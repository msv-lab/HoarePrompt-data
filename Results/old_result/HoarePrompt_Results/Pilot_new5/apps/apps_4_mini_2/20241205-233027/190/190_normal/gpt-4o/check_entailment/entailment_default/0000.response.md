To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's dissect the code and see if it meets all the specified requirements.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We are tasked with adjusting the lengths of sticks such that all sticks are "almost good" for some integer `t`. A stick length `a_i` is "almost good" for `t` if `|a_i - t| ≤ 1`.
- We need to minimize the total cost of changing the lengths, where the cost is defined as `|a - b|` for changing a stick from length `a` to length `b`.
- The program should return both the optimal value of `t` and the minimum cost.

### Code Review:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    min_cost = float('inf')
    best_t = -1
    for t in range(1, 101):
        current_cost = 0
        for length in a:
            if length < t - 1:
                current_cost += t - 1 - length
            elif length > t + 1:
                current_cost += length - (t + 1)
        if current_cost < min_cost:
            min_cost = current_cost
            best_t = t
    print(best_t, min_cost)
```

#### Analysis of the Code:
1. The program iterates through all possible integers `t` from 1 to 100.
2. For each `t`, it calculates the cost of adjusting each stick's length to be within `[t - 1, t + 1]`.
3. If a stick's length is less than `t - 1`, it calculates how much it needs to be increased.
4. If a stick's length is greater than `t + 1`, it calculates how much it needs to be decreased.
5. The program keeps track of the minimum cost encountered and the corresponding `t`.

### Edge Cases:
- **Single Stick (n = 1)**: The stick can either be adjusted up or down to meet the condition for `t`. The code should handle this correctly.
- **All Sticks Already Optimal**: If all sticks are already within the range for some `t`, the cost should be zero.
- **Maximum and Minimum Stick Lengths**: Since `a_i` can vary from 1 to 100, we need to ensure that both extremes are handled correctly, particularly near the boundaries of possible `t` values.

### Output Hints Evaluation:
The output hints agree with the code’s functionality description. The function correctly identifies the minimum cost required to adjust values in `a` for any `t`. 

### Conclusion:
Upon reviewing the code, it adheres to the problem description by iterating through all potential values of `t` and calculating the necessary costs accurately. I cannot identify any edge cases where the program fails to meet the requirements provided in the description.

Thus, I conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
