Output State: **`current_cost` is the total cost calculated based on the lengths in list `a` with respect to `t`, which is equal to 2; `min_cost` is equal to `current_cost`; `best_t` is equal to 2; `length` is the last integer processed from list `a`; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is in the range 1 <= `a_i` <= 100; and the current value of `current_cost` is less than `min_cost.**
