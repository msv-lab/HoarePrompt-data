Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each integer `a_i` is in the range 1 <= `a_i` <= 100; `length` is the next integer in the list `a`. If `length` is less than `t - 1`, then `current_cost` is incremented by `t - 1 - length`. Otherwise, if `length` is greater than `t + 1`, then `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + (length - (t + 1))`. The value of `t` remains unspecified in the output state. The state of the other variables is not affected.***
