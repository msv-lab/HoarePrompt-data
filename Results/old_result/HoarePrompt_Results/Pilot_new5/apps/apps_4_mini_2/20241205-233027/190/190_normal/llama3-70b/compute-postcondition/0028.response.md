The value of `min_cost` is assigned the current value of `cost`. Other variables remain unchanged, but the relationship that `cost` is less than `min_cost` will no longer hold true after this assignment. Therefore, the new value of `min_cost` will be equal to `cost`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `sticks` is a sorted list of integers derived from `a`, `mid` is at least `1`, `min_cost` is equal to `cost`, `min_t` is the value of `t` that yielded `min_cost`, `i` starts at `mid + 1` which is at least `2`, and `cost` is the sum of min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i - 1))) for x in sticks.**
