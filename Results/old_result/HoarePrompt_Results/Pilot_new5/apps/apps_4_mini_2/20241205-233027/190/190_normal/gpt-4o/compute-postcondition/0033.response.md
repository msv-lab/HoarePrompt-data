The code snippet updates the value of `current_cost` by adding `t - 1 - length`. Given that `t` is 2, `t - 1` equals 1. Since the current value of `length` is less than 1 (as stated), we can denote the value of `length` as some integer less than 1, which means `length` can only be 0 because `length` is an integer. 

Thus, the calculation becomes:
```
current_cost += 1 - length
```
Since `length` is 0, the calculation simplifies to:
```
current_cost += 1 - 0
current_cost += 1
```

Now `current_cost` increases by 1, while the remaining variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is in the range 1 <= `a_i` <= 100; `current_cost` is updated to its previous value + 1; `min_cost` is updated to the previous value of `current_cost`; `best_t` is set to 1; `t` is 2; `length` is the first integer in list `a`, and is 0.**
