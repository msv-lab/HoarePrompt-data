To determine the impact of the code `current_cost += length - (t + 1)`, we need to analyze the changes made to the `current_cost` variable, while checking the states of the other relevant variables.

1. **Initial State Review**:
   - `n` is an integer such that `1 <= n <= 1000`.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is in the range `1 <= a_i <= 100`.
   - `min_cost` is positive infinity.
   - `best_t` is -1.
   - `length` is `a[1]` (the second element of the list `a`).

2. **Impact of the Code**:
   - The code updates `current_cost` by adding the value of `length - (t + 1)` to it. 
   - Since `length` is equal to `a[1]`, we can express the update as `current_cost += a[1] - (t + 1)`.

3. **Variables Affected**:
   - The variable `current_cost` is changed.
   - The values of `n`, `a`, `min_cost`, `best_t`, and `length` remain unchanged, although `length` is being used in the calculation.

4. **Final Calculation**:
   - Assuming `t` is defined and has a specific integer value, `current_cost` will be updated accordingly.
   - Since the exact value of `current_cost` and `t` are not provided, we describe the effect on `current_cost` based on its previous value and the calculation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is in the range 1 <= a_i <= 100; `min_cost` is positive infinity; `best_t` is -1; `length` is `a[1]`; `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + (a[1] - (t + 1))`.**
