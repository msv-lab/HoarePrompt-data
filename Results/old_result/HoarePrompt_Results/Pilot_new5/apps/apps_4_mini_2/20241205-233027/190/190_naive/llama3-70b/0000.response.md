To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step-by-step and identify any potential issues that may arise.

1. **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads the integer `n` (the number of sticks) and the list of integers representing the lengths of the sticks.

2. **Sorting the Sticks**: The program sorts the stick lengths to find a central point (median). This is a good approach since it helps in minimizing the total cost to change the lengths.

3. **Initial Median Calculation**: The median stick length is used as an initial `t`. This makes sense since the median minimizes the sum of absolute deviations.

4. **Cost Calculation**: The program calculates the cost of changing all sticks to the initial median value `t`. This part seems correct as it sums up the absolute differences.

5. **Exploration for Minimum Cost**: The program examines stick lengths around the median (specifically from `mid - 1` down to `1` and from `mid + 1` up to `100`). Here, it checks if changing all stick lengths to either `i` or `i + 1` reduces the total cost. 

**Potential Issue**:
- The loop that checks for values below `mid` (`for i in range(mid - 1, 0, -1)`) only considers positive integers down to `1`. However, it doesn't account for the situation where the optimal `t` could be `1` when all sticks are significantly longer (e.g., `10, 15, 20`).
  
- The code does not directly handle the edge case where all stick lengths are the same but significantly larger than `2`. For example, if there are sticks of lengths `10`, the best value of `t` would still be `10`, resulting in a cost of `0`. However, if the program doesn't check for `t` values that might better fit the range, it could miss the optimal solution.

- The logic for calculating the minimum costs for `t` values `i` and `i + 1` might miss some optimal `t` values in between.

**Example Case**:
Consider input:
```
5
10 10 10 10 10
```
In this case:
- The median is `10`, which leads to a cost of `0`.
- If the program explores `t` values lower than `10`, it may calculate costs incorrectly since all sticks are already equal to `10`. 

This could potentially yield incorrect outputs if all sticks are initially equal but the program continues to explore other values instead of recognizing the optimal state.

Given this reasoning, the program does not handle all cases correctly. 

Correctness: **False**.
