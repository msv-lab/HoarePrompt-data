Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is in the range 1 <= `a_i` <= 100. If `current_cost` is less than `min_cost`, then `min_cost` is updated to `current_cost`, `best_t` is set to 1, and `t` remains 1; `current_cost` is the sum of the costs calculated for all elements in `a` based on the given conditions.***
