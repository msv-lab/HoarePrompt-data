Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. Let's break down why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling:** The program reads integer `n`, which represents the number of sticks, and a list `a` of their respective lengths. This aligns with the problem description, which specifies that the lengths are positive integers.

2. **Cost Calculation:** The program intelligently calculates the cost of modifying each stick length to fit within the range `[t - 1, t + 1]` for each potential value of `t` from `1` to `100`. The cost for each stick is calculated based on its distance from the acceptable range, ensuring that it correctly captures the requirement of adjusting the sticks to be "almost good" for the chosen `t`.

3. **Finding Minimum Cost:** The program iterates through each potential `t`, computes the total cost for each `t`, and keeps track of the minimum cost and the corresponding `t`. This matches the problem requirement of finding the value of `t` that minimizes the total adjustment cost.

4. **Output:** Finally, it prints the optimal `t` along with the minimum cost. This aligns with the specified output format in the problem description.

5. **Boundary Conditions:** The program handles the entire specified range of stick lengths (from `1` to `100`) and considers all possible values for `t` within that range. This ensures that it addresses all potential cases as outlined in the description.

Overall, the logical flow and operations performed in the program adhere to the problem requirements, ensuring that it calculates the correct outputs for the given constraints. Hence, the program is deemed correct.
