The impact of the code on the program is that `current_cost` is incremented by the value of `t - 1 - length`. The variable `length` is previously defined as `a[1]`, which is the second element of the list `a`. The other variables retain their values as they were before this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is in the range 1 <= `a_i` <= 100, `min_cost` is set to positive infinity, `best_t` is -1, `length` is `a[1]`, and `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + t - 1 - length`.**
