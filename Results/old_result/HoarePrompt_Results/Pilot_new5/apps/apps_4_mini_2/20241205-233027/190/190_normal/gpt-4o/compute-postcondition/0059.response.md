Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is in the range 1 <= `a_i` <= 100, `current_cost` is 0, `min_cost` remains unchanged, `best_t` remains unchanged, `length` is the first integer in list `a`, `t` is 2, and the value of `length` is greater than or equal to 1.***
