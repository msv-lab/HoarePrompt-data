The value of `a` is assigned the result of `list(map(int, input().split()))`, which means that `a` will now be a list of integers converted from the input. The variable `n` remains unchanged, as it still represents the number of integers in the list `a`. The constraint on `a_i` remains valid, as each integer in `a` is expected to be in the range from 1 to 100. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer `a_i` is in the range 1 <= `a_i` <= 100, and `a` is now the list of integers from input.**
