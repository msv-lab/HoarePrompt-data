The value of `length` is derived from the third integer in the list `a`. The variable `current_cost` is updated by adding `t - 1 - length` to its previous value. Given that `t` is equal to 2, the expression simplifies to `2 - 1 - length`, which is `1 - length`. The value of `current_cost` will be updated accordingly, but the previous value of `current_cost` is not specified.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 1000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is in the range 1 <= `a_i` <= 100, length is the third integer in the list `a`, `t` is equal to 2, and current_cost is updated by adding `1 - length`.**
