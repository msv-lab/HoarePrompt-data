Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is in the range 1 <= `a_i` <= 100; `min_cost` is the minimum cost calculated based on all `a_i` elements compared to `t`; `best_t` is the value of `t` that yields `min_cost` (which is -1 if no update was made), `t` is still 1, and `current_cost` is the sum of the costs calculated for all elements in `a` based on the given conditions.**
