The value of `current_cost` is set to 0. The states of the other variables remain unchanged, as `min_cost`, `best_t`, `length`, and `t` are not affected by this assignment. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is in the range 1 <= `a_i` <= 100; `current_cost` is 0; `min_cost` remains unchanged; `best_t` remains unchanged; `length` is the last integer processed from list `a`; `t` is 2**
