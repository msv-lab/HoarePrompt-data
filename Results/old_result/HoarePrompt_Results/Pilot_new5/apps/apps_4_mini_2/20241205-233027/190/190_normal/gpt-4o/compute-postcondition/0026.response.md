The value of `min_cost` is assigned the value of `current_cost`. Since it is stated that `current_cost` is less than `min_cost`, this means that the previous value of `min_cost` will be overwritten by the value of `current_cost`. The other variables retain their previous states as they are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is in the range 1 <= `a_i` <= 100; `min_cost` is equal to `current_cost`; `best_t` is the value of `t` that yields `min_cost` (which is -1 if no update was made); `t` is still 1; the current value of `current_cost` is the sum of the costs calculated for all elements in `a` based on the given conditions, and the current cost is less than the minimum cost `min_cost`.**
