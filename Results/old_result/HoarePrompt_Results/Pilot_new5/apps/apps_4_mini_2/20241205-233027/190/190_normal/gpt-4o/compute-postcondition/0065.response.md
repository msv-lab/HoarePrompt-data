The code updates the variable `current_cost` by adding the result of the expression `t - 1 - length`. The variable `t` is equal to 2, so we can substitute that into the expression. The variable `length` is the second integer in the list `a`. We don't have a specific value for `length`, but we know that it is an integer in the range 1 to 100 based on the values of the elements in `a`. 

The expression simplifies as follows:
- `t - 1` equals `2 - 1`, which is `1`.
- Therefore, `current_cost` is updated by adding `1 - length`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 1000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is in the range 1 <= `a_i` <= 100, `length` is the second integer in the list `a`, `t` is equal to 2, `current_cost` is updated by adding `1 - length` to its previous value.**
