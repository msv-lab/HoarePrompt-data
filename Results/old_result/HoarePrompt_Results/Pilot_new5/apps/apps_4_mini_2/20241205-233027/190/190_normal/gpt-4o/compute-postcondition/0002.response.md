The variable `min_cost` is assigned the value of `float('inf')`, which represents positive infinity in Python. This assignment does not affect the values of `n` or `a`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer `a_i` is in the range 1 <= `a_i` <= 100; `min_cost` is set to positive infinity.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer `a_i` is in the range 1 <= `a_i` <= 100; `min_cost` is set to positive infinity.**
