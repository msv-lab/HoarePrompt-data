Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is in the range 1 <= `a_i` <= 100; if the first integer in list `a` (i.e., `length`) is less than 1, `current_cost` is updated to its previous value + 1, `min_cost` is updated to the previous value of `current_cost`, `best_t` is set to 1, `t` is 2, and `length` is 0. Otherwise, if `length` is greater than or equal to 1, `current_cost` is greater than or equal to 1, `min_cost` is 0, `best_t` is 1, and `length` remains the first integer in list `a`, with a special case where if `length` is greater than 3, then `current_cost` stays greater than or equal to 1, `min_cost` remains 0, `best_t` is still 1, and `length` is greater than 3.***
