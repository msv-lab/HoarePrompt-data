In this case, `x` is assigned the minimum value among `n`, `a`, and `b`. Given that `n` is an integer between 2 and `a + b`, and both `a` and `b` are between 1 and 100, the value of `x` will depend on the specific values of `n`, `a`, and `b`. 

- If `n` is less than both `a` and `b`, then `x` will be equal to `n`.
- If `n` is greater than `a` but less than or equal to `b`, then `x` will be equal to `a`.
- If `n` is greater than `b` but less than or equal to `a`, then `x` will be equal to `b`.
- If `n` is greater than both `a` and `b`, then `x` will be equal to the lesser of `a` and `b`.

The conditions specify that `n` is at least 2 and at most `a + b`, while `a` and `b` are at least 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer corresponding to user input such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`, `a` is an integer corresponding to user input such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 100, `b` is an integer corresponding to user input such that 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 100; `x` is the minimum of `n`, `a`, and `b`.**
