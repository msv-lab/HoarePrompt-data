The function accepts three integer parameters: `n`, `a`, and `b`, where `n` is constrained such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a + b`, `a` represents the number of pieces of the first cake, and `b` represents the number of pieces of the second cake (both between 1 and 100). The function performs a binary search to determine the maximum number of pieces that can be distributed equally based on the conditions defined in the `can_distribute` function. It returns `low - 1`, which represents the largest number that can be distributed from the pieces of both cakes, ensuring the result is at most `min(a, b)`.
