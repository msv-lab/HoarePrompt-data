Output State: **`low` is equal to `high`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a + b`, `a` is an integer representing the number of pieces of the first cake (1 ≤ `a` ≤ 100), `b` is an integer representing the number of pieces of the second cake (1 ≤ `b` ≤ 100), `mid` is not valid because the loop has terminated, and the final value of `high` is equal to `min(a, b) + 1` or less, based on the last evaluation of `can_distribute(mid)`. If `can_distribute(mid)` was true for the final iteration, `low` would be `min(a, b) + 2`, otherwise, it will be equal to the last value of `high`.**
