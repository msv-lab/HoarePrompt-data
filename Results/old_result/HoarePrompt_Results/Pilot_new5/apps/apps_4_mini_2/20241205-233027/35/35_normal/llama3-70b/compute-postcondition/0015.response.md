To analyze the output state after the while loop completes its execution, we start with the conditions given:

- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\)
- `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 100\)
- `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 100\)
- `x` is the minimum of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

The loop continues to decrement `x` until the conditions within the loop are satisfied, specifically:

1. \(a \geq x\)
2. \(b \geq x\)
3. \(a - x + (b - x) \geq x\) which simplifies to \(a + b - 2x \geq 0\) or \(a + b \geq 2x\)

We need to find the state of the variables once the loop terminates.

1. The loop will break when the conditions required are satisfied, which means after some decrements of \(x\), these conditions will hold.
2. The final value of \(x\) is the largest integer for which the conditions are still false; therefore, after the final decrement, the next value of \(x\) must satisfy the condition leading to the termination of the loop.

After all iterations are complete:
- The output state for `x` will be the largest integer that still meets the conditions, where at least one of the conditions holds true.
- The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial values since they are not modified in the loop.

Thus, the output state after the loop executes will be:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`, `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 100, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 100; `x` is the largest integer such that `x` was decremented to satisfy at least one of the conditions: `a >= x`, `b >= x`, or `a + b >= 2x`.**
