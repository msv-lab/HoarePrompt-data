The value of `high` is assigned the value of `mid`. The value of `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`, so now `high` will be equal to this calculated value. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`, `low` is less than `high`, `high` is now equal to `mid`, and `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`, `low` is less than `high`, `high` is now equal to `(low + high) // 2`, and `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`.**
