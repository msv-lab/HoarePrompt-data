The variable `low` is assigned the value of `mid + 1`. Since `mid` is equal to `(min(a, b) + 2) // 2`, the new value of `low` will be `((min(a, b) + 2) // 2) + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b, `a` is an integer representing the number of pieces of the first cake (1 ≤ a ≤ 100), `b` is an integer representing the number of pieces of the second cake (1 ≤ b ≤ 100), `low` is equal to `((min(a, b) + 2) // 2) + 1`, `high` is equal to `min(a, b) + 1`, `mid` is equal to `(min(a, b) + 2) // 2`, and the function `can_distribute(mid)` returns true.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b, `a` is an integer representing the number of pieces of the first cake (1 ≤ a ≤ 100), `b` is an integer representing the number of pieces of the second cake (1 ≤ b ≤ 100), `low` is equal to `((min(a, b) + 2) // 2) + 1`, `high` is equal to `min(a, b) + 1`, `mid` is equal to `(min(a, b) + 2) // 2`, and the function `can_distribute(mid)` returns true.**
