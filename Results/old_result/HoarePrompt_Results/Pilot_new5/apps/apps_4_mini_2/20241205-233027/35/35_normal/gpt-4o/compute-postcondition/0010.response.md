The variable `low` is assigned the value of `mid + 1`. The value of `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, which means that `mid` is the average of `low` and `high` when divided by 2. Consequently, `low` will now be greater than the previous value of `mid`. However, without specific values for `low`, `high`, and `mid`, we cannot determine exact numerical values, but we know that the relationship holds.

The conditions remain unchanged: `n` is still an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ a + b`, `low` must still be less than `high`, and `mid` was previously calculated based on the old values of `low` and `high`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`, `low` must be less than `high`, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, and `low` is now `mid + 1`.**
