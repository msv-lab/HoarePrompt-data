The function accepts three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`, where `n` must be between 2 and the sum of `a` and `b`, while `a` and `b` are between 1 and 100. It calculates the largest integer `x` such that `x` is less than or equal to `n`, `a`, and `b`, and ensures that the remaining amounts from `a` and `b` after taking `x` are also at least `x`. The result `x` is printed as the output. There is no return value from the function.
