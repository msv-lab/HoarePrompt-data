The variable `low` is assigned the value of `mid + 1`. Since `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, the value of `low` will increase by 1. The value of `high` remains unchanged, and `mid` will no longer be valid after this operation since `low` has changed. The states of `n`, `high`, and the relationship between `low` and `high` remain valid.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`, `low` is now equal to `(low + high) // 2 + 1`, `high` is unchanged, and `mid` is no longer valid.**
