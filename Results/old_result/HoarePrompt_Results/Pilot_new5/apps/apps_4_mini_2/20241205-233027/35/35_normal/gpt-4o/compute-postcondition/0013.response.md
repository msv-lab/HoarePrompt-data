According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `low` and `high`. The loop can continue executing as long as `low` is less than `high`. At the end of the last iteration, it is given that `low` is less than `high`, which means the loop can execute again. 

No adjustments are needed for `low` or `high` because they already satisfy the loop condition. Other states do not need to be altered as they do not affect the continuation of the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`, `low` is less than `high`, and `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`**.
