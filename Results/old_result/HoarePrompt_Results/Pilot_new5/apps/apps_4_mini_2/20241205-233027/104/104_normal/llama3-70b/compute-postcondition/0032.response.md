According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop will run as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `j` is 3. 

Since the loop starts with `j` initialized to `i + 1` (which is 3) and goes up to `n + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be increased by 1. Therefore, `j` will become 4.

Also, for the loop to continue executing, `n` must be at least 4, because the condition for the loop is that `j` should be less than or equal to `n`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer between 4 and 100, `i` is 2, `j` is 4**
