The code calculates the maximum value between `max_erase` and `j - i - 1`. The value of `j` is 4 and `i` is 2, so `j - i - 1` equals 1. As `max_erase` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its value. However, it is implied that `max_erase` could be some integer value that is being updated based on the calculated value.

The output state will include the comparison and update of `max_erase` while retaining the values of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 4 and 100, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `max_erase` is updated to max(`max_erase`, 1)**
