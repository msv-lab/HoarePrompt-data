Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `j` is equal to `n + 1`, `max_erase` is the maximum number of elements that can be erased from the list `a` starting from index `i`. The elements of the list `a` from index `i` to `j - 1` form a consecutive sequence such that for each `k` in the range from `i` to `j`, the value of `a[k]` minus `a[i]` is equal to `k - i`.***
