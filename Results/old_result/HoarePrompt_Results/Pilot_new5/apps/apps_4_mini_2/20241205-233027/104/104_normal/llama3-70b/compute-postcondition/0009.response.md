The statement `max_erase = max(max_erase, j - i - 1)` assigns the value of `max(max_erase, j - i - 1)` to `max_erase`. 

1. The variable `max_erase` can either be `0` or `j - 1`.
2. The expression `j - i - 1` calculates the difference between `j`, `i`, and 1. Given that `i` is `0`, this simplifies to `j - 1`.
3. Since `j` is in the range from `1` to `n` and must also be in the range from `2` to `n + 1`, this means that `j - 1` will be in the range from `0` to `n - 1`.

Now let's analyze the conditions for `max_erase`:
- If `max_erase` was `0`, then `max(max_erase, j - i - 1)` will result in `j - 1` (which will be at least `0` and at most `n - 1`).
- If `max_erase` was `j - 1`, then `max(max_erase, j - i - 1)` will remain `j - 1` since `j - 1` is equal to `j - 1`.

So, after executing the code, `max_erase` will take the larger value between its previous state and `j - 1`. 

Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `max_erase`, while all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `max_erase` is either max(max_erase, j - 1), and `j` is in the range from 1 to `n`, and `j` must be in the range from 2 to `n + 1`.**
