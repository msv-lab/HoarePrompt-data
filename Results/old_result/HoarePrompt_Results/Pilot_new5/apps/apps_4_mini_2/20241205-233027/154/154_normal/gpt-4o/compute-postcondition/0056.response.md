The variable `time_used` is assigned the value of `complete_tasks` multiplied by `total_time_per_task`. Given that `complete_tasks` is equal to `n`, the expression becomes `time_used = n * total_time_per_task`. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `complete_tasks` is equal to `n`, `remaining_time` is updated based on the total time spent on subtasks, `subtasks_solved` is 0, `max_points` is the maximum of `max_points_current` and `points`, `time_used` is equal to `n * total_time_per_task`.
