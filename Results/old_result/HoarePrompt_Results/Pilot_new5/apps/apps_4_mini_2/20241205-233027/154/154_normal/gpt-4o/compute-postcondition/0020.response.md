Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `complete_tasks` is 0, `time_used` is 0, `points` is 0. If `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`, then `remaining_time` is updated to `remaining_time - (M // subtask_time) * subtask_time`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` becomes `M // subtask_time`, and `subtasks_solved` is increased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`.***
