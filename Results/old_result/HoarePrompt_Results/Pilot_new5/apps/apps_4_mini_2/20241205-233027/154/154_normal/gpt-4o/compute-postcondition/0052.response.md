Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `complete_tasks` is equal to `n`, `remaining_time` is updated based on the total time spent on subtasks, `subtasks_solved` is the total number of subtasks that could be solved given the available time, `max_points` is the maximum of `max_points_current` and `points + subtasks_solved`, and `t` may have any number of remaining elements, including none, depending on prior iterations. If the loop does not execute, `remaining_time` remains unchanged, `subtasks_solved` remains 0, and `max_points` remains equal to `max_points_current`.**
