Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `complete_tasks` is 0, `time_used` is 0, `points` is 0, `remaining_time` is equal to `M - time_used`, `subtasks_solved` is equal to `0 + max_subtasks_for_this_task`, where `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is equal to `remaining_time // subtask_time`, and `remaining_time` is updated to `remaining_time % subtask_time` if there is enough time to complete the subtask based on `subtask_time`.***
