The variable `subtasks_solved` is assigned the minimum value between its current value and `(n - complete_tasks) * k`. Since `complete_tasks` is equal to `n`, the expression `(n - complete_tasks)` evaluates to `0`. Therefore, `subtasks_solved` will be assigned the minimum of its current value and `0`. 

If `subtasks_solved` is initially greater than 0, it will be set to 0. If it is already 0, it will remain 0. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Thus, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `complete_tasks` is equal to `n`, `subtasks_solved` is 0, `max_points` is the maximum of `max_points_current` and `points`, `time_used` is equal to `n * total_time_per_task`, and `points` is equal to `n * (k + 1)`**.
