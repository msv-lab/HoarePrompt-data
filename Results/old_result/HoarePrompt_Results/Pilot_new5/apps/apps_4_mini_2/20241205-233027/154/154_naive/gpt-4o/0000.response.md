To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, I'll analyze the code and see if it meets all specified requirements.

The problem involves solving a certain number of tasks, each with several subtasks, within a limited time. The program should compute the maximum points Polycarp can earn based on the number of complete tasks he can solve and additional subtasks he can complete with the remaining time.

Key parts of the problem:
1. For each complete task solved, Polycarp earns `k + 1` points.
2. He can earn 1 point for each subtask solved.
3. The goal is to maximize the total points earned within the given time `M`.

### Analysis of the Code
1. The input is read and parsed correctly.
2. The function `func_1` calculates the total time required to complete a task and iterates over the number of complete tasks Polycarp can solve.
3. For each complete task, it checks how much time is used and ensures it does not exceed `M`.
4. It calculates the remaining time and attempts to solve as many subtasks as possible with the remaining time.
5. The points are calculated and updated correctly.

### Potential Edge Cases
1. **When `M` is 0**: If Polycarp has no time to solve any tasks, the expected output should be `0`. The code should handle this situation correctly.
2. **When all subtasks take more time than `M`**: If each subtask takes longer than the available time `M`, the program should also correctly return `0`.
3. **When `n = 1`, `k = 1`, and `M` equals the time of the single subtask**: The program should correctly award points for completing the task.
4. **When `M` is just enough to complete one task, and then just enough time for additional subtasks from the remaining tasks.**

However, upon reviewing the iteration over `remaining_time`, there is a flaw:
- In the inner loop, the program does not account for the fact that Polycarp can solve subtasks from different tasks with the same available time. The subtasks solved should not be limited to one task's subtasks alone. The logic currently will not accumulate the total work done correctly when `remaining_time` is spread over multiple tasks.

### Conclusion
There is a situation where the program may incorrectly compute the maximum points possible due to how it handles subtasks across multiple tasks.

Correctness: **False**. 

**Example of failure:** If Polycarp has `n = 5`, `k = 5`, `M = 10`, and the task times are `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16]`, he can complete the first subtask of all five tasks (5 points) but might not recognize that he can also solve the second subtask of two tasks as well (adding 2 more points). The current logic does not allow for this optimal distribution of subtasks.
