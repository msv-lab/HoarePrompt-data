The assignment `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]` means that the value at `dp[i][j]` is set to the value currently present at `dp[i][j - 1]`. The specific values of `n`, `k`, `M`, `t`, and the values in `dp` are not changed by this operation, except for the entry `dp[i][j]`.

Since `i` is currently 1 and `j` is also 1, the assignment takes the value from `dp[1][0]` (since j - 1 = 0) and assigns it to `dp[1][1]`. 

Now, the output state reflects that `dp[1][1]` is now equal to `dp[1][0]`, while all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45), `M` is at least 1, `t` is a sorted list of integers of length `k`, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `dp[1][1]` is equal to `dp[1][0]`.**
