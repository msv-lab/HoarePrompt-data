The function accepts three parameters: an integer `n` (number of tasks), an integer `k` (number of subtasks per task), and a non-negative integer `M` (total minutes available), along with a list `t` of length `k` representing the time required for each subtask. It computes the maximum number of subtasks that can be completed within the available minutes `M`, considering the time constraints for each subtask, and returns the total count of completed subtasks along with a count of how many of the original subtasks can be completed completely within `M`.
