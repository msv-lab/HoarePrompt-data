The code assigns the value of `dp[i][j - 1]` to `dp[i][j]`. Given that `i` is 1 and `j` is 3, this means `dp[1][3]` takes the value of `dp[1][2]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45), `M` is at least 3, `t` is a sorted list of integers of length `k`, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, and `dp[1][3]` is equal to `dp[1][2]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45), `M` is at least 3, `t` is a sorted list of integers of length `k`, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, and `dp[1][3]` is equal to `dp[1][2]`.**
