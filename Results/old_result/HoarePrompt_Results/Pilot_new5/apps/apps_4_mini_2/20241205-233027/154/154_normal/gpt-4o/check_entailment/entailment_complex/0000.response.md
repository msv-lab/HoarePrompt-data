Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case when `M` is zero correctly. According to the problem description, if `M` is zero, Polycarp cannot solve any subtasks or complete any tasks, which means the maximum points he can earn should be zero. However, the given implementation does not explicitly check for this scenario, which could lead to an incorrect result. 

For instance, if `n = 1`, `k = 1`, and `M = 0`, the program would still enter the loop for `complete_tasks = 0`, and it would attempt to solve subtasks using the remaining time (`remaining_time` would be `0`). However, since all subtask times are greater than `0`, it would not accumulate any points, and the return value would still depend on the calculations within the loop rather than immediately returning `0` for `M = 0`.

Additionally, the program assumes that it can always utilize the remaining time effectively after completing tasks, but it does not account for scenarios where `M` is insufficient to even solve a single subtask. The handling of edge cases, particularly when `M` is zero or when the total time required for even a single subtask exceeds `M`, is not appropriately addressed.

Thus, the program fails to fulfill the problem requirements for all potential input cases.
