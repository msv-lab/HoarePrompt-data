Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `complete_tasks` is equal to `n`, `remaining_time` is still dependent on its previous calculation minus `max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time`, `subtasks_solved` is equal to its previous value plus `max_subtasks_for_this_task`, `max_points` is the maximum of `max_points_current` and `points`, `time_used` is equal to `n * total_time_per_task`, `points` is equal to `n * (k + 1)`, `subtask_time` is the next element in `t` at index `i + 1`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is equal to `remaining_time // subtask_time`.**
