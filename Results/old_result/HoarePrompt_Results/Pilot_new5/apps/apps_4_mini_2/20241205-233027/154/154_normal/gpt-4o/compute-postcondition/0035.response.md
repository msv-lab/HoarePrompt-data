The variable `subtasks_solved` is assigned the value `0`. The previous value of `subtasks_solved` is determined by the expression `min(previous_value, (n - complete_tasks) * k)`, but since the updated value is explicitly set to `0`, the previous value of `subtasks_solved` is irrelevant for the output.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged, including `n`, `complete_tasks`, `points`, `remaining_time`, `max_points`, and the information that indicates we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45); `complete_tasks` remains `n`; `points` is equal to `n * (k + 1)`; `remaining_time` is M - time_used; `subtasks_solved` is 0; `max_points` is max(max_points_current, points + subtasks_solved); and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
