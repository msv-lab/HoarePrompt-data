To assess the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description and output hints, we need to analyze both the code and possible edge cases.

### Problem Description:
Polycarp has `n` tasks with `k` subtasks each, and he has `M` minutes to solve them. Each subtask `j` takes `t[j]` minutes. He earns points for each completed subtask and an additional point for completing all subtasks of a task. The goal is to maximize the points earned within the time limit `M`.

### Code Overview:
1. The code reads the input values and initializes variables to track the maximum points.
2. It calculates the total time required to complete each task.
3. It iterates through the possible number of completely finished tasks (`complete_tasks`).
4. For each completed task, it calculates the time used and remaining time.
5. It then attempts to solve as many subtasks as possible with the remaining time.
6. Finally, it checks if it can achieve a higher point total than previously calculated.

### Output Hints:
The output hints indicate that the function calculates the maximum points by completing full tasks and utilizing remaining time for subtasks, but it does not handle the case where `M` is zero. If `M` is zero, Polycarp cannot complete any tasks or subtasks, leading to a maximum point total of zero, which the code does not address.

### Edge Case Analysis:
1. **When `M` is zero**: The code does not account for this situation. It will still attempt to iterate through `complete_tasks` and could mistakenly return a positive score, which would be incorrect because no points can be earned if there's no time available.
2. **Boundary Cases**: The situation where `n`, `k`, or `M` is at its minimum or maximum limits (e.g., `n=1`, `k=1`, `M=0` or `M=2*10^9`). The algorithm should still correctly compute the points even in these extremes.

### Conclusion:
The output hints suggest the function could yield an incorrect result when `M` is zero, as it does not handle this edge case. The function does not ensure that the calculated points cannot exceed zero when no time is available. 

Thus, considering the output hints and the analysis of potential edge cases, we conclude that the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
