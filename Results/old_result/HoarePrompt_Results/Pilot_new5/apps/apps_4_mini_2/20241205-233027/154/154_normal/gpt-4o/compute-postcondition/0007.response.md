The variable `points` is assigned the value of `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`. The value of `complete_tasks` is 0, so regardless of the value of `k`, `points` will be 0. The values of `n`, `complete_tasks`, and `time_used` remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `complete_tasks` is 0, `time_used` is 0, `points` is 0.**
