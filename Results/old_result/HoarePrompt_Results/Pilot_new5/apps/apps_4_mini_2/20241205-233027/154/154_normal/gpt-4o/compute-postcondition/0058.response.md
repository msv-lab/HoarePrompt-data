Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45) with `complete_tasks` equal to `n`, `remaining_time` updated based on the total time spent on subtasks, `subtasks_solved` is 0, `max_points` is the maximum of `max_points_current` and `points`, and `time_used` is equal to `n * total_time_per_task`. If `time_used` exceeds `M`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
