Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `complete_tasks` is equal to `n`. If `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`, then `remaining_time` is decreased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time`, where `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is equal to `remaining_time // subtask_time`. Additionally, `subtasks_solved` is increased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`, `max_points` is the maximum of `max_points_current` and `points`, `time_used` is equal to `n * total_time_per_task`, and `points` is equal to `n * (k + 1)`. The value of `subtask_time` is the next element in `t` at index `i + 1`.***
