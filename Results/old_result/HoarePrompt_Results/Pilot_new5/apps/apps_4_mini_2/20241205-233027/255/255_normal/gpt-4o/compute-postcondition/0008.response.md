The value of `operations` is incremented by 1. Since the initial value of `operations` is 2, it becomes 3 after the increment. The other variables (`n`, `s`, `i`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is a string of length `n`, `operations` is 3, `i` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is a string of length `n`, `operations` is 3, `i` is 2**
