The code snippet provided is a `print` statement that outputs the value of `operations`. Since it does not change the state of any variables, we will retain all the precondition information while only noting the output of the `operations` variable.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 500; `s` is a string of length `n`; `operations` is the count of transitions between different characters in the string `s`; `i` is equal to `n - 1; operations` is printed.**
