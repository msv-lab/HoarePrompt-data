The value of `operations` is incremented by 1. The variable `operations` previously held the value of 1, so after execution, its new value will be 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is a string of length `n`, `operations` is 2, `i` is 1, and the current value of `s[i]` is not equal to the current value of `s[i - 1]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is a string of length `n`, `operations` is 2, `i` is 1, and the current value of `s[i]` is not equal to the current value of `s[i - 1]`.**
