Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to delete the entire string as described in the problem. The logic used in the program counts the number of different contiguous groups of characters in the string, but this does not reflect the actual minimum number of operations needed to delete the string. 

For example, consider the input:
```
5
aaaaa
```
The expected output should be `1` because the entire string can be removed in one operation. However, the program would output `1` which is correct in this case, but it fails to handle cases where the characters can be grouped for fewer operations.

Take another example:
```
8
abcddcba
```
The expected output is `4` (you can delete 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'dd' in separate operations), but the program counts the number of changes between characters and outputs `7`, which is incorrect.

Thus, the program does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem for all possible cases. The cases where contiguous characters can be removed together as one operation are not being considered in the program's logic, leading to incorrect outputs for various inputs.
