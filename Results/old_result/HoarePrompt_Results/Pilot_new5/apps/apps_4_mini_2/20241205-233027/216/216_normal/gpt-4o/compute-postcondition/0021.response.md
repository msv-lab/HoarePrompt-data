The `current_set.clear()` method is called, which empties the `current_set`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state of the variables is:

- `current_set` is now empty.

The other variables maintain their previous values, which are:

- `n` is an integer in the range 1 to 200.
- `s` is a non-empty string.
- `char` is the second character in `s`.
- `current_count` is 1 if `char` is a lowercase letter and was not previously in `current_set`, otherwise it remains unchanged.
- `max_count` is updated to the maximum of the previous `max_count` and `current_count`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range 1 to 200; `s` is a non-empty string; `char` is the second character in `s`; `current_set` is empty; `current_count` is 1 if `char` is a lowercase letter and was not previously in `current_set`, otherwise it remains unchanged; `max_count` is the maximum of the previous `max_count` and `current_count`.**
