Postcondition: ***`d` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1; `i` is 0; `sofas` is a list that has at least 1 element; `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are assigned values from `sofas` at index 0; `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned values from `sofas` at index `j`. The current value of `x1` is greater than `x2_j` and the current value of `x2` is greater than `x2_j`. `right_count[i]` has been increased by 1.***
