According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `d`. If `d` is greater than 1, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `d` must be greater than 1, so after one more iteration, `d` will be reduced by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `d` must be at least 2. 

State: **`d` must be greater than 2, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `sofas` is a list containing the previous tuples plus the new tuple `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`**
