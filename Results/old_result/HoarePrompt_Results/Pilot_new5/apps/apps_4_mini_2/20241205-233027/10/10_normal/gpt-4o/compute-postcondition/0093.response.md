According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` in relation to `d`. Since the loop runs for `j` in the range of `d`, for it to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `d`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and since `d` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is currently 1 (the second iteration of the loop). Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `j` will be 2, and we need to ensure that `d` is at least 3 so that the loop can still execute.

State: **`d` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 1, `sofas` is a list with at least `d` elements, `j` is 2**
