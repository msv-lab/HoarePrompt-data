To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze the main parts of the logic against the problem description and identify potential edge cases.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input Structure**:
    - The first line contains the number of sofas `d`.
    - The second line contains the dimensions of the matrix `n` and `m`.
    - The next `d` lines give the coordinates of the sofas.
    - The last line specifies the counts of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of Grandpa Maks's sofa.

2. **Logic Requirements**:
    - For each sofa, the program must count how many other sofas are to the left, right, top, and bottom.
    - It must then check if the counts match the provided conditions `(cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b)`.
    - If a matching sofa is found, it should return its index (1-based); if none match, it should return `-1`.

### Program Logic:
- The program reads the number of sofas and their coordinates.
- It defines a function `func_1` that counts how many sofas are left, right, top, and bottom of a given sofa.
- It then compares the result of `func_1` with the expected counts and prints the index of the matching sofa or `-1` if no match is found.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Coordinate Comparison**:
    - The counting logic in `func_1` currently only checks for horizontal alignment (same `y` value) for left and right and vertical alignment (same `x` value) for top and bottom. This is incorrect because sofas can be considered in relation to each other based solely on their positions rather than requiring strict alignment in either dimension.
    - For example, consider two sofas at (2, 1) and (2, 2). The program wouldn't count one as being above or below the other when they are actually vertically adjacent, which contradicts the problem statement.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**:
    - If there are sofas that are vertically or horizontally adjacent but have different coordinates (not strictly aligned), the function doesn't count them appropriately.
    - For instance, with sofas at (1, 1)-(1, 2) and (2, 1)-(2, 2), asking for a sofa with `cnt_{t} = 1` would fail because the function would not identify correct conditions.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis above, the program is incorrect. It fails to count sofas correctly when they are positioned adjacent but not aligned directly vertically or horizontally as required by the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
