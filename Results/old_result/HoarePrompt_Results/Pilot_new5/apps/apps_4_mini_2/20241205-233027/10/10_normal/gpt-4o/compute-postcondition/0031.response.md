Postcondition: ***`d` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1; `i` is 0; `sofas` is a list that has at least 1 element; `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are assigned values from `sofas` at index 0; `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned values from `sofas` at index `j`; if `x1` is greater than `x2_j` and `x2` is greater than `x2_j`, then `right_count[i]` is increased by 1 and `left_count[i]` is increased by 1; otherwise, `right_count[i]` and `left_count[i]` remain unchanged. The current values of `y1` and `y2` are both less than `y1_j`.***
