The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables but instead causes the program to skip the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop and move to the next iteration. Therefore, the states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`d` is greater than 4, `i` is 2, `sofas` is a list with at least `d` elements, `j` is 4 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
