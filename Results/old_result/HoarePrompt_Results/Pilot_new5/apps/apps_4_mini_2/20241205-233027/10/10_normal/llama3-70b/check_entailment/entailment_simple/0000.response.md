To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze whether the program meets all the requirements specified.

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of sofas (`d`), the dimensions of the storehouse (`n`, `m`), the coordinates of each sofa, and the counts of sofas relative to Grandpa Maks' sofa. This matches the input structure defined in the problem.

2. **Data Structure**: The program stores the coordinates of the sofas in a list called `sofas`, where each sofa's coordinates are represented as tuples. This is consistent with the problem description.

3. **Logic to Find Counts**: The `func_1` function counts the number of sofas relative to the current sofa (left, right, top, bottom). It checks for each sofa by comparing their coordinates to determine the relative position:
   - **Left**: Checks if `sofa` is to the left of `s` on the same row.
   - **Right**: Checks if `sofa` is to the right of `s` on the same row.
   - **Top**: Checks if `sofa` is above `s` on the same column.
   - **Bottom**: Checks if `sofa` is below `s` on the same column.

   However, there is a flaw in the logic. The checks for left and right (as well as top and bottom) only compare the first coordinate of the `sofa` with the first coordinate of `s`, which can lead to incorrect counts because it does not take into account both cells that make up each sofa.

   For example, consider a sofa represented by coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). The program only checks one of these pairs of coordinates against the others, which does not accurately reflect the position of the sofa in relation to others in all cases. 

4. **Output Generation**: The program outputs the index of the sofa that meets the specified conditions or -1 if no such sofa exists. This part follows the description.

A specific case that demonstrates this issue: if two sofas have the same y-coordinates but different x-coordinates, the program may not correctly determine the left/right relations if it only considers one of the sofa's coordinates, leading to inaccurate counts.

Thus, the program fails to correctly account for all the conditions necessary to determine the correct sofa.

Based on this analysis, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
