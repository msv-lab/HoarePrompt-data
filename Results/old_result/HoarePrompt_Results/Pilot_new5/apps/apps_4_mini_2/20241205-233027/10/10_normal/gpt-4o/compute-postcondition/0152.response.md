According to the code, the loop iterates over the range of `d`, which is a positive integer. This means that `d` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute. The variable `i` will start from 0 and go up to `d-1` for each iteration. 

Since `d` is already specified as a positive integer, it guarantees that the loop will execute at least once. At the start of the loop, the variable `i` should be initialized to 0, which is its starting value for the first iteration.

State: **`d` is a positive integer, `i` is 0**
