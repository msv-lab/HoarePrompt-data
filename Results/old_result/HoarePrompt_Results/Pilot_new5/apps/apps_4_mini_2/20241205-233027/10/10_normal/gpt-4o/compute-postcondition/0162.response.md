The variable `target_sofa` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The initial value of `i` is 2, so `target_sofa` becomes 2 + 1 = 3. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`d` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `left_count[i]` is equal to `cnt_l`, `right_count[i]` is equal to `cnt_r`, `top_count[i]` is equal to `cnt_t`, `bottom_count[i]` is equal to `cnt_b`, `target_sofa` is 3**.
