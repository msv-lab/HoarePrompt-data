Output State: **`sofas` is a list of tuples containing up to `d` tuples; `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom` are non-negative integers representing the counts based on the conditions defined in the loop; `left` is the count of sofas to the left of `sofa` on the same row, `right` is the count of sofas to the right of `sofa` on the same row, `top` is the count of sofas above `sofa` on the same column, and `bottom` is the count of sofas below `sofa` on the same column. If `sofas` contains no tuples, then `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom` will all be 0.**
