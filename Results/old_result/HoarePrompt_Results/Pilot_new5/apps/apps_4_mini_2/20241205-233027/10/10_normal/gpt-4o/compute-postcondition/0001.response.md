The values of `n` and `m` are assigned based on the input provided by the user, where the input consists of two integers separated by a space. The state of `d`, the coordinates of the sofas, and the counts of sofas on each side remain unaffected. The new values for `n` and `m` depend on the user input. Thus, the output state will include the updated values for `n` and `m` while retaining the other variables as they are.

Output State: **`d` is an input positive integer, `n` is an input positive integer, `m` is an input positive integer representing the dimensions of the storehouse, each of the next `d` lines contains four integers (x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2) representing the coordinates of the i-th sofa, and the last line contains four integers (cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b) representing the counts of sofas on the left, right, top, and bottom respectively.**
