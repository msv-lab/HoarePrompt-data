The code `bottom_count[i] += 1` increments the value at index `i` of the `bottom_count` list by 1. The variable `i` is equal to 1 at this point, so the value at `bottom_count[1]` is increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 1, `sofas` is a list with at least `d` elements, `bottom_count[1]` is increased by 1.**
