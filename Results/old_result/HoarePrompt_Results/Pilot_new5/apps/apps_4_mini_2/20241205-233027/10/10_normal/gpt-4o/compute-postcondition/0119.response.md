Postcondition: ***`d` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `sofas` is a list with at least `d` elements. If `x1` is greater than `x2_j` and `x2` is also greater than `x2_j`, then `right_count[i]` and `left_count[i]` are both incremented by 1. The current values of `y1` and `y2` are both less than `y1_j`. If the condition is not met, `right_count[i]` and `left_count[i]` remain unchanged.***
