Postcondition: ***`d` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `sofas` is a list with at least `d` elements, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned values from `sofas[0]`, and the current value of `x1` is greater than `x2_j`, while the current value of `x2` is also greater than `x2_j`. Additionally, `right_count[i]` has been increased by 1.***
