The code initializes `left_count` as a list containing `d` zeros. This means that the value of `left_count` is now a list where each element is `0`, and the length of the list is equal to the value of `d`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples where each tuple represents the coordinates of a sofa in the format `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b` are input integers, `left_count` is a list of `d` zeros.**
