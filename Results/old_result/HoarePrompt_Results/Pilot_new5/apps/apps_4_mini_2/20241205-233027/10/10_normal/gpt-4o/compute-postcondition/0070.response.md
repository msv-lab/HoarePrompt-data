The statement `right_count[i] += 1` increments the value at index `i` of the list `right_count` by 1. The initial state does not provide the specific value of `right_count[i]`, but it indicates that `i` is initially 1. Therefore, the value at index 1 of `right_count` will increase by 1.

The other variables `d`, `sofas`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j`, `x1`, and `x2` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`d` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `sofas` is a list with at least `d` elements, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned values from `sofas[0]`, both `x1` is less than `x1_j` and `x2` is less than `x1_j`, and `right_count[i]` is increased by 1.**
