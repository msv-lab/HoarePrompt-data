According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `d`. If `i` is less than `d`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and the value of `d` is a positive integer. 

For the loop to execute one more time after the current iteration, `i` will need to be increased by 1. Thus, `i` must become 1. Additionally, `d` must remain greater than 1 in order for the loop to execute again.

State: **`d` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `left_count[i]` is equal to `cnt_l`, `right_count[i]` is equal to `cnt_r`, `top_count[i]` is equal to `cnt_t`, `bottom_count[i]` is equal to `cnt_b`, and `target_sofa` is set to 1**
