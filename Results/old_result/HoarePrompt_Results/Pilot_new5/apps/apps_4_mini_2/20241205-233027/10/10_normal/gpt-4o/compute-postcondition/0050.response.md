The code `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since there are no variable assignments or calculations taking place in this line, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `sofas` is a list with at least 1 element, `j` is 1 and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
