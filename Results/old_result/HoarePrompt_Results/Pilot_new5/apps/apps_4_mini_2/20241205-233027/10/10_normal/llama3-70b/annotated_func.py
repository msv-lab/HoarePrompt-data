#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is an integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5, sofas is a list of tuples where each tuple contains four integers (x1, y1, x2, y2) representing the coordinates of each sofa with 1 ≤ x1, x2 ≤ n and 1 ≤ y1, y2 ≤ m, and cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b ≤ d - 1.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sofas` is a list of tuples containing up to `d` tuples; `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom` are non-negative integers representing the counts based on the conditions defined in the loop; `left` is the count of sofas to the left of `sofa` on the same row, `right` is the count of sofas to the right of `sofa` on the same row, `top` is the count of sofas above `sofa` on the same column, and `bottom` is the count of sofas below `sofa` on the same column. If `sofas` contains no tuples, then `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom` will all be 0.
    return left, right, top, bottom
    #The program returns the counts of sofas: left, right, top, and bottom, where left is the count of sofas to the left on the same row, right is the count of sofas to the right on the same row, top is the count of sofas above on the same column, and bottom is the count of sofas below on the same column. If `sofas` contains no tuples, then all counts are 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `sofa` representing the coordinates of a specific sofa and a list of tuples `sofas` where each tuple represents the coordinates of other sofas. It counts and returns the number of sofas that are directly to the left, right, above, and below the specified `sofa`. If there are no other sofas in the list, the function returns counts of 0 for all directions. The function does not consider the case where the coordinates of `sofa` and other sofas may be equal; it only counts when they differ.
