Postcondition: ***`d` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `sofas` is a list with at least `d` elements, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned values from `sofas[0]`. The current values of `y1` and `y2` are both greater than `y2_j`. `right_count[i]`, `left_count[i]`, and `bottom_count[i]` are all increased by 1.***
