Postcondition: ***`sofas` is a list of tuples containing at least 3 tuples, `s` is the third tuple in the list. If the first element of the first tuple in `sofas` is less than the first element of `s`, and the second element of the first tuple in `sofas` is equal to the second element of `s`, then `left` is increased by 1.***
