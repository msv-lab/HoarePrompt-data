The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop without executing the remaining code within the current loop iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is greater than 3, `i` is 2, `sofas` is a list with at least `d` elements, `j` is 3 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`d` is greater than 3, `i` is 2, `sofas` is a list with at least `d` elements, `j` is 3 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
