The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `sofa`, which is a tuple containing four integers (x1, y1, x2, y2) representing the coordinates of a specific sofa, and `sofas`, which is a list of tuples where each tuple contains four integers representing the coordinates of other sofas. The function computes and returns counts of sofas in relation to the specified `sofa`: `cnt_l` is the count of sofas to the left on the same row, `cnt_r` is the count of sofas to the right on the same row, `cnt_t` is the count of sofas above on the same column, and `cnt_b` is the count of sofas below on the same column. If the list `sofas` is empty, the function returns all counts as 0. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept the coordinates of a specific sofa and a list of other sofas, then return the counts of sofas located relative to the specified sofa's position.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter sofa (a tuple of four integers) and a parameter sofas (a list of tuples of four integers), and returns counts of sofas to the left, right, above, and below the specified sofa. If there are no sofas in the list, it returns counts as 0 for all directions.**
