The value of `d` is assigned the value of `int(input().strip())`, where `input()` accepts an input and `int()` converts it to an integer. The other variables are not affected, so the output state retains the conditions on `n`, `m`, and the sofa coordinates as valid.

Output State: **`d` is an input positive integer, `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the storehouse, each of the next `d` lines contains four integers (x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2) representing the coordinates of the i-th sofa (1 ≤ x_1, x_2 ≤ n, 1 ≤ y_1, y_2 ≤ m), and the last line contains four integers (cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b) representing the counts of sofas on the left, right, top, and bottom respectively.**
