To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to ensure that the program correctly identifies the sofa that meets the conditions specified.

### Key Points from the Problem Description:
1. The storehouse is represented as a matrix, and each sofa takes two neighboring cells.
2. We need to find a sofa such that:
   - It has a specific number of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom, as specified by the input.
3. If no sofa meets all the conditions, we should output -1.
4. The algorithm must correctly calculate how many sofas are positioned relative to each sofa in all four directions based on their coordinates.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
1. The program reads the number of sofas and their coordinates, storing them in a list.
2. It defines a function `func_1` that counts how many sofas are to the left, right, top, and bottom of a given sofa.
3. The program iterates over each sofa and checks if the counts from `func_1` match the required counts.
4. If a match is found, it prints the index of the sofa (1-based). If no matches are found after checking all sofas, it prints -1.

### Potential Issues:
1. The `func_1` function checks only the first coordinate of the sofa to determine the left/right/tops/bottoms, but since a sofa can be in a horizontal or vertical position, it might miscount if the sofas are not aligned perfectly in one direction.
2. The conditions for counting left, right, top, and bottom are not distinguishing between whether a sofa is vertical or horizontal, which could lead to incorrect outputs in certain arrangements.

### Example Where It May Fail:
Consider the following input:
```
3
3 3
1 1 1 2
2 1 2 2
1 2 2 2
1 1 1 1
```
- We have three sofas:
  - Sofa 1: (1,1) to (1,2)
  - Sofa 2: (2,1) to (2,2)
  - Sofa 3: (1,2) to (2,2)
- Here, the counts should indicate that:
  - Sofa 1 has `cnt_l = 0`, `cnt_r = 1`, `cnt_t = 1`, `cnt_b = 0`.
  - Sofa 2 has `cnt_l = 1`, `cnt_r = 0`, `cnt_t = 0`, `cnt_b = 1`.
  - Sofa 3 has `cnt_l = 1`, `cnt_r = 1`, `cnt_t = 0`, `cnt_b = 0`.
- According to the counts provided (1, 1, 1, 1), none of the sofas would match, but based on the counting methodology in the code, it might misinterpret the positioning.

### Conclusion:
Given the potential for miscounting due to the way the function checks the positions and the relationships between sofas, this indicates the program does not correctly implement the counting as specified. 

Correctness: **False**.
