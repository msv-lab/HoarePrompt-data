The values of `n` and `k` are now assigned the values provided by the input. Since `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\) and `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{5}\), the specific values of `n` and `k` will be determined by user input but they will remain within those specified ranges.

Output State: **`n` is the input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `k` is the input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5.**
