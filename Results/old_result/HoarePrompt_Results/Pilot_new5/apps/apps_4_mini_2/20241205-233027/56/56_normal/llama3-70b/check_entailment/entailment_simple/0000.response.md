Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Sum Constraint**: The program assumes that if `n < k`, it should print "No". However, this doesn't account for the possibility that `n` can still be expressed as a sum of `k` integers, even if that means some of those integers could be negative (as indicated by the problem description, where negative powers are allowed). For instance, if `n = 1` and `k = 2`, it is possible to achieve this sum by using `2^{-1}` and `2^{-1}` (which both equal `0.5`), resulting in `1`. Therefore, the check of `n < k` is insufficient and incorrect.

2. **Lexicographical Order and Maximum Integer**: The logic for building the list `a` only considers the highest powers of 2 that can be subtracted from `n`. It does not ensure the solution is the lexicographically largest one while keeping the maximum integer as small as possible. After constructing the array `a`, simply sorting it in descending order does not guarantee that the maximum integer is minimized across all possible valid combinations.

3. **Handling of Remaining Sum**: After the loop, if `len(a) < k`, the program returns "No", but if `len(a) == k`, it outputs the sorted array. The program lacks logic to distribute the remaining sum appropriately when there are extra powers of two. If there are fewer than `k` components in `a`, there should be a way to fill in extra elements, possibly by including negative powers of 2.

Overall, the program fails to handle cases where negative integers are needed and does not correctly enforce the constraints on lexicographical order and minimizing the largest integer in the sequence. Therefore, it does not meet the requirements laid out in the problem description.
