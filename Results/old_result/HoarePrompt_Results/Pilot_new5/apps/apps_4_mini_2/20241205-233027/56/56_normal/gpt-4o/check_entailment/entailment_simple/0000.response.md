To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic in the `func_1` function and check whether it meets all the requirements outlined in the problem statement.

### Analyzing the Program:

1. **Input Constraints**: The program reads two integers, `n` and `k`, which adhere to the constraints \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{5}\). This setup respects the given input conditions.

2. **Checking Immediate Conditions**:
   - The first condition checks if \(k\) is greater than \(n\). If so, it returns 'No' because it's impossible to have \(k\) integers that sum to \(n\) if \(k > n\).

3. **Extracting Set Bits**:
   - The program extracts the indices of the set bits (1s) in the binary representation of \(n\). This is correctly implemented, and the `bits` list will contain all the powers of 2 that sum up to \(n\).

4. **Checking the Length of Bits**:
   - After collecting the set bits, if their count exceeds \(k\), the program returns 'No'. This is correct because we can't create a sequence of length \(k\) if we don't have enough powers of 2.

5. **Fulfilling the Length \(k\)**:
   - If the number of set bits is less than \(k\), the program enters a while loop to append smaller powers of 2 (by decreasing the smallest index in `bits`). This process is repeated until the length of `bits` matches \(k\). This step ensures that the maximum element is minimized while still maintaining the lexicographical order requirement by always adding smaller indices (i.e., by decrementing).

6. **Sorting the Bits**:
   - Finally, the `bits` list is sorted in reverse order before returning the result. This guarantees that the output is lexicographically largest.

### Conclusion:
The program logically follows the steps required by the problem description. It checks for infeasibility conditions, constructs the necessary sequence of powers of 2, and ensures that the final output meets both the sum and lexicographical requirements.

**Correctness: True**

The program is correct as it adheres to the requirements of the problem description and handles all potential cases outlined therein.
