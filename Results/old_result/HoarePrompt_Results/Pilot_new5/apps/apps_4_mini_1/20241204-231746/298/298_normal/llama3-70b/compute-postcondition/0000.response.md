To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we consider the effect of calling `func_2(a, b)` and how it impacts the variables `x` and `y`. Since we are not provided with the implementation details of `func_2`, we can only state that `x` and `y` will be assigned specific values based on the input integers `a` and `b`.

- The initial state is that `a` and `b` are integers within the bounds 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9, and `k` is in the range 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^9.
- After invoking the function `func_2(a, b)`, `x` and `y` are assigned values that depend on the implementation of `func_2`.

Since the specific output of `func_2` is not known, we denote the results generically as `func_2(a, b)` returning some values `x` and `y`.

Thus, the output state will reflect the unchanged values of `a` and `b` and include the new values of `x` and `y` as a result of the function call.

Output State: **`a` is an integer (1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9), `b` is an integer (1 ≤ b ≤ 10^9), `x` is the result of func_2(a, b), `y` is the result of func_2(a, b)**.
