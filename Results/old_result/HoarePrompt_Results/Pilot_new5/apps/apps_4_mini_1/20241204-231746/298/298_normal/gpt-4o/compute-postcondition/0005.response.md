The value of `area` is assigned the value of `int(area)`. Since `area` is already calculated as `n * m / k` and is stated to be an integer, the type conversion using `int` has no effect on the value of `area`. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged except for the confirmation that `area` is indeed an integer.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `m` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `k` is an integer between 2 and 10^9, and `area` is equal to `n * m / k`, confirmed to be an integer.**
