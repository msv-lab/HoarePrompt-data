The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned values from the input. The values are constrained such that `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9` and `2 ≤ k ≤ 10^9`. The exact values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are determined by user input during execution. Therefore, the states of the other variables are not affected, but their values change based on the input provided. 

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers with values taken from user input, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^9.**
