The function accepts input values for integers `n`, `m`, and `k`. It calculates the area as `n * m / k` and checks if the area is an integer greater than zero. If the area is not an integer or equals zero, it prints "NO". If the area is a valid integer greater than zero, it prints "YES" and coordinates based on comparisons between `2 * area`, `n`, and `m`, determining specific coordinates to print. It handles cases where the area might not be achievable with the given dimensions and outputs accordingly.
