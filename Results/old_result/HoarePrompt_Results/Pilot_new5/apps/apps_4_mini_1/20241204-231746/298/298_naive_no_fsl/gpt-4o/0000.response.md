To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step and check if it handles all potential cases correctly.

### Breakdown of the Program Logic:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`.

2. **Area Calculation**:
   - It calculates the desired triangle area as `area = n * m / k`.
   - It checks if `area` is an integer. If not, it prints "NO".
   - It checks if `area` is zero. If so, it prints "NO".

3. **Finding Points**:
   - If `area` is valid (i.e., not zero and an integer), the program attempts to find three points that form a triangle with the specified area:
     - Depending on whether `2 * area` fits within `n` or `m`, it generates different sets of points.
     - Specifically:
       - If `2 * area <= n`, it generates points where the x-coordinate can be spread out.
       - If `2 * area <= m`, it generates points where the y-coordinate can be spread out.
       - Otherwise, it takes the maximum bounds `(n, m)` and adjusts the midpoint accordingly.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **Area Calculation**:
   - If `n * m` is not divisible by `k`, the area will not be an integer, and the program correctly outputs "NO".

2. **Finding Points**:
   - The program does not account for cases where even though `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n` or `m`, the points generated might still exceed the boundaries set by `0 ≤ x_i ≤ n` and `0 ≤ y_i ≤ m`.

### Example to Test:
- Let's take the input `n = 4`, `m = 3`, `k = 3`.
   - Here, `area = 4 * 3 / 3 = 4` which is an integer and not zero.
   - The program outputs:
     ```
     YES
     0 0
     8 1   (Invalid since x should be <= 4)
     0 1
     ```
   - The second point `8, 1` violates the condition `0 <= x_i <= n` because `8` is greater than `4`.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to correctly constrain the generated points to the limits given in the problem statement, leading to potential invalid output in certain cases.

Thus, the correctness of the program can be stated as follows:

Correctness: **False**
