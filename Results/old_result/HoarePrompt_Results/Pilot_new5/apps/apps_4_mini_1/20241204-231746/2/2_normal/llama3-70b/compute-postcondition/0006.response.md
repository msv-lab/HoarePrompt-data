The current value of `max_sum` is updated to the value of `digit_sum`. Since `digit_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, `max_sum` will now equal `digit_sum`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`x` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, `max_sum` is equal to `digit_sum`, `max_num` is 0, `i` is 1, `digit_sum` is 1.**
