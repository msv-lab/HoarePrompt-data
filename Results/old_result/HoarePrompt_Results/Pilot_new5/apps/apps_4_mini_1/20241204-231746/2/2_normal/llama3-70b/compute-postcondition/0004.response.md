`digit_sum` is assigned the value of the sum of the digits of `i`, which is currently `1`. The digit sum of `1` is `1`. The other variables (`x`, `max_sum`, `max_num`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`x` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, `max_sum` is 0, `max_num` is 0, `i` is 1, `digit_sum` is 1**
