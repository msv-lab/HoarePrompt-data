According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` in relation to `x`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `digit_sum` is 2. Since `x` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, we do not know the exact value of `x`, but we know it must be at least 2 for the loop to continue executing.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented to 3. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `i` (which is 3) must be less than or equal to `x`. Therefore, to allow the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`x` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18 and must be greater than or equal to 3; `max_sum` remains unchanged, `max_num` remains unchanged, `i` is 3, `digit_sum` is 2**
