According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `left`, `right`, and the character at `s[left]`. The loop will continue executing as long as `left` is less than `right` and `s[left]` is not 'G'. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know the following:
- `left` is at least 1, which means it can potentially be increased.
- `right` must be greater than 0, indicating it is valid and can also remain greater than `left`.
- The condition `s[left] != 'G'` must also hold for the loop to execute again.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time:
1. `left` must still be less than `right`.
2. It must be ensured that `s[left]` is not 'G'.

Since `left` is at least 1 and `right` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute again, we need:
- `left` to remain less than `right`.
- We need to adjust the string `s` such that `s[left]` is not 'G'.

Therefore, the state needs to be modified to ensure that `s[left]` does not equal 'G' for the loop to continue.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000, `s` is an input string such that `s[left]` must not be 'G', `golden` is a list of indices where 'G' appears in `s`, `max_beauty` is 0, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is at least 1, `right` must be greater than 0**
