In the initial state, `i` is 2, `segments` contains at least 3 tuples, and `prev_start` and `prev_end` are assigned the values from `segments[1]`. The code snippet assigns values to `curr_start` and `curr_end` from the tuple at index `i` in `segments`. 

Since `i` is 2, `curr_start` and `curr_end` will get the values from `segments[2]`. The previous values of `prev_start` and `prev_end` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is 2; `segments` contains at least 3 tuples; `prev_start` and `prev_end` are assigned the values from `segments[1]`; `curr_start` and `curr_end` are assigned the values from `segments[2]`.**
