Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000. If `s[j]` is 'G', `beauty` is increased by 1, `j` is updated to `i + 2`, and `max_beauty` is either unchanged or updated to the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`. If `s[j]` is not 'G', the `beauty` is the total count of consecutive 'G's found from index `i` until a non-'G' character is encountered, and `j` is set to `i + 2` while breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of `left`, `right`, `golden`, `max_beauty_one_swap`, and `curr_beauty` remain consistent with their definitions.***
