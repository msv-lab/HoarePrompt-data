The variable `beauty` is incremented by 1. The initial state does not provide information about the value of `beauty`, so we can only state that it has increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `beauty` has been increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is less than `n - 3, `beauty` is increased by 1.**
