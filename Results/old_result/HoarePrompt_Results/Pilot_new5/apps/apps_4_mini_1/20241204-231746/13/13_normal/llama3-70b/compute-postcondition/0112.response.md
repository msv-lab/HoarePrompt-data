The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is an integer such that `i` is less than `n - 2`, `j` is initialized to `i + 2`, and the character at index `j` in string `s` is not 'G', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
