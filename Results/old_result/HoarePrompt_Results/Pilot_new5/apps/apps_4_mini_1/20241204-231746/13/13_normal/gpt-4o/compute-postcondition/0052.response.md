The code assigns the values of `curr_start` and `curr_end` from the tuple `segments[i]`. Given that `i` is 1, the values of `curr_start` and `curr_end` will be the starting and ending indices of the second segment in the `segments` list. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Since `segments` contains tuples representing segments and `length of segments` is greater than 1, we can determine that `curr_start` and `curr_end` will be set to the values corresponding to `segments[1]`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `segments` contains tuples representing the starting and ending indices of segments, `max_length` is equal to the maximum length of segments calculated from `segments`, length of `segments` is greater than 1, `prev_start` is the starting index of segment `segments[0]`, `prev_end` is the ending index of segment `segments[0]`, `curr_start` is the starting index of segment `segments[1]`, `curr_end` is the ending index of segment `segments[1]`.**
