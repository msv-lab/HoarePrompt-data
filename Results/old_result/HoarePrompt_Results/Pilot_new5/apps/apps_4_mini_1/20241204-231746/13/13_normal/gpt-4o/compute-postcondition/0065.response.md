Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `segments` contains at least 4 tuples, `prev_start` and `prev_end` are values from `segments[2]`, `curr_start` and `curr_end` are values from `segments[3]`. If `curr_start - prev_end` equals 2, then `max_length` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and the calculated expression, while all other variables remain unchanged.***
