`left` is incremented by 1. Since `left` is at least 2, its value will now be at least 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000, `s[left]` must not be 'G', `golden` is a list of indices where 'G' appears in `s`, `max_beauty` is 0, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is at least 3, `right` must be greater than `left`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000, `s[left]` must not be 'G', `golden` is a list of indices where 'G' appears in `s`, `max_beauty` is 0, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is at least 3, `right` must be greater than `left`**.
