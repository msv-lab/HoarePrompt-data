According to the code, the loop can execute as long as both conditions `left < right` and `s[left] != 'G'` are satisfied. 

At the end of the last iteration:
- `left` is now `left + 1`, which means the current value of `left` is one more than it was at the start of the iteration.
- `left` is still less than `right`, which indicates that this condition is satisfied.
- `s[left]` must not be 'G' for the loop to continue. 

Since `s[left]` must not be 'G' and `left` is currently one more than its previous value, it is necessary to ensure that `s[left]` at the new position (after increment) is not 'G' for the loop to execute again. 

The conditions that require adjustment are:
- `left` must be incremented, which is already handled as per the state.
- The value at `s[left]` needs to be specified as not equal to 'G'.

As such, the state needs to reflect that `s[left]` must not be 'G' after the increment of `left`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000; `s` must not have 'G' at index `left`, and `s[left] must not be 'G' after increment`**
