Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000 and `i` is `n - 1`. If `s[i]` is 'G' and `s[i + 1]` is 'S', then `beauty` is updated to `1 + k + m`, where `m` is the number of consecutive 'G's starting from index `i + 2`, while `curr_beauty` and `max_beauty` remain unchanged, and `max_beauty_one_swap` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `beauty`. Otherwise, no changes occur to `beauty`, `curr_beauty`, `max_beauty`, or `max_beauty_one_swap`.***
