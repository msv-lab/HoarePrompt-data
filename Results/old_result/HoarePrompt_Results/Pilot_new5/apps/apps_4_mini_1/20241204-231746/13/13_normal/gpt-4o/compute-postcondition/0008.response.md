The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000, `trophies` must have `trophies[i]` equal to 'G', `segments` is an empty list, `i` is 2, `start` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000, `trophies` must have `trophies[i]` equal to 'G', `segments` is an empty list, `i` is 2, `start` is 0**
