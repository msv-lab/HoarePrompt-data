Postcondition: ***`i` is equal to `n`, `segments` contains tuples representing the starting and ending indices of all segments of consecutive 'G' characters in the original string `trophies`. If there are no 'G' characters, `segments` will remain empty, indicating that `segments` is currently empty. The original value of `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, and `trophies` is a string of length `n` containing only 'G' and 'S'.***
