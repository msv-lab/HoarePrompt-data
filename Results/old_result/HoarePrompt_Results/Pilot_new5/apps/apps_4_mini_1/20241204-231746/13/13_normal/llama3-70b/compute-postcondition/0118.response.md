To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we analyze the provided conditions.

1. The loop iterates with `j` starting from `i + 2` up to `n - 1` (exclusive). 
2. Since `j` is initialized as `i + 2`, we can deduce that for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `n`.
3. The current value of `j` is `i + 3`, which means the next value of `j` will be `i + 4`.
4. For the loop to execute again, we require that `j < n`, which translates to `i + 4 < n`. Given that `i` is less than `n - 2`, we can see that for this condition to hold, `n` must be greater than `i + 4`.

Considering these points, we can summarize the state adjustments as follows:

- `i` is still less than `n - 2`, and after this iteration, it remains unchanged.
- `j` will increment to `i + 4`.
- Therefore, `n` must be greater than `i + 4`.

Now, putting this all together:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is an integer such that `i` is less than `n - 2`, `j` is `i + 4`**.
