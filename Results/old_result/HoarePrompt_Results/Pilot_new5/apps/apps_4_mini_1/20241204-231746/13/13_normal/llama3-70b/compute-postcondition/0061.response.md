The value of `beauty` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `beauty` is 1, so after the increment, `beauty` becomes 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is greater than 0, `golden` is a list of indices where 'G' appears in `s`, `max_beauty` is either unchanged or updated to the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is the count of consecutive 'G's at the end of the loop, `left` is the index of the first 'G' found that is less than the final value of `right`, `right` is equal to `n`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0, `s[i]` is 'G', `s[i + 1]` is 'S', `beauty` is 2, and `s[j]` is 'G'**.
