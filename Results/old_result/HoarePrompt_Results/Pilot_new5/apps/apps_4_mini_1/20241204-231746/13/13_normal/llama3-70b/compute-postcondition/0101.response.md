The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `curr_beauty` is the count of consecutive 'G's encountered while decrementing from `i`, `beauty` is 1 or 2 depending on `s[j]`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of its previous value and `beauty`, `left` is the index of the first 'G' found that is less than `right`, `right` remains equal to `n`, `j` is `i - 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
