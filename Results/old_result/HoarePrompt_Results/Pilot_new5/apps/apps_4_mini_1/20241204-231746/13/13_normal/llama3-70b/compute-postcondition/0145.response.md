Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` must be less than `n - 2`, `beauty` is equal to `1 + k` where `k` is the number of consecutive 'G's found starting from index `i - 1`, `j` is `i - k - 1`, `curr_beauty` remains unchanged, and `max_beauty` remains unchanged. The character at index `j` in string `s` is not 'G'.***
