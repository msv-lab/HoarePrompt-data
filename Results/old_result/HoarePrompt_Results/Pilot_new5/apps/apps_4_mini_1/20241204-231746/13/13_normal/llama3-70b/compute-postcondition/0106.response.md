Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `j` is -1, if `s[j]` is 'G', then `beauty` is increased by 1 while `max_beauty_one_swap`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged. If `s[j]` is not 'G', `beauty` remains unchanged, `max_beauty_one_swap`, `left`, and `right` also remain unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
