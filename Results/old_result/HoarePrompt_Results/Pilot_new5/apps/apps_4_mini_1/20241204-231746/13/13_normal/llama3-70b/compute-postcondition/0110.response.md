The code increments the variable `beauty` by 1. The variables `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. The value of `beauty` will be one unit higher than its previous value. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `j` is initialized to `i + 2`, and `s[j]` is 'G', and `beauty` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `j` is initialized to `i + 2`, `s[j]` is 'G', and `beauty` is increased by 1.**
