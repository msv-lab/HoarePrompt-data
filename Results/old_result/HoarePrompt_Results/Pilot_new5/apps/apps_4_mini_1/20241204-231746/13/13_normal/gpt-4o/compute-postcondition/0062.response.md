The code snippet assigns the values from the tuple `segments[i - 1]` to `prev_start` and `prev_end`. Since `i` is 3, this means it will take the values from `segments[2]`. The values of `segments[2]` will determine the new values of `prev_start` and `prev_end`. The other variables `i`, `segments`, `curr_start`, and `curr_end` remain unaffected.

Output State: **`i` is 3; `segments` contains at least 4 tuples; `prev_start` and `prev_end` are the values from `segments[2]`; `curr_start` and `curr_end` are the values from `segments[3]**.
