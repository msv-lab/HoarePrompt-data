Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 <= n <= 100,000) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'G' and 'S'. It calculates the maximum number of consecutive 'G's in the string and also determines the maximum possible count of consecutive 'G's that can be obtained by swapping one 'G' with an adjacent 'S'. Finally, it returns the greater of these two values. **
