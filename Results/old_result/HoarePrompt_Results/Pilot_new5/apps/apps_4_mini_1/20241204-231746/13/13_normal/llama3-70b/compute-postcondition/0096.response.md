Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is `n - 2`, `j` is `i - 1`, `max_beauty` is either unchanged or updated to the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is the count of consecutive 'G's encountered while decrementing from `i`, `left` is the index of the first 'G' found that is less than `right`, `right` is equal to `n`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of its previous value and `beauty`, `beauty` is 1, and `s[j]` is not 'G'.***
