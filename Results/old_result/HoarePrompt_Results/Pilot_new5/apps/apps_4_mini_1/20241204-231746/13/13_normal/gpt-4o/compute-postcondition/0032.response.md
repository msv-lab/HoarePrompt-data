Since `i` is incremented by 1, its value will increase by 1. The bounds of `i` remain valid as it was previously a valid index within the range of `0` to `n-1`, and after incrementing, it will still satisfy `0 <= i < n` if `n` is greater than 1. The values of `n`, `trophies`, and `segments` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `trophies` is a string of length `n` containing only 'G' and 'S', `segments` is an empty list, `i` is now a valid index such that `0 <= i < n` and `trophies[i]` is 'G', after incrementing `i` by 1.**
