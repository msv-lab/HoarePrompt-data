Output State: **`i` is the first index in `trophies` where the character is not 'G', `trophies[start]` is 'G', and all characters from `trophies[start]` to `trophies[i-1]` are 'G'. If `i` equals `n`, that means all characters in the string were 'G'. If `start` was equal to `n`, then the loop did not execute, and `i` is equal to `n`.**
