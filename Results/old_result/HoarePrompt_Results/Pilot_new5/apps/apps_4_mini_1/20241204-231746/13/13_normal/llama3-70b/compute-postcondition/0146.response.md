The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` must be less than `n - 2`, `beauty` is equal to `1 + k` where `k` is the number of consecutive 'G's found starting from index `i - 1`, `j` is `i - k - 1`, `curr_beauty` remains unchanged, and `max_beauty` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
