Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000, `s` does not start with 'G', `golden` is a list of indices where 'G' appears in `s`, `max_beauty` is 1, `curr_beauty` is 1 if `left` is less than `right`; otherwise, `curr_beauty` remains 0. The current value of `left` is equal to the index of the first 'G' in `s` or `n` if 'G' is not found, and `right` is greater than or equal to `left`.***
