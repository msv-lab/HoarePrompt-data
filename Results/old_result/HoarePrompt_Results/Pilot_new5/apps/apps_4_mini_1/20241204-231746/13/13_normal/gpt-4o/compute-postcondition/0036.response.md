The variable `i` is incremented by 1. The initial state indicates that `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, which means that the value of `n` remains unchanged and its condition still holds. The values of `trophies[i]` and `trophies[i + 1]` remain as 'G'. The only change is the increment of `i` by 1.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `trophies[i]` must be 'G', `trophies[i + 1]` must be 'G', `i` is increased by 1.**
