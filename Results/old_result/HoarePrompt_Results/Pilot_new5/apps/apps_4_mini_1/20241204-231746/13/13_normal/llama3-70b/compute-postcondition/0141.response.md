To evaluate the output state after the loop completes execution, we will analyze the information provided step by step.

The loop iterates backwards from index `i - 1` down to `0`. For each index `j`, it checks if the character `s[j]` is 'G'. If it is, it increments the `beauty` by 1. If it encounters a character that is not 'G', the loop breaks immediately.

Thus, the output state after the loop executes will depend on how many consecutive 'G's are found starting from `s[i - 1]` and moving backwards. 

Hereâ€™s how we can summarize the output state:

- If there are `k` consecutive 'G's starting from `s[i - 1]`, then `beauty` will be `1 + k` after the loop, as it starts with a value of 1 and gains an additional point for each 'G' encountered.
- `j` will be `i - k - 1` after the loop completes (this accounts for the index where the loop breaks).
- The value of `i` remains unchanged.
- `curr_beauty` and `max_beauty` also remain unchanged throughout the execution.

Now, considering the conditions for the loop to execute `k` times:
- There must be at least `k` 'G's starting from `s[i - 1]`.
- The loop can execute 0 times if `s[i - 1]` itself is not 'G', in which case `beauty` stays 1.

Thus, if the loop runs to completion (covering all possible iterations):
- If `s` contains `k` consecutive 'G's from `s[i-1]`, then `beauty` becomes `1 + k`, and `j` ends at `i - k - 1`.

Using this understanding, we can conclude:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `beauty` is equal to `1 + k` where `k` is the number of consecutive 'G's found starting from index `i - 1`, `j` is `i - k - 1`, `curr_beauty` remains unchanged, and `max_beauty` remains unchanged.**
