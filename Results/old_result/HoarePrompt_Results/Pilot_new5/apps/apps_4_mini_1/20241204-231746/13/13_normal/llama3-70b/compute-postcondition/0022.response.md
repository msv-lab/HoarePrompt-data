Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000, `s` is an input string, `golden` is a list of indices where 'G' appears in `s`, `max_beauty` is 0, `curr_beauty` is 1, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, and if `s[right]` is 'G', then `curr_beauty` is updated to 1. Otherwise, if `left` is at least equal to `right` or `s[left]` is 'G', `right` is greater than 0, and if `left` is less than `right`, then `curr_beauty` is updated to 1 while the value of `left` remains less than the current value of `right`.***
