Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 0, `golden` is a list of indices where 'G' appears in `s`, `max_beauty` is either unchanged or updated to the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is the count of consecutive 'G's at the end of the loop, `left` is the index of the first 'G' found that is less than the final value of `right`, `right` is equal to `n`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0, and `s[i]` is 'G' and `s[i + 1]` is 'S'.***
