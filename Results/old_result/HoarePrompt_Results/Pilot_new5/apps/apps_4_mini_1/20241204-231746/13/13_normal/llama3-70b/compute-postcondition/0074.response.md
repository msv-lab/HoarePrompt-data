According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the range it will iterate over. The loop starts at `i + 2` and ends before `n`. For the loop to execute, `i + 2` must be less than `n`. Given that `n` is at least 2, we can deduce that if `i` is 0, the loop will start at 2, which is valid. However, if `i` is such that `i + 2` is equal to or greater than `n`, the loop will not execute.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to ensure that `i + 2` is less than `n`. Therefore, `i` must be less than `n - 2`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is less than `n - 2, `golden` is a list of indices where 'G' appears in `s`, `max_beauty` is either unchanged or updated to the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is the count of consecutive 'G's encountered while decrementing from `i`, `left` is the index of the first 'G' found that is less than the final value of `right`, `right` is equal to `n`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0, `s[i]` is 'G', `s[i + 1]` is 'S', `beauty` is the total count of consecutive 'G's found from index `i` until a non-'G' character is encountered, and `j` is `i + 2`.**
