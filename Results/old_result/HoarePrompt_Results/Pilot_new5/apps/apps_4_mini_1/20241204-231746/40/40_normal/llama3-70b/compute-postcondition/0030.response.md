The length of `substr` is calculated as `len(substr)`, where `substr` is `s[1:4]`. Since `s` is a non-empty string with length `n` that is at least 4, `substr` will have a length of 3 (the characters at indices 1, 2, and 3 of `s`). The `max_len` variable is updated to hold the maximum value between its current value and the length of `substr`. 

Since `max_len` remains unchanged in the initial state, it will either remain the same or be set to 3, depending on its initial value.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with length `n` that must be at least 4; `i` is 1; `j` is 4; `substr` is `s[1:4]`; `max_len` is max(`max_len`, 3).**
