Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string with length `n` that is at least 2; `i` is 1; `j` is 2; `max_len` is the length of the longest substring of `s` that is not a palindrome; `substr` is the second character of `s`, and the current value of `substr` is not equal to its reverse (i.e., `substr` is not a palindrome).***
