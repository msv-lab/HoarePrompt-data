The code assigns a new value to `max_len` based on the maximum of its current value and the length of `substr`. Since `max_len` is initially 2, and `substr` is the first three characters of `s`, the length of `substr` is 3. Therefore, `max_len` will be updated to 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with length `n`, `max_len` is 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, and `substr` is the first three characters of `s`.**
