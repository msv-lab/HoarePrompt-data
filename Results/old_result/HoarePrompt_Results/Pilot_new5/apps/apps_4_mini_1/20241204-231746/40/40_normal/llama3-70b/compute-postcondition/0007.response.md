In this case, `max_len` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and the length of `substr`. The initial state indicates that `max_len` is 0, and `substr` is the first character of `s`, which has a length of 1. Therefore, the length of `substr` is 1.

Since `max_len` is initially 0, the comparison in the `max` function will result in `max_len` becoming 1 after the execution of the code. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `n` is the length of `s`, `max_len` is 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `substr` is the first character of `s`, and `substr` is not equal to its reverse (`substr[::-1]`).**
