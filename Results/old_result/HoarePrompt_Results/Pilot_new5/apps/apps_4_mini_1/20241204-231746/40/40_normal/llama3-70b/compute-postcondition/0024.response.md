According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as the variable `j` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. Since the loop is defined to run from `i + 1` to `n + 1`, we can calculate that for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be 3 in the next iteration. 

The variable `i` remains 1, and `s` is still a non-empty string with length `n` at least 2. Since `j` is now going to be 3, the loop will only execute again if `n` is at least 3 in order for `j` to stay within the bounds of the loop condition.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string with length `n` that must be at least 3; `i` is 1; `j` is 3**
