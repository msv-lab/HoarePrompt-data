To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and its logic against various potential inputs.

The goal is to find the length of the longest substring of a given string `s` that is not a palindrome. The program works by checking the following:

1. If the input string `s` has a length of 1 or less, it immediately returns 0 because a single character is inherently a palindrome.
2. It checks if the entire string `s` is not a palindrome using the `func_1` function. If not, it returns the length of the string `s`.
3. If the entire string is a palindrome, the program then checks the substring formed by removing the first character (`s[1:]`). If this substring is not a palindrome, it returns its length, which is `len(s) - 1`.
4. Similarly, it checks the substring formed by removing the last character (`s[:-1]`). If this substring is not a palindrome, it also returns its length of `len(s) - 1`.
5. If all the above checks return true (i.e., both sub-strings are palindromes), it finally returns 0, indicating that there are no non-palindrome substrings.

Now, let's consider a potential edge case where the original string is made up of two different characters, which should not be a palindrome. For example, consider the string "ab":

1. The string "ab" itself is not a palindrome, hence it should return 2.
2. If we take substrings "a" and "b", both are palindromes, but we should have returned the length of "ab" directly since it is not a palindrome.

The current logic would incorrectly identify that the longest non-palindrome substring is of length 0 for "ab", as it does not check the full string adequately after confirming it's not a palindrome.

Thus, the program fails for the test case of "ab":

```
Input: ab
Expected Output: 2
Actual Output: 0
```

Based on this analysis, the program does not cover all possible cases correctly.

Correctness: **False**.
