To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we analyze the behavior of the loop based on the initial state and the provided information. 

The loop iterates over the range from `i + 1` to `n + 1`, where `i` is initially set to 2. During each iteration, it extracts a substring `substr` from the string `s`, starting at index `i` and ending at index `j`. The loop checks whether `substr` is a palindrome. If it is not, it updates `max_len` to be the maximum of its current value and the length of `substr`.

In order to have the loop execute, `n` must be at least 2, since the smallest substring length would be 1 (from index 2 to index 3). 

Analyzing the loop:
1. The loop starts with `j` at 3 and goes up to `n`, which means it will run for `n - 2` iterations, as `j` increments from 3 to `n + 1`.
2. The maximum length of any non-palindromic substring found during these iterations will be stored in `max_len`.

If the loop executes `n - 2` times, `max_len` could be updated based on the substrings checked during each iteration. The exact value of `max_len` will depend on the content of the string `s` and the substrings formed during the iterations.

After all iterations of the loop:
- `max_len` will contain the length of the longest non-palindromic substring found in `s` from the starting index `i`.
- The loop would have checked all possible substrings starting from index 2 with varying lengths up to `n-2`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with length `n`, `max_len` is the length of the longest non-palindromic substring of `s` starting from index 2, `i` is 2, `j` is `n + 1`, `substr` is the last checked substring from `s[i:j]`.**
