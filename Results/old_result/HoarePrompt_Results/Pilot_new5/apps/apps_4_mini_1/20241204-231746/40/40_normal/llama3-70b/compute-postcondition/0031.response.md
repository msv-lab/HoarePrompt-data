Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string with length `n` that is at least 4, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, and `substr` is `s[1:4]`. If `substr` is not equal to its reverse, `max_len` is updated to the maximum of its current value and 3. There is no change to the variables if `substr` is equal to its reverse.***
