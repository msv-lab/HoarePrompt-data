Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with length `n`, `max_len` is the length of the longest substring of `s` that is not a palindrome, `i` is 0, and `j` is `n`, with `substr` being the entire string `s`. If `substr` is not equal to its reverse, then `max_len` will reflect the longest non-palindromic substring found during execution.**
