The function accepts a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters and calculates the maximum "jump" between consecutive vowels in the string. The jump is defined as half the distance between the indices of consecutive vowels, rounded up, plus one for the first vowel found. If there are no vowels, it returns 0. If the last character of the string is not a vowel, it updates the maximum jump based on the distance from the last vowel to the end of the string. The result is printed as an integer.
