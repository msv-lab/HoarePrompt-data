According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the string `s`. Since `s` is a non-empty string, the length is at least 1, which allows the loop to execute. Before the loop starts, `i` needs to be initialized to 0 as the starting index for the first iteration. 

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `vowels` is {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `max_jump` is 1, `prev_pos` is -1, `i` is 0**
