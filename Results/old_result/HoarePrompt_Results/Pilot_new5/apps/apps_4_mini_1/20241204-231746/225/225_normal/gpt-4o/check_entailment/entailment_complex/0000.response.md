Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. Specifically, the main issue lies in the handling of the case when there are no vowels present in the input string. According to the problem description, the Grasshopper must jump from the start to the end of the string, only landing on vowels. If the string contains no vowels, the Grasshopper cannot complete the jump, and thus the minimum jump ability should be equal to the length of the entire string.

However, the current implementation of the function incorrectly returns the length of the string as the maximum jump ability only if the `prev_pos` remains -1 (indicating no vowels were found), which implies that a jump of the entire string length is necessary. This scenario is not explicitly accounted for in the annotations nor is it correctly interpreted in the function's logic.

Additionally, in the case where no vowels are found, the Grasshopper's jump ability should be considered in the context of needing to make a jump over the entire string length. The programâ€™s logic assumes that if there are no vowels in the string, the maximum jump should be defined, but in such cases, there is no valid jumping path at all.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the problem requirements for all potential cases, particularly when no vowels are present. Hence, the correctness is classified as false.
