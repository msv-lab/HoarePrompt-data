The string `s` is assigned the value of `input()`, which will accept a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters. The length of the string will not exceed 100 characters. Other variables are not affected, so the output state reflects the new value of `s`.

Output State: **The input is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100; `s` is an input string of capital English letters.**
