The value of `max_jump` is updated based on the maximum of its current value and the difference between `i` and `prev_pos`. Since `prev_pos` is -1 and `i` is 0, the calculation will be `0 - (-1)`, which equals `1`. Thus, `max_jump` remains `1` as it is not increased. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `vowels` is {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `max_jump` is 1, `prev_pos` is -1, `i` is 0**
