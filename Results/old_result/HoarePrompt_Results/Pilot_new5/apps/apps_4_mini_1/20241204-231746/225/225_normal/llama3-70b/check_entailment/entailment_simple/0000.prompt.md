You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: One day, the Grasshopper was jumping on the lawn and found a piece of paper with a string. Grasshopper became interested what is the minimum jump ability he should have in order to be able to reach the far end of the string, jumping only on vowels of the English alphabet. Jump ability is the maximum possible length of his jump. 

Formally, consider that at the begginning the Grasshopper is located directly in front of the leftmost character of the string. His goal is to reach the position right after the rightmost character of the string. In one jump the Grasshopper could jump to the right any distance from 1 to the value of his jump ability. [Image] The picture corresponds to the first example. 

The following letters are vowels: 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U' and 'Y'.


-----Input-----

The first line contains non-empty string consisting of capital English letters. It is guaranteed that the length of the string does not exceed 100. 


-----Output-----

Print single integer a — the minimum jump ability of the Grasshopper (in the number of symbols) that is needed to overcome the given string, jumping only on vowels.


-----Examples-----

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, and the length of the string does not exceed 100.
def func():
    s = input()
    vowels = 'AEIOUY'
    n = len(s)
    max_jump = 0
    last_vowel = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] in vowels:
            if last_vowel == -1:
                max_jump = max(max_jump, i + 1)
            else:
                max_jump = max(max_jump, (i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1)
            last_vowel = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is an input string of capital English letters, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s`, `max_jump` is equal to the maximum distance between consecutive vowels in `s`, `last_vowel` is the index of the last vowel found in `s`, and if there are no vowels, `max_jump` is 0.
    if (last_vowel != n - 1) :
        max_jump = max(max_jump, (n - last_vowel) // 2 + 1)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`s` is a string of capital English letters, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s`, and `last_vowel` is the index of the last vowel found in `s`. If `last_vowel` is not equal to `n - 1`, `max_jump` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the value calculated as (n - last_vowel) // 2 + 1. If `last_vowel` is equal to `n - 1`, `max_jump` remains unchanged.
    print(max_jump)

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
