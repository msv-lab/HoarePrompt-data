Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly follows the problem description. It takes three positive real numbers as input, generates the twelve specified expressions, calculates their values, and identifies the maximum value along with its corresponding expression. The program handles ties by returning the first occurrence of the maximum expression in the list, which aligns with the requirements. 

Additionally, the input constraints (0.1 ≤ x, y, z ≤ 200.0 with one digit after the decimal) are respected since the program uses float values for computation. The output format matches the specified requirements, ensuring that the expressions are printed correctly without unnecessary parentheses.

All edge cases, such as scenarios where numbers are equal or very close together, are also effectively handled since the use of the `max` function with a proper key ensures that the correct expression is returned in such cases. Therefore, I can confirm that the program is implemented correctly based on the given problem description.
