The variable `a8` is assigned the value of `(y ** z) ** x`, which involves exponentiation. The expression indicates that `y` raised to the power of `z` is then raised to the power of `x`. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged, but the value of `a8` is updated.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are positive real numbers between 0.1 and 200.0; `a1` is equal to `x`; `a2` is equal to `x`; `a3` is equal to `x`; `a4` is equal to `x`; `a5` is equal to `y`; `a6` is equal to `y`; `a7` is equal to `y`; `a8` is equal to `(y ** z) ** x`.**
