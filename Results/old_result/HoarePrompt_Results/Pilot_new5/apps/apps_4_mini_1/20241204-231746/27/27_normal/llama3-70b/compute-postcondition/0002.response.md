In the given code snippet, `a2` is assigned the value of `x` raised to the power of `z`, which is further raised to the power of `y`. The impact of this computation is that `a2` will now hold a new value based on the current values of `x`, `y`, and `z`. The other variables `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged.

The specific expression for `a2` will be `x ** (z ** y)`, where `x`, `y`, and `z` are positive real numbers between 0.1 and 200.0, inclusive, each with exactly one digit after the decimal point.

Therefore, the Output State is: `x`, `y`, and `z` are positive real numbers between 0.1 and 200.0; `a1` is equal to `x`; `a2` is equal to `x ** (z ** y)`.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are positive real numbers between 0.1 and 200.0; `a1` is equal to `x`; `a2` is equal to `x ** (z ** y)`.**
