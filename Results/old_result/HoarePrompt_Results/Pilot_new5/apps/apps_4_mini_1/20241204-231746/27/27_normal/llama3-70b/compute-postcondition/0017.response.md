Functionality: ** The function accepts three positive real numbers `x`, `y`, and `z`, each between 0.1 and 200.0 inclusive, with exactly one digit after the decimal point. It calculates and compares 12 different exponential expressions involving `x`, `y`, and `z`, then prints the expression that yields the maximum value among them. However, the function does not return any value; it only prints the result. **
