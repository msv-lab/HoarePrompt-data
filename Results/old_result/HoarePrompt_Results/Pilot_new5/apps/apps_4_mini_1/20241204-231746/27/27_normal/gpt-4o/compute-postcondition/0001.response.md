The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned new values based on the input provided through `sys.stdin.read()`, which will be split and converted to `float`. The initial states of `x`, `y`, and `z` as positive real numbers in the range [0.1, 200.0] with exactly one digit after the decimal point will be updated to reflect the new values.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are new positive real numbers in the range [0.1, 200.0] with exactly one digit after the decimal point; their values are taken from the input provided.**
