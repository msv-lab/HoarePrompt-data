Correctness: **False**

The provided program attempts to determine if it is possible for Mishka to switch on the garlands such that every second after the maximum switch-on time, at least one garland is lit. The program checks if the three integers representing the intervals of the garlands (k1, k2, k3) are coprime, using their greatest common divisor (GCD).

However, the conclusion drawn from checking if the GCD is equal to 1 does not directly correlate with the problem requirements. The problem does not state that the garlands must be coprime to ensure coverage of all seconds; rather, it is sufficient for the intervals to overlap or be timed such that there are no gaps in lighting.

For example, consider the input `4, 2, 3`. The GCD of these numbers is not 1 (it is 1, 2, or 4 depending on which two are compared), but it is still possible to find times to turn on the garlands such that all seconds are covered. In this case, the program would output "NO" incorrectly, while the correct answer should be "YES."

Thus, the program fails to address the problem correctly because it relies solely on the GCD condition, which does not guarantee that there will not be gaps in the lighting of the garlands.
