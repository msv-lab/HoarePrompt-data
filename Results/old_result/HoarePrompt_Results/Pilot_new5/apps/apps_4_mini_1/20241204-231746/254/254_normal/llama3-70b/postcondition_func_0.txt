The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. Since there is no check for cases where both `a` and `b` are zero (which is not applicable here given the constraints), the function is safe from such edge cases and operates correctly within the bounds of the provided input limits.
