The variable `gcd_k1_k2` is assigned the value of the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `k1` and `k2`. The values of `k1` and `k2` are new integer values based on input, while `k_1`, `k_2`, and `k_3` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the GCD calculation while maintaining the validity of the other variables.

Output State: **`k_1`, `k_2`, `k_3` are integers such that 1 ≤ `k_1`, `k_2`, `k_3` ≤ 1500; `gcd_k1_k2` is the GCD of `k1` and `k2` based on input values.**
