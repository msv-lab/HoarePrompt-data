The value of `gcd_all` is assigned the result of `math.gcd(gcd_k1_k2, k3)`, which calculates the greatest common divisor of `gcd_k1_k2` and `k3`. The initial state indicates that `k_1`, `k_2`, and `k_3` fall within the range of 1 to 1500, and `gcd_k1_k2` is already defined as the GCD of `k_1` and `k_2`. Thus, the output state will reflect the calculated value of `gcd_all` based on those given values.

Output State: **`k_1`, `k_2`, `k_3` are integers such that 1 ≤ `k_1`, `k_2`, `k_3` ≤ 1500; `gcd_k1_k2` is the GCD of `k_1` and `k_2`; `gcd_all` is equal to `math.gcd(gcd_k1_k2, k3)`**.
