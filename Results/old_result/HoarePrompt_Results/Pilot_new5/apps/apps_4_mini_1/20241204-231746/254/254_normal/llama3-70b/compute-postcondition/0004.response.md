According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. The loop will execute as long as `b` is not zero (i.e., `b` must be truthy). At the end of the last iteration, we know that `b` is equal to `a % b`, which is a positive integer and less than the previous value of `b`. This means that `b` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to execute one more time. 

Since `a` is a positive integer and `b` is now equal to some positive integer less than the previous `b`, we need to ensure that `b` remains positive. Given that `b` must be adjusted based on its previous state, we note that for the loop to execute again, the previous value of `b` must have been greater than 0. 

Thus, we can summarize that we need to maintain the condition `b` must be greater than 0, which is already satisfied by the provided states.

State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is equal to `a % b` (which is a positive integer and less than the previous `b`), and `b` must be greater than 0**
