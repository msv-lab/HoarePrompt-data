The provided program is intended to determine whether it is possible for Mishka to switch on the three garlands such that at least one garland is lit at every second after the maximum of the starting times for the garlands. The program checks this condition by calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of the three time intervals `k1`, `k2`, and `k3`.

Let's analyze the correctness of the program step by step, considering the problem description.

1. **Understanding the LCM Condition**: The program calculates the LCM of the three intervals, and then checks if this LCM is divisible by each of the three intervals. If the LCM is divisible by all three, it implies that the garlands can be set to follow a periodic pattern that covers all subsequent seconds.

2. **GCD Function**: The program uses a helper function `func_1` to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers, which is used to compute the LCM. The LCM is calculated correctly as:
   \[
   \text{lcm}(k1, k2, k3) = \frac{k1 \times k2 \times k3}{\text{gcd}(k1, k2) \times \text{gcd}(k2, k3) \times \text{gcd}(k1, k3)}
   \]
   However, there is an important error in the calculation of LCM in the program. The formula used will not yield the correct LCM for three numbers.

3. **Logical Fallacy**: The program checks if the LCM of `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` is divisible by each of `k1`, `k2`, and `k3`, but this alone does not ensure that every second after the maximum starting time will have at least one garland lit. For example, if `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` are not co-prime with respect to each other and have a common divisor greater than 1, it might lead to gaps where no garland is lit at certain seconds.

4. **Counterexample**: Consider the input `4`, `2`, `3`. The LCM of these numbers is 12. According to the program, it checks:
   - LCM % 4 == 0 (True)
   - LCM % 2 == 0 (True)
   - LCM % 3 == 0 (True)
   The program would output "YES". However, with the starting times optimized, there would be gaps, e.g., at 1, 5, 7, 9, where no garland is lit.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem statement, particularly in ensuring that every second after switching on the garlands will have at least one garland lit.

**Conclusion**: The program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description due to incorrect logic in determining the coverage of lit garlands.

Correctness: **False**
