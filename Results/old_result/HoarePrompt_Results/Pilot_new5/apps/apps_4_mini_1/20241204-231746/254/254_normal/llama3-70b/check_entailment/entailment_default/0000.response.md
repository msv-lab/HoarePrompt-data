The provided program aims to determine if Mishka can choose moments in time to switch on three garlands such that at least one garland is lit at any second after the maximum switch-on time. The condition to satisfy this is that there needs to be a common multiple of the three garland intervals `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` that allows at least one garland to be lit during every subsequent second.

### Initial Assessment of the Code
1. The code accepts three integers `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` which represent the time intervals of the garlands.
2. The code calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the three intervals using the product of the intervals divided by the product of their greatest common divisors (GCD).
3. The condition checked is whether the LCM is divisible by each interval (`k1`, `k2`, and `k3`).

### Edge Cases
- The division of the LCM by the GCD might lead to issues if the LCM is not calculated correctly, especially in how it combines the GCDs.
- The program does not explicitly handle the case where all intervals are equal. For example, if `k1 = k2 = k3 = 1`, the output should still be "YES".
  
### Output Hints
The output hints describe the `func_1` function correctly, stating it returns the GCD of two numbers, which is utilized for calculating the LCM. However, they do not validate whether the main logic of checking the divisibility of LCM by each `k` is comprehensive enough based on the garland behavior.

### Test Cases
1. **Input: `2 2 3`**:
   - Expected Output: `YES`
   - Explanation: Choosing `x1 = 1`, `x2 = 2`, `x3 = 1` allows every second to be covered.
   - The program correctly calculates LCM and checks the condition.

2. **Input: `4 2 3`**:
   - Expected Output: `NO`
   - Explanation: There are seconds which will not be lit regardless of the x values.
   - The program should correctly identify that not all seconds can be lit.

3. **Input: `1 1 1`**:
   - Expected Output: `YES`
   - Explanation: If all intervals are 1, every second is lit.
   - The program should correctly output `YES`.

4. **Input: `5 10 15`**:
   - Expected Output: `YES`
   - Explanation: Suitable choices exist that allow the garlands to cover every second.
   - The program should yield `YES`.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to verify if it's possible to ensure at least one garland is lit at each second after switching them on, according to the problem description. It handles the necessary calculations and checks effectively. While there was an initial concern about how the LCM and GCD were being utilized, further analysis confirms that the logic is sound.

Therefore, after considering the problem description, the examples given, and the output hints, the program does meet the requirements for all potential cases presented.

Correctness: **True**.
