The code snippet `a, b = b, a % b` performs a simultaneous assignment for `a` and `b`. The new value of `a` becomes the old value of `b`, and the new value of `b` becomes the result of `a % b`.

Initially, we know that:
- `a` is a positive integer,
- `b` is a positive integer equal to `a % b`, and
- `b` must be less than `a`.

The operation `a % b` will yield a value that is also less than `b`, since `b` is defined as being less than `a`. Therefore, the new value of `b` after the operation will be the result of `a % b`, which will be a positive integer as long as `b` is not zero.

Thus, the output state after the assignment is:
- `a` becomes the previous value of `b`,
- `b` becomes the result of `a % b`.

However, since `b` is initially defined as `a % b`, we have the implication that `a % b` is already capturing the modulus operation which keeps `b` positive and less than `a`.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is equal to `a % b` (which is a positive integer and less than the previous `b`), `a` is now equal to the previous value of `b`**.
