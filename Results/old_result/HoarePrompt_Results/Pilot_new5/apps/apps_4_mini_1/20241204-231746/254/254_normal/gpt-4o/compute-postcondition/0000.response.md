The code assigns values to `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` through the `map(int, input().split())` function, which takes input and converts it into three integers. The initial values of `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` are not specified but are within the range of 1 to 1500.

Thus, the output state will reflect that `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` are now assigned new integer values based on the input, but we do not know what that input is. 

Output State: **`k_1`, `k_2`, `k_3` are integers such that 1 ≤ `k_1`, `k_2`, `k_3` ≤ 1500; `k1`, `k2`, `k3` are assigned new integer values based on input.**
