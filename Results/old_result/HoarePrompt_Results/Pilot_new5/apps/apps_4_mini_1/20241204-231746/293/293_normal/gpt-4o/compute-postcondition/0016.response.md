The code assigns `current_node` the value of `2 * current_node + 1`. However, the initial state does not provide a specific value for `current_node`, leaving it unknown. Since we do not have information about its value, the output state cannot provide a specific result for `current_node` but should reflect that it has been modified. Other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this specific operation.

Output State: **`h` is between 1 and 50 inclusive, `n` is between 1 and 2^h inclusive, `total_leaves` is 2^h, `visited_count` is 3, `path` is a binary string of length h, `direction` is the second character in the path, `current_node` is updated to `2 * current_node + 1`.**
