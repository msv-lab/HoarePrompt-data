The variable `ans` is incremented by `n // 2 - 1`. Given that `n` must be greater than 2, the expression `n // 2` yields a positive integer value. Thus, `ans` is updated, but without knowing its initial value, we cannot specify its final value. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`h` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50; `n` must be greater than 2; `ans` is updated by adding `n // 2 - 1` to its previous value.**
