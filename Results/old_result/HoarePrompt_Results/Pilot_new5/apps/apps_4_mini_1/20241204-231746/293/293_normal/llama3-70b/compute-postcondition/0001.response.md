The variable `ans` is assigned the value `0`, but the values of the other variables, `h` and `n`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50; `n` is an integer representing a leaf node index such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2^`h`; `ans` is 0.

Output State: **`h` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50; `n` is an integer representing a leaf node index such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2^`h`; `ans` is 0.**
