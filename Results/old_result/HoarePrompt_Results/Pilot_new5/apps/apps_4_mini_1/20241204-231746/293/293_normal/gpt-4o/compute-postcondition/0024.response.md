Output State: **`h` is between 1 and 50 inclusive, `n` is between 1 and 2^h inclusive, `total_leaves` is 2^h, `visited_count` is equal to the length of `path`, `path` is a binary string of length `h`, `current_node` is the value derived from traversing the binary tree according to the `path` string, which is a result of interpreting `path` as a series of left (0) and right (1) moves starting from the root node (0).**
