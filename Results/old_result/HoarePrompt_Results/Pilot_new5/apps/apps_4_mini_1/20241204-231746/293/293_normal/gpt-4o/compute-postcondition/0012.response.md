The value of `current_node` is updated to `2 * current_node + 2`. Given that `current_node` is initially 0, the new value will be `2 * 0 + 2 = 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is between 1 and 50 inclusive, `n` is between 1 and 2^h inclusive, `total_leaves` is 2^h, `visited_count` is 1, `path` is a binary string of length h, `current_level` is 0, `current_node` is now 2, and `direction` is not equal to '0'.
