The value of `n` is divided by 2 using floor division. Since `n` is greater than 1, the new value of `n` will be either an integer greater than or equal to 1 depending on its previous value. The values of `h` and `ans` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50; `n` is now equal to its previous value divided by 2; if `n` was even, then `ans` is equal to the original `n // 2 - 1`; if `n` was odd, then `ans` is equal to the original `n // 2`.

Output State: **`h` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50; `n` is now equal to its previous value divided by 2; `ans` is equal to `n // 2 - 1` if `n` was even, or `ans` is equal to `n // 2` if `n` was odd.**
