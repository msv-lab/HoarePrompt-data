The value of `ans` is incremented by `n // 2`. Given that `n` is an odd integer greater than 1, `n // 2` will yield an integer value that is one less than half of `n`. Since `ans` starts at 0, the new value of `ans` will be equal to `n // 2`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`h` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50; `n` must be greater than 1 and is an odd integer; `ans` is equal to `n // 2**.
