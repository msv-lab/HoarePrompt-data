The variable `file` is a string containing at least two parts separated by a space. When executing the code `name, type_ = file.split()`, the string `file` is split into two parts: `name` and `type_`. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is outside the scope of this operation. The variables `files`, `examples`, and `regulars` also remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is a list containing at least 1 tuple, `examples` is an empty list, `regulars` is an empty list, `name` and `type_` are obtained from splitting the string `file` into two parts.**
