The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `temp_counter` was less than or equal to `2 * n - 1`, so after the increment, `temp_counter` will still be less than or equal to `2 * n`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, and `temp_counter` is now one greater than its previous value.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, `temp_counter` is one greater than its previous value.**
