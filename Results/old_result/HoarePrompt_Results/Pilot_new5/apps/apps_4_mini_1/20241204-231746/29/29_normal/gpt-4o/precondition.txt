n is a positive integer representing the number of test files (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and files is a list of tuples where each tuple consists of a string (the filename) and an integer (0 or 1) indicating if the file contains a regular test (0) or an example test (1). The filenames are distinct and consist of digits and small English letters, with lengths between 1 to 6 characters.
