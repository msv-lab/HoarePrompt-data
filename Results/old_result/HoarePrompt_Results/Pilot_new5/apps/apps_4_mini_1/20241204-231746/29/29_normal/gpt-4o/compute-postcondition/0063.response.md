`temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Given that it was initially greater than `2 * n`, after the increment it will still be greater than `2 * n` (specifically, it will be `temp_counter + 1`). The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, `n` is a positive integer, `examples[i]` is equal to `str(temp_counter)`, and `temp_counter` is now `temp_counter + 1`.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, `n` is a positive integer, `examples[i]` is equal to `str(temp_counter)`, `temp_counter` is now `temp_counter + 1`.**
