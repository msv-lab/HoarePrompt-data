The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Given the initial state, `temp_counter` was already less than or equal to `2 * n`, and after the increment, it will still be within the valid range as long as it was not equal to `2 * n`. The string representation of the new value of `temp_counter` must still remain in `files_set`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `temp_counter` is a value greater than or equal to `1` and less than or equal to `2 * n + 1`, and str(`temp_counter`) remains in `files_set`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `temp_counter` is a value greater than or equal to `1` and less than or equal to `2 * n + 1`, and str(`temp_counter`) remains in `files_set`.**
