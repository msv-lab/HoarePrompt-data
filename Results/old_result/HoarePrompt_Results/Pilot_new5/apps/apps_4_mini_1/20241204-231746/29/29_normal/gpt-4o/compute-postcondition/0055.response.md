The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Since `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`, this condition remains valid. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `temp_counter` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `2 * n`.**
