According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `files` list. If the list contains at least one more tuple, the loop will execute again for the next file. At the end of the last iteration, `files` contains at least 1 tuple. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the `files` list should contain at least 2 tuples, and the loop will proceed to the next tuple in the list.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is a list containing at least 2 tuples, `type_` will depend on the next file being processed, `examples` will be updated accordingly, and `regulars` may contain the value of `name` or remain an empty list, depending on `type_`.**
