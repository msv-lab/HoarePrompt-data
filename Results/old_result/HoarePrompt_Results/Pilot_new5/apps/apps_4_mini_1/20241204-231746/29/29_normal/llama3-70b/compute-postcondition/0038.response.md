The function `func` does not accept any parameters as indicated by its definition. The function processes a number of files, with `n` being a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) that represents the number of files. Each file description consists of a string `filename` (with a length of 1 to 6 characters) and a type (either "0" for regular test or "1" for example test), ensuring that all filenames are distinct.

Since there is no direct input to the function in the form of parameters, the function operates internally based on the described constraints. The output of the function is not specified in the provided information, so we cannot determine the specific return value.

Functionality: **The function processes a number of files based on specified constraints without accepting any parameters, and the return value is not defined in the provided information.**
