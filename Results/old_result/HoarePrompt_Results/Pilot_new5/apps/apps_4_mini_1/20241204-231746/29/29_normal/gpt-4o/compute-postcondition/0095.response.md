The code appends a formatted string to the `moves` list. The string is constructed using the value of `regulars[i]` and the value of `temp_counter`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. The initial state indicates that `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, and `n` is a positive integer. Therefore, the states of the other variables remain the same, but the `moves` list will now contain an additional entry.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, `n` is a positive integer, `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, and `moves` has a new entry 'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}'.**
