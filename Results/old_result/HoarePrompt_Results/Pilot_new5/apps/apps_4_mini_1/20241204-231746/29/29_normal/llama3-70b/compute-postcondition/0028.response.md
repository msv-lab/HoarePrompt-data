The `script` list is modified by appending a new formatted string `f'move {file} {i}'`. The variable `file` is the third element in `regular`, and `i` is defined as `len(examples) + 3`. Since the values of `file` and `i` depend on the existing state, we will include them in the output state. The other variables retain their values since they are unaffected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `files` is a list sorted by the second item of each tuple in descending order, `examples` is a list derived from `files`, `regular` must have at least 3 elements, `i` is len(examples) + 3, `file` is the third element in `regular`, and `script` now includes the string `move {file} {i}` appended to it.**
