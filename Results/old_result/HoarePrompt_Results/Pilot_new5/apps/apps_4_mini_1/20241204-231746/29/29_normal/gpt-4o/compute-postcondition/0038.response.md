According to the code, the loop will execute again for the next index `i`, which will be the current value of `i` plus one. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is currently at an index that corresponds to the length of the `examples` list minus one (since `i` starts from 0). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Since `examples` must have at least one name (as stated), the new value of `i` will therefore be `len(examples)`, which means it indicates that the loop has finished the current range.

Thus, the `examples` list must still contain at least as many names as it did at the end of the previous iteration, and since `temp_counter` is defined as being the smallest integer greater than `2 * n` plus 1 that was previously in `files_set`, it remains unchanged as no modifications happen to `temp_counter`, `moves`, or `examples[i]` if `examples[i]` equals `str(i + 1)`.

The loop will not execute again if we are already at the last index of `examples`, hence `i` being `len(examples)` means that `examples[i]` is not valid anymore for the next iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is a list of tuples containing filenames and types, `examples` is a list containing at least 1 name of files of type '1', `regulars` is a list containing the names of files of types other than '1', `moves` contains the entry `f'move {examples[len(examples) - 1]} {temp_counter}'`, and includes `move {examples[len(examples) - 1]} {len(examples)}` if `examples[len(examples) - 1]` is not equal to `str(len(examples))`, `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`**
