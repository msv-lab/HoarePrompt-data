The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The initial state indicates that `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`, and since `temp_counter` was less than or equal to `2 * n`, it will now be one unit higher. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `files` is a list of tuples containing filenames and types; `examples` is a list containing at least 1 name of files of type '1'; `regulars` is a list containing the names of files of types other than '1'; `moves` contains the entry `f'move {examples[len(examples) - 1]} {temp_counter}'`; `temp_counter` is incremented by 1.**
