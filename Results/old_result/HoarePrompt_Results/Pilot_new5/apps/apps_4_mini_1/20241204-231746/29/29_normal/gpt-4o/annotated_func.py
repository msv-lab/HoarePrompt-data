    return moves
    #The program returns the list of all move operations performed, as all regulars have been updated to their final target positions and no additional moves are necessary.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of tuples `files`, where each tuple contains a filename and its type. It separates the filenames into two lists: examples (type '1') and regulars (other types). It then generates a list of move operations that update the filenames based on certain conditions, ensuring that the example files are indexed correctly and that regular files are also moved to their appropriate target positions. The function returns the complete list of move operations performed. However, it does not handle cases where the filenames are incorrectly formatted or where the input does not meet the expected structure, which could lead to runtime errors.
