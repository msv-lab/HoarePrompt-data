The `moves` list is updated to include a new string formatted with the current values of `examples[i]` and `temp_counter`. Since no specific values are provided for `examples[i]` and `temp_counter`, we can only mention that `moves` is appended with this new formatted string. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, indicating that the loop has finished executing and `n` remains a positive integer; `moves` now includes a new entry: `move {examples[i]} {temp_counter}`.**
