The values of `name` and `type_` are assigned the values from the split input. The specific values of `name` and `type_` are not known because they depend on user input. `n` remains a positive integer within the range of 1 to 10^5, and `files` is unaffected by this code. The loop condition does not impact because it is dependent on `n`, which remains the same.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `files` is a list containing the previous elements and the new tuple (name, int(type_)), `name` is an input string, `type_` is an input string.**
