The variable `file` is expected to be a string that contains at least one space, allowing it to be split into two components: `name` and `type_`. After executing the code, `name` will contain the first part of the string and `type_` will contain the second part. The initial conditions of `n`, `files`, `examples`, and `regulars` remain unchanged, but the specific values of `name` and `type_` will be determined by the contents of `file`.

Thus, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is a list containing at least 2 tuples, `name` is the first part of `file` after the split, `type_` is the second part of `file` after the split, `examples` will be updated accordingly, and `regulars` may contain the value of `name` or remain an empty list depending on `type_`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is a list containing at least 2 tuples, `name` is the first part of the split `file`, `type_` is the second part of the split `file`, `examples` will be updated accordingly, and `regulars` may contain the value of `name` or remain an empty list depending on `type_`.**
