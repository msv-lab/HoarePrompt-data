Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n + 1`, `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, `files` is a list of tuples containing filenames and types, `examples` now includes `examples[i]` as `str(temp_counter)`, `regulars` is a list containing the names of files of types other than '1', `moves` contains the previous entries and now includes `f'move {examples[i]} {temp_counter + 1}'` if `examples[i]` is not equal to `str(i + 1)`; otherwise, `moves` remains unchanged.***
