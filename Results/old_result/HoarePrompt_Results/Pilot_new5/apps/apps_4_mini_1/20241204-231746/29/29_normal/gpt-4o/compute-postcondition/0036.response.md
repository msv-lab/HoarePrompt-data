The code appends a new move command to the `moves` list. The command is constructed using the value of `examples[i]` and `i + 1`. The other variables remain unaffected in terms of their values. 

1. The variable `moves` will now include an additional entry: `f'move {examples[i]} {i + 1}'`.
2. The variables `n`, `files`, `examples`, `regulars`, `temp_counter`, and `files_set` retain their previous state since they are not modified by the code.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is a list of tuples containing filenames and types, `examples` is a list containing at least 1 name of files of type '1', `regulars` is a list containing the names of files of types other than '1', `moves` contains the entry `f'move {examples[i]} {temp_counter}'` along with the newly appended entry `move {examples[i]} {i + 1}`, `examples[i]` is now `str(temp_counter)`, `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, and `temp_counter` is the smallest integer greater than `2 * n` plus 1 that was present in `files_set`, and `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is a list of tuples containing filenames and types, `examples` is a list containing at least 1 name of files of type '1', `regulars` is a list containing the names of files of types other than '1', `moves` contains the entry `f'move {examples[i]} {temp_counter}'` and now includes `move {examples[i]} {i + 1}`, `examples[i]` is now `str(temp_counter)`, `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, and `temp_counter` is the smallest integer greater than `2 * n` plus 1 that was present in `files_set`, and `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`.**
