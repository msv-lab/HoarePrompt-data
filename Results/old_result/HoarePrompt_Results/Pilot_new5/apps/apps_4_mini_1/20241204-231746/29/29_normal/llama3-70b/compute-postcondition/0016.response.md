According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `examples` list. The `enumerate` function will start iterating over `examples` at index 1. For the loop to execute, the `examples` list must contain at least one element. 

Given that `examples` is derived from the `files` list, we can infer that there must be at least one tuple in `files` where the second item is 1. Additionally, the variable `i` will start at 1 and represent the current index of the loop.

Therefore, for the loop to be executed, the following conditions must be met: `examples` must contain at least 1 element, `i` starts at 1, and `file` is the first item in the `examples` list.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5); `files` is a list sorted by the second item of each tuple in descending order; `examples` is a list of the first items of the tuples in `files` that must have at least 1 element; `script` is an empty list; `i` is 1; `file` is the first item in `examples`**.
