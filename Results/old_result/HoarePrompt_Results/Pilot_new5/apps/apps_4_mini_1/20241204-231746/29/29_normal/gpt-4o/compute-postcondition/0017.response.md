The variable `name` is assigned the first element of the tuple `file`, and this value is being appended to the list `regulars`. The previous values of `n`, `files`, and `file` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is a list containing at least 2 tuples, `file` is the next tuple in the list, `name` is the first element of `file`, `regulars` now includes `name`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is a list containing at least 2 tuples, `file` is the next tuple in the list, `name` is the first element of `file`, `regulars` now includes `name`.**
