Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, `regulars[i]` is equal to `str(temp_counter)`, and the current value of `regulars[i]` is not equal to `str(target)`. Additionally, `moves` has a new entry 'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter + 1}'.***
