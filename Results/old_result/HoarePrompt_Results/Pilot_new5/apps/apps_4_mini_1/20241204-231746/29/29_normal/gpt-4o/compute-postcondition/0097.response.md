The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Given that `temp_counter` is initially greater than `2 * n`, it will still remain greater than `2 * n` after the increment. The other variables remain unaffected, but the new value of `temp_counter` will be `temp_counter + 1`. The state of `regulars[i]`, which is `str(temp_counter)`, will also change since `temp_counter` has increased, thus affecting its string representation.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, `n` is a positive integer, `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, `moves` has a new entry 'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}', `regulars[i]` is `str(temp_counter + 1)`**
