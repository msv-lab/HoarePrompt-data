According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `temp_counter` and `n`. The loop will continue executing as long as `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`. At the end of the last iteration, `temp_counter` was increased by 1, meaning it is now equal to its previous value plus 1.

Given that `n` must be at least `(temp_counter + 1) / 2`, we need to ensure that `2 * n` is at least equal to `temp_counter + 1`. This means we need `n` to be at least `(temp_counter + 1) / 2`. 

In addition, since `str(temp_counter)` must also be in `files_set`, and `temp_counter` has just been incremented, we need `str(temp_counter)` to still be present in `files_set`. Therefore, we can deduce that `temp_counter` could be equal to 1 or 2 based on the increment, so it should be checked accordingly.

For the loop to execute one more time:
1. `n` must remain at least `(temp_counter + 1) / 2`, which translates to `n` being at least 1.
2. `str(temp_counter)` must still be in `files_set`, which means `str(temp_counter + 1)` should also be checked for presence in `files_set` in the case of the next iteration.

State: **`n` must be at least `(temp_counter + 1) / 2` and `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`**
