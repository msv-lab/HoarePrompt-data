The value of `low` is updated to be `mid + 1`. Given that `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, the new value of `low` will be greater than the previous value of `mid`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected, but we can infer that `low` is now greater than its previous value and must still be less than `high`.

Output State: **`low` is now equal to `mid + 1`, `high` is unchanged, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`.**
