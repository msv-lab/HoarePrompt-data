According to the code, the `while True` loop will execute indefinitely as it has no exit condition. Therefore, it will always execute at least once regardless of the values of `n`, `a`, or `b`. Since there are no conditions that need to be satisfied for the loop to execute, the program state can remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`, `a` is an integer between 1 and 100, `b` is an integer between 1 and 100; `x` is the minimum of `n`, `a`, and `b`.**
