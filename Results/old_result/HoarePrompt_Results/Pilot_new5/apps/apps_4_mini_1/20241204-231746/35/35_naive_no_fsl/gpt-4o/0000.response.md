To analyze the correctness of the provided program, let's break down the requirements and the implementation step by step.

### Problem Requirements:
1. We have `n` plates and two cakes split into `a` and `b` pieces respectively.
2. Each piece must be placed on a plate.
3. Each plate must have at least one piece.
4. No plate can contain pieces from both cakes.
5. We want to maximize the minimum number of pieces on any plate (denote this as `x`).

### Analysis of the Provided Code:
1. The function `func_1(n, a, b)` tries to find the maximum `x` using a binary search approach.
2. The search space for `x` is between `1` and `min(a, b) + 1`.
3. The helper function `can_distribute(x)` checks if `x` pieces can be allocated to the plates such that:
   - The total pieces from both cakes distributed on plates is at least `n * x`.
   - This is determined by checking if the number of plates we can fill from each cake (`a // x` and `b // x`) is enough to cover `n`.

### Potential Edge Cases and Issues:
The main issue with the code is that the function does not correctly account for ensuring that all plates have a piece of cake from either of the cakes without running into the limit of pieces. 

#### Counter Example:
Consider the input: 
```
5 2 3
```
- Here, we have 2 pieces from cake 1 and 3 pieces from cake 2.
- The only way to distribute the pieces satisfying the conditions is giving one plate 1 piece from each cake. 

However, the logic in `can_distribute()` has an oversight:
- It calculates `a // x + b // x` which gives the total number of plates we can fill but does not ensure that we can fill `n` plates without exceeding the number of pieces of cake available.

For `x = 2`, we would want to check:
- From cake 1 (`2 // 2 = 1`): 1 plate can be filled.
- From cake 2 (`3 // 2 = 1`): 1 plate can be filled.
- This results in a total of only 2 plates being filled, which is not enough for 5 plates.

Thus, the condition fails, and checking if `low` is ever updated correctly based on this logic leads to discrepancies in the binary search.

### Conclusion:
The provided implementation does not handle all potential cases correctly, particularly in ensuring that both conditions for filling the plates are satisfied simultaneously. Therefore, the program is deemed incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
