Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer representing the number of plates (2 ≤ n ≤ a + b), `a` is an integer representing the number of pieces of the first cake (1 ≤ a ≤ 100), `b` is an integer representing the number of pieces of the second cake (1 ≤ b ≤ 100), `low` is 1, `high` is `min(a, b) + 1`, `mid` is `(min(a, b) + 2) // 2`, and the function `can_distribute(mid)` returns false.***
