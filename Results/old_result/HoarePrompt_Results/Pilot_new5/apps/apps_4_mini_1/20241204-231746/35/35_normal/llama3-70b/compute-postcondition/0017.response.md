The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly as per its definition; however, it operates on the parameters `n`, `a`, and `b` based on the given constraints. The constraints state that `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\), where `a` and `b` are also integers constrained by \(1 \leq a, b \leq 100\). Since the output is not specified in the provided details, we cannot determine the return value. Therefore, the functionality of the function can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function operates with the parameters n, a, and b, where n is an integer constrained between 2 and a + b, while a and b are integers constrained between 1 and 100. The function's specific return value is not provided.**
