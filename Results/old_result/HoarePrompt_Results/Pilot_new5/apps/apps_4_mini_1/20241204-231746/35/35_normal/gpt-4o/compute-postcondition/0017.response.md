Postcondition: ***`low` is less than `high`; if `can_distribute(mid)` is true, then `low` is greater than or equal to `(low + high) // 2 + 1`, `high` remains unchanged, and `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2` before the increment. Otherwise, `low` remains less than `high`, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, and `high` is updated to `(low + high) // 2`.***
