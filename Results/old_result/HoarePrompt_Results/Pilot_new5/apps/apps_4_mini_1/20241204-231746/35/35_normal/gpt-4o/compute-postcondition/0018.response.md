Output State: **`low` is equal to `high`, `n`, `a`, `b` are integers where `2 ≤ n ≤ a + b`, `1 ≤ a ≤ 100`, and `1 ≤ b ≤ 100`. The final value of `mid` is the largest integer for which `can_distribute(mid)` returned true, and `high` is `min(a, b) + 1` initially. If the loop executed, `low` must have been initially less than `high`, and `can_distribute(mid)` will have been evaluated multiple times, resulting in the adjustments of `low` and `high` to reach equality.**
