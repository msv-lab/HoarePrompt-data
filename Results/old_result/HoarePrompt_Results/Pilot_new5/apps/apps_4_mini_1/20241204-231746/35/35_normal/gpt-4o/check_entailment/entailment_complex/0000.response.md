To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze the logic of the two functions `func_1` and `can_distribute`, and ensure they align with the problem description and the test cases.

1. **Problem Description**:
   - We need to distribute pieces of two cakes across `n` plates.
   - Each plate must contain at least one piece of cake.
   - No plate can contain pieces from both cakes.
   - Our goal is to maximize the minimum number of pieces on any plate.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(n, a, b)`**:
     - This function aims to perform a binary search to find the maximum number of pieces, `x`, that can be placed on each plate.
     - It initializes `low` to 1 and `high` to `min(a, b) + 1`, which is appropriate since each plate must have at least one piece, and cannot have more pieces than the smaller cake.
     - The loop continues until `low` is no longer less than `high`, adjusting `low` and `high` based on whether `can_distribute(mid)` is true or not.
     - Finally, it returns `low - 1`.
   
   - **`can_distribute(x)`**:
     - This function checks if it's possible to fill at least `n` plates with `x` pieces on each.
     - It calculates the total number of plates that can be filled from both cakes as `a // x + b // x` and checks if this is at least `n`.
     - This logic seems valid as it ensures that enough plates can be filled with the given constraints.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not explicitly handle cases where `n` exceeds the total number of pieces, i.e., when `n > a + b`. However, the constraint `2 ≤ n ≤ a + b` in the problem description seems to guarantee that `n` will always be a valid input.
   - The code assumes `x` can be any number starting from 1, but if either `a` or `b` is less than `n`, it can lead to situations where not all plates can be filled. For example, if `a = 1`, `b = 1`, and `n = 3`, it would return 0, which is invalid because it cannot satisfy the requirement of at least one piece per plate.

4. **Example Consideration**:
   - For input `5 2 3`, the output is `1`. This is correct because we can place 1 piece from each cake on 5 plates (2 from cake 1 and 3 from cake 2).
   - For input `4 7 10`, the output is `3`. This output is achievable because we can distribute the pieces effectively among the plates.
   - However, if we think about the edge case where both cakes have fewer pieces than the number of plates, the program does not correctly enforce the rule that each plate must have at least one piece. 

Based on the analysis, the program does not handle all potential cases, particularly where the number of plates exceeds the available pieces. Therefore, the output for such cases can be incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
