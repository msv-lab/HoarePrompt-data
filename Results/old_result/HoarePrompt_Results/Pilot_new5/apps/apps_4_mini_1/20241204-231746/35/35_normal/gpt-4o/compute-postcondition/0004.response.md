The value of `low` is assigned the value of `mid + 1`. The previous value of `mid` is `(min(a, b) + 2) // 2`. Since there are no specific constraints on the values of `a` and `b` given, we can only indicate that `low` has been updated. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of plates (2 ≤ n ≤ a + b), `a` is an integer representing the number of pieces of the first cake (1 ≤ a ≤ 100), `b` is an integer representing the number of pieces of the second cake (1 ≤ b ≤ 100), `low` is updated to `mid + 1`, `high` is `min(a, b) + 1`, `mid` is `(min(a, b) + 2) // 2`, and the function `can_distribute(mid)` returns true.**
