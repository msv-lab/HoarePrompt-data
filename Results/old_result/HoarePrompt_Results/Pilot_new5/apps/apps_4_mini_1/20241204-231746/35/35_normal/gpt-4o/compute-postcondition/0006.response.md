The value of `high` is assigned the value of `mid`. The variable `mid` is calculated as `(min(a, b) + 2) // 2`. Since `can_distribute(mid)` returns false, it indicates that the distribution of pieces is not possible at this `mid` value. However, the value of `low` remains unchanged, and the other variables are not affected. The final value of `high` will be equal to `mid`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of plates (2 ≤ n ≤ a + b), `a` is an integer representing the number of pieces of the first cake (1 ≤ a ≤ 100), `b` is an integer representing the number of pieces of the second cake (1 ≤ b ≤ 100), `low` is 1, `high` is `(min(a, b) + 2) // 2`, `mid` is `(min(a, b) + 2) // 2`, and `can_distribute(mid)` returns false.**
