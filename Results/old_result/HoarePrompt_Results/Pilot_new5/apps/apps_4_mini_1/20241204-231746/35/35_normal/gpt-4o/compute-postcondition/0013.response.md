According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `low` and `high`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `low` is less than `high`. At the end of the last iteration, it is stated that `low` is less than `high`, which means the loop can execute again without any modifications to the state. 

Thus, there is no need to adjust the variables `low` and `high` for the loop to proceed.

State: **`low` is less than `high`**
