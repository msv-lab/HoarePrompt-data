The value of `x` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `x` will now hold an integer provided by the user. Since there are no other variables affected, the output state reflects that `x` now contains an input integer within the specified range.

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that -10^18 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, representing the camera angle in degrees, where positive values denote clockwise rotations and negative values denote counter-clockwise rotations; `x` is an input integer.**
