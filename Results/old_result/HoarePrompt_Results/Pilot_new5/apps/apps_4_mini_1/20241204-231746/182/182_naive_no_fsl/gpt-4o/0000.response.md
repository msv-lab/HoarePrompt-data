To analyze the provided program, we need to understand how it processes the input angle and calculates the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns required to minimize the deviation from vertical.

### Breakdown of the Program:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads an integer `x`, which represents the camera rotation angle.

2. **Normalization of the Angle**:
   - `normalized_angle = x % 360` effectively bounds the angle to the range of [0, 360) degrees. This step is necessary because angles are cyclical.

3. **Calculation of Required Turns**:
   - `turns = (360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4`:
     - This line calculates the number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed to correct the rotation.
     - The expression `(360 - normalized_angle)` effectively gives the angle we need to rotate clockwise to return to the "up" position.
     - Dividing by 90 gives the number of 90-degree rotations required.
     - The `% 4` ensures that the result is within the range [0, 3], which corresponds to the four possible 90-degree turns.

### Testing Cases:

Let's examine the example cases provided in the prompt:

1. **Example Input: `60`**
   - Normalized angle: `60 % 360` = `60`
   - Required turns: `(360 - 60) // 90 % 4` = `300 // 90 % 4` = `3`
   - This output is incorrect according to the description, which states the output should be `1`.

2. **Example Input: `-60`**
   - Normalized angle: `-60 % 360` = `300`
   - Required turns: `(360 - 300) // 90 % 4` = `60 // 90 % 4` = `0`
   - This output is again incorrect according to the description, which states the output should be `3`.

### Conclusion:

The program fails for both example cases. 

- For an input of `60`, it should output `1`, but it outputs `3`.
- For an input of `-60`, it should output `3`, but it outputs `0`.

Thus, since the program does not yield the correct output for the specified examples in the problem description, the conclusion is:

Correctness: **False**
