The provided program does not fully implement the requirements set forth in the problem description.

### Issues:
1. **Normalization of the Angle**: The program normalizes the angle `x` to the range of [0, 360) using `x % 360`, which is not appropriate when `x` is negative. The problem description states that negative angles denote counter-clockwise rotations, and the program should consider these angles correctly.
  
2. **Calculation of 90-degree Turns**: The program uses the following calculation to determine the number of 90-degree clockwise turns:
   ```python
   print((x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4)
   ```
   This does not correctly account for counter-clockwise rotations and does not follow the requirement to minimize the number of clockwise turns. The formula fails to handle angles adequately, especially for cases where the angle is negative.

3. **Output for Angles Equal to 0**: If the input angle is exactly 0, the program correctly outputs 0, which is fine, but does not handle the necessary logic for determining the number of turns based on the absolute value of the angle when it's negative.

### Example Cases:
- For an input of `-60`, the expected output is `3` (as described), but the current implementation will calculate `(300 + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4`, which does not yield the correct result.
  
- For positive angles, such as `60`, the program may give the correct result, but it fails to accommodate the negative angles properly.

### Conclusion:
The program does not account for both positive and negative angles as required, nor does it correctly handle the minimization of clockwise turns based on the camera's angle. 

Thus, the program does not meet the problem description as expected.

Correctness: **False**
