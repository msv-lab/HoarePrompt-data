The function accepts an integer input `x`, which represents a camera angle in degrees. It normalizes `x` to the range of [0, 360) by using `x % 360`. If `x` is 0, it prints 0. Otherwise, it calculates and prints the equivalent direction as an integer in the set {0, 1, 2, 3}, based on the normalized value of `x`. This integer corresponds to the 90-degree rotation segment that the angle falls into, where 0 is north, 1 is east, 2 is south, and 3 is west. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results.
