The variable `target_sofa` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The initial state indicates that `i` is `previous_i + 1`, so we can express `target_sofa` as `previous_i + 1 + 1`, which simplifies to `previous_i + 2`. The values of `right_count`, `left_count`, `bottom_count`, and `top_count` remain unchanged, and `d` is still greater than `i + 1`, which means `d` is greater than `previous_i + 2`.

Output State: **`right_count` remains unchanged, `left_count` remains unchanged, `bottom_count` remains unchanged, `top_count` remains unchanged, `i` is `previous_i + 1`, `target_sofa` is `previous_i + 2`, and `d` is greater than `previous_i + 2.**
