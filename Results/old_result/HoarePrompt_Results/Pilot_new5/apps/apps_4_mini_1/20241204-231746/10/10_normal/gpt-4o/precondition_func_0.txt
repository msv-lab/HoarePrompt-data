d is an integer representing the number of sofas, where 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5; n and m are integers representing the dimensions of the storehouse, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5; each of the next d lines contains four integers (x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2) representing the coordinates of the sofas, and the last line contains four integers (cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b), where 0 ≤ cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b ≤ d - 1.
