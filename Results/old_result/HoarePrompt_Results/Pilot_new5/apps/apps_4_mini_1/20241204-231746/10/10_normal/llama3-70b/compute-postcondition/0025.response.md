Postcondition: ***`sofa` is a 2D list of integers representing the coordinates of the sofas with at least 2 sofas. If `s` is not equal to `sofa`, and the x-coordinate of the first sofa is less than that of the second sofa while their y-coordinates are the same, then `top` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, all values of `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom` remain unchanged.***
