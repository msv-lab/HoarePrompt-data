According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `sofas` variable. For the loop to execute, `sofas` must be a non-empty 2D list. Additionally, since `s` will take each sofa from the list, it is necessary to acknowledge the first sofa's coordinates when the loop starts. Therefore, we need to ensure that `sofas` has at least one entry. 

State: **`sofa` is a 2D list of integers representing the coordinates of the sofas that must have at least 1 sofa, `s` is the first sofa in the list (sofa[0]), `d` is greater than or equal to 1**
