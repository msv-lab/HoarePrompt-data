Postcondition: ***`sofa` is a 2D list of integers representing the coordinates of the sofas with at least 1 sofa, `s` is the first sofa in the list (`sofa[0]`), and `d` is greater than or equal to 1. If `s` is not equal to `sofa`, and if the first coordinate of `sofa[0]` is equal to the first coordinate of `s` while the second coordinate of `sofa[0]` is greater than that of `s`, then `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom` are each incremented by 1. If `s` is equal to `sofa`, `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom` remain unchanged.***
