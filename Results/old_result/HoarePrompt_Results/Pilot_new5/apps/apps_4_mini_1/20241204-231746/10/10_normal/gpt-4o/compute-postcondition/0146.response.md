Postcondition: ***If `y1` is less than `y1_j` and `y2` is less than `y1_j`, then `bottom_count[i]` is increased by 1, given that `y1` is greater than `y2_j`, `y2` is greater than `y2_j`, `y1` is less than `y1_j`, `y2` is less than `y1_j`, `x1` is greater than `x2_j`, `x2` is greater than `x2_j`, and `d` is greater than 1. There is no else part for this condition.***
