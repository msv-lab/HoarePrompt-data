#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `d` representing the number of sofas, along with the dimensions of the storehouse (`n` and `m`), and the coordinates of each sofa (`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`). It computes the counts of sofas in four directions (left, right, top, bottom) for each sofa and checks for the first sofa that matches the specified counts (`cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b`). If such a sofa exists, it returns its 1-based index; otherwise, it returns -1. The function does not handle invalid inputs and assumes that the input will always conform to the specified constraints.
