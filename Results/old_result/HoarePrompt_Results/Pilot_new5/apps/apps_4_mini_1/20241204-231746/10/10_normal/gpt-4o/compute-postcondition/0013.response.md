The values for `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are assigned from the input, which accepts a space-separated string and converts it to integers using the `map(int, ...)` function. The other variables remain unchanged as this operation only affects `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b`.

Output State: **`d` is an integer representing the number of sofas; `n` is an integer; `m` is an integer; `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples of integers; `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b` are assigned values from input as integers.**
