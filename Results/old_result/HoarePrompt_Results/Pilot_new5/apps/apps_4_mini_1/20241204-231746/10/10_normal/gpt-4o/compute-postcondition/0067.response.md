Postcondition: ***`right_count[i]` is the number of sofas to the right of the sofa at index `i`, `left_count[i]` is the number of sofas to the left, `bottom_count[i]` is the number of sofas below, `top_count[i]` is the number of sofas above, `d` is greater than 0 and greater than `i + 1`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are assigned values from `sofas[i]`, and `j` is 0. If `i` equals `j`, the current iteration of the loop is skipped.***
