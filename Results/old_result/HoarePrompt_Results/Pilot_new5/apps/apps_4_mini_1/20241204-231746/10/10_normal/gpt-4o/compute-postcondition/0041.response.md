The value of `right_count[i]` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is 0, which means that the count at index 0 of `right_count` is increased by 1. The values of `d`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `d` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, and `right_count[0]` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`d` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `x1, y1, x2, y2` are assigned the values from `sofas[0]`, `x1_j, y1_j, x2_j, y2_j` are assigned the values from `sofas[j]`, and `right_count[0]` is increased by 1.**
