The `sofas` list is updated by appending a new tuple `(x1, y1, x2, y2)` to it. The initial state indicates that `sofas` previously contained some tuples, and now it will contain all the previous tuples plus the new one. The values of `d`, `n`, and `m` remain unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`d` must be greater than or equal to 3; `n` is an integer; `m` is an integer; `sofas` is a list containing the previous tuples plus the additional tuple `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`**
