The values of the variables do not change but we skip the current iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1 and we skip the current iteration of the loop.  
Output State: **`d` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1 and we skip the current iteration of the loop.**
