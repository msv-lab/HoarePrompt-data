Postcondition: ***`sofa` is a 2D list of integers representing the coordinates of the sofas with at least 1 sofa, `s` is the first sofa in the list (`sofa[0]`), `d` is greater than or equal to 1, and the current value of `s` is not equal to the first sofa in `sofa`. If the first coordinate of `sofa[0]` is greater than that of `s` and the second coordinate of `sofa[0]` is equal to the second coordinate of `s`, then `left` and `right` are both incremented by 1. Otherwise, `left` remains unchanged and `right` does not change, retaining their previous values.***
