The `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the remaining code inside the loop for the current iteration and continue with the next iteration. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected, and we are simply moving to the next iteration of the loop. 

Output State: **`d` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1, y1, x2, y2` are assigned the values from `sofas[0]`, and the current value of `i` equals `j`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
