Postcondition: ***`sofa` is a 2D list of integers representing the coordinates of the sofas with at least 1 sofa, `s` is the first sofa in the list (`sofa[0]`), `d` is greater than or equal to 1. If the first coordinate of `sofa[0]` is equal to the first coordinate of `s` and the second coordinate of `sofa[0]` is less than that of `s`, then `left` is incremented by 1, `right` is incremented by 1, and `top` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `left`, `right`, and `top` retain their previous values.***
