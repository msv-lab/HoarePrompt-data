The statement `bottom_count[i] += 1` increments the value of `bottom_count[i]` by 1. The values of other variables, including `right_count[i]`, `left_count[i]`, `top_count[i]`, `d`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j`, remain unchanged as per the initial state description. 

Output State: **If `x1` is greater than `x2_j`, `x2` is greater than `x2_j`, `right_count[i]` is increased by 1, and `left_count[i]` has become `left_count[i] + 1`. The values of `bottom_count[i]` has increased by 1, `top_count[i]` remains unchanged. `d` remains greater than 0, `j` is 0, and the values for `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are unchanged. Additionally, `y1` is less than `y1_j` and `y2` is less than `y1_j`.**
