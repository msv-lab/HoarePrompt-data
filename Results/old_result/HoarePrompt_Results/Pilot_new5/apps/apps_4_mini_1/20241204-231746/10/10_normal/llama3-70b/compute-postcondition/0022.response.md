Postcondition: ***`sofa` is a 2D list of integers representing the coordinates of the sofas with at least 2 sofas, `s` is the second sofa in the list. If the x-coordinate of the first sofa is less than that of the second sofa and their y-coordinates are the same, `top` is incremented by 1, while `left`, `right`, and `bottom` remain unchanged. If the condition is not met, all values of `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom` remain unchanged.***
