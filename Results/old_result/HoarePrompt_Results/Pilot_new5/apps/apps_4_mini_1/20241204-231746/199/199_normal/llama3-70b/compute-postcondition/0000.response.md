The variable `ways` is initialized and assigned the value of `0`. The variable `n` remains unchanged, as it is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9; `ways` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9; `ways` is 0**.
