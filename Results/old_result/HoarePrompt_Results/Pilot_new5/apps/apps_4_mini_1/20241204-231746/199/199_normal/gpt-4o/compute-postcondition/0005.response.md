The value of `b` is assigned the value of `a`, which is currently 1. The states of the other variables (`n`, `count`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^9, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 6), `count` is 0, `a` is 1, and `b` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^9, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 6), `count` is 0, `a` is 1, `b` is 1**
