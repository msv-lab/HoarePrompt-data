To determine the correctness of the provided program, we will analyze its logic in relation to the problem description.

The problem requires us to find the number of ways to cut a stick of length `n` into four parts such that:
1. All parts have positive integer lengths.
2. The parts can form a rectangle but cannot form a square.

From the problem description, valid configurations for forming a rectangle (but not a square) require the lengths to be in pairs, such as {x, x, y, y} where x â‰  y.

The program implementation is as follows:

```python
n = int(input())
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(n):
    if n < 6:
        return 0
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n // 4 + 1):
        b = a
        rem = n - 2 * (a + b)
        if rem > 0 and rem % 2 == 0:
            if a != rem // 2:
                count += 1
    return count
```

### Analyzing the Code:

1. **Early Exit for Small Values**: The code correctly returns `0` for any stick length `n < 6`, as it is impossible to make four positive integer parts.

2. **Loop for Possible Values**: The loop iterates over `a`, which represents one of the lengths of the parts. The variable `b` is assigned the same value as `a`, which means we are considering pairs of the same length initially.

3. **Calculating Remaining Length**: The remaining length (`rem`) is calculated as `n - 2 * (a + b)`, which translates to `n - 4 * a` since `b` is initially set to `a`. This is valid for configurations where both pairs have the same length.

4. **Checking Conditions**: 
   - The condition `if rem > 0 and rem % 2 == 0:` checks if the remaining length is positive and even, which allows for a valid configuration of the other two lengths.
   - The check `if a != rem // 2:` ensures that the lengths do not all become equal (i.e., avoiding squares).

### Potential Issues:

The main problem arises during the iteration where `b` is fixed to be equal to `a`. The code only considers configurations of the form {a, a, y, y}. This means it does not explore combinations of distinct values where the two lengths could be different. The correct approach should allow for different pairs, such as {x, x, y, z} as long as they satisfy the rectangle condition.

### Testing an Input Case:

Consider `n = 10`:

- The program will iterate with `a = 1, 2, ...` 
- For `a = 1`: `rem = 10 - 4*1 = 6`, which is valid.
- For `a = 2`: `rem = 10 - 4*2 = 2`, which is valid.
- However, the program will not consider combinations like {1, 1, 4, 4} or {2, 2, 3, 3} as valid because it does not manipulate `b` independently from `a`.

Thus, it fails to count configurations that could yield valid rectangles, meaning it will undercount the number of valid cuts.

### Conclusion:

Since the program does not cover all potential valid configurations that can form rectangles while avoiding squares, I conclude:

Correctness: **False**.
