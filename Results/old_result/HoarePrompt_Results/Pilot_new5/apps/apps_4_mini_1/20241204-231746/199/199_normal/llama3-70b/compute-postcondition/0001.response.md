According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n // 2 + 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 2, because if `n` is 1, `n // 2 + 1` would equal 1 and the loop would not have any valid range to iterate over. 

At the end of the last iteration, the variable `ways` is 0, but this does not affect whether the loop can execute. 

Thus, for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2, and at the start of the loop, `a` should be 1 since that is the starting point of the range.

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `ways` is 0, `a` is 1**
