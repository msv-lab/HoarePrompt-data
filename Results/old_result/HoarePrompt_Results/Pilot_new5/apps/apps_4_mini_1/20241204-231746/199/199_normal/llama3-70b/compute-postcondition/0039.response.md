The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9. After executing the function body, it returns the count of valid pairs (a, b) such that 2 * (a + b) = n, where a and b are integers, and a is not equal to b. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a positive integer `n` and return the count of valid pairs (a, b) that satisfy the equation while ensuring a and b are distinct integers. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n and returns the count of valid pairs (a, b) such that 2 * (a + b) = n, where a and b are distinct integers.**
