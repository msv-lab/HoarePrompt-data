According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `a` from 1 up to `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 7, meaning that `n // 2` is at least 3. Since `a` is currently 1 and the last evaluated value of `b` is (n - 1) // 2, we need to determine the state for the next iteration.

If `a` was incremented by 1 in the last iteration, the next value of `a` will be 2. For the loop to execute again, `a` should remain less than or equal to `n // 2`. Given that `n` is at least 7, `n // 2` will be at least 3. Therefore, `a` can be incremented to 2, and `b` will still be calculated as (n - 1) // 2, which remains valid since `b` is dependent on `n` and will not change.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 7, `ways` is the count of valid pairs (a, b) such that 2 * (a + b) = n, `a` is 2, `b` is (n - 1) // 2**
