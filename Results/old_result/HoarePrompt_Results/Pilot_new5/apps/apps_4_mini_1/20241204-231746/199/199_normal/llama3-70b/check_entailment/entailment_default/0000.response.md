To determine the correctness of the provided program according to the problem description, we will evaluate both the code and the output hints.

**Program Analysis:**
In the given code, the function `func_1(n)` attempts to count the number of ways to split a stick of length `n` into four parts `(a, a, b, b)`, which can form a rectangle but not a square. The function iterates through possible values of `a` and `b` ensuring that:
1. Both `a` and `b` are positive integers.
2. The condition `2 * (a + b) == n` ensures that the total length is satisfied.
3. The condition `a != b` ensures that the rectangle formed is not a square.

**Output Hints Analysis:**
The output hints clarify that the function counts distinct pairs `(a, b)` where `a + b` equals `n / 2` (which corresponds to the total length being split into two pairs). It also emphasizes that both `a` and `b` should be less than or equal to `n/2`.

**Edge Case Consideration:**
1. **Minimum Length Stick (n = 4):** The smallest case where the stick can be divided into four parts is when `n = 4`. The only valid division would be `(1, 1, 1, 1)`, which is not allowed because it forms a square. The function should return `0`.
2. **Odd Lengths (e.g., n = 5):** For odd lengths, it is impossible to divide the stick into four equal positive integer parts, so the function should return `0`.
3. **Even Lengths Greater Than 4 (e.g., n = 6):** The only way to cut it is `(1, 1, 2, 2)`, which is valid. The function correctly returns `1`.
4. **Even Lengths Like n = 20:** As per the problem, it can return multiple pairs. The function correctly identifies `(1, 1, 9, 9)`, `(2, 2, 8, 8)`, `(3, 3, 7, 7)`, and `(4, 4, 6, 6)`.

**Conclusion:**
The output hints align with the code's logic, and no edge cases seem to be overlooked based on the provided input conditions. The code accurately captures all valid configurations as described. 

Thus, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**. 

The function correctly computes the number of ways to split the stick into four parts such that it forms a rectangle but not a square for all valid cases.
