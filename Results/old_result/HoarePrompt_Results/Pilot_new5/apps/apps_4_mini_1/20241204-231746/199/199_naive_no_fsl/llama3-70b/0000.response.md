Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The requirement is to find distinct ways to split the stick into four parts such that it's possible to form a rectangle but impossible to form a square.

### Problem with the Code:
1. **Logic for Rectangle Formation**: The code checks if `2 * (a + b) == n`, which corresponds to the condition that two pairs of lengths (a, a) and (b, b) can be formed to create a rectangle. However, this check is not sufficient because it doesn't consider the possibility of other valid pairs that can yield rectangles.
  
2. **Exclusion of Squares**: The implementation does not explicitly handle the scenario of excluding the case where all parts are equal (which would form a square). It only checks for the condition `a != b`, but it doesnâ€™t ensure that the found pairs (a, a) and (b, b) do not lead to a situation where they could form a square.

### Counterexample:
- For `n = 8`, the code would iterate through possible values for `a` and `b`:
  - When `a = 2` and `b = 2`, it will satisfy `2 * (2 + 2) = 8`. 
  - This configuration {2, 2, 2, 2} does not satisfy the requirement of being impossible to form a square, yet the current logic does not filter out this case correctly.

Thus, since the program does not correctly handle all edge cases described in the problem and does not ensure that square formations are excluded correctly, it fails to meet the requirements of the problem statement. Hence, the output should indicate that the program is incorrect.
