The value of `valid` is assigned `False`, which means it remains unchanged from its initial state. The states of the other variables, `n`, `t`, and `dir`, are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State will reflect the unchanged statuses of those variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50; `valid` is False; `t` is an input integer; `dir` is either 'West' or 'East'.**
