According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute `n` times, starting from 0 and going up to `n-1`. If `n` is greater than the current iteration count, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, we know that the loop has already executed once; hence, the current iteration count is 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), and must be greater than 1**
