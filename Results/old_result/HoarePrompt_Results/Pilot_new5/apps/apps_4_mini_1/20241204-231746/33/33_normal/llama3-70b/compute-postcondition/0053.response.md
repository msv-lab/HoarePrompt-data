Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `t` is an integer, `dir` is a string, and `curr_lat` remains within the valid latitude range; if `curr_lat` is less than -90 or greater than 90, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, `curr_lat` remains within the valid latitude range, and execution continues with the next iteration of the loop.***
