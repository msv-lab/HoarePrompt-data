The variable `valid` is assigned the value `False`, which is already its initial state. Therefore, the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The output state reflects that `valid` continues to be `False`, and no other variables have been affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `position` is either 0 or 20000, `valid` is set to False, `t` is an integer, `dir` is an input direction either 'West' or 'East'**
