The value of `t` is assigned the value of `int(t)`, which converts the input value of `t` into an integer. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. The value of `n` is still an integer between 1 and 50, `valid` remains False, and `dir` is either 'West' or 'East'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50; `valid` remains False; `t` is an input integer; `dir` is either 'West' or 'East'.**
