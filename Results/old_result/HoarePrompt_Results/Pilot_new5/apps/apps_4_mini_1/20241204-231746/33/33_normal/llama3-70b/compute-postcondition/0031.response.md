The `continue` statement does not change any variable values but causes the loop in which it is placed to skip the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. As there are no specific variable assignments or changes due to this statement, the values of `n`, `t`, and `dir` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and must be greater than 1; `t` is an input integer; `dir` is a string from input; we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
