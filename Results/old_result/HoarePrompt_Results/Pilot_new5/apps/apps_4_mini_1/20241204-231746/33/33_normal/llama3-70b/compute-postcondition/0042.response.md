Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and must be greater than 1; `t` is an input integer; `dir` is a string from input; if `curr_lat` is -90 and `dir` is not 'South', 'NO' is printed and the program execution is terminated. If `curr_lat` is within the valid latitude range, no action takes place and the program continues.***
