The value of `t` is converted to an integer using `int(t)`. The variable `t` was previously an input integer, but after this operation, it remains an integer with potentially the same value if it was already a valid integer input. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1; `t` is an integer; `dir` is an input string; `curr_lat` remains within the valid latitude range.**
