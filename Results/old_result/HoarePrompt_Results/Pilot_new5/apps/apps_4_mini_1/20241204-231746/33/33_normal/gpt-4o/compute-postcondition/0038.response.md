Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `position` is either 0 or 20000, `valid` is set to False, `t` is an integer, and `dir` is an input direction either 'West' or 'East'. If `position` is 0 or 20000, the program retains the given values of `n`, `position`, `valid`, `t`, and `dir`.***
