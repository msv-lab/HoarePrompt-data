The code snippet simply prints 'NO'. Given the initial state, we must consider the conditions provided. 

Since `curr_lat` is equal to -90 and `dir` is not 'North', the condition that leads to 'NO' being printed is satisfied. Therefore, the program will print 'NO', but it does not change any variable values or states. 

The output state reflects the unchanged conditions since the printing doesn't affect the numeric or string variables; it just indicates that the specific output is being generated due to the conditions.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and must be greater than 1; `t` is an input integer; `dir` is a string from input; `curr_lat` is -90; 'NO' is printed.**
