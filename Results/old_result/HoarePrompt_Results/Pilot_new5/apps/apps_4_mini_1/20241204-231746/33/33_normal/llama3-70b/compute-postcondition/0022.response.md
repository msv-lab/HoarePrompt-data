Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). If `curr_lat` is -90 and `dir` is not 'North', 'NO' is printed to the console and the program terminates. If `curr_lat` is within the valid range of -90 to 90 but not equal to -90, or if `curr_lat` is -90 and `dir` is 'North', the program continues to the next iteration of the nearest enclosing loop. The current value of `curr_lat` is 90 and `dir` is not 'South'.***
