Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `valid` remains False, `t` is an input integer, and `dir` is either 'West' or 'East'. If `dir` is 'South', then `position` remains unchanged if `position + t` exceeds 20000. If `dir` is 'West' or 'East', then the variables retain their values if `position` is 0 or 20000; otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
