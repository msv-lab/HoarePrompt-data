The function accepts a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), representing the number of directional movements. For each movement, it reads a non-negative integer `t_i` (1 ≤ t_i ≤ 10^6) and a direction (`dir_i`) which can be "North", "South", "West", or "East". The function adjusts the current latitude based on the direction and distance, ensuring that the latitude remains within the bounds of -90 to 90. If any movement results in an invalid latitude, or if the conditions for reaching latitudes -90 or 90 are not met with the appropriate direction, it prints 'NO' and exits. If the loop completes successfully and the latitude equals 90, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return a value but outputs results directly to the console.
