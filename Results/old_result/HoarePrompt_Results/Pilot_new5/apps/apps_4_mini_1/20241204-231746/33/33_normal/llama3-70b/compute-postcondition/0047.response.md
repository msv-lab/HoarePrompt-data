In the provided code snippet, `curr_lat` is adjusted by subtracting `t` divided by `111.195`. The initial state specifies that `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `t` is an integer, `dir` is an input string, and `curr_lat` is within the valid latitude range. Since `t` is an integer and `curr_lat` is currently valid, `curr_lat` will be altered, but no values of `n`, `dir`, or the validity of `curr_lat` change beyond the result of the operation.

The state of `curr_lat` after executing the operation will still be valid, but it will now reflect the decrease based on the value of `t`. Therefore, the specific value of `curr_lat` will change according to the operation performed.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1; `t` is an integer; `dir` is an input string; `curr_lat` is updated to `curr_lat - (t / 111.195)` and remains within the valid latitude range.**
