Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `valid` remains False, `t` is an input integer, and `dir` is either 'West' or 'East'. If `position` is less than 0 or greater than 20000, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `position` is within the range of 0 to 20000, then `position` is unchanged.***
