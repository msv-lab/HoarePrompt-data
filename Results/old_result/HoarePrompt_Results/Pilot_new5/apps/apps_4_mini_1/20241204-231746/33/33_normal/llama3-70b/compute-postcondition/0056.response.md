Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `t` is an integer, `dir` is a string, and `curr_lat` remains within the valid latitude range. If `curr_lat` is equal to -90 and `dir` is not 'North', then 'NO' is printed and the program has exited. Otherwise, if `curr_lat` is within valid latitude bounds, the execution continues with the next iteration of the loop.***
