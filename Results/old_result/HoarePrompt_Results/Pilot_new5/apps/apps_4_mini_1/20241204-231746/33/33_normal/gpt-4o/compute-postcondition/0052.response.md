The code `position += t` increments the value of `position` by the value of `t`. Given the condition that if `position + t` exceeds 20000, the program maintains the states of the variables without changes, we need to evaluate the outcome.

Since `position` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine if `position + t` exceeds 20000. Thus, we can't ascertain whether `position` will be updated or remain unchanged.

Therefore, we will maintain the original states of the variables unless we have more specific information about `position` and `t`. 

The Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `valid` remains False, `t` is an input integer, `dir` is either 'West' or 'East', and `position` remains unchanged if `position + t` exceeds 20000, or `position` is updated by `t` if it does not exceed 20000.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `valid` remains False, `t` is an input integer, `dir` is either 'West' or 'East', and `position` remains unchanged if `position + t` exceeds 20000.**
