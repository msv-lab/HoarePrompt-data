`t` is assigned the value of `int(t)`, converting the input `t` into an integer. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), `curr_lat` is 90, `t` is an input integer, `dir` is an input value.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), `curr_lat` is 90, `t` is an input integer, `dir` is an input value**
