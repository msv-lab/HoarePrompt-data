`a` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial state indicates that `a` is within the range of 1 to 10,000,000. The values of `n` and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `a` is now equal to the input integer.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer within 1 to 10,000,000, `b` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ b â‰¤ 10,000,000**
