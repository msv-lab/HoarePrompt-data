The variable `y` is assigned the value of `(n - x * a) // b`. Given that `x` is 0, this simplifies to `y = (n - 0 * a) // b`, which further simplifies to `y = n // b`. The value of `n` is greater than or equal to 0, and we know that `n - x * a` is divisible by `b`, meaning the division will yield an integer result. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an input integer within 1 to 10,000,000, `x` is 0, and `y` is equal to `n // b`.**
