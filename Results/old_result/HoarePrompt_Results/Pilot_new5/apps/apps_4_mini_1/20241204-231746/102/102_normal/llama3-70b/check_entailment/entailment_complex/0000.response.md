Correctness: **True**

The given Python program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's an explanation of why it meets those requirements:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`, which represent the amount of money Vasya has and the costs of Ber-Cola and Bars bars, respectively. This aligns with the input specification in the problem description.

2. **Iterative Checking**: The program uses a for loop to iterate over all possible quantities `x` of Ber-Cola bottles that Vasya can buy (from 0 to `n // a`). For each value of `x`, it calculates the maximum number of Bars bars `y` that can be purchased with the remaining money after buying `x` bottles of Ber-Cola. This is done through the formula `y = (n - x * a) // b`.

3. **Condition Checking**: Inside the loop, it checks whether the current values of `x` and `y` satisfy the equation `x * a + y * b == n`. If this condition is met, it prints "YES" followed by the values of `x` and `y`, indicating that it is possible to spend exactly `n` burles.

4. **No Solution Case**: If the loop completes without finding any valid (x, y) pairs, the program outputs "NO", indicating that it is impossible to spend exactly `n` burles using the given costs.

5. **Handling of Non-Negative Integers**: The program ensures that both `x` and `y` are non-negative by the construction of the loop and the calculation of `y` from the remaining money.

6. **Multiple Solutions**: The problem description allows for multiple valid (x, y) pairs, and the program correctly handles this by searching for any valid combination rather than all possible combinations.

7. **Efficiency**: The loop runs at most `n // a + 1` iterations, which is efficient given the constraints, ensuring that it can handle the largest inputs within reasonable time limits.

Overall, the program effectively checks the conditions laid out in the problem description and outputs the correct results based on the input values. Thus, it is accurate and adheres to all specified requirements.
