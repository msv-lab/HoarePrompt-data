To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the program step-by-step.

The problem requires us to find two non-negative integers \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( x \cdot a + y \cdot b = n \). The program does this by iterating over possible values of \( x \) (the number of Ber-Cola bottles Vasya can buy), and for each \( x \), it calculates \( y \) (the number of Bars bars). The program checks if the total cost matches \( n \).

1. **Input Read**: The program reads three integers: \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \).
2. **Loop through possible \( x \)**: The for loop iterates from \( 0 \) to \( n // a \). This ensures that \( x \) does not exceed the maximum number of Ber-Cola bottles Vasya can afford.
3. **Calculate \( y \)**: For each \( x \), the program computes \( y \) as \( (n - x \cdot a) // b \).
4. **Check the total cost**: It checks if \( x \cdot a + y \cdot b = n \). If true, it prints "YES" and the values of \( x \) and \( y \).
5. **Exit if found**: The program exits if a valid pair \( (x, y) \) is found.
6. **Print "NO" if no pair is found**: If the loop completes without finding valid \( x \) and \( y \), it prints "NO".

### Potential Issues
Now let's consider potential cases where the program might fail:
- The program calculates \( y \) as \( (n - x \cdot a) // b \). This can lead to a situation where \( y \) is not valid if \( (n - x \cdot a) \) is negative or not a multiple of \( b \). Specifically, if \( (n - x \cdot a) < 0 \) (e.g., if \( a > n \), the program would still try to calculate \( y \) even though the remaining money is negative), this would lead to incorrect results.
- The program only checks if \( (n - x \cdot a) \) is divisible by \( b \) at the time of calculating \( y \), but it does not ensure that \( y \) is a non-negative integer. This could lead to scenarios where it incorrectly determines whether a valid combination exists.

### Example Case
Consider the input:
```
5
6
7
```
Here, \( n = 5 \), \( a = 6 \), and \( b = 7 \). According to the logic:
- The program would iterate \( x \) from \( 0 \) to \( 5 // 6 = 0 \), only checking \( x = 0 \).
- It would calculate \( y = (5 - 0 \cdot 6) // 7 = 5 // 7 = 0 \), leading to \( 0 \cdot 6 + 0 \cdot 7 = 0 \).
- Since \( 0 \) does not equal \( 5 \), it would print "NO". However, it should recognize that it is impossible to buy any items because both costs are higher than \( n \).

This indicates that there is a logical flaw in handling cases where neither \( a \) nor \( b \) can be afforded with the available \( n \).

### Conclusion
Given that we found at least one case where the program does not work as expected:

Correctness: **False**.
