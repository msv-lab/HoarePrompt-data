Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether it is possible for Vasya to spend exactly `n` burles through the purchase of any non-negative integers `x` and `y` of Ber-Cola and Bars bars, respectively. 

1. The program iterates through all possible numbers of Ber-Cola bottles (`x`), from `0` up to `n // a`, which captures all feasible purchases within the budget.
2. For each possible `x`, it checks if the remaining money after buying `x` bottles of Ber-Cola can be evenly divided by the price of a Bars bar (`b`). This is done using the modulus operator.
3. If a valid `y` (number of Bars bars) is found, it prints "YES" and the values of `x` and `y`.
4. If no combination is found that satisfies the condition `x·a + y·b = n`, it prints "NO".

The edge cases such as:
- Buying zero items of either type
- The scenario where the total money is exactly equal to the cost of one item

are inherently handled by the program. The use of a for loop ensures that all potential combinations of `x` and `y` are checked. Thus, the program adheres to the requirements laid out in the problem description and should function correctly for all valid inputs.
