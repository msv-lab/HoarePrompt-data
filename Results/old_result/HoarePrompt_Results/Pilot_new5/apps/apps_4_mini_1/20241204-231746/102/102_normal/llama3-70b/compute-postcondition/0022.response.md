Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10,000,000, `x` is equal to `n // a`, `y` is equal to `(n - x * a) // b` if `x * a + y * b` equals `n`, and the program prints 'YES' along with the values of `x` and `y`. If no such `x` and `y` satisfy the condition, the loop will have executed `n // a + 1` times and no output will be printed.**
