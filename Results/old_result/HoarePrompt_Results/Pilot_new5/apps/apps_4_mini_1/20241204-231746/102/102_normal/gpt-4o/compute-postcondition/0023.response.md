The code simply prints 'NO', indicating that no valid `x` was found which satisfies the condition `(n - x * a) % b == 0`. The values of variables do not change due to this line of code. Therefore, the Output State remains unchanged except for the indication that the result of the execution is 'NO'. The program does not return anything other than that.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is an input integer within 1 to 10,000,000, `x` is `n // a`, and the program outputs 'NO'.**
