The code `print('YES')` outputs the string 'YES' to the console, but it does not alter any of the state variables. Therefore, the preconditions remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10,000,000, `x` is 0, `y` is equal to `n // b`, and the equation `x * a + y * b` is equal to `n` holds true; output 'YES' is printed.**
