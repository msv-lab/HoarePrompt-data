Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if Vasya can spend exactly `n` burles on bottles of Ber-Cola and Bars bars. It does this by iterating through all possible non-negative integer values of `x` (the number of Ber-Cola bottles), calculating the corresponding `y` (the number of Bars bars), and checking if the total cost matches `n`.

1. The outer loop goes from `0` to `n // a`, ensuring it considers all possible counts of Ber-Cola bottles that can be bought without exceeding `n`.
2. For each `x`, the program calculates `y` as `(n - x * a) // b`. This calculation will yield a non-negative integer `y` as long as the remaining money `(n - x * a)` is non-negative and divisible by `b`.
3. If a valid combination of `(x, y)` is found such that `x * a + y * b = n`, it prints "YES" and the values of `x` and `y`.
4. If no valid combination is found after exhausting all possibilities, it prints "NO".

The program handles various cases where `n`, `a`, and `b` can vary significantly, including edge cases where one of the items may not be purchased at all (i.e., `x` or `y` can be `0`).

Given the constraints and the logic implemented, I could not find any case where the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description. Thus, the correctness of the program is assured for all input scenarios within the specified limits.
