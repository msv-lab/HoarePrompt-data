The variable `y` is assigned the value of `(n - x * a) // b`. The value of `x` is initialized at 0, so the expression simplifies to `(n - 0 * a) // b`, which is `(n) // b`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10,000,000, `x` is 0, and `y` is equal to `n // b`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10,000,000, `x` is 0, `y` is equal to `n // b`.**
