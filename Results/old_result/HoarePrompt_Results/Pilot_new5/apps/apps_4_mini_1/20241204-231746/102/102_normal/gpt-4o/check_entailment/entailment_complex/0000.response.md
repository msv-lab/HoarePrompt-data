Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's why it meets the criteria:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input, which corresponds to the total money available and the costs of the two items, respectively. This matches the input specifications given.

2. **Logic to Find Combinations**: The program uses a loop to iterate over possible quantities of Ber-Cola bottles (from 0 to `n // a`). For each quantity `x`, it calculates the remaining money after purchasing `x` bottles and checks if this remaining amount can be evenly divided by the cost of Bars bars `b`. This effectively checks if there exists a non-negative integer `y` such that the equation `n = x * a + y * b` holds true.

3. **Output**: When it finds suitable values of `x` and `y`, it prints "YES" followed by the quantities `x` and `y`, which matches the output requirements. If no suitable combination is found after checking all possibilities, it correctly outputs "NO".

4. **Correctness Conditions**: The program accounts for all possible combinations of `x` and `y` within the defined range, ensuring it does not miss any valid solutions. The loop's upper bound of `n // a + 1` ensures that all potential values of `x` are considered.

5. **Efficiency**: Given the constraints (with values up to 10 million), the program remains efficient, as it will not need to check an excessive number of iterations; it directly computes whether the remaining amount after buying `x` bottles can be made up with the cost of Bars bars.

Overall, the annotated program correctly implements the logic required to determine if the total amount `n` can be exactly spent using the costs of `a` and `b`, and it outputs the appropriate results according to the problem description.
