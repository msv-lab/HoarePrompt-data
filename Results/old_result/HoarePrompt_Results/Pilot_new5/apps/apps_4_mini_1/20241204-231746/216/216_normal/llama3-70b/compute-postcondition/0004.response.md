The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly since it is defined without any input parameters. However, it is stated that `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200\), and `s` is a string consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters with a length of `n`. Based on the provided information, it appears that the function operates on these two constraints (the integer `n` and the string `s`) in its implementation.

Since the function's output specifics are not provided in the prompt, we cannot detail the return values. Therefore, we can only summarize the constraints of the parameters that the function relies on.

Functionality: **The function operates on a positive integer n (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200) and a string s consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters with length n.**
