Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. The problem requires determining the maximum number of distinct lowercase letters in "pretty" positions, which must satisfy two conditions: 
1. All letters at those positions must be distinct and lowercase.
2. There must be no uppercase letters between any two positions chosen.

However, the program only collects the indices of all lowercase letters in the string and prints the count of these indices, without checking if they are distinct or if they are separated by uppercase letters. 

For example, consider the input `aaaaBaabAbA`. The program would return 4 because there are 4 lowercase letters ('a' at indices 0, 1, 2, and 6), but it fails to recognize that the positions must be distinct and must not be separated by an uppercase letter. The actual maximum pretty set in this case only contains 2 distinct positions (6 and 8).

Thus, the program does not adhere to the requirements outlined in the problem description, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
