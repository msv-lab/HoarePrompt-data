The variable `current_count` is assigned the value `0`. The previous values are that `current_count` can take any value, but its previous state is now set to `0`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `s` is a string of length `n`, `char` is the third character in `s`, `current_set` is now empty, `current_count` is 0, and `max_count` remains the maximum of its previous value and `current_count`.
