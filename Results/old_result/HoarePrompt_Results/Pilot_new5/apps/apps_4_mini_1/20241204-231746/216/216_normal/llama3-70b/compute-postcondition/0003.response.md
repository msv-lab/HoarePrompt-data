The length of the `lowercase` list is calculated and printed. The value of `len(lowercase)` reflects the count of indices of lowercase letters in the string `s`. The initial states of `n`, `s`, and `lowercase` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer within 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200; `s` is a string consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters with length `n`; `lowercase` is a list of indices of lowercase letters in `s`; the length of `lowercase` has been printed.**
