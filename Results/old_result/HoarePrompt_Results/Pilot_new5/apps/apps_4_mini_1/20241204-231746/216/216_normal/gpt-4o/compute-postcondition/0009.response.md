`current_count` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `current_count` was previously 0, so after the increment, `current_count` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `s` is a string of length `n`, `max_count` is 0, `current_set` contains `char`, `current_count` is 1, and `char` is the first character in `s`, which is a lowercase letter.
