Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `s` is a string of length `n`, and `char` is the third character in `s`. If `char` is a lowercase letter and not in `current_set`, then `current_set` now contains `char`, `current_count` is increased by 1, and `max_count` remains the maximum of its current value and 0. If `char` is a lowercase letter but is already in `current_set`, then `current_set`, `current_count`, and `max_count` remain unchanged. If `char` is not a lowercase letter, then `current_set` becomes empty, `current_count` is 0, and `max_count` remains the maximum of its previous value and 0.***
