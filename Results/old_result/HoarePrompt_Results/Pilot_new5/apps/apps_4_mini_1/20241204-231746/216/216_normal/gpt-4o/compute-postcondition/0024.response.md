According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as there are characters left in the string `s`. The loop iterates over each character in `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` has a length of `n`, and `char` is the second character in `s`. 

To execute the loop one more time, the next character `char` must be the third character in `s`, and we need to ensure that `n` is at least 3 for this to happen.

Thus, the adjusted states are:
- `n` must be at least 3 to account for the next character.
- `char` will be the third character in `s`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `s` is a string of length `n`, `char` is the third character in `s`, `current_set` remains unchanged, `current_count` remains unchanged, and `max_count` is the maximum of its current value and 0.**
