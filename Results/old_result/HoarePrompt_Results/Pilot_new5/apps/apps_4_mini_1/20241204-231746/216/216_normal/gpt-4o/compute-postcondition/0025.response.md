The code snippet `current_set.add(char)` adds `char` (which is the third character of the string `s`) to the set `current_set`. The previous values of `current_set` remain unchanged except for the addition of `char`. The other variables `n`, `s`, `current_count`, and `max_count` remain unchanged as well. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `s` is a string of length `n`, `char` is the third character in `s`, `current_set` now contains `char`, `current_count` remains unchanged, and `max_count` is the maximum of its current value and 0.**
