Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `s` is a string of length `n`, and `char` is the second character in `s`. If `char` is a lowercase letter and not already in `current_set`, it is added to `current_set`, and `current_count` is increased by 1. If `char` is already in `current_set`, no changes are made to `current_set` or `current_count`. If `char` is not a lowercase letter, then `current_set` remains empty, `current_count` is 0, and `max_count` is the maximum of its current value and 0.***
