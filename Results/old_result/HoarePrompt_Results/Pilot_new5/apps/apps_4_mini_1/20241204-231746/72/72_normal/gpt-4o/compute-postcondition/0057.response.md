The value of `max_questions` increases by 1, but since the previous value of `max_questions` is unknown, it remains unspecified. The states of the other variables are not affected. Thus, the Output State is: `n` and `k` retain their previous states; `m` is greater than 0; `y` is one less than its initial value; `full_cycle_length` is greater than 0; `k` is not a multiple of `full_cycle_length`; `remaining_questions` is greater than 0; `col` is 2; `max_questions` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` and `k` retain their previous states; `m` is greater than 0; `y` is one less than its initial value; `full_cycle_length` is greater than 0; `k` is not a multiple of `full_cycle_length`; `remaining_questions` is greater than 0; `col` is 2; `max_questions` is increased by 1.**
