The value of `max_questions` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `max_questions` is unknown. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` retain their previous states, `m` is greater than 0, `y` is one less than its initial value, `full_cycle_length` is greater than 0, `k` is not a multiple of `full_cycle_length`, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `col` is 1, and `max_questions` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` and `k` retain their previous states, `m` is greater than 0, `y` is one less than its initial value, `full_cycle_length` is greater than 0, `k` is not a multiple of `full_cycle_length`, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `col` is 1, `max_questions` is increased by 1.**
