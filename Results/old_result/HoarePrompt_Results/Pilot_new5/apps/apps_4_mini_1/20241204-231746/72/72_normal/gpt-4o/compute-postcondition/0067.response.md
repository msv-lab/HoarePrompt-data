Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` retain their previous states; `m` is greater than 0; `y` is one less than its initial value; `full_cycle_length` is greater than 0; `k` is not a multiple of `full_cycle_length`; `remaining_questions` is greater than 0; `col` is 2; if `direction` equals 1, then `max_questions` is increased by 1 and if `row` equals `n`, `row` is updated to `row - 3`. Otherwise, `max_questions` is decreased by 1 and if `row` was -1, `row` is increased by 2 (now `row` is `previous_value + 2`).***
