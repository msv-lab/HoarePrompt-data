The statement `max_questions -= 1` decreases the value of `max_questions` by 1. The states of `n`, `m`, `k`, `y`, `col`, `row`, and `sergei_questions` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` retain their previous states, `m` is greater than 0, `y` is one less than its initial value, `col` is 1, `row` is updated accordingly; if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1; `max_questions` is decremented by 1.**
