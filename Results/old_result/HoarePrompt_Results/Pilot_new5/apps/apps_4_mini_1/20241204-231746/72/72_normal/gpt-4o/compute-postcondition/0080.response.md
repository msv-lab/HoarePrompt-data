Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k` retain their previous states, `m` is greater than 0, `y` is one less than its initial value, `full_cycle_length` is greater than 0, `k` is not a multiple of `full_cycle_length`, `remaining_questions` is greater than or equal to 0, `max_questions` is adjusted based on the number of times the loop executed plus 1, and `row` is one greater than its previous value. If `row` equals `n`, then `col` is set to `y`, `row` is updated to `n - 1`, `sergei_questions` is increased by 1, and the current value of `direction` is -1. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
