Output State: **`n` retains its previous state, `m` is greater than 0, `k` retains its previous state, `y` is one less than its initial value, `full_cycle_length` is greater than 0, `k` is not a multiple of `full_cycle_length`, `remaining_questions` is greater than or equal to 0, `col` is equal to `m - 1`, `max_questions` is adjusted based on the total number of loop executions, `row` alternates between 0 and `n-1`, `sergei_questions` reflects the total number of times `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y` during the iterations.**
