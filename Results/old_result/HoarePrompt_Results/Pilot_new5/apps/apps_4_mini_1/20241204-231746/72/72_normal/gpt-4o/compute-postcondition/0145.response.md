Postcondition: ***`n` retains its previous state, `m` is greater than 1, `k` retains its previous state, `y` is one less than its initial value, `full_cycle_length` is greater than 0, `k` is not a multiple of `full_cycle_length`, `remaining_questions` is greater than or equal to 1, `col` is 1, and if `row` is equal to `n`, then `row` is updated to either -1 (if it was 1) or `n - 2` (if it was n), `max_questions` is incremented by 1, and `direction` is set to -1. Otherwise, if `row` is not equal to `n`, the state remains unchanged.***
