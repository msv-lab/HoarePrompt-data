The function `func` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y`. Here, `n` and `m` are integers representing the number of rows and pupils per row, respectively, with constraints of 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100. The parameter `k` is a positive integer representing the total number of questions asked, constrained by 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. The parameters `x` and `y` represent Sergei's seating position, where `x` is the row number (1 ≤ x ≤ n) and `y` is the position in that row (1 ≤ y ≤ m).

The function returns a value based on Sergei's position relative to the total questions asked. The specifics of the return value are not provided, but it can be inferred that the output is dependent on the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, m, k, x, and y, and returns a value based on Sergei's position in his row and the number of questions asked.**
