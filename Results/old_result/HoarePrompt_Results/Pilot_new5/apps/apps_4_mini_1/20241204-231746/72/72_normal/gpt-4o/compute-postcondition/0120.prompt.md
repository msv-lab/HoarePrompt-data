You are assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for finding the postcondition of an if statement based on the condition of the if statement. You will be given the precondition, the if condition and you need to calculate the postcondition to take into account the condition of the if statement. The precondition and the postcondition are expressed in natural language.

Precondition: describes the initial state of the program variables before entering the if condition.
If condition: This is a given part of the task and is not something you need to create or modify. This is the condition to enter the if statement.

Postcondition: describes the state of the program variables after entering the if condition. So taking into account the precondition it must be extended so the if condition is also true. This description should include both the values of the variables and the relationships between them. Similar to the precondition, avoid explaining how the program operates; concentrate solely on the variable values and their interrelations. Ensure that the postcondition retains the conditions stated in the precondition. 
I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
Follow the format Postcondition: **the calculated postcondition**

Example 1:
Precondition: `str` is a string
If condition:
```
if len(str) < 3:
```

Example Answer 1:
Postcondition: ***`str` is a string, and the lenght of the `str` is less than 3***


Example 2:
Precondition: `n` can have any value
if condition:
```
if isinstance(n, int):
```

Example Answer 2:
Postcondition: ***`n` is integer of any value`***

Example 3:
Precondition: `x` is an positive integer
if condition:
```
if x < 2:
```


Example Answer 3:
Postcondition: ***x is a positive less than 2***

Example 4:
Precondition: `m` is an integer, if m is higher than 10 n equals minus m, a is alist of integers
if condition:
```
if n < 0:
```


Example Answer 4:
Postcondition: ***`m`,  if m is higher than 10 n equals minus m. a is a list of integers. the current value of  n is lower than 0***

Example 5:
Precondition: `x` is an integer, a is a list of integers.
if condition:
```
if a[0] != 0:
```

Example Answer 5:
Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer , a is a list of integers. The first element of a is not 0***

Your Task:
Precondition: According to the code, for the loop to execute at least once, we need to ensure that the variable `m` is greater than 0, which allows the `for col in range(m)` loop to have at least one iteration. Since `remaining_questions` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute again, it is necessary to confirm that condition. The variable `col` will start at 0 and increment during each iteration, hence it will take on values from 0 to `m-1`. 

Additionally, since `row` alternates between 0 and `n-1`, we need to consider that it will switch to the other value if it was previously one of those two. The `sergei_questions` will also be adjusted based on the current values of `row` and `col`.

State: **`n` retains its previous state, `m` is greater than 0, `k` retains its previous state, `y` is one less than its initial value, `full_cycle_length` is greater than 0, `k` is not a multiple of `full_cycle_length`, `remaining_questions` is greater than or equal to 1, `col` starts at 0, `max_questions` is adjusted based on the total number of loop executions, `row` alternates between 0 and `n-1`, `sergei_questions` reflects the total number of times `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y` during the iterations.
if condition:
```
if (row == x and col == y):
```
Your task is to complete the  postcondition . All the information of the precondition must be included in the postcondition and additionally the if condition must also be included. If the variables have values related to previous conditions try to put that early in the postcondition and say the current value of the variable from then on. Give the overall state of the program for the program after it enters the if condition.
