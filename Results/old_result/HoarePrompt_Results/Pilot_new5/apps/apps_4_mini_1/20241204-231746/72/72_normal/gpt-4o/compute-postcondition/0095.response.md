The impact of the code decreases the value of `row` by 2. The previous value of `row` has been updated to `row - 1`, so after executing `row -= 2`, the new value of `row` will be `(row - 1) - 2`, which simplifies to `row - 3`. 

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `m`, `k` retain their previous states; `m` is greater than 0; `y` is one less than its initial value; `col` is 1; `row` is now updated to `row - 3`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` retain their previous states; `m` is greater than 0; `y` is one less than its initial value; `col` is 1; `row` is updated to `row - 3`.**
