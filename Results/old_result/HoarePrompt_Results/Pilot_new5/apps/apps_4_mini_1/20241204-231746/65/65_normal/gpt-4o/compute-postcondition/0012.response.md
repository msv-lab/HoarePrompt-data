Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `s` is a string of lowercase letters with length `n`, and an IndexError occurs when attempting to access the character at index `n`, which is out of bounds. If `color` is in `color_count`, then the program handles `color` accordingly; otherwise, an IndexError occurred while trying to access the character at index `n`.***
