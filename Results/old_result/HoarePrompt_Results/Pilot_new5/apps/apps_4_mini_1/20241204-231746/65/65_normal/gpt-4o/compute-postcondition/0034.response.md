The code snippet `print('YES')` outputs the string 'YES' to the console. This operation does not change any of the variables in the initial state. All existing conditions regarding `n`, `k`, `s`, `color_count`, and `can_distribute` remain valid after the execution.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `s` is a string of lowercase letters of length `n`, `color_count` is a dictionary with counts of occurrences of each unique character from `s`, and `can_distribute` is True.**
