Postcondition: ***`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; if `0 <= new_row < 2 and 0 <= new_col < 2`, and if `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, then `queue` now contains 'AXCB' and 'ABCX'; `visited` includes `start`, 'AXCB', and 'ABCX'; `directions` remains unchanged; `current` equals `start`; `empty_pos` is 3; `empty_row` is 1; `empty_col` is 1; `new_pos` is `3 + 2 * dr_value + dc_value`; and `new_state` is a list containing ['A', 'B', 'C', 'X']; `new_state_str` is 'ABCX'. If the condition is not satisfied, the state remains unchanged.***
