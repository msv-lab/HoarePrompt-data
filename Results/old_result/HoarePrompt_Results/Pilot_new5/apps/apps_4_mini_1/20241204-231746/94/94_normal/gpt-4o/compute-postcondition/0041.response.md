The code `current = queue.popleft()` removes the first item from the `queue` and assigns it to `current`. The first item in `queue` is 'AXCB', so `current` will be updated to 'AXCB'. After this operation, 'AXCB' will no longer be in `queue`.

The updated values are:
- `current` is 'AXCB'
- `queue` will now contain 'ABCX'

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `visited` contains 'AXCB', 'ABCX', and `start`; `queue` contains 'ABCX'; `current` is 'AXCB'; `empty_pos` is 3; `empty_row` is 1; `empty_col` is 1**
