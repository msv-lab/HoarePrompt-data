To analyze the provided code snippet, we start with the following initial state:

- `start` is 'AXCB'
- `visited` contains 'AXCB', 'ABCX', and 'ACXB'
- `current` is 'AXCB'
- `empty_pos` is 1
- `new_state` has swapped values at positions 1 and `new_pos`
- `new_state_str` is 'ACXB'
- `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`
- `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`
- `new_pos` is equal to `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`

The code snippet provided is:
```
new_state_str = ''.join(new_state)
```

Analyzing this, `new_state_str` is assigned the value of the string formed by joining the elements of `new_state`. The previous value of `new_state_str` was 'ACXB', which indicates it has already been set. However, since `new_state` is not explicitly defined in the current initial state, we will consider its new value, which is based on the swap operation.

The impact of the code involves concatenating the characters in `new_state` and assigning it to `new_state_str`. Assuming `new_state` has been defined properly and contains valid characters, the output state will reflect the new value of `new_state_str`.

Since `new_state_str` is updated based on `new_state`, we denote that `new_state_str` now represents the string formed by the current state of `new_state`.

Output State: **`start` is 'AXCB', `visited` contains 'AXCB', 'ABCX', and 'ACXB', `current` is 'AXCB', `empty_pos` is 1, `new_state_str` is a string formed by joining the characters in `new_state`.**
