Postcondition: ***`start` is 'A', 'B', 'C', 'X'; `new_pos` is unknown; `new_state` is a list of `current` (value unknown); if `new_row` is between 0 and 1 inclusive and `new_col` is between 0 and 1 inclusive, then if `new_state_str` is not already in `visited`, it is added to `visited`, which now includes `start`, 'AXCB', 'ABCX', and `new_state_str`; `queue` contains 'AXCB', 'ABCX', and `new_state_str`; `empty_pos` is 3; `empty_row` is 1; `empty_col` is 1. If `new_state_str` is already in `visited`, no changes are made to `visited` or `queue`. Otherwise, if the condition on `new_row` and `new_col` is not satisfied, no changes are made.***
