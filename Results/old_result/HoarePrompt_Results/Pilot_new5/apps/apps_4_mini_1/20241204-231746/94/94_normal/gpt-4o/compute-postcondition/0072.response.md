The code snippet adds `new_state_str` to the `visited` set. The value of `new_state_str` is the string representation of `new_state`, which is the result of a swap operation. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is 'AXCB', `visited` contains 'AXCB', 'ABCX', 'ACXB', and `new_state_str` has been added to `visited`; `current` is 'AXCB', `new_pos` is equal to `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `new_state` is a list after a swap, `new_state_str` is a string representation of `new_state`.**
