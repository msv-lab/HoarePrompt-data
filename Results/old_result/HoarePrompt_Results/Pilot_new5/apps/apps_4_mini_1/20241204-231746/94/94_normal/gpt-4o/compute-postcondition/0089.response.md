The code `visited.add(new_state_str)` indicates that `new_state_str` is being added to the set of `visited` states. Since `new_state_str` was stated to not be in `visited` before the operation, we can conclude that `visited` will now include this new string representation of a state, and no other variables are directly affected by this code execution.

Output State: **`start` is 'AXCB', `visited` now includes `new_state_str`, `queue` contains new valid states that have not been visited yet minus the first element, `current` is the first element of `queue`, `empty_pos` is 1, `empty_row` is 0, `empty_col` is 1.**
