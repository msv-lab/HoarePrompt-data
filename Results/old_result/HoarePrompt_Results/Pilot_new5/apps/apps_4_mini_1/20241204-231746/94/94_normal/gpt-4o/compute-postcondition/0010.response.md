The value of `new_pos` is assigned the result of the calculation `new_row * 2 + new_col`. Given that `new_row` is 0 and `new_col` is 1, we calculate `new_pos` as follows:

```
new_pos = 0 * 2 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1
```

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `start` is a string of length 4 consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `queue` is empty; `visited` is a set containing `start`; `directions` is a list of tuples [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]; `current` is equal to `start`; `empty_pos` is 3; `empty_row` is 1; `empty_col` is 1; `dr` is -1, `dc` is 0; `new_row` is 0; `new_col` is 1; `new_pos` is 1.
