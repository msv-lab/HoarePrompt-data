To calculate the new state based on the provided initial state and code snippet, we first take note of the values in the initial state and how the code modifies them.

Initial State:
- `start` is 'AXCB'
- `visited` includes `new_state_str` if it was not already present
- `queue` contains new valid states that have not been visited yet with `new_state_str` added to it
- `current` remains the first element of the `queue`
- `empty_pos` is 1
- `empty_row` is 0
- `empty_col` is 1
- `new_row` is 0 + `dr` (where `dr` is derived from the `directions`)
- `new_col` is 1 + `dc` (where `dc` is derived from the `directions`)

The code snippet calculates:
```
new_pos = new_row * 2 + new_col
```

Since `new_row` is equal to `0 + dr` and `new_col` is equal to `1 + dc`, this means:
- `new_pos = (0 + dr) * 2 + (1 + dc)`

Now, we will update the output state with the new value for `new_pos`. The specific values for `dr` and `dc` are not provided, so they remain as variables in the final output. Other variables such as `start`, `visited`, `queue`, `current`, `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, and `empty_col` remain unchanged since the code does not affect them.

Output State: **`start` is 'AXCB', `visited` includes `new_state_str` if it was not already present, `queue` contains new valid states that have not been visited yet with `new_state_str` added to it, `current` remains the first element of the `queue`, `empty_pos` is 1, `empty_row` is 0, `empty_col` is 1, `new_row` is 0 + `dr`, `new_col` is 1 + `dc`, `new_pos` is (0 + dr) * 2 + (1 + dc)**
