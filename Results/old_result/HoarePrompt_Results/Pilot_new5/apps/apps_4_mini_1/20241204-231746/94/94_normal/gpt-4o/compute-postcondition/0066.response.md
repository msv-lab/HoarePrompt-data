According to the code, the loop iterates over all the possible directions defined by `directions`. For each direction, it checks whether moving to a new position `(new_row, new_col)` is valid, and if the resulting state represented by `new_state_str` has not been visited yet. 

At the end of the last iteration, `current` is 'AXCB', `empty_pos` is 1, and `visited` contains 'AXCB', 'ABCX', and 'ACXB'. The loop iterates through `directions`, which likely includes adjustments to the `row` and `column` based on `dr` and `dc`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next direction `(dr, dc)` must be valid such that:
1. The new row and column calculated based on `empty_pos` and the current position must remain within the bounds defined (i.e., `0 <= new_row < 2` and `0 <= new_col < 2`).
2. The newly generated `new_state_str` must be different from the states already in `visited`.

In the current state, the `empty_pos` is 1, which means in a typical 2D setup this position corresponds to a specific location that could change with a valid movement.

After considering these points, the new state should be updated for the next iteration. Assuming that a valid direction is chosen that changes the `empty_pos`, let's denote the new position after the move based on directional offsets `dr` and `dc`.

State: **`start` is 'AXCB', `visited` contains 'AXCB', 'ABCX', 'ACXB', `current` is 'AXCB', `empty_pos` must be updated based on a valid move, and `new_state_str` must not be in `visited`.**
