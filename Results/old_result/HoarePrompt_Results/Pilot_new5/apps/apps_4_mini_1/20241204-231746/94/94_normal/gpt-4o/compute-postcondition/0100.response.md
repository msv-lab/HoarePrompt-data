The code `queue.append(new_state_str)` adds the value of `new_state_str` to the end of the `queue`. The initial state indicates that `queue` contains new valid states that have not been visited yet, and `new_state_str` represents a string obtained by joining the characters of `new_state`. 

Since the existing `queue` is updated by adding `new_state_str`, the values of `start`, `visited`, `current`, `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, and `empty_col` remain unchanged. Therefore:

Output State: **`start` is 'AXCB'; `visited` includes `new_state_str` and the previous elements; `queue` contains new valid states that have not been visited yet with `new_state_str` added to it; `current` remains the first element of the `queue`; `empty_pos` is 1; `empty_row` is 0; `empty_col` is 1; `new_state_str` is the string obtained by joining the characters of `new_state`.**
