The code `queue.append(new_state_str)` adds the value of `new_state_str`, which is 'ACXB', to the `queue`. The `queue` previously contained 'ABCX', and now it will include 'ACXB' as well. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`start` is 'AXCB', `visited` contains 'AXCB', 'ABCX', 'ACXB', `queue` contains 'ABCX', 'ACXB', `current` is 'AXCB', `empty_pos` is 1, `new_state` is ['A', 'C', 'X', 'B'], `new_state_str` is 'ACXB'**
