`new_state_str` is assigned the value of `''.join(new_state)`, which concatenates the elements of the list `new_state` into a single string. The elements in `new_state` are 'A', 'C', 'X', and 'B', so `new_state_str` will be 'ACXB'. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`start` is 'AXCB', `visited` contains 'AXCB', 'ABCX', and `start`, `queue` contains 'ABCX', `current` is 'AXCB', `empty_pos` is 1, `new_state` is ['A', 'C', 'X', 'B'], `new_state_str` is 'ACXB'**
