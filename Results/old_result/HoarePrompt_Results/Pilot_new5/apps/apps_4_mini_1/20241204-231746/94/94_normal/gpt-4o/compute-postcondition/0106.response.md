`new_state` is assigned the value of `list(current)`, which means it is a new list created from the existing `current` variable. The other variables remain unchanged as there are no operations affecting them directly. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged variables and indicates that `new_state` is a list created from `current`.

Output State: **`start` is 'AXCB'; `visited` includes `new_state_str` and previous elements; `queue` contains new valid states that have not been visited yet with `new_state_str` added to it; `current` is the next element of the `queue`; `empty_pos` is 1; `empty_row` is 0; `empty_col` is 1; `new_pos` is equal to `2 * dr + 1 + dc`; `new_state` is a list created from `current`.**
