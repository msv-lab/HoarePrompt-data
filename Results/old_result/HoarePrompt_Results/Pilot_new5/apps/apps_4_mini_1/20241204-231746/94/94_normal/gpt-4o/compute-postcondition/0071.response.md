The `new_state` variable contains a list representing a state after a swap, which is not provided explicitly in the initial state. The code snippet converts `new_state` into a string by joining its elements. Thus, `new_state_str` will be a string representation of the current state after the swap.

Since `new_state` is assumed to have been modified through a swap, we do not know its exact contents without further information. However, we can confirm that `new_state_str` will be a string derived from whatever `new_state` currently holds.

Output State: **`start` is 'AXCB', `visited` contains 'AXCB', 'ABCX', 'ACXB', `current` is 'AXCB', `new_pos` is equal to `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `new_state` is a list after a swap, `new_state_str` is a string representation of `new_state`**.
