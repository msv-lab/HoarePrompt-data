`new_state_str` is assigned the string value obtained by joining the elements of `new_state`. The `new_state` list is initialized as `['A', 'B', 'C', 'X']`, and joining the elements together results in the string 'ABCX'. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `queue` contains 'AXCB'; `visited` is a set containing `start` and 'AXCB'; `directions` remains unchanged; `current` is equal to `start`; `empty_pos` is 3; `empty_row` is 1; `empty_col` is 1; `new_pos` is `3 + 2 * dr_value + dc_value`; `new_state` is a list containing ['A', 'B', 'C', 'X']; `new_state_str` is 'ABCX'.**
