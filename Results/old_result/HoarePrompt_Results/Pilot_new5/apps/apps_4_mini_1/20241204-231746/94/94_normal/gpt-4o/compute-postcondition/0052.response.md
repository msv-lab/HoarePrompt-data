In the provided code, the `visited` set is updated by adding `new_state_str`, which is 'ACXB', to it. The previous value of `visited` contains 'AXCB' and 'ABCX'. After executing the code, 'ACXB' will be included in the `visited` set.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated `visited` set will now include three strings: 'AXCB', 'ABCX', and 'ACXB'. 

Output State: **`start` is 'AXCB', `visited` contains 'AXCB', 'ABCX', 'ACXB', `queue` contains 'ABCX', `current` is 'AXCB', `empty_pos` is 1, `new_state` is ['A', 'C', 'X', 'B'], `new_state_str` is 'ACXB'**
