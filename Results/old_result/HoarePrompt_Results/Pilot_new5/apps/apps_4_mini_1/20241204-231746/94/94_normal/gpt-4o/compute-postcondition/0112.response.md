Postcondition: ***`start` is 'AXCB'; `visited` includes `new_state_str` and previous elements, with `new_state_str` added; `queue` contains new valid states that have not been visited yet, now including `new_state_str`; `current` is the next element of the `queue`; `empty_pos` is 2. If `new_row` is within the valid range (0 to 1) and `new_col` is also within the valid range (0 to 1), then `new_state_str` is added to both `visited` and `queue`.***
