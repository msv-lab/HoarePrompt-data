Functionality: ** The function accepts two 2D lists `puzzle1` and `puzzle2`, each containing the tiles 'A', 'B', 'C', and an empty cell 'X'. It determines the index of 'X' in both puzzles, swaps the elements at those indices, and then returns True if the modified `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` are permutations of each other. If the swapped `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` are not permutations of each other, it returns False.**
