The code appends `new_state_str` (which is 'ABCX') to the `queue`. The previous values of the affected variables are `queue` containing 'AXCB' and `new_state_str` equal to 'ABCX'. After the operation, `queue` will include 'ABCX' along with its previous elements.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `start` is a string of length 4 consisting of 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `queue` now contains 'AXCB' and 'ABCX'; `visited` is a set containing `start`, 'AXCB', and 'ABCX'; `directions` remains unchanged; `current` is equal to `start`; `empty_pos` is 3; `empty_row` is 1; `empty_col` is 1; `new_pos` is `3 + 2 * dr_value + dc_value`; `new_state` is a list containing ['A', 'B', 'C', 'X']; `new_state_str` is 'ABCX'.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `queue` now contains 'AXCB' and 'ABCX'; `visited` is a set containing `start`, 'AXCB', and 'ABCX'; `directions` remains unchanged; `current` is equal to `start`; `empty_pos` is 3; `empty_row` is 1; `empty_col` is 1; `new_pos` is `3 + 2 * dr_value + dc_value`; `new_state` is a list containing ['A', 'B', 'C', 'X']; `new_state_str` is 'ABCX'.**
