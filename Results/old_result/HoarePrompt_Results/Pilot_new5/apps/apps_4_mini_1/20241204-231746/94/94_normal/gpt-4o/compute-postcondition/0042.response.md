The code assigns the index of 'X' in the string `current` to the variable `empty_pos`. In this case, `current` is 'AXCB', and 'X' is located at index 1 (0-based indexing). The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `visited` contains 'AXCB', 'ABCX', and `start`; `queue` contains 'ABCX'; `current` is 'AXCB'; `empty_pos` is 1; `empty_row` is 1; `empty_col` is 1**
