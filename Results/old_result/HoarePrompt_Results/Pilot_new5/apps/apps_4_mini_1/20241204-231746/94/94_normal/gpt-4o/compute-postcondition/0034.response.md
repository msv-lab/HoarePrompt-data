The code `new_state_str = ''.join(new_state)` assigns a new string to `new_state_str` by joining the elements of the list `new_state`. The value of `new_state` is unknown, but it will influence the value of `new_state_str`. Other variables remain unchanged, so we will indicate that `new_state_str` is now a string made from joining the elements of `new_state`.

Since `new_state` was previously unknown, the exact content of `new_state_str` cannot be determined, but we note that it is now defined based on `new_state`. The existing states for other variables do not change.

Output State: **`start` is 'A', 'B', 'C', 'X'; `new_pos` is unknown; `new_state` is a list of `current` (value unknown); `new_state_str` is now the string formed by joining elements of `new_state`; `visited` includes `start`, 'AXCB', and 'ABCX'; `queue` contains 'AXCB' and 'ABCX'; `empty_pos` is 3; `empty_row` is 1; `empty_col` is 1.**
