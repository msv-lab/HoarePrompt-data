Postcondition: ***`start` is 'AXCB'; `visited` includes `new_state_str` and previous elements, with `new_state_str` added; `queue` contains new valid states that have not been visited yet, now including `new_state_str`; `current` is the next element of the `queue`; `empty_pos` is 2. If `new_state_str` was not previously visited, it is now added to `visited` and `queue`.***
