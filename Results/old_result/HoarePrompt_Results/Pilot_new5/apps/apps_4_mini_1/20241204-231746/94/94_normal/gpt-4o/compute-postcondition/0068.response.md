The variable `new_pos` is assigned the value of `new_row * 2 + new_col`. The values of `new_row` and `new_col` are derived from `empty_row + dr` and `empty_col + dc`, respectively. The initial states of `start`, `visited`, and `current` remain unchanged.

Since `new_row` and `new_col` are not specifically defined in the initial state, we will treat them as expressions based on their definitions. The expression for `new_pos` can be simplified to `new_pos = (empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`.

Thus, the output state, while including the unchanged variables, would be:

Output State: **`start` is 'AXCB', `visited` contains 'AXCB', 'ABCX', 'ACXB', `current` is 'AXCB', `new_pos` is equal to `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`**.
