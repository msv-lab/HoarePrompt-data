The variable `new_state` is assigned the value of `list(current)`, which transforms `current` (the first element of `queue`) into a list. The contents of `current` will determine the specific values in `new_state`, but since the value of `current` is not provided, we cannot specify the exact elements in `new_state`. 

The other variables in the initial state remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state includes the information that `new_state` is now a list formed from the characters of the string `current`.

Output State: **`start` is 'AXCB', `visited` contains all unique states generated from 'AXCB', `queue` contains new valid states that have not been visited yet minus the first element, `current` is the first element of `queue`, `empty_pos` is 1, `empty_row` is 0, `empty_col` is 1, `new_pos` is either 1, 2, 3, or 4, and `new_state` is a list created from `current`.**
