#State of the program right berfore the function call: puzzle1 and puzzle2 are both 2D lists (or lists of strings) representing a 2 Ã— 2 grid, containing exactly one occurrence of each of the tiles 'A', 'B', 'C', and one occurrence of the empty cell 'X'.
def func_1(puzzle1, puzzle2):
    for i in range(4):
        if puzzle1[i] == 'X':
            x1 = i
        
        if puzzle2[i] == 'X':
            x2 = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` are 2D lists containing tiles 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `x1` is the index of 'X' in `puzzle1`, and `x2` is the index of 'X' in `puzzle2`; both `x1` and `x2` must be in the range [0, 3].
    puzzle1[x1], puzzle2[x2] = puzzle2[x2], puzzle1[x1]
    return sorted(puzzle1) == sorted(puzzle2)
    #The program returns True if `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` are permutations of each other after swapping elements at indices `x1` and `x2`, indicating that they contain the same elements in different orders.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two 2D lists `puzzle1` and `puzzle2`, each containing the tiles 'A', 'B', 'C', and an empty cell 'X'. It determines the index of 'X' in both puzzles, swaps the elements at those indices, and then returns True if the modified `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` are permutations of each other. If the swapped `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` are not permutations of each other, it returns False.
