According to the code, the loop iterates over `directions`, which means that for each iteration, the values of `dr` and `dc` will change based on the `directions` list. Since we don't have the specifics of the `directions` list from the information provided, we cannot determine how many iterations have been completed or how to adjust the states specifically for the next iteration.

However, we can infer that for the loop to execute one more time, the current values of `dr` and `dc` will need to change. Since `current` equals `start`, `empty_pos` is 3, and `new_state_str` is 'ABCX', the next values for `dr` and `dc` will simply be the next tuple in the `directions` list.

Thus, we can conclude that the state will still include the previously mentioned values, while the variables `dr` and `dc` will move to the next pair of values in `directions`. Assuming there are more directions available:

State: **`start` is 'A', 'B', 'C', 'X'; `new_pos` is `3 + 2 * dr_value + dc_value` for the next direction; `new_state` is ['A', 'B', 'C', 'X']; `new_state_str` is 'ABCX'; `visited` includes `start`, 'AXCB', and 'ABCX'; `queue` contains 'AXCB' and 'ABCX'; `empty_pos` is 3; `empty_row` is 1; `empty_col` is 1; `dr` and `dc` are the next values in `directions`.**
