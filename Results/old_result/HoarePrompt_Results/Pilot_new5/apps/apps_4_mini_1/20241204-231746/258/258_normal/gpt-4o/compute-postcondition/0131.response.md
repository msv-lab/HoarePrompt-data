The code `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. As a result, no variables are modified in this context. 

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state without any changes to the variable values.

Output State: **`my` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2 - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `count` is the sum of `c` for each `(x, y, c)` in `meats` where the distance from `(mx, my)` is less than or equal to `T`, `d` is equal to `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `count` is less than `K`, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `j` is `i + 2`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is equal to `dx * dx + dy * dy`.**
