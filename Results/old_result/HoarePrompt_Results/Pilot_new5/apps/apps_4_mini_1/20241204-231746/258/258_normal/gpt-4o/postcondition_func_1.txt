The function accepts an integer `N`, an integer `K`, and a list of tuples `meats`, where each tuple contains three integers. It performs a binary search to determine the maximum hardness of meat pieces that can meet the requirement defined by `func_1`. The function returns a value `high` that is greater than `low + 1e-07`, which represents the approximate maximum hardness.
