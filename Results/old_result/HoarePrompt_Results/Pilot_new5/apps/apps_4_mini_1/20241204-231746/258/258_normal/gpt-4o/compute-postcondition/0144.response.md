Output State: **`my` is updated to the final calculated value, `count` is the sum of `c` for each `(x, y, c)` in `meats` where the distance from `(mx, my)` is less than or equal to `T`, `i` is N - 2, `j` is N - 1, `d` is valid for the last iteration, `cx` is equal to the average of the last two `x` values from `meats`, `cy` is equal to the average of the last two `y` values from `meats`, `dx` is equal to half the difference of the last two `x` values, `dy` is equal to half the difference of the last two `y` values, `d2` is equal to the sum of squares of `dx` and `dy`, `count` is greater than or equal to `K`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are assigned the values from `meats[i]`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are assigned the values from `meats[N - 1]`, the condition `c1 * T < c2 * T` holds true; `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are now equal to `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` respectively.**
