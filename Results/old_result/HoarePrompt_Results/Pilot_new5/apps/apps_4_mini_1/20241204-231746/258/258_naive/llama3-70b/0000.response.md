To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze if it correctly computes the minimum time required for K pieces of meat to be ready based on the given problem description.

The key points to consider:
1. The program uses a brute-force method to place the heat source at every integer coordinate in the range from (-1000, -1000) to (1000, 1000).
2. For each coordinate (X, Y), it calculates the time for all pieces of meat to be ready using the formula given in the problem.
3. It sorts the times for each coordinate and identifies the K-th minimum time, which is what Takahashi needs.

However, there are flaws in the implementation:

1. **Inaccurate Ranges for Heat Source Placement**: The problem mentions that (X, Y) can be real numbers, but the program only checks for integer coordinates (from -1000 to 1000). This limitation means that the optimal placement of the heat source might be skipped entirely. For example, the optimal coordinate may lie between integers, which the program does not account for.

2. **Sorting and Minimum Selection**: Even if the program sorts the times and selects the K-th minimum, if the coordinates don't include potential optimal positions, the algorithm won't return the correct answer.

3. **Precision**: The description requires that the answer should be correct within an absolute or relative error of 10^{-6}. The method employed may not guarantee this level of precision as it limits the coordinates to integers.

Given these points, we can conclude:
- The program does not handle the full range of potential coordinates for the heat source.
- It may not produce the correct result because it ignores real-number coordinates, hence failing to find the actual optimal position.

Based on these observations, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**.
