The function accepts four parameters: `x` and `y`, which are the coordinates of a piece of meat (either floats or integers), and `X` and `Y`, which are the coordinates of a heat source (floats). It returns a list of values obtained by multiplying each coefficient 'c' from the `meats` list with the result of `func_1` called with the coordinates of the meat and the heat source. The function assumes that `meats` is defined in the scope of the function and accessible during execution. If `meats` is not properly defined, it will raise a NameError.
