The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `float('inf')`, which represents positive infinity in floating-point representation. The values of `x`, `y`, and `K` remain unchanged, and their conditions regarding their ranges still hold. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` and `y` are integers within the range of -1000 to 1000, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, and `ans` is equal to positive infinity.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers within the range of -1000 to 1000, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `ans` is equal to positive infinity.**
