The code `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change but we skip the remaining part of the loop for the current iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is the sum of the condition checking for each tuple in `meats`, `j` is `i + 2`, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `d` is `d / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is equal to `( (x1 - x2)^2 / 4 ) + ( (y1 - y2)^2 / 4 ) and we skip the current iteration of the loop.
