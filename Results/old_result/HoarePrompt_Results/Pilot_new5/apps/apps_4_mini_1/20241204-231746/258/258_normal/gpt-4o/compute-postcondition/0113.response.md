Output State: **`my` is equal to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `count` is the sum of `c` for each `(x, y, c)` in `meats` where the distance from `(mx, my)` is less than or equal to `T`, `d` is equal to `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `count` remains less than `K`, `N` is greater than `i + 1`, and `d2` is equal to `((x1 - x2) / 2) * ((x1 - x2) / 2) + ((y1 - y2) / 2) * ((y1 - y2) / 2) if `d * d2 > d2`, otherwise `mx` is equal to `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`.**
