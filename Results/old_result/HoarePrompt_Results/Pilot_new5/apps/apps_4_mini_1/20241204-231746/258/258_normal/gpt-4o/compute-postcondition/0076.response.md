Postcondition: ***`my` is equal to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `count` is the sum of `c` for each `(x, y, c)` in `meats` where the distance from `(mx, my)` is less than or equal to `T`, `i` is less than `N - 1`, and `j` is `j`. If `c1 * T < c2 * T`, then `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` are assigned the previous values of `x2`, `y2`, and `c2`, respectively, while `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` are updated to the previous values of `x1`, `y1`, and `c1`.***
