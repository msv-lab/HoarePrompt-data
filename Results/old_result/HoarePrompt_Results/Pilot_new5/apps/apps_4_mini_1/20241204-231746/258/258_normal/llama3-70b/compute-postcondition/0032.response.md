The variable `times` is assigned the output of `func_2(-998, -1000, -998, -1000)`, which is not specified here, but we assume it's a list that can be sorted. The code then sorts the list `times`. The values of `x`, `y`, and `K` are unaffected by the sorting operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged values of `x`, `y`, and `K`, while indicating that `times` has been sorted.

Output State: **`x` is -998, `y` is -1000, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `times` has been sorted.**
