To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step.

### Problem Description Overview:
1. Takahashi wants to grill N pieces of meat with specific coordinates and hardness values.
2. The time taken to grill each piece of meat depends on the coordinates of a heat source and the hardness of the meat.
3. The goal is to find the optimal coordinates for the heat source such that at least K pieces of meat are ready within the minimum time.

### Program Breakdown:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads inputs correctly and stores the meat pieces in a list of tuples, containing coordinates and hardness values.
   
2. **Function func_1**:
   - This function checks if K or more pieces of meat can be grilled in time T.
   - It iterates over all pairs of meat pieces, calculating a candidate position `(mx, my)` for the heat source based on their coordinates.
   - It then counts how many pieces of meat can be cooked in time T from this position.
   - If the count of cooked pieces is greater than or equal to K, it returns `True`, indicating that it is possible.

3. **Function func_2**:
   - This function employs binary search to minimize the grilling time.
   - It repeatedly calls `func_1` to find the maximum time T for which K or more pieces can be grilled.
   - The loop continues until the difference between the bounds is sufficiently small (`1e-07`), ensuring precision.

4. **Function func_3**:
   - This function serves as the entry point and handles reading input, invoking `func_2`, and printing the result.

### Evaluation of Correctness:
- The program correctly adheres to the problem description. It checks each pair of meat pieces to determine possible heat source positions and calculates how many pieces can be grilled within a specified time.
- The binary search approach in `func_2` effectively narrows down the minimum time required to grill at least K pieces of meat.
- The output format adheres to the precision requirements specified in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to function correctly according to the problem description. It handles all edge cases within the constraints provided and returns precise results.

Therefore, the output indicating the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
