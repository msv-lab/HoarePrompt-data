Postcondition: ***`my` is updated to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `count` remains equal to the number of tuples where sum(c * math.sqrt((mx - x) and count is less than K`, `j` is equal to `i + 2`, and `N` must be greater than `i + 2`. If `c1 * T < c2 * T`, then `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are updated to the previous values of `x2`, `y2`, `c2` respectively, while `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are updated to the previous values of `x1`, `y1`, `c1`. If the condition is not met, no changes occur to those variables.***
