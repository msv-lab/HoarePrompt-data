The `meats` list is updated by appending a tuple consisting of the current values of `x`, `y`, and `c`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state now reflects that `meats` contains a new tuple with the values of `x`, `y`, and `c`. 

Output State: **`N` must be greater than or equal to 1, `K` is an integer equal to `int(data[1])`, `meats` is now a list containing the tuple `(x, y, c)` where `x` is equal to `int(data[2])`, `y` is equal to `int(data[3])`, `c` is equal to `int(data[4])`, `index` is 2.**
