The variable `d2` is assigned the value of `dx * dx + dy * dy`. The previous states of `dx` and `dy` are defined as `(x1 - x2) / 2` and `(y1 - y2) / 2`, respectively. Therefore, we can express `d2` as:

\[ 
d2 = \left(\frac{x1 - x2}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y1 - y2}{2}\right)^2 
\]

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`my` is updated based on the calculations, `count` is less than `K`, `j` is `i + 2`, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `d` is `(c1 - c2) * T / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is equal to `(dx * dx + dy * dy)`.**
