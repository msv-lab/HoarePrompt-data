Postcondition: ***`my` is updated based on the condition `c1 * T < c2 * T`. If true, `my` is set to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, and `count` is the sum of `c` for each `(x, y, c)` in `meats` where the distance from `(mx, my)` is less than or equal to `T`. The values of `i`, `j`, `d`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, and `mx` are calculated from the corresponding variables. If the condition is false, there are no changes made to the program variables. Additionally, `count` remains less than `K` and `N` must be greater than `i + 1`.***
