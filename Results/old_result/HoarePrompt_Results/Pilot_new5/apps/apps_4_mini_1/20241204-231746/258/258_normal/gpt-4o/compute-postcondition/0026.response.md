The function `func_3` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, the constraints suggest that it operates on the following input values: 

- `N`, which is an integer representing the number of pieces of meat, where \(1 \leq N \leq 60\).
- `K`, which is an integer representing the number of pieces of meat to be grilled, where \(1 \leq K \leq N\).
- `meats`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains three integers \((x_i, y_i, c_i)\) representing the coordinates \((x_i, y_i)\) and the hardness \(c_i\) of each piece of meat, with the constraints \(-1000 \leq x_i, y_i \leq 1000\) and \(1 \leq c_i \leq 100\).

Based on the output description, the function likely processes these inputs to determine a result, but the specifics are not provided. Therefore, we cannot detail the return values.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters related to the number of pieces of meat, the number of pieces to be grilled, and a list of tuples representing the coordinates and hardness of each piece of meat.**
