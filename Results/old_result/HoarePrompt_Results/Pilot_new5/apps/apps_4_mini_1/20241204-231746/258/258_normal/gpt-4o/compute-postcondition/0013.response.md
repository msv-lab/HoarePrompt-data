The value of `y` is assigned the value `int(data[index + 1])`. The variable `index` is 6, so `y` will be updated to `int(data[7])`. The other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the output state is: `N` must be greater than or equal to 2, `K` is an integer equal to `int(data[1])`, `meats` is a list containing the tuple `(x, y, c)` where `y` is now equal to `int(data[7])`, `c` is equal to `int(data[4])`, `index` is 6, and `x` is equal to `int(data[6])`.

Output State: **`N` must be greater than or equal to 2, `K` is an integer equal to `int(data[1])`, `meats` is now a list containing the tuple `(x, int(data[7]), c)` where `c` is equal to `int(data[4])`, `index` is 6, and `x` is equal to `int(data[6])**.
