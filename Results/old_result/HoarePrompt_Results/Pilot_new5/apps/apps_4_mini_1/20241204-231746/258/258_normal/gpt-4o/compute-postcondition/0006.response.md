The variable `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`, where `index` is currently 2. The variable `data` is not mentioned in the initial state, but it implies that `data` is a list or array-like structure containing at least 3 elements since `index` is 2. The values of `N`, `K`, `meats`, and `index` remain unchanged. The only variable affected is `x`, which now holds the integer value at the second index of `data`.

Output State: **`N` must be greater than or equal to 1, `K` is an integer equal to `int(data[1])` (1 ≤ K ≤ N), `meats` is an empty list, `index` is 2, `x` is equal to `int(data[2])**
