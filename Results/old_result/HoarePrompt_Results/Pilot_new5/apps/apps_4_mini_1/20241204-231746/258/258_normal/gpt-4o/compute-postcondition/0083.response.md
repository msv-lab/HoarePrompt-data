The variable `cy` is assigned the value of `(y1 + y2) / 2`. Since this assignment directly affects the value of `cy`, it also influences the calculation of `my`, which is dependent on `cy`. However, since we don't have the exact previous values of `y1` and `y2`, we can't compute an exact value for `cy` or `my`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`my` is equal to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `count` is the sum of `c` for each `(x, y, c)` in `meats` where the distance from `(mx, my)` is less than or equal to `T`, `i` is less than `N - 1`, `j` is `j`, `d` is equal to `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, and `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`.**
