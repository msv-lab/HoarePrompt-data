The loop iterates over all possible pairs of integers \( x \) and \( y \) within the range of -1000 to 1000. For each pair, it calls the function `func_2`, which produces a list `times`, and then sorts this list. The variable `ans` keeps track of the minimum value of `times[K - 1]` across all iterations.

Since the outer loop iterates from -1000 to 1000 for \( x \) and the inner loop does the same for \( y \), the loop will execute a total of \( 2001 \times 2001 = 4,004,001 \) times.

After all iterations have completed, \( x \) will be 1000 and \( y \) will be 1000 as those are the last values assigned during the loop execution.

- `K` remains a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq K \leq N \).
- `ans` will be the minimum value of `times[K - 1]` found during the iterations, reflecting the best result across all combinations of \( x \) and \( y \).
- `times` will have been sorted across all the combinations but will not be in a specific state after the loops, as it is overwritten in each iteration.

Output State: **`x` is 1000, `y` is 1000, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `ans` is the minimum value of `times[K - 1]` across all iterations, `times` is sorted in non-decreasing order for each pair of `(x, y)`.**
