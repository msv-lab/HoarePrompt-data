Output State: **`my` is equal to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `count` is the sum of `c` for each `(x, y, c)` in `meats` where the distance from `(mx, my)` is less than or equal to `T`, and `count` may be greater than or equal to `K` or less than `K`. If the loop does not execute, `my` and `count` retain their values from before the loop, with `count` being the sum of `c` for the distances calculated, and the function does not return any value.**
