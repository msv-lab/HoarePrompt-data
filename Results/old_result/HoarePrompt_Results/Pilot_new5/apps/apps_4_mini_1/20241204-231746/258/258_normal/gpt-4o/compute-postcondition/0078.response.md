Postcondition: ***`my` is equal to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `count` is the sum of `c` for each `(x, y, c)` in `meats` where the distance from `(mx, my)` is less than or equal to `T`, `i` is less than `N - 1`, `j` is `j`, and `d` is equal to `c1 * T - c2 * T. The current value of `d` is less than 0.***
