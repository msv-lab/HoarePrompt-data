Output State: **`my` is updated to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2; count` is the sum of `c` for each `(x, y, c)` in `meats` where the distance from `(mx, my)` is less than or equal to `T`; `i` is less than `N - 1`; `j` is `i + 1`; `d` is equal to `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`; `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`; `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`; `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`; `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`; `d2` is equal to `dx * dx + dy * dy`; `mx` is equal to `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2; count` is less than `K`; `N` must be greater than `i + 1`; `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are assigned values from `meats[i]`; `x2` is assigned the first element of `meats[j]`; `y2` is assigned the second element of `meats[j]`; `c2` is assigned the third element of `meats[j]`.**
