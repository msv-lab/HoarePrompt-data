In the provided code, `d2` is calculated as `dx * dx + dy * dy`. The previous values of `dx` and `dy` are not explicitly given, but they are defined as `(x1 - x2) / 2` and `(y1 - y2) / 2` respectively. Therefore, `d2` will be the sum of the squares of these two expressions.

The values of the other variables, including `my`, `count`, `d`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, and `dy`, remain unchanged in this execution.

Therefore, the Output State is: `my` is equal to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2; `count` is the sum of `c` for each `(x, y, c)` in `meats` where the distance from `(mx, my)` is less than or equal to `T`, and `count` is less than `K`; `d` is equal to `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`; `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`; `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`; `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`; `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`; `d2` is equal to `dx * dx + dy * dy`.

Output State: **`my` is equal to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`; `count` is the sum of `c` for each `(x, y, c)` in `meats` where the distance from `(mx, my)` is less than or equal to `T`, and `count` is less than `K`; `d` is equal to `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`; `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`; `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`; `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`; `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`; `d2` is equal to `dx * dx + dy * dy`**.
