The code swaps the values of `x1`, `y1`, `c1` with `x2`, `y2`, `c2`. Therefore, after the execution of the code, the values of `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` will be equal to the original values of `x2`, `y2`, and `c2`, respectively, and vice versa. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`my` is equal to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `count` is the sum of `c` for each `(x, y, c)` in `meats` where the distance from `(mx, my)` is less than or equal to `T`, `count` is less than `K`, `j` is `i + 2`, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `x1` is `meats[j][0]`, `y1` is `meats[j][1]`, `c1` is `meats[j][2]`, `x2` is `meats[i][0]`, `y2` is `meats[i][1]`, `c2` is `meats[i][2]`.**
