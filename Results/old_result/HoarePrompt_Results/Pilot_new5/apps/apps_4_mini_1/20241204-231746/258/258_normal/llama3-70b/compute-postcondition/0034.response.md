According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `y`. The loop iterates over the range from -1000 to 1000, which means it will execute for each integer in that range. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is -1000. For the loop to execute one more time, `y` needs to be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the next value of `y` will be -999. The loop will continue executing until `y` reaches 1000. Since there are no other conditions or constraints affecting `y`, we can keep the other states the same.

State: **`x` is -998, `y` is -999, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `times` has been sorted, and `ans` is updated to min(`ans`, times[K - 1])**
