The variable `index` is incremented by 3. The previous value of `index` was 2, so after the operation, `index` will be 5. The states of the other variables, `N`, `K`, and `meats`, remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`N` must be greater than or equal to 1, `K` is an integer equal to `int(data[1])`, `meats` is now a list containing the tuple `(x, y, c)` where `x` is equal to `int(data[2])`, `y` is equal to `int(data[3])`, `c` is equal to `int(data[4])`, `index` is 5.**
