The `times` list is sorted in place, which changes the order of its elements. However, the specifics of those elements are not provided in the initial state. The other variables `x`, `y`, `K`, and `ans` are unaffected by the sorting operation. 

Output State: **`x` is -998, `y` is -999, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `times` is sorted, and `ans` is updated to min(`ans`, times[K - 1])**
