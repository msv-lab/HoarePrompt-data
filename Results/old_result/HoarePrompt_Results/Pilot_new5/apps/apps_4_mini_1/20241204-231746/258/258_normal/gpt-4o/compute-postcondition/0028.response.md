The variable `x1`, `y1`, `c1` is assigned the values from the tuple `meats[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `meats[i]` is an element from the list `meats`, the exact values of `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` depend on the contents of that list at index `i`. Therefore, we can't specify exact values but can represent them as `x1`, `y1`, `c1`.

Output State: **`my` is equal to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2; count` is the sum of `c` for each `(x, y, c)` in `meats` where the distance from `(mx, my)` is less than or equal to `T`, and `count` is less than `K`, `j` is `i + 2`, `N` must be greater than `i + 2`, `x1` is `meats[i][0]`, `y1` is `meats[i][1]`, `c1` is `meats[i][2]`.**
