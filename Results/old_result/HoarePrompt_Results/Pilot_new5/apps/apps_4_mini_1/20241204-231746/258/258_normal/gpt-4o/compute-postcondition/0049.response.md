The code snippet `x1, y1, c1 = meats[i]` assigns the values from the `meats` list at index `i` to the variables `x1`, `y1`, and `c1`. The preconditions state that `count` is less than `K`, `j` is equal to `i + 2`, and `N` must be greater than `i + 2`. 

The specific values assigned to `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` depend on the contents of the `meats` list at index `i`, which is not provided. Therefore, we can only state that these assignments have occurred without specifying the exact values.

Output State: **`my` is updated based on the calculations, `count` is less than `K`, `j` is `i + 2`, `N` must be greater than `i + 2`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are assigned values from `meats[i]`.**
