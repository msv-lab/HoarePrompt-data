The value of `N` is assigned the integer value of `data[0]`, where `data` is a list of strings obtained from input. The previous state of `N` is not known, but it will now hold the value of the first element of `data` converted to an integer. The other variables (`K`, `meats`, and `data`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer representing the number of pieces of meat (1 ≤ N ≤ 60), `K` is an integer representing the number of pieces of meat to be grilled (1 ≤ K ≤ N), `meats` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (x_i, y_i, c_i), `data` is a list of strings obtained from input, and `N` is the integer value of `data[0]`.**
