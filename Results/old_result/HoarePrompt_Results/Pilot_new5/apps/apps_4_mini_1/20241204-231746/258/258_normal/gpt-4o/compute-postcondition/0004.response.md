The variable `index` is assigned the value `2`. The values of `N`, `K`, and `meats` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer representing the number of pieces of meat (1 ≤ N ≤ 60), `K` is an integer equal to `int(data[1])` (1 ≤ K ≤ N), `meats` is an empty list, and `index` is 2.

Output State: **`N` is an integer representing the number of pieces of meat (1 ≤ N ≤ 60), `K` is an integer equal to `int(data[1])` (1 ≤ K ≤ N), `meats` is an empty list, `index` is 2.**
