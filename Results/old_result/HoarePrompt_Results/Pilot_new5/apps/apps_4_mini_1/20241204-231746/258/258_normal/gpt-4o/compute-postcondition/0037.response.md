The variable `cy` is assigned the value of `(y1 + y2) / 2`. The other variables `my`, `count`, `d`, and `cx` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. The preconditions still hold true with the updated value of `cy`.

Output State: **`my` is equal to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `count` is the sum of `c` for each `(x, y, c)` in `meats` where the distance from `(mx, my)` is less than or equal to `T`, and `count` is less than `K`; `d` is equal to `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`; `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`; `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`.**
