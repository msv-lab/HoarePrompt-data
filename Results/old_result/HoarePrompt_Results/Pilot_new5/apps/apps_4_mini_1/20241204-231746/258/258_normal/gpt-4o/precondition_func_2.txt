N is an integer representing the number of pieces of meat (1 ≤ N ≤ 60), K is an integer representing the number of pieces of meat to be grilled (1 ≤ K ≤ N), and meats is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (x_i, y_i, c_i) representing the coordinates and hardness of each piece of meat, with -1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100.
