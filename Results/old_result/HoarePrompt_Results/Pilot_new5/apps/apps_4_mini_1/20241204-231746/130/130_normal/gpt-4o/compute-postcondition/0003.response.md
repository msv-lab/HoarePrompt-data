Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` are assigned values based on input integers, where `N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` are all positive integers such that 1 ≤ K ≤ N and 1 ≤ M, L ≤ 10^18; `min_x` is equal to `(L + M - 1) // M`. The current value of `min_x` is calculated, and it satisfies the condition that `M * min_x` is less than or equal to `N - K`.***
