Functionality: ** The function accepts four positive integers N, M, K, and L as input. It checks if M is greater than or equal to both (N - K + 1) and L. If both conditions are satisfied, it outputs 1; otherwise, it outputs -1. There are no return statements, and the function operates solely by printing the output based on the condition checks. **
