To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze its logic against the problem description step by step.

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input correctly, parsing `n`, `k`, and `M`, followed by the list `t` that contains the time required for each subtask.

2. **Core Logic**:
   - The program calculates the total time required to complete a task (`total_time_per_task = sum(t)`).
   - It then iterates over the number of complete tasks Polycarp can potentially finish (`complete_tasks`).
   - For each complete task, it calculates how much time is used and how many points he earns from completing those tasks.
   - The remaining time after completing the full tasks is calculated (`remaining_time = M - time_used`).
   - The program then tries to solve as many subtasks as possible with the remaining time using a greedy approach, iterating over the subtasks' time.

3. **Potential Issues**:
   - The program attempts to count the subtasks solved across all tasks but limits the total number of subtasks solved to `(n - complete_tasks) * k`. This means it does not allow solving more subtasks than the number of incomplete tasks, which could be incorrect if Polycarp has enough time to solve more subtasks than the limit set by the unfinished tasks.
   - There could be cases where Polycarp could solve fewer complete tasks but still have enough time to solve a significant number of subtasks, leading to a potentially higher score than calculated.

4. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider the case:
     ```
     Input:
     3 3 8
     1 2 3
     ```
   - Here, Polycarp can:
     - Complete the first task (1 + 2 + 3 = 6 minutes, earning 4 points).
     - Then with the remaining 2 minutes, he can solve one subtask of the second task (1 point) or any other subtask that fits within the remaining time.
   - However, if he tried to just solve subtasks without completing the first one, he could possibly try various combinations but the logic in the program limits the subtasks he could solve based on the incomplete tasks count.

Given that the program's logic imposes a limit based on the number of incomplete tasks, it does not correctly calculate the maximum points Polycarp can earn in terms of subtasks solved.

Therefore, the program does not work correctly for all possible inputs.

Correctness: **False**.
