The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly in its signature. However, the constraints imply that there are four inputs that must be provided for the function to operate correctly: two integers `n` and `k`, a non-negative integer `M`, and a list `t` of `k` integers.

1. `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 45`.
2. `k` is an integer such that `1 ≤ k ≤ 45`.
3. `M` is a non-negative integer such that `0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9`.
4. `t` is a list of `k` integers where each `t[j]` (for `1 ≤ j ≤ k`) is an integer such that `1 ≤ t[j] ≤ 1000000`.

The output of the function is not explicitly provided in the prompt. Therefore, without additional information on what the function does with these parameters and its return value, we cannot detail the output.

In summary, the function assumes the following parameters:
- Two integers `n` and `k`.
- A non-negative integer `M`.
- A list `t` of integers.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), k (1 ≤ k ≤ 45), M (0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9), and a list t of k integers where each integer t[j] (1 ≤ j ≤ k) is between 1 and 1000000.**
