The code snippet updates the `dp` list at position `[i][j]` based on the previous values of `dp` and the value from the sorted list `t`. The `dp` list is updated using the maximum between its current value and the value from the previous row at `[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]]` plus 1. The conditions mentioned in the initial state dictate that `i` is 1, `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`, and updates will only take place for this specific value of `j`.

The relevant change is to the `dp` list. Since `j` is defined to be greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`, we can conclude that `dp[i][j]` will be updated.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `M` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers, `dp` is updated at `[1][j]` to the maximum of its current value and `dp[0][j - t[0]] + 1`, `i` is 1, `j` is greater than or equal to `t[0]`.**
