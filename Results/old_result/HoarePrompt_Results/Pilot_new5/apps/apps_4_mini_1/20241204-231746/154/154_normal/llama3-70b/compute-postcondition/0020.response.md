To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we analyze the provided information step by step:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop is defined as `for j in range(1, M + 1)`, which means that the loop will iterate over values of `j` starting from 1 up to and including `M`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `M` must be at least 1.

2. **Initial State of j**: The loop initializes `j` to 1 at the start of the first iteration. There are no additional conditions required to adjust the state for `j` itself since it is initialized correctly by the range function.

3. **Global State Considerations**: The program state mentions `dp` which is a 2D array that has been maintained appropriately such that `dp[i][j]` accurately represents the maximum number of items selected and adheres to the conditions specified (`dp[i][0]` is 0 for all `i` and `dp[0][j]` is 0 for all `j`). This implies that the `dp` array is in a valid condition prior to the loop, and does not require modification for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the only necessary condition we need to ensure is that `M` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `M` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers, `dp` remains updated, `i` is `k + 1`, and `M` must be greater than or equal to 1**.
