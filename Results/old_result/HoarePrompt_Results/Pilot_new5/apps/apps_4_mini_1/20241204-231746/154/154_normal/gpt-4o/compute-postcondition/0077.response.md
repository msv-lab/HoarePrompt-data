Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 45. If `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`, `remaining_time` is updated by subtracting the largest multiple of `subtask_time` that is less than or equal to `remaining_time`, `subtask_time` is updated to the next value in `t`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is calculated as the quotient of `remaining_time` divided by `subtask_time`, and `subtasks_solved` is increased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`.***
