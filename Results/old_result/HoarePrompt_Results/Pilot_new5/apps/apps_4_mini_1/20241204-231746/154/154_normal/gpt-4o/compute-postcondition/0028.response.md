The code snippet assigns a new value to `max_points`, which takes the maximum between its current value and the sum of `points` and `subtasks_solved`. The variable `subtasks_solved` has been updated to the minimum of its previous value and `(n - complete_tasks) * k`. The states of other variables such as `n`, `k`, `complete_tasks`, `points`, and `max_points` are not affected directly in this step, but the value of `subtasks_solved` will impact `max_points`. 

Since `subtasks_solved` is now equal to `min(subtasks_solved, (n - complete_tasks) * k)`, we can concretely express `max_points` as `max(max_points, points + min(subtasks_solved, (n - complete_tasks) * k))`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45; `complete_tasks` is equal to the number of elements in `t` for which `remaining_time` was sufficient; `subtasks_solved` is updated to min(`subtasks_solved`, (n - complete_tasks) * k); `max_points` is updated to max(`max_points`, `points` + `subtasks_solved`).**
