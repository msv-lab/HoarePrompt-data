The value of `subtasks_solved` is increased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`. The value of `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is previously calculated as `remaining_time // subtask_time`. The initial state mentions that both `n` and `k` are positive integers, and all conditions regarding `subtask_time`, `remaining_time`, and `current_index` remain valid after execution. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are positive integers; `subtask_time` is the next value in `t`; `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`; `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `remaining_time // subtask_time`; `subtasks_solved` is increased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`; `current_index` is less than `len(t) - 1`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers; `subtask_time` is the next value in `t`; `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`; `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `remaining_time // subtask_time`; `subtasks_solved` is increased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`; `current_index` is less than `len(t) - 1.**
