The operation `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]` assigns the value of `dp[i][j - 1]` to `dp[i][j]`. The initial state specifies that `dp` is a list of `k + 1` lists, each containing `M + 1` zeros. 

Given that `j` is greater than or equal to 2, we know that `j - 1` will be at least 1. Thus, `dp[i][j]` will take the value from the previous index in the same list `dp[i]`, specifically, `dp[i][j - 1]`, which is still 0 initially.

Since no other variables are affected by this operation, the output state will reflect that the value of `dp[i][j]` is now equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, which is initially 0. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `M` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers, `dp[i][j]` is 0, `dp[i][j - 1]` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 2**.
