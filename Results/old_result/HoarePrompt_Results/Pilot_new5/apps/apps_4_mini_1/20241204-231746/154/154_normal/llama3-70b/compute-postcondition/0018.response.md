Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `M` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers, `dp` is updated such that `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum number of items that can be selected from the first `i` items with a total weight of `j`, for all `j` from 0 to `M`, and `dp[i][0]` remains 0 for all `i`, while `dp[0][j]` remains 0 for all `j`.**
