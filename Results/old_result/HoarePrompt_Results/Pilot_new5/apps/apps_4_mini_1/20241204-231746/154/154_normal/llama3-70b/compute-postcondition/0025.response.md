According to the code, the `for` loop iterates over the variable `j` starting from 1 up to and including `M`. The loop will execute again for the next value of `j` if it is less than or equal to `M`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is currently at the value 1 (for the first iteration). For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the next value of `j` will be 2. 

Additionally, for the loop to continue executing, the condition for `j` must hold true, which means `j` should still be less than or equal to `M`. Since `M` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop can execute again as long as `M` is at least 2.

State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `M` must be greater than or equal to 2, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers, and `dp` remains updated with `dp[i][j]` equal to `max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1)` where `i` is `k + 1` and `j` is 2**
