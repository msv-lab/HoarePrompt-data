Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45; `M` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `M` ≤ 2·10^9; `t` is a list of `k` positive integers where each integer `t[j]` is such that 1 ≤ `t[j]` ≤ 1000000; `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the elements in `t`; `max_points` is 0; `complete_tasks` is equal to the number of elements in `t` for which remaining_time was sufficient to allow at least one subtask to be solved; `time_used` remains 0; `remaining_time` is reduced by the total time spent on all completed subtasks, where total time is the sum of `max_subtasks_for_this_task * t[j]` for all `j` where `remaining_time` was sufficient; `subtasks_solved` is the total number of subtasks solved across all tasks that were feasible.**
