The code `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]` assigns the value of `dp[i][j - 1]` to `dp[i][j]`. The variable `i` is initialized as `k + 1`, which indicates that we are accessing the `dp` array at the row `k + 1`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `M`, `t`) are unaffected by this assignment. 

Since `i` is equal to `k + 1`, the assignment essentially updates the `k + 1`-th row of the `dp` array at column `j` with the value from the `k + 1`-th row at column `j - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `M` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers, `dp` remains updated with `dp[k + 1][j]` being equal to `dp[k + 1][j - 1]`, `i` is `k + 1`**.
