Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `M` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers, `dp[i][j]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1` if `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`, while `dp[i][j - 1]` remains 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 2.***
