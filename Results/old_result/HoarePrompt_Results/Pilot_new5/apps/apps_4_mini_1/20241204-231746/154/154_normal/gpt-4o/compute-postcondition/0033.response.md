The value of `points` is calculated by multiplying `complete_tasks` by `(k + 1)`. The initial state dictates that `complete_tasks` has been incremented by 1, so its new value is `complete_tasks + 1`. The calculation for `points` thus becomes `(complete_tasks + 1) * (k + 1)`. Other variables remain unchanged. The output state reflects the updated value of `points`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45, `complete_tasks` is updated to `complete_tasks + 1`, `time_used` is equal to (complete_tasks + 1) * total_time_per_task, and `points` is equal to (complete_tasks + 1) * (k + 1).**
