Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `M` is greater than or equal to 3, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers, `i` is `k + 1`, `j` is 3, and `dp[k + 1][3]` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `dp[k][3 - t[k]] + 1` if `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`. The value of `dp[k + 1][2]` remains unchanged.***
