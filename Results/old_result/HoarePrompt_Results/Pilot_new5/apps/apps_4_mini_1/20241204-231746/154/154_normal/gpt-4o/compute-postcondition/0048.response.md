Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45; `subtask_time` is the next value in `t`, `remaining_time` must be greater than or equal to `subtask_time`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is calculated as `remaining_time // subtask_time`, `subtasks_solved` is increased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`, `current_index` must be less than `len(t) - 1; max_subtasks_for_this_task is `remaining_time // subtask_time`.**
