n is a positive integer representing the number of tasks (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), k is a positive integer representing the number of subtasks in each task (1 ≤ k ≤ 45), M is a non-negative integer representing the total available time in minutes (0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9), and t is a list of k positive integers where each element t[j] (1 ≤ t[j] ≤ 1000000) represents the time required to solve the j-th subtask.
