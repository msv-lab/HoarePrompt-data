The expression `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1)` updates `dp[i][j]`. The initial state indicates that `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i][j - 1]` before this operation, meaning it is dependent on the value of `dp[i][j - 1]`. Given that `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`, it allows the calculation of `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]]`, which is a value from the previous row of the `dp` table at the column `j - t[i - 1]`.

Thus, the output state reflects the updated value of `dp[i][j]`, which is now the maximum of its previous value or the value `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1` (which is the value computed using the previous row plus one). The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `M` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers, `i` is `k + 1`, `j` is 1, and `dp[i][j]` is now equal to max(`dp[i][j]`, `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`)**.
