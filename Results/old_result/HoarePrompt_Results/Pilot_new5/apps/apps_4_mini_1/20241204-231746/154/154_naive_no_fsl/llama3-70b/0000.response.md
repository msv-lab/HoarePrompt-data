Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic needed to determine the maximum points Polycarp can earn given the constraints. 

### Reasoning:
1. **Dynamic Programming Table Initialization**: The dynamic programming (DP) table `dp[i][j]` is being initialized in a way that does not accurately capture the scoring system. The way the program calculates points for each subtask and sums them does not take into consideration that completing a task gives an extra point.

2. **Handling Points Calculation**: The sum of points being calculated at the end does not correctly account for the extra point awarded for fully completing a task. The current implementation counts points for every subtask completed but fails to adequately track or award the bonus points for completing whole tasks.

3. **Example Failure**: Consider the input:
   ```
   2 3 10
   1 1 1
   ```
   - Expected output: 5 (Complete both tasks, earning 3 points each for the subtasks and 2 bonus points for completing both tasks).
   - Actual behavior: The current program would not yield the correct maximum points because it doesnâ€™t properly calculate the total points considering full task completions.

Therefore, due to the miscalculation of points and the absence of logic to correctly award bonus points for full task completions, the program is incorrect as it fails to handle all potential input cases correctly.
