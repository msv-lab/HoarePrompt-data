The variable `points` is assigned the value of `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`. The value of `complete_tasks` is currently 0, and since `k` is a positive integer between 1 and 45, `k + 1` will range from 2 to 46. Therefore, the value of `points` will also be 0 regardless of the value of `k`. The states of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45, `M` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `M` ≤ 2·10^9, `t` is a list of `k` positive integers where each integer `t[j]` is such that 1 ≤ `t[j]` ≤ 1000000, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the elements in `t`, `max_points` is 0, `complete_tasks` is 0, `time_used` is 0, and `points` is 0.**
