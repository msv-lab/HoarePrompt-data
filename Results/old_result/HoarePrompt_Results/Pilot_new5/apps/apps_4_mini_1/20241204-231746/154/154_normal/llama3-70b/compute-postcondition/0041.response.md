The line of code `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]` updates the value of `dp[i][j]` to be equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`. The value of `i` is `k + 1` and `j` is 2. The precondition states that `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`, but this is not relevant to the current line of code since it simply copies the value from `dp[i][j - 1]`.

The values of `n`, `k`, `M`, `t`, and the conditions regarding `j` and `t` are not affected by this line. Hence, we keep the original preconditions intact.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `M` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers, `i` is `k + 1`, `j` is 2, and `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`.**
