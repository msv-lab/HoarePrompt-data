Functionality: ** The function accepts three integers, `n`, `k`, and `M`, as well as a list `t` of `k` integers. It calculates the maximum number of items that can be selected from the given items in `t` without exceeding the total weight `M`. The function outputs the sum of the maximum number of items that can be selected for each `M` value, along with the count of instances where the maximum number of items matches the number of items selected. However, it does not directly use the parameter `n`, which may indicate a lack of usage or expected functionality in the computation. **
