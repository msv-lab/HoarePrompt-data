To determine if the given program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description, we need to analyze its behavior based on the input values of `x`, `y`, and `z`.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_upvotes` is initialized to `x` (the known upvotes).
   - `max_upvotes` is initialized to `x + z` (the case where all unknown votes are upvotes).
   - `min_downvotes` is initialized to `y` (the known downvotes).
   - `max_downvotes` is initialized to `y + z` (the case where all unknown votes are downvotes).

2. **Logic Evaluation**:
   - The program first checks if `max_upvotes` is less than `min_downvotes`. If it is true, it means even in the best case for upvotes (maximum upvotes), they are still less than the minimum downvotes. Thus, the result is printed as `'-'`.
   - If the first condition is false, it checks if `max_downvotes` is less than `min_upvotes`. If true, it means even in the best case for downvotes, they still cannot exceed the minimum upvotes, so it prints `'+'`.
   - If both conditions are false, it means there is an overlap between maximum downvotes and minimum upvotes or potentially equal values, leading to uncertainty in the result, thus it prints `'?'`.

### Cases Considered:
- **Case 1**: When `z = 0` (no unknown votes). The program correctly identifies the situation since it directly compares known upvotes and downvotes.
- **Case 2**: When `z > 0`, the program correctly evaluates potential outcomes based on the maximum and minimum thresholds of upvotes and downvotes.
- **Case 3**: The program accurately reflects the uncertainty when there is a possibility of different outcomes based on unknown votes.

### Conclusion:
The program effectively handles all specified scenarios from the problem description, including the conditions for certain results (`+`, `-`, `0`) and the uncertain outcome (`?`). 

### Verdict:
Correctness: **True** 

The program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description consistently for all input scenarios.
