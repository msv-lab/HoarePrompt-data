To verify the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze it against the problem description and consider all potential edge cases.

### Problem description review:
- We are given three integers: `x` (upvotes), `y` (downvotes), and `z` (unknown votes).
- The output should be:
  - "+" if there will always be more upvotes than downvotes.
  - "-" if there will always be more downvotes than upvotes.
  - "0" if the upvotes equal downvotes.
  - "?" if the outcome can be both "+" and "-" based on different voting scenarios with the unknown voters.

### Program review:
```python
def func():
    (x, y, z) = map(int, input().split())
    min_upvotes = x
    max_upvotes = x + z
    min_downvotes = y
    max_downvotes = y + z
    if max_upvotes < min_downvotes:
        print('-')
    elif max_downvotes < min_upvotes:
        print('+')
    else:
        print('?')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables Calculation:**
   - `min_upvotes = x`: This represents the minimum number of upvotes, which is simply the known upvotes since unknown votes could potentially not contribute to it.
   - `max_upvotes = x + z`: This is the maximum number of upvotes, assuming all unknown votes are upvotes.
   - `min_downvotes = y`: This is the minimum number of downvotes.
   - `max_downvotes = y + z`: This is the maximum number of downvotes, assuming all unknown votes are downvotes.

2. **Condition Checks:**
   - The first condition checks if the maximum possible upvotes (`max_upvotes`) is less than the minimum possible downvotes (`min_downvotes`). If true, output is `'-'`.
   - The second condition checks if the maximum possible downvotes (`max_downvotes`) is less than the minimum possible upvotes (`min_upvotes`). If true, output is `'+'`.
   - If neither condition holds, it means that both outcomes are possible, leading to an uncertain result, hence output `'?'`.

### Edge Cases:
The program needs to be tested against potential edge cases. Let's consider:

- Case where `x = 0`, `y = 0`, `z = 1`:
  - This situation should yield `"?"` because the unknown vote could favor either side.
- Case where `x = 1`, `y = 1`, `z = 0`:
  - This should yield `"0"` as there are equal votes.
- Case where `x = 3`, `y = 7`, `z = 0`:
  - This yields `'-'` because there are more downvotes than upvotes without uncertainty.
- Case where `x = 0`, `y = 1`, `z = 1`:
  - This yields `"?"` because the unknown could be an upvote or downvote.

### Conclusion:
The conditions in the provided program correctly handle all the cases based on the problem description. Each possible input leads to the expected output according to the defined rules and conditions.

Correctness: **True**.
