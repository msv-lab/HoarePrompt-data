Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Here's the explanation of how it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three integers, `x`, `y`, and `z`, representing the number of upvotes, downvotes, and uncertain votes, respectively. This matches the input specification in the problem description.

2. **Logical Conditions**:
   - The program calculates:
     - `min_upvotes = x` (minimum upvotes is the number of certain upvotes)
     - `max_upvotes = x + z` (maximum upvotes is the certain upvotes plus all uncertain votes being upvotes)
     - `min_downvotes = y` (minimum downvotes is the number of certain downvotes)
     - `max_downvotes = y + z` (maximum downvotes is the certain downvotes plus all uncertain votes being downvotes)
   
3. **Decision Making**:
   - The program first checks if `max_upvotes < min_downvotes`. If this condition is true, it means that the maximum possible upvotes (including all uncertain votes) are still less than the minimum downvotes. In this case, it correctly outputs `'-'`, indicating that downvotes definitely outnumber upvotes.
   - The next check is if `max_downvotes < min_upvotes`. If this condition holds, it means that even with all uncertain votes counted as downvotes, they cannot surpass the minimum upvotes (which are fixed). In this case, it outputs `'+'`, indicating that upvotes definitely outnumber downvotes.
   - If neither condition is met, this implies that there is an overlap or uncertainty in the results based on the uncertain votes. The program thus outputs `'?'`, indicating that the result is uncertain.

4. **Coverage of All Cases**:
   - The logic covers all possible scenarios:
     - If all certain votes lead to a clear result (`+`, `-`, or `0`), the program outputs the correct symbol.
     - If the uncertain votes create ambiguity about the final outcome, it outputs `'?'.`
   - The inclusion of all possible values for `x`, `y`, and `z` within the specified range (0 to 100) ensures that the program adheres to the constraints provided in the problem description.

Overall, the program's logic aligns perfectly with the requirements specified in the problem description, leading to the conclusion that the implementation is correct.
