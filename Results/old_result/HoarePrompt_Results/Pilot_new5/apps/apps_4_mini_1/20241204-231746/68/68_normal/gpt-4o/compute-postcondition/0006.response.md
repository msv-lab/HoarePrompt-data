The code `print('-')` will output a string `'-'` to the console, but it does not change the values of any variables. The initial conditions regarding the variables remain valid, and no variables have been modified. Therefore, the output state will include all the information from the initial state.

Output State: **`x` is an integer in the range 0 to 100; `y` is an integer in the range 0 to 100; `z` is an integer in the range 0 to 100; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`; `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`; the current value of `max_upvotes` is less than the current value of `min_downvotes`.**
