The value of the variables does not change due to the `break` statement. However, it means that we exit the most internal loop immediately. Since the current value of `unrated` is False, and no other variables are affected, the output state remains the same except for indicating the loop exit.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000; `ratings_before` contains `n` integers; `ratings_after` contains `n` integers; `rated` remains False or True depending on the conditions met during the loop; `unrated` is False; `maybe` remains True; `i` is still 0; `j` will be `n` after the loop execution ends; the current value of `unrated` is False and we break out of the most internal loop.**
