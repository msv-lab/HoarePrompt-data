According to the code, the loop executes as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, after the last iteration, `i` will become 1, and `n` must still be at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `i` is 1**
