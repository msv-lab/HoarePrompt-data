The value of `rated` is assigned the boolean value `True`. The states of `n` and `i` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `i` is 1, and `rated` is True.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `i` is 1, `rated` is True**.
