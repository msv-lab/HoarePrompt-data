The variable `unrated` is assigned the value `False`. Other variables (`n`, `j`, `i`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State remains consistent with the precondition, with the update reflecting the change to `unrated`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `j` is `i + 2`, where `n` must be greater than `i + 2; `unrated` is False**.
