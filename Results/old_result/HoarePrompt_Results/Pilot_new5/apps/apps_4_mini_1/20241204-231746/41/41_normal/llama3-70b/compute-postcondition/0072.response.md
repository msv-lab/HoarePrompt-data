Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 1000 \), `i` is less than `n - 1`, and `unrated` remains `False`. If `unrated` is `False`, then `j` is set to \( n - 1 \), and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, no changes are made as the else part does not exist.***
