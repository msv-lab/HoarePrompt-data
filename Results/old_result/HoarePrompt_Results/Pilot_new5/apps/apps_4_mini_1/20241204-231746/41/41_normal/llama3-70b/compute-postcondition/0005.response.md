`ratings_before` is modified by appending the value of `a`, which was obtained from user input. The variable `n` remains unchanged and continues to satisfy the condition \(2 \leq n \leq 1000\). The values of `a` and `b` remain as integers obtained from user input, and the state of `ratings_before` is updated to include the new value.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `a` is an integer obtained from user input; `b` is an integer obtained from user input; `ratings_before` has the value `ratings_before.append(a)`**.
