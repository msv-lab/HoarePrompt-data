The values of `a` and `b` are assigned new values based on the input from the user, which are split into two integers. The precondition states that `ratings` includes the tuple `(a, b)`, so after the input, `ratings` will also reflect the new values of `a` and `b`. The other variables, `n` and `_`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `_` is 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, and `ratings` includes the tuple `(a, b)` with the new values of `a` and `b`.**
