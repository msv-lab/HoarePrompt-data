Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000; `rated` is False, indicating that all pairs of ratings are equal between `ratings_before` and `ratings_after`; `unrated` is False, confirming that not all pairs of ratings are equal; `i` is `n` after all iterations of the loop are complete; `j` remains beyond the last index.**
