The variable `ratings_before` is initialized as an empty list. The previous state of `n` remains unaffected since the initialization of `ratings_before` does not depend on or change any existing variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `ratings_before` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `ratings_before` is an empty list.**
