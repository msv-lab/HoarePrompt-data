According to the code, the for loop starts iterating from 1 and goes up to `n-1`. This means that for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2, which is already satisfied given that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000. 

At the start of the loop, the variable `i` should be initialized to 1, which is the first value in the range. Additionally, since `ratings` contains `n` tuples, we can acknowledge that the loop will access elements of `ratings` using the index `i`.

The states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `i` is now 1 (the starting index for the loop).
- The `ratings` list is valid and contains `n` tuples, which implies that it can be indexed from 0 to `n-1`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `ratings` contains `n` tuples, `is_rated` is False, `is_unrated` is False, `i` is 1**
