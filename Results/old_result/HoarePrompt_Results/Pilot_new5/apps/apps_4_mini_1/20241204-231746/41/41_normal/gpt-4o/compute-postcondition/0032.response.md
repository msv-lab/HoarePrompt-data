The value of `is_unrated` is assigned `True`, but it already has that value based on the initial state. Therefore, no changes occur to the variables. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000; `ratings` contains `n` tuples; `is_rated` is False; `is_unrated` is True; `i` is 2**
