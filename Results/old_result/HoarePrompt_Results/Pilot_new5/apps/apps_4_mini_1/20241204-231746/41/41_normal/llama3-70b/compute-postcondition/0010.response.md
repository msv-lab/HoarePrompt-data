The line `ratings_after.append(b)` adds the value of `b` to the list `ratings_after`. Since `ratings_after` already has the value from the previous line of code, this operation will update the list to include an additional entry corresponding to the value of `b`. The variable `ratings_before` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. 

Thus, the Output State is:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000
- `a` is a new user input integer
- `b` is a new user input integer
- `ratings_before` has the value indicating that `a` has been added to the list
- `ratings_after` now has the value indicating that both `b` and the previous value have been added to the list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `a` is a new user input integer; `b` is a new user input integer; `ratings_before` has the value indicating that `a` has been added to the list; `ratings_after` has the value indicating that both `b` and the previous values have been added to the list.**
