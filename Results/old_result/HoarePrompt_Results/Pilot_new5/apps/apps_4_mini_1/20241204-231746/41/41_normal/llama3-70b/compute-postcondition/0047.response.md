According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit of the `range`, which is `n`. The loop will execute for values of `j` starting from `i + 1` up to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` would have been less than `n`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented by 1 from its last value. 

Since the loop starts with `j = i + 1`, if it executed its body successfully in the last iteration, `j` must have been equal to `i + 1` in that iteration. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1, making it `j = i + 2`, and for the loop to run, `j` must be less than `n`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000; `ratings_before` contains `n` integers; `ratings_after` contains `n` integers; `unrated` is False; `rated` is either False or True depending on the conditions met during the loop; `maybe` remains True; `j` is equal to `i + 2` and must be less than `n`.**
