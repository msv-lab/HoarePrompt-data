The variable `maybe` is assigned the value `True`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `ratings_before` contains `n` integers obtained from user input; `ratings_after` contains `n` integers obtained from user input; `rated` is False; `unrated` is True; `maybe` is True.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `ratings_before` contains `n` integers obtained from user input; `ratings_after` contains `n` integers obtained from user input; `rated` is False; `unrated` is True; `maybe` is True.**
