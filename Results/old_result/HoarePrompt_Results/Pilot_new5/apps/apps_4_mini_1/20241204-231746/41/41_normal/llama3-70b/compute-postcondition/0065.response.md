According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the value of `j` and `n`. The loop starts at `j = i + 1` and continues until `j < n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than `n - 2`, which means `j` is currently `i + 2` or higher, depending on the number of iterations completed.

Given that `j` starts from `i + 1`, the next value for `j` in the next iteration will be `j + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`. 

Since `j` is currently at least `i + 1`, the next value of `j` will be `i + 2`. As `i` is less than `n - 2`, this means `j` will be `i + 2` next, which is still less than `n`.

To summarize:
- `j` will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration, which will make it `i + 2`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be greater than `i + 2`.

Thus, the adjusted state at the beginning of the next iteration of the loop will be:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `j` is `i + 2`**
