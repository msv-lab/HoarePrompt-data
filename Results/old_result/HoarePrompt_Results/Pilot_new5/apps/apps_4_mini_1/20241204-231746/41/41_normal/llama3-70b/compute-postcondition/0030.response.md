The variable `unrated` is assigned the value `False`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, and `j`) are not affected. Since we know that `j` is `i + 3` and `n` is greater than `i + 3`, we can state that `n` is greater than `j`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000; `j` is `i + 3` with `n` greater than `j`; `unrated` is False**.
