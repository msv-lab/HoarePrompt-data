The variable `unrated` is assigned the value `False`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, and `j`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `j` is `i + 2`, and `unrated` is `False`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `j` is `i + 2`, `unrated` is False**.
