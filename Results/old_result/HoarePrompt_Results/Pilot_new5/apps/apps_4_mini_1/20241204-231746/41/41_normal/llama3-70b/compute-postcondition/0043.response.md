According to the code, the loop executes as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `j` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to 3. Additionally, `j` must be less than `n` for the loop to continue. Since `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, and `j` is currently 2, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `ratings_before` contains `n` integers, `ratings_after` contains `n` integers, `unrated` is False, `rated` is either False or True depending on the conditions met during the loop, `maybe` remains True, `i` is 1, `j` is 3**
