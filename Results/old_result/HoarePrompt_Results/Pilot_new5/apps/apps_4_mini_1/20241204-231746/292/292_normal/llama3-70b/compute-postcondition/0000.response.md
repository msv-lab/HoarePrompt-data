In the given code, `a` and `b` are assigned new values through the `map(int, input().split())` function, which takes input from the user and splits it into two parts, converting them into integers. The previous condition that `1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10` still holds true after this execution, but the specific values of `a` and `b` will be updated based on user input.

Since the actual input values are not known, `a` and `b` will now be specific integers within the bounds mentioned.

Output State: **`1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10`, where `a` and `b` are the integers provided as input**.
