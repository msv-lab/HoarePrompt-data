In the given initial state, `a` can take values of 9, 18, or 27. Consequently, the value of `b` is at least `2 * a`, which means `b` can be at least 18, 36, or 54 depending on the value of `a`. The variable `years` is set to 1.

The code modifies `b` by doubling its value with the operation `b *= 2`. This means that the new value of `b` will be twice its previous value.

For each potential value of `a`, we can calculate the corresponding minimum possible value of `b` before and after the operation:

1. If `a = 9`, then `b` is at least `2 * 9 = 18`. After doubling, `b` will be at least `36`.
2. If `a = 18`, then `b` is at least `2 * 18 = 36`. After doubling, `b` will be at least `72`.
3. If `a = 27`, then `b` is at least `2 * 27 = 54`. After doubling, `b` will be at least `108`.

Thus, after executing the code, the values of `a` and `years` remain unchanged, while `b` is updated based on the value of `a`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `1 ≤ a ≤ 3`, `a` is either 9, 18, or 27; `b` is at least 36 if `a` is 9, at least 72 if `a` is 18, at least 108 if `a` is 27; `years` is 1.

Output State: **`1 ≤ a ≤ 3`, `a` is either 9, 18, or 27; `b` is at least 36, 72, or 108; `years` is 1**.
