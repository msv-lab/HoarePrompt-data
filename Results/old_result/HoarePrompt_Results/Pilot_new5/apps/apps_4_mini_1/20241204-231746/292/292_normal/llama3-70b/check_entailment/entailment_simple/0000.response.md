Correctness: **True**

The provided program accurately implements the requirements stated in the problem description. Here’s a breakdown of how it does so:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers, `a` and `b`, which represent the weights of Limak and Bob. This matches the problem description that specifies the weights will be provided in a single line of input.

2. **Weight Growth Logic**: The program uses a `while` loop to continue processing as long as Limak's weight (`a`) is less than or equal to Bob's weight (`b`). Inside the loop:
   - Limak's weight is tripled (`a *= 3`).
   - Bob's weight is doubled (`b *= 2`).
   This behavior matches the problem's description that states Limak's weight triples and Bob's weight doubles every year.

3. **Year Count**: The variable `years` is incremented with each iteration of the loop, effectively counting the number of years until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's weight. This is precisely what the problem asks for: determining the number of full years after which Limak's weight becomes strictly greater than Bob's.

4. **Output**: Once the loop exits (indicating Limak's weight is now greater than Bob's), the program prints the total number of years counted, which aligns with the output specification of the problem.

5. **Correctness Across Edge Cases**: The program is designed to handle the minimum and maximum constraints effectively, given that `1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10`. All possible combinations within this range are addressed, and the weight calculations will lead to Limak being heavier than Bob within a reasonable number of iterations.

In conclusion, the program meets all the specified requirements and correctly performs the necessary calculations, thus fulfilling the problem description.
