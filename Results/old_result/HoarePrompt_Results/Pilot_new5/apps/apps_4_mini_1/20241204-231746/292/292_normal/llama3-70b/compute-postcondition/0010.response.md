To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition `a <= b`. 

From the given states:
- `a` can be 9, 18, or 27.
- `b` can be 36, 72, or 108.

Since we know that `a` is between 1 and 3 inclusive but can only take values of 9, 18, or 27, this means that `a` must be adjusted since its possible values are greater than the minimum value of 1. 

For the loop `while a <= b` to execute one more time, the relationship between `a` and `b` must be such that `a` is still less than or equal to `b`. Since both 9, 18, and 27 are all less than the possible values for `b` (which are at least 36), we see that the loop can indeed execute again, but we must ensure that `a` remains within the specified range.

Thus, we need to change the constraints on `a` so that it is guaranteed to execute again without altering `b`, as `b` is already at least 36. 

In conclusion, the state must be adjusted to ensure that `a` remains less than or equal to `b` (meaning `a` should stay at least 9). 

State: **`1 ≤ a ≤ 3`, `a` must be at least 9, `b` is at least 36, `years` is 2**
