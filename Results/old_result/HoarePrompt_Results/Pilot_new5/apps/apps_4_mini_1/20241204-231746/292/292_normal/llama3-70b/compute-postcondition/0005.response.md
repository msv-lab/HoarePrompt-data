The value of `years` is incremented by 1. The initial state states that `years` is 0, so after executing the code, `years` will be 1. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `1 ≤ a ≤ 3`, `a` is either 3, 6, or 9; `b` is at least `2 * a`; `years` is 1.

Output State: **`1 ≤ a ≤ 3`, `a` is either 3, 6, or 9; `b` is at least `2 * a`; `years` is 1**.
