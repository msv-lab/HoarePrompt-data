The variable `years` is initialized to 0. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged as the code does not affect them. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input with 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10, and `years` is 0.

Output State: **`a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input with 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10, `years` is 0**.
