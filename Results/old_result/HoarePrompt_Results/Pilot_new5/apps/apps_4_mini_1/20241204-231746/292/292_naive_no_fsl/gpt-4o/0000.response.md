Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. Hereâ€™s a brief explanation of how it works:

1. The program reads two integers, `a` (Limak's weight) and `b` (Bob's weight), from input. It ensures that `a` is less than or equal to `b`, as stated in the problem.
2. It initializes a variable `years` to keep track of the number of years that pass.
3. It enters a loop that continues as long as Limak's weight `a` is less than or equal to Bob's weight `b`.
4. In each iteration of the loop, it updates Limak's weight by tripling it (`a *= 3`) and Bob's weight by doubling it (`b *= 2`).
5. The `years` counter is incremented in each iteration until Limak's weight becomes strictly greater than Bob's weight.
6. Finally, the program prints the total number of years.

The program adheres to the requirement that Limak must be strictly heavier than Bob, and it correctly calculates how many years it takes for this condition to be satisfied. 

The edge cases, such as when both weights are at their minimum (1, 1), are correctly handled, returning 1 as expected. Thus, after considering various potential cases, the program functions as required, leading to the conclusion that it is correct.
