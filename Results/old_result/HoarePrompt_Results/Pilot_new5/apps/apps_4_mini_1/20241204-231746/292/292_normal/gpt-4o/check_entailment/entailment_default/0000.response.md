The provided program calculates the number of years it takes for Limak's weight to exceed Bob's weight by simulating the weight changes over the years. Limak's weight is tripled each year, while Bob's weight is doubled. The program works correctly for the specified input range (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10).

### Assessment of the Code:
1. The code begins by reading the weights of Limak and Bob, ensuring Limak's weight (`a`) is less than or equal to Bob's weight (`b`).
2. It enters a loop that continues as long as Limak's weight is less than or equal to Bob's weight.
3. Inside the loop, Limak's weight is updated by multiplying it by 3, and Bob's weight is updated by multiplying it by 2.
4. The variable `years` is incremented with each iteration to count the number of years until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's.
5. Finally, the number of years is printed.

### Possible Edge Cases:
Given the constraints (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10), the program will handle all valid inputs correctly as per the problem description. The weights will always be in the valid range, and since the weights are guaranteed to change (with Limak's weight growing faster than Bob's), there is no need for additional validation of input values.

### Alignment with Output Hints:
The output hints state that the function correctly handles the input weights by performing the described operations (tripling Limak's weight and doubling Bob's weight) until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's weight. It also mentions that the function does not handle cases where input values are outside the specified constraints, which is acceptable given the problem statement guarantees that the inputs will always be within these bounds.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic specified in the problem description and successfully handles all valid input scenarios as described. Since there are no edge cases that can occur within the given constraints that would cause it to fail, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
