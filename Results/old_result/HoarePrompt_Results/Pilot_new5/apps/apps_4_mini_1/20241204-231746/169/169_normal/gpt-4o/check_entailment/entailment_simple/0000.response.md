Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic outlined in the problem description. Here is why it adheres to the requirements:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes the `stones` variable to 0, which represents the number of stones Vasya has at the beginning.

2. **Processing Operations**: It iterates over each operation in the string `s`. For each operation:
   - If the operation is `+`, it increments the `stones` count, indicating that Vasya added a stone to the pile.
   - If the operation is `-`, it decrements the `stones` count. However, it uses `max(0, stones - 1)` to ensure that the number of stones never goes below zero. This is crucial because the problem states that Vasya can only take stones from a non-empty pile, thus preventing the scenario where he might attempt to take a stone when there are none available.

3. **Final Output**: After processing all operations, it prints the total number of stones left, which represents the minimal possible number of stones that could remain in the pile after all operations have been performed.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles various scenarios:
   - If all operations are `+`, it accurately returns the total number of additions.
   - If there are more `-` operations than `+` operations, the program ensures that it never reports a negative count of stones, returning zero instead.

This approach guarantees that the output meets the requirement of finding the minimal possible number of stones in the pile after executing the operations as described. The logic accommodates all valid inputs within the specified constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). Therefore, the program fulfills the problem's requirements for all possible cases.
