The value of `minus_count` is assigned the result of `s.count('-')`, which counts the number of occurrences of the character '-' in the string `s`. The length of `s`, represented by `n`, remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of symbols "-" and "+"; `n` is the length of `s`; `minus_count` is the count of '-' in `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of symbols "-" and "+"; `n` is the length of `s`; `minus_count` is the count of '-' in `s`.**
