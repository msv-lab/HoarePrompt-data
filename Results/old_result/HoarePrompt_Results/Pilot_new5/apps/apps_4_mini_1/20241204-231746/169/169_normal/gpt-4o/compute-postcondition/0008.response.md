The code updates the value of `stones` by subtracting 1 from its current value. Since `stones` is initially 0, subtracting 1 will result in a value less than 0. However, the `max` function ensures that the value of `stones` cannot be less than 0, so it will remain at 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '+' and '-', `stones` is 0, `operation` is '-', and `stones` remains 0.**
