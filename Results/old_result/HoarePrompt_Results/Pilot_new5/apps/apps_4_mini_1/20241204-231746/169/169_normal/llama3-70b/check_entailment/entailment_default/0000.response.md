To assess the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze both the code and the output hints systematically.

### Problem Description:
Vasya has a pile of stones, and he performs `n` operations represented as a string of "+" (adding a stone) and "-" (taking a stone). The task is to find out the minimal possible number of stones left in the pile after these operations, given that the pile cannot be empty before a "-" operation.

### Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    minus_count = s.count('-')
    plus_count = s.count('+')
    if minus_count > plus_count:
        print(0)
    else:
        print(plus_count - minus_count)
```

### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Counting Operations**: The code counts the number of "-" (minus_count) and "+" (plus_count) operations in the string `s`.
2. **Logic**:
   - If there are more minus operations than plus operations, it prints `0`. This denotes that it is impossible to have fewer stones than `0` because Vasya would not be able to perform more "-" operations than the number of stones available.
   - If there are equal or more plus operations than minus operations, it computes the difference `plus_count - minus_count` and prints that value. This computation represents the net gain of stones after considering all operations.

### Edge Cases to Consider:
- When all operations are "-" (e.g., "----"): The initial number of stones must be at least the length of the string for Vasya to perform all operations. Therefore, the minimal number of stones left should indeed be `0` if he started with enough stones.
- When all operations are "+" (e.g., "++++"): Starting with `0` stones leads to a final count of `4`, which is correctly handled.
- When operations are mixed, particularly starting with many "-", it should still respect that Vasya must have had enough stones to perform all "-" operations.

### Output Hints:
The output hints state that if there are more "-" symbols than "+", it prints `0`. If "+" symbols are equal to or greater than "-", it prints the difference. This aligns with the program's logic and seems to match the requirement of the problem description.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the code and the output hints:
- The code correctly handles the case when there are more "-" than "+" and prints `0`, which is correct.
- It also correctly computes the remaining stones in cases where the "+" operations outnumber the "-" operations, following the problem's description.

Final assessment:
The program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description, covering all potential edge cases mentioned. 

Correctness: **True**.
