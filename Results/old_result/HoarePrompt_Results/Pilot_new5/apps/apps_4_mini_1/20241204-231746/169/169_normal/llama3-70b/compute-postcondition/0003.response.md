`plus_count` is assigned the value of the count of the '+' symbols in the string `s`. The variable `s` remains unchanged, and the count of '+' symbols does not affect `n` or `minus_count`. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of symbols "-" and "+"; `n` is the length of `s`; `minus_count` is the count of '-' in `s`; `plus_count` is the count of '+' in `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of symbols "-" and "+"; `n` is the length of `s`; `minus_count` is the count of '-' in `s`; `plus_count` is the count of '+' in `s`.**
