The value of `stones` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `stones` is unknown, so we cannot determine its exact new value. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `s` is a string of length `n`, `operation` must be the next character in `s`, and since the loop finishes processing all characters, there isn't a next character; `stones` is increased by 1.
