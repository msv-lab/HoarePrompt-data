To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the described problem, we will analyze the code and the problem description carefully.

### Problem Description Recap
Nikolay needs to prepare a compote using fruits in the ratio of:
- 1 lemon
- 2 apples
- 4 pears

Given the counts of lemons, apples, and pears (`a`, `b`, and `c` respectively), we need to find the maximum total number of fruits that can be used in the compote.

### Program Analysis
The code provided performs the following steps:
1. It reads the counts of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`).
2. It calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used based on the availability of apples and pears using:
   ```python
   max_lemons = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)
   ```
3. It then computes the total number of fruits that can be used:
   ```python
   total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4
   ```
4. Finally, it prints the total number of fruits.

### Edge Cases
We need to consider edge cases:
- If any of the fruits is insufficient to make even one compote, e.g., if `a = 0`, `b < 2`, or `c < 4`, the function should correctly output `0` if it were capable of handling `0` counts.
- The minimal count for each fruit is `1`, per the problem statement. Thus the edge cases should be limited to the combinations of `1` and larger numbers, especially because `1` is the smallest viable input.

### Output Hints
The output hints describe how the function computes the maximum possible lemons and the total fruits. The hints correctly outline that the function will print the total number of fruits based on the maximum number of lemons calculated.

### Conclusion
The code appears to correctly implement the logic as specified in the problem description.

#### However, a critical flaw appears:
- The original problem description states that each fruit count is between `1` and `1000`. The function currently does not explicitly check if the number of fruits is less than what's needed to create any compote, which would lead to an incorrect sum for scenarios where fruits are limited (like `1 lemon`, `1 apple`, and `1 pear` would output `0`, but the function would print `0` since it does not allow for `0` inputs).

After analyzing all potential cases, especially the requirement that fruit counts must be `1` or greater, the function is still logically correct for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**. 

The program correctly calculates the maximum total number of fruits that can be used in the compote for valid inputs based on the provided examples and constraints.
