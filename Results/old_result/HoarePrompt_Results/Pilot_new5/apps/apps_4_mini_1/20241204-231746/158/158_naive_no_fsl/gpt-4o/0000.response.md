To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we analyze the code:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    c = int(input())
    max_lemons = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)
    total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4
    print(total_fruits)
```

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads three integers representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears.
2. **Computation of Maximum Lemons**:
   - The line `max_lemons = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)` correctly computes the maximum number of lemons that can be used according to the ratios. It checks how many full sets of (1 lemon, 2 apples, 4 pears) can be made given the available fruits.
3. **Total Fruits Calculation**:
   - The total number of fruits used in the compote is calculated as `total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4`. This correctly sums up the fruits based on the maximum number of lemons that can be used.
4. **Output**: Finally, it prints the total number of fruits used.

### Validating Against Edge Cases:
Let's consider a few edge cases:

1. **Case where one fruit type is zero**:
   - Input: `0`, `1`, `1` (0 lemons, 1 apple, 1 pear)
   - The program will effectively treat `a` as 0, leading to `max_lemons = min(0, 1 // 2, 1 // 4) = 0`, thus outputting `0`, which is correct.

2. **Case where all fruits are below the necessary amount**:
   - Input: `1`, `1`, `1` (1 lemon, 1 apple, 1 pear)
   - Here, `max_lemons = min(1, 1 // 2, 1 // 4) = 0`, so it outputs `0`, which is correct.

3. **Exact fit case**:
   - Input: `1`, `2`, `4` (1 lemon, 2 apples, 4 pears)
   - The program will calculate `max_lemons = 1`, resulting in `total_fruits = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7`, which is correct.

4. **Limiting Case**:
   - Input: `1000`, `2000`, `4000` (1000 lemons, 2000 apples, 4000 pears)
   - The program will calculate `max_lemons = 1000` and output `1000 + 2000 + 4000 = 7000`, which is correct.

After reviewing the program across various edge cases, there are no cases where the program fails to meet the requirements set out in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
After considering the problem description and testing various edge cases, the program correctly computes the maximum total number of fruits Nikolay can use in the compote based on the given ratios.

Correctness: **True**
