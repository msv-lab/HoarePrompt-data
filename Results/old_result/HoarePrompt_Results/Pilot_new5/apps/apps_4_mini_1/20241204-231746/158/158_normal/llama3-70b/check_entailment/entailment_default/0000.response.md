To assess the correctness of the provided program according to the problem description and the output hints, let's break down the components.

**Problem Description:**
Nikolay has a certain number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`). The compote requires fruits in the ratio of 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears. We need to determine the maximum total number of fruits that can be used in the compote based on the available quantities.

**Given Program:**
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    c = int(input())
    min_lemon = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)
    print(min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4)
```

### Initial Assessment:
1. The program takes three integers as input, representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears.
2. It calculates `min_lemon`, which is the maximum number of complete sets of fruits (1 lemon, 2 apples, 4 pears) that can be formed based on the input quantities.
3. The output is computed as `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`, which simplifies to `min_lemon * 7`, representing the total number of fruits used in the compote.

### Edge Cases:
- If Nikolay has very few fruits (e.g., `a = 1`, `b = 1`, `c = 1`), the program should return `0`, since he cannot make any complete set.
- If any of the fruits are not enough to form at least one complete set (e.g., `a = 0`, `b = 2`, `c = 8`), it should still correctly return `0`.
- The program should handle the edge situation where there are excess fruits not required in the proportion to make the complete set. For example, `a = 3`, `b = 7`, `c = 12` should yield `21`.

### Output Hints Analysis:
- The output hints describe the function correctly: it calculates the minimum number of complete sets based on the fruit ratios and outputs the total number of fruits used.
- The hints accurately reflect the logic of the code.

### Conclusion:
The logic of the program is sound. It correctly calculates the number of complete sets based on available fruits and handles edge cases appropriately. The output matches expectations based on the problem description and examples provided.

Therefore, based on the analysis, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**.
