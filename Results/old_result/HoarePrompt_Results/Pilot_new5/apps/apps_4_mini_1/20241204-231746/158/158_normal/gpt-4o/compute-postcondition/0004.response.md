`total_fruits` is assigned the value calculated from `max_lemons`. The expression for `total_fruits` is `max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4`, which simplifies to `max_lemons * (1 + 2 + 4)`, resulting in `max_lemons * 7`. Therefore, `total_fruits` is equal to `max_lemons * 7`. 

The values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `max_lemons` remain unchanged after this computation. 

Output State: **`a` is an input positive integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive; `b` is an input positive integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive; `c` is an input integer; `max_lemons` is equal to `min(a, b // 2, c // 4); total_fruits` is equal to `max_lemons * 7`.**
