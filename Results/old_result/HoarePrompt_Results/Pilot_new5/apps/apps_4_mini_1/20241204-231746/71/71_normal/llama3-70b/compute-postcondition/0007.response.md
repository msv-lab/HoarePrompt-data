The value of `n` is updated by performing an integer division by 10 (`n //= 10`). Since `n` must be greater than or equal to 10, the result of `n // 10` will be at least 1. The value of `w` is already stated to be increased by 1 prior to executing the code, but the exact value of `w` is unknown. Therefore, after running the code, `n` will be at least 1, and `w` will be incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1; `w` is increased by 1.**
