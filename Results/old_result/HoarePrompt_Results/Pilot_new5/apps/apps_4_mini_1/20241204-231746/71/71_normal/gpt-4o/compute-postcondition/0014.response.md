The value of `count_zeros` is incremented by 1. Since `count_zeros` was previously determined to be 1 if the next `digit` is '0' or 0 if the next `digit` is not '0', the output state will depend on its initial value. However, the initial state does not provide the specific value of `count_zeros` before the increment. Therefore, we can state that `count_zeros` has increased by 1.

The other variables remain unchanged based on the provided initial conditions. Thus, the output state is as follows:

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string representing a non-negative integer less than or equal to 2,000,000,000; `k` is an integer between 1 and 9; if the next `digit` is '0', then `count_zeros` is increased by 1, otherwise `count_zeros` remains unchanged, and `to_remove` is still either 0 or 1.**
