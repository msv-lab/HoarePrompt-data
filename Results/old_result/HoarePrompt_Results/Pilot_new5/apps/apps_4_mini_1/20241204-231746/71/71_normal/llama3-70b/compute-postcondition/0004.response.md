The value of `n` is updated by performing an integer division by 10. Since `n` must be greater than 0, the result of this operation will still keep `n` as a non-negative integer. The other variables `k` and `w` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `n` after the division by 10.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0 and now is the result of n // 10; `k` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 9); `w` is 1**
