The value of `w` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `w` is unknown. The precondition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 10 remains valid and unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than or equal to 10; `w` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 10; `w` is increased by 1**
