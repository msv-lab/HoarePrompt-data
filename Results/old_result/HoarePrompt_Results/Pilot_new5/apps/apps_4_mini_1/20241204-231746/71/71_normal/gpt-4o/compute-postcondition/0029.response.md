The code snippet `print(len(n) - 1)` calculates the length of the string `n` and subtracts 1 from it. The result of this calculation is printed, but it does not affect any of the variable states.

The length of the string `n` will be a value greater than 0 since `n` is a non-empty string. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`count_zeros` is the number of trailing zeros in the integer represented by `n`, `to_remove` is the number of non-zero digits before the last `k` zeros, `n` is a non-empty string representing a non-negative integer less than or equal to 2,000,000,000; `k` is an integer between 1 and 9; and the length of `n` is greater than 0.**
