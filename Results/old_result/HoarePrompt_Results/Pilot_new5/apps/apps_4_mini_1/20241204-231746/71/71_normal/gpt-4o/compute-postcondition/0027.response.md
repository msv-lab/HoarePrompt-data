The code `print(to_remove)` outputs the value of the variable `to_remove`. The variable `to_remove` is not affected by the code execution, and its specific value is not provided in the initial state. However, we know that `count_zeros` is equal to `k`, which is an integer between 1 and 9.

Since `to_remove` has not been defined or assigned a specific value in the initial state and is not modified by the code, its value remains unknown. Therefore, we only state the condition of the other variables.

Output State: **`count_zeros` is equal to `k`, `to_remove` is unknown, `n` is a non-empty string representing a non-negative integer less than or equal to 2,000,000,000, `k` is an integer between 1 and 9.**
