Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-empty string representing a non-negative integer less than or equal to 2,000,000,000; `k` is an integer between 1 and 9; if `count_zeros` is equal to `k`, then if `digit` is '0', `count_zeros` equals `k + 1`; otherwise, `count_zeros` equals `k` and `to_remove` is incremented by 1, leading to a break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
