The value of `count_zeros` is incremented by 1, changing its previous value of 0 to 1. The other variables remain unaffected as their values do not change. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-empty string representing a non-negative integer less than or equal to 2,000,000,000; `k` is an integer between 1 and 9; `count_zeros` is 1; `to_remove` is 0; the current value of `digit` is '0'.

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string representing a non-negative integer less than or equal to 2,000,000,000; `k` is an integer between 1 and 9; `count_zeros` is 1; `to_remove` is 0; the current value of `digit` is '0'**.
