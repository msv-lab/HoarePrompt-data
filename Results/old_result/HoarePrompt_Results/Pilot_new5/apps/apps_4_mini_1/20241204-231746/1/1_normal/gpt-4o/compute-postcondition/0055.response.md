Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `bind - 1`; `bind` is not -1; `ind` must be less than `bind - 1;` if the character at index `i` in `s` is ':', then `end_colon` is set to `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
