To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the given conditions:

1. The loop iterates over a range defined by `n - 1` down to `-1`. This means that `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute, as `range(n - 1, -1, -1)` will not yield any values if `n` is 0.
2. The variable `i` starts at `n - 1` and decrements each iteration until it reaches `-1`. This indicates that `i` will take values from `n - 1` to `0` in the first iteration.
3. The presence of `bind` being -1 does not directly affect the execution of the loop but may influence the logic within the loop body if it relies on `bind`.

Thus, to ensure the loop executes, we need the following states:

- `n` must be greater than 0 to create a valid range for `i`.
- `i` can be initialized to `n - 1` (the starting index of the loop).
- The variable `s` is a string that will be used within the loop.

State: **`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |; `n` must be greater than 0; `i` is `n - 1`; `bind` is -1**.
