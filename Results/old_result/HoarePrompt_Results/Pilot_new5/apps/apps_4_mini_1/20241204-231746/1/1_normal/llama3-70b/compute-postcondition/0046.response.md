The value of the variables does not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |, with a length of at least 1; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `n - 2`; `bind` is equal to `n - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
