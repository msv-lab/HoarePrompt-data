The variable `s` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts a string input consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |, with a length between 1 and 500,000. Other variables or states are not affected, so the output state reflects the new value of `s` based on the input received.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |, with a length between 1 and 500,000, now updated to the input value.**
