The variable `ind` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 1. The states of the other variables `s`, `n`, and `i` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |, with a length equal to `len(s)`; `n` is greater than 1; `i` is 1; `ind` is 1.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |, with a length equal to `len(s)`; `n` is greater than 1; `i` is 1; `ind` is 1.**
