According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range defined by `ind + 1` and `bind`. For the loop to execute, the starting value `ind + 1` must be less than the ending value `bind`. Given that `ind` is not -1 and is less than `bind`, we can infer that `ind + 1` is also less than `bind`. Therefore, the loop can execute as long as there are valid values in the specified range.

To summarize the necessary states:
- `n` being greater than 0 is not directly relevant to the execution of this loop.
- `i` is -1 initially, but it will be adjusted to `ind + 1` as the loop starts, so it will take the value of `ind + 1` at the beginning of the first iteration.
- `bind` must not be equal to `ind + 1` for the loop to run, which is ensured since `ind` is less than `bind`.
- `f` and `ans` do not directly affect whether the loop can execute.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
State: **`s` is an input string that is valid, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `ind + 1`, `bind` is greater than `ind + 1`, `f` is True or False, `ind` is valid and less than `bind`, `ans` is 4**
