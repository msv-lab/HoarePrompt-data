The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `bind - 1`; `bind` is not -1; `ind` must be less than `bind - 1;` `start_colon` is the index of the first colon character found in the substring from `ind + 1` to `bind`, or -1 if no colon was found in that range; `end_colon` is `i`, which is `bind - 1`; the character at index `i` in `s` is ':' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
