The value of `segment_count` is assigned 0. The previous value of `segment_count` was less than or equal to 1, which might have been 0 or 1. Setting it to 0 explicitly maintains its value without altering any other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 3 and 100; `ticket` is a string of `n` digits; `segment_length` is 3; `current_sum` is 0; `segment_count` is 0; `target_sum` is the sum of the first three digits of `ticket`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 100; `ticket` is a string of `n` digits; `segment_length` is 3; `current_sum` is 0; `segment_count` is 0; `target_sum` is the sum of the first three digits of `ticket`.**
