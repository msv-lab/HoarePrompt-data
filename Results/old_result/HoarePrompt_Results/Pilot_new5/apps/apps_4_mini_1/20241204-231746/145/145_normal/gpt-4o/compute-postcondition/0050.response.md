The variable `current_sum` is assigned the value of 0. The values of `n`, `ticket`, `segment_length`, `segment_count`, and `target_sum` remain the same and are not affected by this assignment. The initial state indicates that `current_sum` was not equal to 0 before this assignment, so now it will be equal to 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 100; `ticket` is a string of `n` digits; `segment_length` is 3; `current_sum` is 0; `segment_count` is less than or equal to 1; `target_sum` is the sum of the first three digits of `ticket`.**
