According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is an integer between 2 and 100. 

In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 1. For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than 1. 

Therefore, the adjusted states at the start of the next iteration should reflect these changes. 

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 1, `ticket` is a string of `n` digits, `segment_length` is 2, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 1**
