Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine if a given sequence of digits can be divided into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums. 

Here's a breakdown of how the program works:

1. It calculates the total sum of the digits in the sequence.
2. It checks if the total sum is even; if it is not, it cannot be split into equal parts, and the program returns "NO".
3. If the total sum is even, it calculates the target sum for each segment (which is half of the total sum).
4. It iterates through the digits, accumulating their sum (`curr_sum`). Every time `curr_sum` matches the `target_sum`, it increments the `segments` counter and resets `curr_sum` to zero.
5. Finally, the program checks if at least two segments were found (i.e., `segments >= 2`). If so, it returns "YES"; otherwise, it returns "NO".

The algorithm correctly handles various cases, including those where multiple valid segmentations are possible. Since the program accurately represents the conditions laid out in the problem description, it works as intended for all possible inputs within the specified constraints.
