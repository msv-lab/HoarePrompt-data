According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times, where `n` is an integer between 3 and 100. Thus, the loop can execute as long as `n` is not less than 3. The variable `i` will start from 0 and will increment by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n - 1`. 

At the start of the loop, `i` must be initialized to 0, and since `ticket` is a string of `n` digits, the first segment must be valid for the loop to perform its operations. The `current_sum` and `segment_count` start at 0, and `target_sum` is defined as the sum of the first three digits of `ticket`, which is a necessary condition for any operations involving segments.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted to ensure `i` starts at 0, and `target_sum` is calculated correctly based on the first three digits of `ticket`.

State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 100, `ticket` is a string of `n` digits, `segment_length` is 3, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 0, `target_sum` is the sum of the first three digits of `ticket`, `i` is 0**
