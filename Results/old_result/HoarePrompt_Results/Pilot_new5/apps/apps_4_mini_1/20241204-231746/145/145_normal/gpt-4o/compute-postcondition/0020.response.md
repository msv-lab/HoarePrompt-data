Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `ticket` is a string of `n` digits, `segment_length` is 1, `target_sum` is equal to the first digit of `ticket`, `current_sum` is equal to the sum of all digits in `ticket` that were processed, `segment_count` is the number of segments found that match `target_sum`, and `i` is equal to `n - 1` if `current_sum` equals `target_sum` after processing all digits, otherwise `i` is equal to `n - 1` and `current_sum` remains as the sum of the digits processed up to that point.**
