The value of `segment_count` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `segment_count` is unknown. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 3 and 100, `ticket` is a string of `n` digits, `segment_length` is 3, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is increased by 1, `target_sum` is the sum of the first three digits of `ticket`, and `i` is 0.
