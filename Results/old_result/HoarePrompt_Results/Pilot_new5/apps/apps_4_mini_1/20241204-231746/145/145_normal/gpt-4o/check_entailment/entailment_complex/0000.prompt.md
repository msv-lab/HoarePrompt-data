You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Recently Vasya found a golden ticket — a sequence which consists of $n$ digits $a_1a_2\dots a_n$. Vasya considers a ticket to be lucky if it can be divided into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums. For example, ticket $350178$ is lucky since it can be divided into three segments $350$, $17$ and $8$: $3+5+0=1+7=8$. Note that each digit of sequence should belong to exactly one segment.

Help Vasya! Tell him if the golden ticket he found is lucky or not.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 100$) — the number of digits in the ticket.

The second line contains $n$ digits $a_1 a_2 \dots a_n$ ($0 \le a_i \le 9$) — the golden ticket. Digits are printed without spaces.


-----Output-----

If the golden ticket is lucky then print "YES", otherwise print "NO" (both case insensitive).


-----Examples-----
Input
5
73452

Output
YES

Input
4
1248

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example the ticket can be divided into $7$, $34$ and $52$: $7=3+4=5+2$.

In the second example it is impossible to divide ticket into segments with equal sum.
Annotated Functions:
n = int(input())
ticket = input()
print(func_1(n, ticket))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), and ticket is a string of n digits where each digit is a character representing an integer between '0' and '9'.
def func_1(n, ticket):
    for segment_length in range(1, n):
        target_sum = segment_sum(0, segment_length - 1)
        
        current_sum = 0
        
        segment_count = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            current_sum += int(ticket[i])
            if current_sum == target_sum:
                current_sum = 0
                segment_count += 1
        
        if current_sum == 0 and segment_count > 1:
            return 'YES'
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `ticket` is a string of `n` digits, `segment_length` is between 1 and `n-1`, `target_sum` is equal to the sum of the first `segment_length` digits of `ticket`, `current_sum` is equal to the sum of all processed digits in `ticket`, `segment_count` is the number of segments found that match `target_sum`. After all iterations, `current_sum` is equal to 0 and `segment_count` is greater than 1 if the function returns 'YES', otherwise `current_sum` is not equal to 0 or `segment_count` is less than or equal to 1.
    return 'NO'
    #The program returns 'NO' because current_sum is not equal to 0 or segment_count is less than or equal to 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` (between 2 and 100 inclusive) and a string `ticket` of `n` digits. It checks if it is possible to split the digits into multiple segments such that each segment has the same sum, returning 'YES' if such a split is possible and `segment_count` is greater than 1; otherwise, it returns 'NO'. If no valid splitting exists, it will also return 'NO' if either the total processed sum is not zero or if only one valid segment is found.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: ticket is a string of length n consisting of digits, where n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100. The individual digits, represented by a_i, are integers between 0 and 9.
def segment_sum(start, end):
    return sum(int(ticket[i]) for i in range(start, end + 1))
    #The program returns the sum of integers representing the digits of 'ticket' from index 'start' to 'end', where 'ticket' is a string of length n consisting of digits.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters, `start` and `end`, and returns the sum of the integer values of the digits in the string `ticket` from index `start` to index `end`, inclusive. It assumes that both indices are valid and within the bounds of the string's length, which must be between 2 and 100. There are no checks for invalid index ranges, so if `start` is greater than `end` or if either index is out of bounds, the function may raise an IndexError.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
