The code sets `current_sum` to 0. The previous value of `current_sum` was equal to the current value of `target_sum`, which was the sum of the first three digits of `ticket`. Therefore, after executing the code, `current_sum` is now 0 while `target_sum` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 100, `ticket` is a string of `n` digits, `segment_length` is 3, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 0, `target_sum` is the sum of the first three digits of `ticket`, `i` is 0, and `target_sum` remains the same.**
