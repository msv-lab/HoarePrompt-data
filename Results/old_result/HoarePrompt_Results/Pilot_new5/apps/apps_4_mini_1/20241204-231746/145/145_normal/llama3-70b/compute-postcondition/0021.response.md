`curr_sum` is assigned the value `0`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `ticket` is a string of digits of length `n`, `total_sum` is a non-negative even integer, `target_sum` is equal to `total_sum // 2`, `curr_sum` is `0`, `segments` is unchanged, `digit` is the next digit in the ticket, `segments` is incremented by 1.
