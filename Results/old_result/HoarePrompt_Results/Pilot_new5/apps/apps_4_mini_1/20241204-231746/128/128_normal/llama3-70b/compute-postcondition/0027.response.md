Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer, `days` is a list sorted in descending order based on the value of `l - k` for each tuple (k, l), and if `i` is less than `f`, then `sold` is updated to `sold + min(days[i][0] * 2, days[i][1])`. Otherwise, `sold` is updated by adding `min(days[i][0], days[i][1])` while `i` is increased by 1 (but remains less than `n`).***
