To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we analyze the provided state and the loop structure.

The loop iterates over `days`, which is a list of tuples `(k_i, l_i)`. For the loop to execute, `days` must contain at least one tuple. Given that `n` is specified as a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), it implies that the number of tuples in `days` should also be at least 1, since `n` defines the size of `days`.

Considering the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer, ensuring that there is at least one tuple in `days`.
- `f` is a non-negative integer, but it does not directly influence the execution of the loop.
- `days` is a list of tuples, and for the loop to execute, it needs to contain tuples.
- `regular_sales` and `potential_sales_increase` are empty lists, but they do not impact the loop's execution either.

Thus, the primary requirement is that `days` must have at least one tuple for the loop to execute. Since `n` is already positive and thus indicates the number of tuples, we can conclude that the loop can execute without further adjustments regarding `n`, but we can explicitly state the conditions.

After examining these points, here’s the adjusted state:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer, `days` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, (k, l) is the first tuple in `days**.
