Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a non-negative integer `f`, followed by `n` pairs of integers representing the number of products and clients for each day. It calculates the total number of products sold based on the number of clients, prioritizing the first `f` days by allowing double the products to be sold if possible, while for the remaining days it sells based on the available products. The final total sold is printed. It handles up to 100,000 days and large integer values for products and clients, ensuring that the sorting and calculation of sold products respect the constraints provided. **
