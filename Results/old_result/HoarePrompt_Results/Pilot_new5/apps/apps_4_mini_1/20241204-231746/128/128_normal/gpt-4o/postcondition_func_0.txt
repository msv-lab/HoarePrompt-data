The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a non-negative integer `f`, and a list of tuples `days`, where each tuple contains two non-negative integers. It computes `total_sales` as the sum of the minimum values of each tuple and adds the sum of the top `f` potential sales increases from the calculated `potential_sales_increase`. The returned `total_sales` accounts for regular sales and the best potential increases, given that `f` may be less than or equal to `n`.
