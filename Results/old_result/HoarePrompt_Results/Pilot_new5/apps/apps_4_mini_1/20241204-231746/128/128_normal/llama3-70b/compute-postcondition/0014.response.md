According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is given as a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), the loop will definitely execute as long as `n` is at least 1. At the end of the last iteration, the index `i` will take values from 0 to n-1. Thus, before the loop starts, `i` should be initialized to 0. 

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer, `days` is a list sorted in descending order based on the value of `l - k` for each tuple (k, l), `sold` is 0, `i` is 0**
