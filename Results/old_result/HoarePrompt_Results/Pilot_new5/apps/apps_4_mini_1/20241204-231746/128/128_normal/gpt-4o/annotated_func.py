#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), f is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ f ≤ n), and days is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two non-negative integers (k_i, l_i) such that 0 ≤ k_i, l_i ≤ 10^9 for i from 1 to n.
def func_1(n, f, days):
    regular_sales = []
    potential_sales_increase = []
    for (k, l) in days:
        regular_sales.append(min(k, l))
        
        potential_sales_increase.append(min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer, `days` is a list of tuples containing `n` tuples of non-negative integers, `regular_sales` contains `n` values each equal to `min(k_i, l_i)` for each tuple `(k_i, l_i)` in `days`, `potential_sales_increase` contains `n` values each equal to `min(2 * k_i, l_i) - min(k_i, l_i)` for each tuple `(k_i, l_i)` in `days`.
    total_sales = sum(regular_sales)
    potential_sales_increase.sort(reverse=True)
    total_sales += sum(potential_sales_increase[:f])
    return total_sales
    #The program returns total_sales, which is calculated as the previous total_sales value plus the sum of the first f elements from the sorted list potential_sales_increase.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a non-negative integer `f`, and a list of tuples `days`, where each tuple contains two non-negative integers. It computes `total_sales` as the sum of the minimum values of each tuple and adds the sum of the top `f` potential sales increases from the calculated `potential_sales_increase`. The returned `total_sales` accounts for regular sales and the best potential increases, given that `f` may be less than or equal to `n`.
