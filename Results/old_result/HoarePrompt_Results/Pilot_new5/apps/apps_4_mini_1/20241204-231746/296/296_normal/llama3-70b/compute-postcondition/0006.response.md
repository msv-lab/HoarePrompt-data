The code executes a print statement for the variable `k`, which has a fixed value of 2. The value of `n` remains unchanged because the print statement does not alter its value. Thus, the output state will reflect that `k` is printed as 2 and retains its value. Other variables are unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9 and `n` is not equal to 2; `k` is 2 and 2 is printed.**
