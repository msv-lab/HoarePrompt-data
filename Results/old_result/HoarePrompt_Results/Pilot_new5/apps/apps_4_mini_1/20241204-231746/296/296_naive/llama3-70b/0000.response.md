To assess the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step.

The problem description specifies that for a given positive integer \( n \), we need to find a sequence of fractions \( \frac{a_i}{b_i} \) that satisfy certain conditions, including:

1. \( b_i \) divides \( n \) and \( 1 < b_i < n \).
2. \( 1 \le a_i < b_i \).
3. The sum of the fractions equals \( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \).

The provided program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    if n == 2:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        k = 2
        print(k)
        print('1', n // 2)
        print('1', n)
```

### Analyzing the Program

1. **Handling the case for \( n = 2 \)**:
   - If \( n \) is 2, the program correctly outputs "NO". This is because there are no integers \( b_i \) such that \( 1 < b_i < 2 \), as the only integer in that range would be 1, which fails the condition.

2. **Handling values of \( n > 2 \)**:
   - For values greater than 2, the program outputs "YES" and attempts to provide two fractions:
     - \( \frac{1}{n//2} \) (where \( n//2 \) is the largest integer \( b_i \) that is less than or equal to half of \( n \)).
     - \( \frac{1}{n} \).
   - However, the program does not check if \( n//2 \) satisfies the condition \( 1 < b_i < n \). Specifically:
     - If \( n \) is odd, \( n//2 \) will be \( (n-1)//2 \), which is less than \( n/2 \) but greater than or equal to 1. This could potentially fail the requirement that \( b_i \) divides \( n \).
   
3. **Example Case \( n = 3 \)**:
   - For \( n = 3 \):
     - The program will output "YES".
     - It will provide \( k = 2 \), and the fractions will be \( \frac{1}{1} \) (which is invalid since \( 1 \) doesn't satisfy \( 1 < b_i < 3 \)) and \( \frac{1}{3} \).
     - The sum would be \( 1 + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{4}{3} \), which does not satisfy the required sum \( 1 - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{3} \).
   
Thus, because the program makes incorrect assumptions and does not account for the necessary conditions for any integer \( n > 2 \), it fails for cases like \( n = 3 \).

### Conclusion

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not correctly handle cases for \( n > 2 \), specifically when \( n \) is odd, leading to invalid fractions that do not meet the problem's requirements.
