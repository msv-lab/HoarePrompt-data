Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description correctly for all cases. 

### Explanation of Issues:

1. **Handling of Special Cases**: 
   - The program returns 'NO' when `n <= 2`. However, it should only return 'NO' for `n = 2` since a sequence cannot be formed. For `n = 3`, the output should be 'NO' as well, but the program correctly returns 'NO' since 3 is prime and has no divisors other than 1 and itself.
   
2. **Divisor Handling**:
   - The program collects all unique divisors of `n` excluding 1 and `n`. However, it doesn't account for prime numbers correctly. For a prime number `n`, there are no valid divisors, which is correct as per the problem requirement of finding a sequence. Still, the function doesn't explicitly handle prime numbers as a special case and just relies on the empty divisor list to return 'NO'.
   
3. **Sum Condition**:
   - The generated fractions (1, d) where d is a divisor of `n` will not guarantee that the sum of these fractions equals \(1 - \frac{1}{n}\). In fact, for many values of `n`, especially primes or numbers with few divisors, this condition will not be met as only the sum of the fractions can be guaranteed to yield a value less than 1. 

4. **Failure in Edge Cases**:
   - For example, if `n = 4`, the divisors are [2], and the program will correctly output 'YES' with one fraction (1, 2), which leads to the sum \( \frac{1}{2} \). However, \( 1 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \), which the program does not satisfy.

Overall, the program does not ensure that the sum of the generated fractions meets the requirement of being equal to \( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \) consistently across all valid inputs, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
