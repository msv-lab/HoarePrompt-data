Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements stated in the problem description for all cases. Here are the key points of failure:

1. **Output for n = 2**: The program correctly outputs "NO" when `n` is 2, which is in accordance with the problem description since there are no valid divisors `b_i` that satisfy the conditions.

2. **Output for n > 2**: When `n` is greater than 2, the program outputs "YES" followed by the fractions `1` divided by `n // 2` and `1` divided by `n`. However, this does not satisfy the condition that the denominators `b_i` must be divisors of `n`, and they should also satisfy `1 < b_i < n`.

   - For example, if `n = 4`, the program would output:
     ```
     YES
     2
     1 2
     1 4
     ```
     Here, `b_1 = 2` is valid, but `b_2 = 4` is not valid since we require `b_i < n`. Additionally, the sum of these fractions `1/2 + 1/4 = 3/4`, which is not equal to `1 - 1/4 = 3/4`, creating another inconsistency.

3. **General Case**: The fractions provided do not guarantee that they will sum to `1 - 1/n`, as it is not just about the fractions themselves but also about their relationship to `n` and the strict conditions on `b_i`.

In conclusion, the program fails to construct valid sequences for multiple values of `n` greater than 2, and therefore does not meet the problem requirements overall. It does not ensure the correct denominators that divide `n` or that the sum of the fractions equals the specified target. Hence, the program is incorrect.
