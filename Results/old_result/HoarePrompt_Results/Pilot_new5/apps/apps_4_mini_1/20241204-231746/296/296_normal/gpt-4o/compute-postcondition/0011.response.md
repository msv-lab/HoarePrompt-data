According to the code, the loop iterates over values of `i` starting from 2 up to the integer value of the square root of `n`. In the previous iteration, we know that `i` is currently 2. The loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(n))`. 

Given that `n` is greater than 2 and is a positive integer, `int(math.sqrt(n))` will also be greater than or equal to 1. 

Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will increment to 3 in the next iteration. We also need to ensure that `i` (which is now 3) still satisfies the condition `i <= int(math.sqrt(n))`.

Therefore, in the next iteration, `i` will be 3. Since `n` is still a positive integer greater than 2, we need to ensure that `n` must be greater than or equal to 9 in order for `int(math.sqrt(n))` to be at least 3.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 9, `i` is 3**
