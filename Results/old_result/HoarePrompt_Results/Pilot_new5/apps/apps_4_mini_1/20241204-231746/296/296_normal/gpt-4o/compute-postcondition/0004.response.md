According to the code, for the loop to execute, the variable `i` needs to be initialized to the starting value of the range, which is 2. The loop will iterate starting from 2 up to and including `int(math.sqrt(n))`. Given that `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `math.sqrt(n)` will also be greater than 1, ensuring that the upper limit of the range is valid.

Since `divisors` is an empty list, it does not influence the execution of the loop directly; it will be modified inside the loop if `i` is a divisor of `n`.

Thus, to execute the loop correctly, we can summarize the state as follows:

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9 and `n` is greater than 2, `divisors` is an empty list, `i` is 2**
