Postcondition: ***`v` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `n` is an input positive integer, `s` is an input positive integer, and `low` remains less than `high`. If `total` is less than `s`, then `low` is updated to `mid`, where `mid` is equal to `(low + high + 1) // 2` and `total` is the sum of min(mid, x) for each x in `v`. Otherwise, if `total` is greater than or equal to `s`, then `high` is updated to `mid - 1`, while keeping `mid` equal to `(low + high + 1) // 2` and maintaining `total` as the sum of min(mid, x) for each x in `v`.***
