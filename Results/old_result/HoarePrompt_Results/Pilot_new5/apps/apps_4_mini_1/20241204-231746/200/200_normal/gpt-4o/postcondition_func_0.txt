The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `s`, and a list of `n` positive integers representing the volumes of kvass in each keg. It checks if the total volume of all kegs is less than `s`, in which case it outputs -1. If the total volume is sufficient, it calculates the maximum volume that can be left in the smallest keg after trying to fulfill the total desired volume `s` by potentially taking volume from other kegs. Finally, it prints the adjusted minimum keg volume. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result.
