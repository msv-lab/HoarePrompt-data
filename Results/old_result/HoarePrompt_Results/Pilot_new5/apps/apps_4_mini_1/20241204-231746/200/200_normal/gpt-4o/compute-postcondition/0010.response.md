Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000), `s` is a positive integer (1 ≤ s ≤ 10^12), `v` is updated to the list of integers input by the user, `volumes` is a sorted list of integers from that input, `total_volume` is the sum of the elements in `volumes`, `total_volume` is greater than or equal to `s`, `min_keg_volume` is the first element of `volumes`, `remaining_kvass` is equal to `s`, `i` is 0, and the current value of `volumes[i]` is less than or equal to `min_keg_volume`.***
