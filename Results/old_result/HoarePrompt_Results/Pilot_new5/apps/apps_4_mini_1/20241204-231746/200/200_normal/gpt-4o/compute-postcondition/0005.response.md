The `print(-1)` statement outputs `-1`, but does not change the values of any variables in the initial state. The states of the other variables remain valid, so the output state includes all of them unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000), `s` is a positive integer (1 ≤ s ≤ 10^12), `v` is updated to the list of integers input by the user, `volumes` is a sorted list of integers from that input, `total_volume` is the sum of the elements in `volumes`, and the current value of `total_volume` is less than `s`.**
