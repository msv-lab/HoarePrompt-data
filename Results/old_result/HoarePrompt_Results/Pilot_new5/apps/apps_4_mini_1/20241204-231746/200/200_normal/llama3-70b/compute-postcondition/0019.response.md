The value of `mid` is calculated as the integer division of `low + high + 1` by 2. Since `low` must remain less than `high`, it can be inferred that the values of `low` and `high` are valid as integers with `low < high`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `v` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `n` is an input positive integer, `s` is an input positive integer, `low` remains less than `high`, and `mid` is equal to `(low + high + 1) // 2`.

Output State: **`v` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `n` is an input positive integer, `s` is an input positive integer, `low` remains less than `high`, `mid` is equal to `(low + high + 1) // 2`**.
