To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the implementation step by step.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. **Input**: We have `n` kegs and need to pour `s` liters of kvass.
2. **Output**: Return the amount of kvass left in the least full keg after pouring `s` liters, or `-1` if it is not possible to pour `s` liters.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads `n` and `s`, and then reads the volumes of kvass in the kegs.
2. **Total Volume Check**: It calculates the total volume of kvass and checks if it is less than `s`. If true, it outputs `-1`, which is correct since pouring `s` liters is impossible.
3. **Sorting**: The volumes are sorted, allowing easy access to the keg with the least kvass.
4. **Pouring Logic**:
   - It starts with the smallest keg and attempts to distribute the pouring evenly.
   - It checks how much kvass can be taken from each keg while ensuring the least filled keg's level remains as high as possible.
   - The program calculates how much kvass can still be taken after pouring from the other kegs.
5. **Final Calculation**: If there is remaining kvass to pour after the loop, it adjusts the minimum keg volume based on the leftover kvass divided by the number of kegs.

### Correctness Evaluation:
- **Case when `s` liters can be poured**: The logic correctly reduces the amount of kvass in the kegs and determines how much can remain in the least filled keg.
- **Case when `s` liters cannot be poured**: The total volume check at the start ensures that if `total_volume < s`, it immediately returns `-1`.

### Conclusion:
The program behaves as specified in the problem description for all defined cases. It performs necessary checks, processes the kegs correctly, and returns the appropriate results.

Therefore, the conclusion about the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
