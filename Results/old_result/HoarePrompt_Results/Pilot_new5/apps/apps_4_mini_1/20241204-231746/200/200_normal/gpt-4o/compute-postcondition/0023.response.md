Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000), `s` is a positive integer (1 ≤ s ≤ 10^12), `v` is updated to the list of integers input by the user, `volumes` is a sorted list of integers from that input, `total_volume` is the sum of the elements in `volumes` and is greater than or equal to `s`, `min_keg_volume` is equal to `volumes[0]`, if `volumes[i]` is less than or equal to `min_keg_volume`, then `remaining_kvass` is 0 and `i` is incremented by 1, continuing to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1 and `remaining_kvass` is updated to `remaining_kvass - possible_to_take`.***
