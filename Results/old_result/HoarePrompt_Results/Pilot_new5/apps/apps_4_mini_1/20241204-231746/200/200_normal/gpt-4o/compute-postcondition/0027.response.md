The `continue` statement does not change any variable values; it merely skips the current iteration of the loop and proceeds with the next iteration. Therefore, the existing values of the variables remain unchanged, but we acknowledge that we skip the current iteration.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000), `s` is a positive integer (1 ≤ s ≤ 10^12), `v` is updated to the list of integers input by the user, `volumes` is a sorted list of integers from that input, `total_volume` is the sum of the elements in `volumes` and is greater than or equal to `s`, `min_keg_volume` is equal to `volumes[0]`, `remaining_kvass` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` must be greater than `i` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
