Functionality: ** The function accepts two positive integers, `n` (the number of kegs) and `s` (the target volume), along with a list `v` of `n` positive integers representing the kvass volume in each keg. It determines the maximum volume `low` that can be uniformly distributed among the kegs to achieve the total volume `s`. If such a distribution is not possible, it returns -1; otherwise, it outputs the value of `low`. The function also handles cases where the total kvass volume is less than `s` by ensuring that the output is -1 if the conditions are not met. **
