The `continue` statement skips the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Based on the initial state, the values of the variables are unchanged, but we know that the loop is still ongoing.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000), `s` is a positive integer (1 ≤ s ≤ 10^12), `v` is updated to the list of integers input by the user, `volumes` is a sorted list of integers from that input, `total_volume` is the sum of the elements in `volumes`, `total_volume` is greater than or equal to `s`, `min_keg_volume` is the first element of `volumes`, `remaining_kvass` is equal to `s`, `i` is still 0, and the current value of `volumes[i]` is less than or equal to `min_keg_volume, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
