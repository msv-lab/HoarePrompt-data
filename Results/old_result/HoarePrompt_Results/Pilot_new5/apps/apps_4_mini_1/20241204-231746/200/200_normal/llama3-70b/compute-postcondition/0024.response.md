Output State: **`low` is equal to `high`, which implies that the loop has terminated when `low` reached the final value that satisfies the condition. The final value of `total` is the sum of `min(low, x)` for each `x` in `v`. If `total` is less than `s`, it indicates that the original minimum value of `v` was insufficient to reach `s`, and if `total` is greater than or equal to `s`, it indicates that the loop terminated with `low` being the maximum value that meets the condition. The final values of `low` and `high` are equal, and `mid` is the average of the final `low` and `high` values in the last iteration. `v` remains a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `n` is the input positive integer, and `s` is the input positive integer.**
