Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `px` is 0, `py` is 0, `v` is the first element of `a`, `nx` is (v - 1) // y, `ny` is (v - 1) % y, and the absolute difference between `nx` and `px` added to the absolute difference between `ny` and `py` is equal to 1.***
