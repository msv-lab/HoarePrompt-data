The values of `px` and `py` are updated to the values of `nx` and `ny`, respectively. The previous values of `nx` and `ny` are based on the calculations performed earlier in the code. Since there are no other specified outputs or changes in values aside from updating `px` and `py`, the output state reflects the new values of `px` and `py`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 200000; `a` is a list of `n` integers; `px` is now equal to `nx`; `py` is now equal to `ny`; `v` is the second element of `a`; `nx` is (v - 1) // y; `ny` is (v - 1) % y.**
