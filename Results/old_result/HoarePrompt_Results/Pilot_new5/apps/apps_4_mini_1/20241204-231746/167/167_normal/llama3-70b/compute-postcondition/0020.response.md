Functionality: ** The function accepts two positive integers, `x` and `y`, and checks a list of integers `a`. It calculates the coordinates `nx` and `ny` based on the values in `a` and verifies if the movement from one coordinate to another has an absolute distance of exactly 1. If this condition is satisfied for all elements in `a`, the function returns `True`. If any element fails the condition, it returns `False`. The function does not utilize `x` in its calculations, which suggests that it might be unnecessary for the current implementation. **
