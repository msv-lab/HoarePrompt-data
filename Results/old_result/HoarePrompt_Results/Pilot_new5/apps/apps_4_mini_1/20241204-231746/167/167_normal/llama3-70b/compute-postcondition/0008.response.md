The variable `nx` is assigned the value of `(v - 1) // y`, and `ny` is assigned the value of `(v - 1) % y`. The previous values of `v` (which is the second element of `a`) and `y` are not specified but remain unchanged. Since `v` is an integer and the calculation involves basic arithmetic operations, `nx` and `ny` will be updated based on the new value of `v`. The condition states that the absolute difference between `nx` and `px` added to the absolute difference between `ny` and `py` is equal to 1, which may help in determining the relationships between these variables but does not affect the execution of the current code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `px` is (new_v - 1) // y, `py` is (new_v - 1) % y, `v` is the second element of `a`, `nx` is (v - 1) // y, `ny` is (v - 1) % y.**
