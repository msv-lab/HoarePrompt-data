According to the code, the loop iterates over the elements of the list `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another element in `a` after the current element `v`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `v` is the first element of `a`. Since `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, and `px`, `py`, `nx`, `ny` are calculated based on `v`, we need to account for the next element in the list for the loop to continue.

For the loop to execute one more time, `v` must become the second element of `a`, which implies `n` must be at least 2. The indices `px` and `py` will be updated based on the new value of `v`, which will be the second element of `a`. The values for `nx` and `ny` will also need to be recalculated based on the new `v`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `px` is (new_v - 1) // y, `py` is (new_v - 1) % y, `v` is the second element of `a`, `nx` is (new_v - 1) // y, `ny` is (new_v - 1) % y, and the absolute difference between `nx` and `px` added to the absolute difference between `ny` and `py` is equal to 1.**
