The code assigns the values of `nx` and `ny` to `px` and `py`, respectively. The previous values of `px` and `py` were both 0, and after the assignment, `px` will take the value of `nx` and `py` will take the value of `ny`. Since the absolute difference between `nx` and `px`, and between `ny` and `py` is equal to 1, it implies that the only possible values for `nx` and `ny` must be such that they differ from `px` and `py` by 1.

Therefore, after the assignment, we have:

- `px` is now equal to `nx` which is (v - 1) // y.
- `py` is now equal to `ny` which is (v - 1) % y.

The other variables retain their previous state since they are unaffected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `px` is (v - 1) // y, `py` is (v - 1) % y, `v` is the first element of `a`, `nx` is (v - 1) // y, `ny` is (v - 1) % y, and the absolute difference between `nx` and `px` added to the absolute difference between `ny` and `py` is equal to 1.**
