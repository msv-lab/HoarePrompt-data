To determine the correctness of the provided annotated Python program against the given problem description, we need to analyze whether the program successfully computes the required sum of reachable integers for a frog making jumps based on the given integers `a` and `b`, within the constraints described.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The frog starts at position `0` and can jump to `k + a` or `k - b`.
   - The function `f(x)` represents the number of distinct positions the frog can reach from `0` to `x`.
   - We need to compute the sum of `f(i)` for all `i` from `0` to `m`.

2. **Analyzing the Program**:
   - The function `func_1(x, y)` computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`.
   - If `g` (GCD) is greater than `1`, the function reduces `m`, `a`, and `b` by dividing by `g`, and recursively calls `func_2`.
   - When `g == 1`, the program computes the sum of reachable integers up to `m` by first checking if `m` is less than `k = a + b - 1`.
   - If `m < k`, it returns the arithmetic sum of integers up to `m`.
   - If `m >= k`, it calculates the sum of reachable integers based on a derived formula involving `k`.

3. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The program correctly handles the GCD calculation to determine if the jumps can be reduced to their simplest form.
   - For `m < k`, the program returns the correct count of reachable integers, as the frog can only reach positions from `0` up to `m`.
   - For `m >= k`, the logic used to return the sum of reachable integers is based on the observation that positions can be reached in steps of `a` or `b`, which is aligned with the properties of linear combinations of these steps.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The implementation accounts for the boundary conditions when `m` is less than `k` correctly.
   - The range of `m` up to `10^9` is handled due to the mathematical calculations involved which are efficient.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program successfully fulfills the requirements of the problem description by computing the sum of reachable positions correctly through appropriate arithmetic manipulations and properties of GCD.
   - Given the recursive nature of the GCD check and the arithmetic summation logic, it effectively builds upon the problem requirements.

Based on this analysis, we conclude that the program correctly implements the required logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
