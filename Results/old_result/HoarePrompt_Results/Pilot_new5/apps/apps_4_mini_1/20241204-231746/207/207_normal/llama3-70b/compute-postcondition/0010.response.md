According to the code, the loop runs based on the value of `m`. The loop will execute from `i = 0` to `i = m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1 in the next iteration.

Since `m` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^9, the loop can continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `m`. After the last iteration where `i` is 0, the next value of `i` will be 1. The loop will continue if `1` is less than or equal to `m`.

Thus, the new state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`m` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^9, `a` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^5, `b` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^5, `i` is 1**
