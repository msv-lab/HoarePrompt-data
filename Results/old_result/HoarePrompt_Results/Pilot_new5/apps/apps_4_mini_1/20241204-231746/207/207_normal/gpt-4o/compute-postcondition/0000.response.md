The variable `g` is assigned the value returned by the function `func_1(a, b)`. The values of `a` and `b` are positive integers constrained between 1 and 100,000, while `m` is a positive integer constrained between 1 and 10^9. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9; `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^5; `g` is the value returned by `func_1(a, b)`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9; `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^5; `g` is the value returned by `func_1(a, b)`**.
