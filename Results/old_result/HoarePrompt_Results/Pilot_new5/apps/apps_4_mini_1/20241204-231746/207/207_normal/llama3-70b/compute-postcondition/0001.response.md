The variable `dp` is assigned a new list containing `m + 1` zeros. The value of `m` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^9. The states of the other variables `a` and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `dp`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^9; `a` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^5; `b` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^5; `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros.**
