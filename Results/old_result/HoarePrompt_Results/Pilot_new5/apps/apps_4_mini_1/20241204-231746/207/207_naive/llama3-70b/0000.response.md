To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the code step-by-step and verify if it handles all potential cases as described.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input:** The program reads three integers: `m`, `a`, and `b`.
2. **Output:** It needs to compute the sum of `f(i)` where `f(x)` is defined as the number of distinct integers a frog can reach starting from position `0` and making jumps of `+a` and `-b` without going outside the interval `[0, x]`.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Initialization:** 
   - A list `dp` of size `m + 1` is initialized with zeros, except for `dp[0]` which is set to `1`. This means the frog can reach position `0`.
   
2. **Jumping Logic:**
   - The program iterates over each position `i` from `0` to `m`:
     - If `i + a` is within bounds, it adds the current number of ways to reach position `i` to `dp[i + a]`.
     - If `i - b` is non-negative, it adds the ways to reach position `i - b` back to `dp[i]`.
   - This logic does not correctly capture how many distinct integers the frog can reach.

### Potential Cases:
- **Handling of Limits:** The current logic does not seem to handle all potential situations where the frog might not be able to reach certain positions effectively, especially in cases where:
  - The jump size `a` is large compared to `m`, potentially skipping reachable integers in between.
  - The frog may effectively "sit" at a position where it cannot jump backward (due to `b`) when trying to reach earlier numbers.

### Example of Incorrect Output:
Consider the input:
- `m = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 10`.

For the above input:
- `f(0) = 1`, the frog can only remain at `0`.
- `f(1) = 1`, the frog can jump to `1` but cannot go further.
- `f(2) = 1`, same logic as `f(1)`.
- `f(3) = 1`, same logic as `f(1)` and `f(2)`.
- `f(4) = 1`, same logic as `f(1)`, `f(2)`, and `f(3)`.

Thus, `f(0) + f(1) + f(2) + f(3) + f(4) = 5`.

However, in the implementation, it may not account correctly for scenarios where the jumps cannot be made due to the large values of `a` or `b` compared to `m`. 

Therefore, the program fails to account for specific edge cases where the frog has limited movement possibilities due to the sizes of `a` and `b`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description correctly for all potential cases due to the way jumps are handled and counted. There are cases where it will return incorrect counts for `f(i)`.

Correctness: **False**.
