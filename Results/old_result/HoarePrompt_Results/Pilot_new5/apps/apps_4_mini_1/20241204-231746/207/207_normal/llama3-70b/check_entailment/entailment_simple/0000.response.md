The annotated program does not correctly implement the functionality specified in the problem description.

### Issues with the Program:

1. **Dynamic Programming Array (`dp`)**:
   - The intention of the dynamic programming array `dp` seems to be to track the number of distinct integers the frog can reach. However, the way it is being updated is incorrect. The program attempts to simulate the jumps but fails to account for the condition that the frog can only jump to integers within the interval `[0, i]` for each `i` from `0` to `m`.
   - Specifically, the expression `dp[i] += dp[i - b]` is not appropriate. This line is trying to add the number of ways to reach the integer `i` by jumping backward by `b`. This does not logically correspond to the problem's requirement.

2. **Boundary Conditions**:
   - The program does not ensure that the backward jump (`i - b`) is valid before attempting to modify `dp[i]`. This can lead to incorrect updates if `i - b` is not a valid index in the `dp` array.

3. **Final Output**:
   - The program attempts to calculate the sum of the `dp` array, which is not aligned with the requirement to calculate `f(i)` for each `i` in the range from `0` to `m` and then sum those values. The logic to compute `f(i)` correctly is missing.

4. **Performance**:
   - The program creates a list `dp` of size `m + 1`, which is impractical given the constraint that `m` can go up to `10^9`. This would lead to excessive memory usage and is not feasible.

### Conclusion:
The logic implemented in the program does not meet the requirements set forth in the problem description. It fails to correctly calculate the number of distinct integers the frog can reach within the given constraints, and it improperly handles the bounds and updates to the `dp` structure.

Therefore, the correctness conclusion is:

Correctness: **False**
