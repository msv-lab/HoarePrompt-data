According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop is designed to iterate over the range from `i + 1` to `n + 1`. Given that `j` is initially not set, the first iteration will set `j` to `i + 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 1 and less than `n`, and `n` is greater than or equal to 2, allowing for the next value of `j`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must increase by 1 for each iteration. Therefore, after the last iteration, `j` will be set to `i + 1`, and for the loop to run again, `j` must be less than or equal to `n`.

Thus, if `i` is at least 1 and less than `n`, after executing the loop body, `j` will be incremented to `i + 2`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than or equal to `n`.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is at least 1 and less than `n`, `j` is at least `i + 2` and must be less than or equal to `n`**.
