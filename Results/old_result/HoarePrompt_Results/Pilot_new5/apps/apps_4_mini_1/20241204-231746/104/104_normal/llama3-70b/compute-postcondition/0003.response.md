According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is defined as a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, the loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 1. At the end of the last iteration, `max_erase` is 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be valid (which it is given the state), and `i` will start at 0 and increment until it reaches `n-1`. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers from user input where 1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000, `max_erase` is 0, `i` is 0**
