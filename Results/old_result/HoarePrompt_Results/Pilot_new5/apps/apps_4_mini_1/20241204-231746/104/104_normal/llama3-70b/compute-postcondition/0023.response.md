According to the code, the loop iterates over `j` starting from `i + 1` up to `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `i + 2` since the previous condition states that `j` is `i + 2`. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to `i + 3`. 

For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than or equal to `n + 1`. Given that `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, if `j` is currently `i + 2`, then for the next iteration, `j` must be `i + 3`, which means that `n` must be at least `i + 3`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and must be at least `i + 3`, `i` is at least 0 and less than `n`, and `j` is `i + 3`**
