Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and must be at least `i + 3`, `i` is at least 0 and less than `n`, and `j` is `i + 3`. If the condition is satisfied that all elements `a[k] - a[i]` equal `k - i` for `k` in the range from `i` to `j`, then `max_erase` is updated to the maximum of its current value and 2.***
