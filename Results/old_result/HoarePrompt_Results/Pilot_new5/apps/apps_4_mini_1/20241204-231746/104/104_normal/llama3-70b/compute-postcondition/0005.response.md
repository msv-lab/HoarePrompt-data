Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers from user input where 1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000, `max_erase` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and the difference between `a[j]` and `a[i]` equals the difference between their indices (j - i), meaning all values in the sublist `a[i]` to `a[j]` are consecutive integers.***
