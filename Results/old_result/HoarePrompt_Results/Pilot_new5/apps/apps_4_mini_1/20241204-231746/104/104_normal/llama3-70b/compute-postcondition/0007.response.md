Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers from user input where 1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000, `max_erase` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1. If all elements in the range from `i` to `j` in the list `a` maintain the condition that the difference between `a[k]` and `a[i]` is equal to the difference between `k` and `i`, then the program verifies this condition holds true for those indices.***
