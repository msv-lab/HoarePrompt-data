Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is at least 1 and less than `n`, and `j` is not set beforehand. If the condition holds true that for all `k` in the range from `i` to `j`, `a[k] - a[i]` equals `k - i`, then `max_erase` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `j - i - 1`. If the condition does not hold, no changes are made to `max_erase`.***
