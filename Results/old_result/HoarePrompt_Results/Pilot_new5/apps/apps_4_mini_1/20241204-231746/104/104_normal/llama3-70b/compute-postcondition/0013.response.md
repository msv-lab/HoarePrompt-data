Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers from user input where 1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000, `i` is 0, `j` is 3. If the condition `all((a[k] - a[i] == k - i for k in range(i, j)))` holds true, then `max_erase` is updated to the maximum of its current value and 2.***
