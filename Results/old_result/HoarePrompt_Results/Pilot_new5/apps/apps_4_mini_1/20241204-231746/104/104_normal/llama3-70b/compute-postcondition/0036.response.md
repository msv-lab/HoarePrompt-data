`max_erase` is assigned the maximum value between `max_erase` and `j - i - 1`. The previous conditions state that `j` is at least `i + 2` and less than or equal to `n`, meaning `j - i - 1` is at least `1`. Therefore, the value of `max_erase` may increase by at least `1` or remain the same depending on its initial value. The other variables' states are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is at least 1 and less than `n`, `j` is at least `i + 2` and must be less than or equal to `n`, `j` must be less than or equal to `n`, and `max_erase` is updated to the maximum value between the previous `max_erase` and `j - i - 1`.**
