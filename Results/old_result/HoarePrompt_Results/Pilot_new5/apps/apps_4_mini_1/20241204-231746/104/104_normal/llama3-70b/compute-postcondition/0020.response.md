According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 0 and less than `n`, which means `j` is equal to `i + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, the next value of `j` will be `i + 2`. 

To ensure that the loop can execute again, `j` must now be at least `i + 2` and still be less than or equal to `n`. Thus, we require that `n` is at least `i + 2` to allow the loop to run. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `i` is at least 0 and less than `n`, and `j` is `i + 2`.**
