The code `dp[i] = min(dp[i], c[i])` assigns to `dp[i]` the minimum value between `dp[i]` and `c[i]`. The initial state includes that `i` is 1 and `dp[1]` is currently the value of `min(dp[1], c[1])`. Therefore, after executing the code, `dp[1]` will be updated to the minimum of its current value and `c[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `dp[1]` is updated to `min(dp[1], c[1])`**
