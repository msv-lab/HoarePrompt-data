The variable `dp` is assigned a list that contains 31 elements, each initialized to the value of `max_cost`. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged, and thus the initial state of `max_cost` is still valid. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30; `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9; `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9; `max_cost` is 10; `dp` is a list of 31 integers, all equal to `max_cost` (which is 10).

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30; `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9; `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9; `max_cost` is 10; `dp` is a list of 31 integers, each equal to 10.**
