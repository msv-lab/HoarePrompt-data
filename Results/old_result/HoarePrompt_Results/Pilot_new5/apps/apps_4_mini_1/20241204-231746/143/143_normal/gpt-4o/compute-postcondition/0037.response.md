The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `L`, and `costs`. The parameter `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30. The parameter `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9. The parameter `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9. After executing the function body, the program returns the minimum value obtained during the loop execution or remains `max_cost` if the loop did not execute. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n`, a positive integer `L`, and a list of integers `costs`, and to return the minimum value found during the loop or `max_cost` if no values were evaluated. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, L, and costs, and returns the minimum value obtained during the loop execution or max_cost if the loop did not execute.**
