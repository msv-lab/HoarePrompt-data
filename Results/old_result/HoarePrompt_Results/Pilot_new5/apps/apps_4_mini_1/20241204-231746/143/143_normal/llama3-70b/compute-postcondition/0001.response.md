The variable `costs` is assigned a list of integers converted from user input. The input is processed by `input().split()`, which creates a list of strings from the input, and `map(int, ...)` converts each of those strings into integers. The other variables `n` and `L` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30; `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `L` ≤ 10^9; `costs` is a list of integers from input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30; `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `L` ≤ 10^9; `costs` is a list of integers from input.**
