The variable `i` is set to 31, which is outside the valid range for `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 30). The code attempts to update `dp[i]` using the expression `min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] * 2)`, but since `i` is 31, this index is out of bounds for the `dp` array. Therefore, the value of `dp[i]` cannot be computed or updated, and no changes occur to `dp` or the other variables. 

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30; `dp[0]` is min(10, c[0]); `dp[1]` is min(10, c[1]); `dp[2]` is updated to min(dp[2], dp[1] * 2); `i` is 31 and no change occurs to `dp[31]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30; `dp[0]` is min(10, c[0]); `dp[1]` is min(10, c[1]); `dp[2]` is updated to min(dp[2], dp[1] * 2); `i` is 31 and no change occurs to `dp[31]`.**
