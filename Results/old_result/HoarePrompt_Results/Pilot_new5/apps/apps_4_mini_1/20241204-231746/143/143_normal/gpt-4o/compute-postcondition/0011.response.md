The code modifies the value of `dp[i]` by assigning it the minimum of its current value and twice the value of `dp[i - 1]`. The previous value of `dp[i]` is `min(10, c[i])`, and `dp[i - 1]` corresponds to `dp[0]`, which is `min(10, c[0])`. Since `i` is initially set to `1`, we will evaluate `dp[1]` based on the values of `dp[0]` and `dp[1]`.

The updated value of `dp[i]` will be `min(dp[1], dp[0] * 2)`. Given that `dp[i]` is capped at 10, if `dp[0]` has some value less than or equal to 5, `dp[1]` can potentially double that value. If `dp[0]` is greater than 5, the effect of doubling it is still limited by the 10 cap on `dp[i]`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, `dp[i]` is updated to min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] * 2), `dp[0]` is min(10, c[0]), `dp[1]` is min(10, c[1]), and `i` is 1**
