The operation `L -= 1 << i` means that `L` is decremented by `1` shifted left by `i` bits. This operation is equivalent to subtracting `2^i` from `L`. Since `n` is within the range of 1 to 30, and `dp[i]` is defined for `i` in the range of 0 to 30, we know that the value of `i` is also constrained by this range.

The initial state mentions that the current values of `n`, `dp[i]`, `answer`, and `current_cost` are not specified, but they remain within defined ranges or constraints. The decrement operation on `L` directly affects its value.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, `dp[i]` is defined for i in range(0, 31), `answer` is updated to min(answer, current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[29]), `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + dp[i]`, `L` is updated to `L - 2^i`.**
