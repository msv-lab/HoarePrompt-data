According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `n` defined in the for loop. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.

Currently, `j` is 0, so for the next iteration, `j` will be 1, and for the loop to continue executing, `n` must be at least 2 (since now `j` will be 1).

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `L` ≤ 10^9, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and `vol` is 0. `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.**
