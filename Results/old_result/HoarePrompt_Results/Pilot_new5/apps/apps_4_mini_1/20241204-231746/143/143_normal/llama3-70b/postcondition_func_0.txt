The function accepts an integer `n`, a positive integer `L`, and a list of `n` integers representing the costs of bottles. It calculates the minimum cost to achieve a total volume of `L` using the available bottle sizes, which follow the pattern of volumes being powers of 2 minus 1 (i.e., 1, 3, 7, 15, etc.). If it is not possible to achieve the volume `L`, it returns -1. This function does not handle cases where `n` or `L` might be outside their specified ranges since input constraints are assumed to be valid.
