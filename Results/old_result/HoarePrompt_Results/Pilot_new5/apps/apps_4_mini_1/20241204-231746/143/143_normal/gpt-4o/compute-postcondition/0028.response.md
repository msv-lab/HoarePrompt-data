Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30; `dp[i]` is defined for i in range(0, 31). If `L` is greater than or equal to `1 << i`, `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + dp[i]`, and `L` is decreased by `1 << i`. The value of `answer` remains as the minimum of `answer` and `current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[29]`.***
