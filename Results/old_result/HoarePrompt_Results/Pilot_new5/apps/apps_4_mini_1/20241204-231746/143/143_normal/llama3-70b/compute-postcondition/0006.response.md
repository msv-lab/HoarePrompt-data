The variable `vol` is assigned the value `2 ** j - 1`. The initial state indicates that `j` is 0. Therefore, `2 ** j` evaluates to `2 ** 0`, which is `1`. Consequently, `vol` will be `1 - 1`, resulting in `vol` being `0`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected after this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `L` ≤ 10^9, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `vol` is 0**.
