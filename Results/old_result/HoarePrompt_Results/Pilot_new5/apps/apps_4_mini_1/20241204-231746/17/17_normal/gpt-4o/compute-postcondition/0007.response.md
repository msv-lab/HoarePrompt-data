The `print(0)` statement outputs the integer `0` to the console. However, this does not change any variable values or program state. The other variables remain unchanged based on the initial state provided.

The output state retains all the information from the initial state, and since no variables are altered, the output state reflects that the print action occurred without modifying any existing variables.

Output State: **`cnt_1` is an input integer, `cnt_2` is a non-negative integer, `cnt_3` is an input integer, `cnt_4` is an input integer, and the integer `0` has been printed.**
