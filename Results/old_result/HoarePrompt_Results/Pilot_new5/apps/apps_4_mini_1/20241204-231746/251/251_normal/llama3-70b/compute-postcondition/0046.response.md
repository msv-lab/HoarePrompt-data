Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is 0, `dp[i]` is equal to max(`cakes[n][0]`, `dp[j] + cakes[i][0]`), and `dp[i]` remains unchanged for other indices. If the current value of `cakes[i][1]` is less than `cakes[j][1]` and the current value of `cakes[i][2]` is less than `cakes[j][2]`, then `dp[i]` is updated accordingly.***
