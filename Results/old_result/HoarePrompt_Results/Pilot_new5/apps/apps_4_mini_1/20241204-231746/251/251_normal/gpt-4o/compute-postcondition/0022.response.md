The value of `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the sum of `dp[j]` and `volumes[i]`. The state of `dp[i]` will depend on the values of `dp[j]` and `volumes[i]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp[i]` is equal to max(dp[i], dp[j] + volumes[i]), `dp[j]` is unchanged, `volumes[i]` is unchanged, `i` is now `i + 1`, and `volumes[j]` must be less than `volumes[i + 1]`.**
