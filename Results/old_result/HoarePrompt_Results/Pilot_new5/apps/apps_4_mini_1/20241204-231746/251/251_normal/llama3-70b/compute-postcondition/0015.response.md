According to the code, the loop is set to execute with the variable `i` starting from 1 and continuing up to `n-1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 2, since if `n` is 1, the range for `i` would be empty (i.e., `range(1, 1)`).

At the start of the loop, the value of `i` will be 1, and thus the condition for the loop to execute is that `n` must be greater than 1. 

Additionally, `dp[0]` is already defined as `cakes[0][0]`, ensuring initialization is appropriate for the first element, which is necessary for the logic inside the loop (although the body of the loop is omitted).

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `dp[0]` is equal to `cakes[0][0]`**
