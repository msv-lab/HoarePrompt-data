Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is equal to `n`, and `j` is 1. If `cakes[i][1]` is less than `cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2]` is less than `cakes[j][2]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `dp[1] + cakes[n][0]`. Otherwise, `dp[i]` remains unchanged for other indices.***
