Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is the final index + 1, `j` is 2. If `cakes[i][1]` is less than `cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2]` is less than `cakes[j][2]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i]` and `dp[2] + cakes[i][0]`. If the condition is not satisfied, `dp[i]` remains unchanged.***
