Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n`, representing the number of cakes, and a list of tuples `cakes`, each containing the radius and height of a cake. It calculates some result via `func_1` using `n` and `cakes`, then prints this result formatted to six decimal places. However, it does not handle any potential input errors such as invalid data types or values outside the specified ranges.**
