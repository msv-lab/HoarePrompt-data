The code snippet assigns values to `r` and `h` by taking input and mapping it to integers. The previous values of `r` and `h` are unknown until input is provided, so their new values will be integer representations of the input provided by the user. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `cakes` contains an additional tuple `((math.pi * r * r * h), r, h)`; `_` is `k + 1`; `r` is an input integer; `h` is an input integer.**
