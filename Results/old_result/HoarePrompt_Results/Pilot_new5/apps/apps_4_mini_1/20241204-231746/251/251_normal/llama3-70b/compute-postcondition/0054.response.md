Output State: **`dp` is an array where `dp[i]` contains the maximum sum of cakes that can be obtained considering the constraints for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `cakes` is a list of cake attributes, `n` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000. If no valid pairs exist for a particular `i`, then `dp[i]` retains the value of `cakes[i][0]` (the volume of the cake). If `n` is 1, then `dp[0]` is equal to `cakes[0][0]`, and the loop does not execute.**
