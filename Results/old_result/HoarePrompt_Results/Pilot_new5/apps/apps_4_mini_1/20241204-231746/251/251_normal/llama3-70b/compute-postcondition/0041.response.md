According to the code, the loop can execute again if the value of `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the final index + 1, which means `i` is currently equal to `n`. Since `n` is greater than 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased to `n`, and thus the next value of `i` would be equal to `n`. There are no adjustments needed for `dp` as it retains its last computed value for `i`.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `dp[i]` remains unchanged**
