The variables `r` and `h` are assigned the values obtained from the input split into integers. The input can be any two integers, but after the execution, we don't know their specific values. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new variables and their relationship to the input but not their exact values.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `cakes` is an empty list; `r` is an input integer; `h` is an input integer.**
