Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `dp[0]` is equal to `cakes[0][0]`, `dp[1]` is equal to max(dp[1], dp[0] + cakes[i][0]), `j` is 0; if the value of `cakes[i][1]` is less than `cakes[j][1]`, and the value of `cakes[i][2]` is less than `cakes[j][2]` then `dp[1]` is updated accordingly.***
