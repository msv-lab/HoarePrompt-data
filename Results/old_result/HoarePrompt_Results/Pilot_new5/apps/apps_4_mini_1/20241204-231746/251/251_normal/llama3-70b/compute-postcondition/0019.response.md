The code updates the value of `dp[i]` to the maximum of its current value and the sum of `dp[j]` and `cakes[i][0]`. Given that `dp[j]` is the value of `cakes[j][0]` (based on the initial state) and `cakes[i][0]` is also present, we can directly relate the values. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `dp[0]` is equal to `cakes[0][0]`, `dp[1]` is equal to max(dp[1], dp[0] + cakes[i][0]), `j` is 0; the value of `cakes[i][1]` is less than `cakes[j][1]`, and the value of `cakes[i][2]` is less than `cakes[j][2]**.
