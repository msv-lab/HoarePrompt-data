`dp[i]` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and the sum of `dp[j] + cakes[i][0]`. The value of `dp[i]` was previously defined as `max(cakes[n][0], dp[j] + cakes[i][0])`. The value of `dp[j]` remains unchanged, and since `j` is 1, we calculate `dp[j] + cakes[i][0]` accordingly. 

Given that `n` is greater than 1 and `i` is equal to `n`, the output state reflects the updated value of `dp[i]`, while `n`, `j`, and `dp[j]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is 1, `dp[i]` is updated to max(previous dp[i], dp[1] + cakes[n][0]).

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is 1, `dp[i]` is updated to max(previous `dp[i]`, `dp[1] + cakes[n][0]`)**.
