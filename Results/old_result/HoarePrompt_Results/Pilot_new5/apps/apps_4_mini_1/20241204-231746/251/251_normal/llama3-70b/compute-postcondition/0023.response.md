Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `dp[0]` is equal to `cakes[0][0]`, `dp[1]` is equal to max(dp[1], dp[0] + cakes[i][0]), `j` is 1. If the value of `cakes[i][1]` is less than `cakes[j][1]` and the value of `cakes[i][2]` is less than `cakes[j][2]`, then `dp[2]` is updated to max(dp[2], dp[1] + cakes[i][0]). Otherwise, `dp[2]` remains unchanged.***
