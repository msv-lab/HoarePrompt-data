According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, we have `j` equal to 0 and `i` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. 

After the last iteration, `j` will be 1. In order for the loop to execute again, `j` must still be less than `i`. Therefore, `i` must be greater than 1 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` must be greater than 1, `j` is 1, and `dp[0]` is equal to `volumes[0]`**
