According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute if `i` is at least 1. Since `i` is already set to 1 before the loop starts, the loop can execute without any issues. 

However, the variable `j` needs to be initialized to the value it will take at the start of the loop, which is 0 before the first iteration. Additionally, the condition regarding `n` being greater than 1 does not directly affect the execution of this loop since it does not impact the loop variable `j`. 

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are the initialization of `j` and ensuring the validity of `i`. 

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `dp[0]` is equal to `cakes[0][0]`, `dp[1]` is equal to `cakes[1][0]`, `j` is 0**
