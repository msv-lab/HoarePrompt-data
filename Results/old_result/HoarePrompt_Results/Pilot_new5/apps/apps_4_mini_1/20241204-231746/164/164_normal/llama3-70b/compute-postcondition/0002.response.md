The variables `g` and `t` are both assigned the value of -1. No other variables are affected, and the conditions on `n`, `k`, and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated values of `g` and `t`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1, `s` is an input string, `g` is -1, `t` is -1**.
