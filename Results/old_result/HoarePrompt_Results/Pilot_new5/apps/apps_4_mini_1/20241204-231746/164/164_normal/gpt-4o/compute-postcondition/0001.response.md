The variable `line` is assigned the value from the input. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1, and `line` is an input string.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1, `line` is an input string.**
