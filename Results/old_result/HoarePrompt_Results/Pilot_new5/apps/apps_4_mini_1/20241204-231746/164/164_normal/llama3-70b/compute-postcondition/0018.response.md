The variable `t` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 2. The values of `n`, `k`, `s`, and other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` - 1, `s` is an input string, `i` is 2, and `t` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` - 1, `s` is an input string, `i` is 2, `t` is 2**.
