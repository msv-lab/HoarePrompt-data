Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n - 1`, `line` is an input string, `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos`, `reachable` is False, and `pos` is equal to `G_pos` if the loop does not execute. If the loop executes, `pos` will be the first index in `line` that contains '#' after `G_pos`, otherwise `pos` remains equal to `G_pos`.***
