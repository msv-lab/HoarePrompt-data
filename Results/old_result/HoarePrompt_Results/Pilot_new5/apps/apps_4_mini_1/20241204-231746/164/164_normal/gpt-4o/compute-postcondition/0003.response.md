`T_pos` is assigned the index of the first occurrence of 'T' in `line`. The state of `line` remains unchanged, and the values of `n`, `k`, and `G_pos` are still valid since they are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1, `line` is an input string, `G_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 'G' in `line`, `T_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 'T' in `line`.**
