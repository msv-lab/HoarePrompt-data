The values of `G_pos` and `T_pos` are swapped. Since the current value of `G_pos` is greater than the current value of `T_pos`, after the swap, `T_pos` will take the value of `G_pos` and vice versa. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1, `line` is an input string, `G_pos` is now equal to the previous value of `T_pos`, `T_pos` is now equal to the previous value of `G_pos` and `G_pos` was greater than `T_pos`.**
