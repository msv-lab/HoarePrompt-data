Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` - 1, and `s` is an input string. If `s[i]` is 'G', then `g` is set to 0, `t` remains -1, and `i` remains 0. If `s[i]` is 'T', then `t` is set to 0, while `g` remains -1, and `i` remains 0. For all other cases, `g` remains -1, `t` remains -1, and `i` remains 0.***
