Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` - 1, `s` is an input string, and `i` is 1. If the character at index `i` of `s` is 'G', then `g` is set to 1. If the character at index `i` of `s` is 'T', then `t` is set to 1. If the character at index `i` of `s` is neither 'G' nor 'T', there is no update to `g` or `t`.***
