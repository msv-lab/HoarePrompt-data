Output State: **`g` is the index of the last occurrence of 'G' in string `s`, `t` is the index of the last occurrence of 'T' in string `s`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n - 1`, and `s` is an input string. If 'G' or 'T' do not appear in `s`, then `g` remains -1 and `t` remains -1.**
