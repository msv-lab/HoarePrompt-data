Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two lines of input, which correspond to the two numbers represented in the golden system. This matches the requirement that the inputs are non-empty strings consisting of '0's and '1's.

2. **Value Calculation**: 
   - The function `func_1(s)` calculates the decimal value of the golden system number represented by the string `s`. It does this by iterating over each character in the string and summing the contributions of '1's according to the formula:
     \[
     \text{value} = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a_i \cdot q^{n - i - 1}
     \]
     Here, \( a_i \) is 1 if the character is '1' and 0 otherwise. The calculation is consistent with the problem description since it directly computes the value based on the defined properties of number \( q \).

3. **Comparison Logic**: 
   - After calculating the values for both inputs, the program compares them using standard comparison operators. It prints '>' if the first value is larger, '<' if smaller, and '=' if they are equal, which aligns with the specified output requirements.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: 
   - The program correctly processes cases where strings have leading zeros, as it sums contributions only for '1's. The string length constraint (up to 100,000 characters) is efficiently handled since Python can manage large floating-point calculations within this range.

5. **Output**: The output formatting meets the requirements of the problem description, providing the correct symbols for the comparisons.

Overall, the program accurately implements the functionality required by the problem description, making it correct in all specified scenarios.
