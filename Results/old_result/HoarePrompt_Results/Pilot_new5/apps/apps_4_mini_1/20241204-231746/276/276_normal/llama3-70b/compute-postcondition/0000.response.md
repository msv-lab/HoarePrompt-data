The variable `q` is assigned the value of the golden ratio, which is calculated as (math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2. The initial state of the variable `s` remains unchanged as the execution of this code does not affect it. Therefore, the output state will state the unchanged value of `s` along with the value of `q`.

Output State: **`s` is a tuple containing two non-empty strings consisting of '0' and '1' characters, each with a length not exceeding 100000; `q` is equal to (math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2**.
