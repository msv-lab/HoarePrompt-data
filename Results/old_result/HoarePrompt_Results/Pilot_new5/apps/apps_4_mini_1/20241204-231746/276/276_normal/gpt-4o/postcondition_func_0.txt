The function accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting of '0' and '1' characters and calculates a value based on the Fibonacci constant `q` (approximately 1.618) raised to the power of `(n - i - 1)` for each index `i` where `s[i]` is '1'. The function returns the computed sum, which will be 0 if there are no '1's in `s`.
