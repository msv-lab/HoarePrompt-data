To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze both the problem requirements and the program implementation.

### Problem Requirements:
1. The program must take two binary numbers (strings of '0's and '1's).
2. It must calculate their decimal values in the "golden system," where the decimal value of a binary string \(a_0a_1...a_n\) is given by \(\sum_{i = 0}^{n} a_i \cdot q^{n - i}\) with \(q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2}\).
3. The program must compare these two decimal values and output:
   - ">" if the first number is larger,
   - "<" if the second number is larger,
   - "=" if they are equal.

### Program Analysis:
- The program begins by reading two input strings from the user.
- It then invokes `func_1` for both input strings to calculate their decimal values.
- `func_1` correctly computes the decimal value for the golden system using the formula specified in the problem description. It does this by reversing the string and iterating through each character, computing the summation with the appropriate power of \(q\).
- After calculating the decimal values, the program compares them and prints the corresponding output based on the comparison.

### Key Points:
1. **Input Handling**: The program properly handles the input as non-empty strings of '0's and '1's, as specified.
2. **Calculation Method**: The calculation in `func_1` follows the mathematical definition provided in the problem description exactly.
3. **Comparison Logic**: The program correctly compares the two results and outputs the required comparison symbols.

### Conclusion:
The program adheres strictly to the problem description and performs the required tasks correctly for all possible binary strings of '0's and '1's. 

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
