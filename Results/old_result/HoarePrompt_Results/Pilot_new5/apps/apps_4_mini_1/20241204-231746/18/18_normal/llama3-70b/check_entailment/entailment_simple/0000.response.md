To determine the correctness of the given Python program based on the provided problem description, letâ€™s analyze both the requirements and the implemented function.

### Problem Description Summary:
1. There are `n` spectators.
2. The first `k` spectators stand up one by one until time `k`.
3. From time `k + 1` to `n + k`, spectators will start sitting down in a wave pattern:
   - At time `k + 1`, the first spectator sits as the `(k + 1)`-th stands.
   - This continues until time `n`, where the `(n - k)`-th spectator sits.
   - After time `n`, the spectators continue to sit down one by one until time `n + k`.

### Expected Output:
- At any given time `t`, the function must return how many spectators are standing.

### Analysis of the Function:
The function implementation is as follows:
```python
def func():
    n, k, t = map(int, input().split())
    print(min(t, k) if t <= n else k - (t - n) % k)
```

1. **First Part** (when `t <= n`):
   - `min(t, k)` correctly counts the number of spectators standing from time `1` to `k`. This captures the scenario where the spectators are still standing up without anyone having sat down.

2. **Second Part** (when `t > n`):
   - The expression `k - (t - n) % k` handles the situation after all `n` spectators have stood up. The formula `(t - n) % k` gives the number of spectators that have sat down after time `n`. Therefore, `k - (t - n) % k` correctly calculates how many are still standing at that time.

### Boundary Cases:
- For the case when `t = 1`, `2`, `3`, ..., `k`, the function will return `1`, `2`, `3`, ..., `k`, respectively.
- For `t = k + 1`, the output is `k - 1`, which is correct because the first spectator sits.
- For `t = n`, the output is `k`, as all `k` are still standing until the last standing by `n`.
- For `t = n + 1`, the function will correctly produce `k - 1`, and so on until `t = n + k`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all cases according to the problem description. The logic for determining how many spectators are standing is accurate based on the time interval comparisons and the pattern described. 

**Correctness: True**
