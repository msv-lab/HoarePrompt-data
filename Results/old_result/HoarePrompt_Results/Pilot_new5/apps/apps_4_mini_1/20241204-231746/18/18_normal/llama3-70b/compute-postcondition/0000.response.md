The values of `n`, `k`, and `t` are assigned based on the result of `map(int, input().split())`, which will read a line of input and convert it into three integers. Since the values of `n`, `k`, and `t` are not given explicitly, we can only state that they will be set to integers based on the input. The constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k) remain valid.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `t` are integers assigned from input, satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k.**
