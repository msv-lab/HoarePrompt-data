The value of `current_cost` is updated by adding `length - (t + 1)` to its previous value. The variables `min_cost` and `best_t` remain unchanged, and `length` is set to the next integer in the list `a` if it has one. Since we don't have the specific values for `current_cost`, `length`, `t`, and the next value in `a`, we cannot determine the exact new value of `current_cost`. However, the other variables remain as described.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list containing at least 1 integer; `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + (length - (t + 1))`; `min_cost` remains unchanged; `best_t` remains unchanged; `length` is set to the next integer in `a` if it has one.**
