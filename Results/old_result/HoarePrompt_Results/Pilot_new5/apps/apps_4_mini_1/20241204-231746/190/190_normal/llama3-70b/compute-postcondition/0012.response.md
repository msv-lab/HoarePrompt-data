`min_t` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `i` is `mid - 1`, which is at least 1 since `mid` is at least 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 100, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `mid` is at least 2, `t` is equal to `mid`, `min_cost` is equal to `cost`, `min_t` is equal to `i`, `i` is now `mid - 1`, and `min_cost` is equal to `cost` (updated), and `min_t` is equal to `mid - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 100, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `mid` is at least 2, `t` is equal to `mid`, `min_cost` is equal to `cost`, `min_t` is equal to `mid - 1`, `i` is now `mid - 1`, and `min_cost` is equal to `cost` (updated).**
