Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `a` is a list containing `n` integers, and `current_cost` is the total cost calculated based on the lengths in `a` relative to `t`, accounting for how many lengths were below `t - 1` and how many were above `t + 1`. The current value of `current_cost` is less than `min_cost`.***
