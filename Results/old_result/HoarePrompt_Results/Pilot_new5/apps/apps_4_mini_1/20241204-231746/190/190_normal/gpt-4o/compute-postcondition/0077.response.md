`best_t` is assigned the value of `t`, which is 101. The current values of other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `current_cost` is the total cost accumulated based on the conditions applied to each element of `a`, `min_cost` is now equal to `current_cost`, `best_t` is 101, `t` is 101, and `length` is the last element of `a`.**
