According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `mid`. The loop is designed to iterate from `mid + 1` to `100`. For the loop to execute, `mid + 1` must be less than or equal to `100`. This means that `mid` must be at most `99`.

Additionally, we need to ensure that the variables involved in the loop state are properly initialized:
- `i` should take on the value of `mid + 1` at the start of the loop.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, the conditions that need to be stated are that `mid` must be less than or equal to `99`, and `i` should be initialized to `mid + 1`.

State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 100, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `mid` must be less than or equal to 99, `t` is equal to `mid`, `min_cost` is the minimum cost calculated from all iterations, `min_t` is the value of `i` that corresponds to `min_cost` if the loop executed; otherwise, `min_t` remains `mid`, `i` is `mid + 1`**.
