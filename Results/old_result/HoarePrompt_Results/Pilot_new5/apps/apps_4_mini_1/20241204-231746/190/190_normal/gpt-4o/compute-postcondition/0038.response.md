Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `a` is a list containing at least 1 integer, if `length` (the first integer in `a`) is less than 1, then `current_cost` is set to 1, while `min_cost` and `best_t` remain unchanged. If `length` is greater than or equal to 1, `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + (length - 3)` if `length` is greater than 3, while `min_cost` and `best_t` remain unchanged; if `length` is less than or equal to 3, then `current_cost`, `min_cost`, and `best_t` remain unchanged.***
