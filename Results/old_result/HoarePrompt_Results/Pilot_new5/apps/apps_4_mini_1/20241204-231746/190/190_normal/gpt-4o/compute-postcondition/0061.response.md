The variable `current_cost` is updated by adding the value of `length - (t + 1)` to it. Since `length` is greater than `t + 1`, the expression `length - (t + 1)` will yield a positive value. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `length` is the first element of `a` and is greater than 102, `min_cost` remains unchanged, `best_t` remains unchanged, `current_cost` is a positive value equal to `current_cost + (length - (t + 1))`, and `t` is 101.**
