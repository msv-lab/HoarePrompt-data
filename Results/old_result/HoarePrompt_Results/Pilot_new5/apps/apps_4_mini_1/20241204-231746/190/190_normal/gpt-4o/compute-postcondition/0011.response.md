The `current_cost` variable is incremented by the value of `length - (t + 1)`. Given that `length` is the first element of `a` and is greater than or equal to `t - 1`, it implies that `length` is at least `t`. Also, since the current value of `length` is greater than `t + 1`, this ensures that `length - (t + 1)` is a positive value.

Therefore, the value of `current_cost` increases by a positive integer. The states of the other variables remain unchanged, so the output state will include the updated value of `current_cost`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `a` is a list containing at least 1 integer, `length` is the first element of `a`, `length` is greater than or equal to `t - 1`, and the current value of `length` is greater than `t + 1; current_cost is increased by length - (t + 1).**
