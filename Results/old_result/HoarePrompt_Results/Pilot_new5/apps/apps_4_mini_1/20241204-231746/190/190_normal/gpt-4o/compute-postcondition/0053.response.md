Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list containing `n` integers; if `current_cost` is less than `min_cost`, then `min_cost` is updated to `current_cost` and `best_t` is set to `t`. If `current_cost` is not less than `min_cost`, both `min_cost` and `best_t` remain unchanged.***
