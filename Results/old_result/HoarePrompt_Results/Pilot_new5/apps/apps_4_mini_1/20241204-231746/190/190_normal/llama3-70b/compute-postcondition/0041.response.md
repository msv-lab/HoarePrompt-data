Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 100, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `mid` is less than or equal to 99, `t` equals `mid`, `min_cost` is the minimum cost calculated for all values of `i` from `mid + 1` to 100, and `min_t` is the value of `i` that corresponds to `min_cost`, or remains equal to `mid` if the loop did not execute.**
