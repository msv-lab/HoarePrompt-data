Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `a` is a list of `n` integers, and `current_cost` is the total cost accumulated based on the conditions applied to each element of `a`. If `current_cost` is less than `min_cost`, then `min_cost` is updated to be equal to `current_cost`, `best_t` remains 101, `t` remains 101, and `length` is the last element of `a`.***
