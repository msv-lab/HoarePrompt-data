Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 100, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `mid` is less than or equal to 99, `t` equals `mid`, `i` is 101, and `cost` is calculated based on the formula provided. If `cost` is less than `min_cost`, then `min_cost` is updated to `cost` and `min_t` is set to 101.***
