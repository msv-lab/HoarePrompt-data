The variable `x` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function to the input split by spaces. The input will contain `n` integers where each integer `x_i` is non-negative and satisfies the condition `0 <= x_i <= 1000`. The initial state of `n` remains valid as it continues to be a positive integer within the specified range. However, the previous unspecified values of `x` will now be defined based on the user input provided.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 50; `x` is a list of n non-negative integers, each satisfying 0 <= x_i <= 1000 based on input; `y` is a list of n integers where each integer y_i is non-negative and satisfies 0 <= y_i <= 1000.**
