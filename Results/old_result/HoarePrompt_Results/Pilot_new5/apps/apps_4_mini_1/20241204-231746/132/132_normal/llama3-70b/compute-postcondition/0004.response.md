The code snippet `print('No')` simply outputs the string 'No' to the console. It does not modify any variables or data states. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged, and the output only consists of the printed string.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `x` is a list of `n` non-negative integers from input; `y` is a list of `n` non-negative integers from input, where each integer `y_i` is in the range 0 <= `y_i` <= 1000; the sum of the elements in `x` is not equal to the sum of the elements in `y` and 'No' has been printed.**
