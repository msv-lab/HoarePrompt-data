The operation `x.sort()` sorts the list `x` in ascending order. The variable `n` remains unchanged, but the order of the elements in the list `x` will be rearranged. The list `y` is not affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `x` is a sorted list of `n` non-negative integers; `y` is a list of `n` non-negative integers where each integer `y_i` is in the range 0 <= `y_i` <= 1000, and the sum of the elements in `x` is equal to the sum of the elements in `y`.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `x` is a sorted list of `n` non-negative integers; `y` is a list of `n` non-negative integers where each integer `y_i` is in the range 0 <= `y_i` <= 1000; the sum of the elements in `x` is equal to the sum of the elements in `y`.**
