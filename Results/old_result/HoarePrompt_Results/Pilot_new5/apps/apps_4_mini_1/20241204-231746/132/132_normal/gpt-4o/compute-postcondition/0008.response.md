The code executes a print statement, which outputs 'Yes' to the console. The values of the variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `total_x`, and `total_y` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that no variables were modified.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `x` is a list of `n` non-negative integers each satisfying 0 <= `x_i` <= 1000; `y` is a list of `n` integers that are non-negative and are the result of mapping `int` over input values; `total_x` is equal to `sum(x)`; `total_y` is equal to `sum(y)`; the total of `y` is less than or equal to the total of `x` (total_y <= total_x); 'Yes' is printed to the console.**
