Postcondition: ***`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `x` is a list of `n` non-negative integers; `y` is a list of `n` non-negative integers where each integer `y_i` is in the range 0 <= `y_i` <= 1000. If the sum of the elements in `x` is not equal to the sum of the elements in `y`, 'No' has been printed. If the sum of the elements in `x` is equal to the sum of the elements in `y`, then if the lists `x` and `y` are equal, 'Yes' has been printed; otherwise, 'No' has been printed.***
