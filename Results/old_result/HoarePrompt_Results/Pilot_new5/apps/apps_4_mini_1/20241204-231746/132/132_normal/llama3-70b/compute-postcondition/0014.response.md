The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `x`, and `y`. 

- `n` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 50 \).
- `x` is a list of `n` non-negative integers where each integer \( x_i \) is in the range \( 0 \leq x_i \leq 1000 \).
- `y` is a list of `n` non-negative integers where each integer \( y_i \) is also in the range \( 0 \leq y_i \leq 1000 \).

Based on the output conditions, the function performs the following:
- The function will handle the input according to the specified conditions on the parameters. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a list `x` of `n` non-negative integers, and a list `y` of `n` non-negative integers. It processes these inputs according to the defined parameters and returns a result accordingly.**
