The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `x`, and `y`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer that satisfies the condition \(1 \leq n \leq 50\). The parameter `x` is a list of `n` integers, where each integer `x_i` is non-negative and satisfies the condition \(0 \leq x_i \leq 1000\). The parameter `y` is also a list of `n` integers, where each integer `y_i` is non-negative and satisfies the condition \(0 \leq y_i \leq 1000\).

Based on the output conditions provided, the function appears to process these parameters and returns a specific result based on the values in the lists `x` and `y`. However, since the output conditions were not explicitly provided in your prompt, I can summarize the functionality up to the point of returning a value based on certain conditions.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and two lists `x` and `y`, each containing `n` non-negative integers, and performs operations based on these parameters to return a result.**
