To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we must analyze the given information carefully. 

1. We know that `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000.
2. Since `num` is the second element of the list `a` if `n` is greater than 1, we can conclude that `num` represents the second number in the sorted list.
3. The loop iterates over each element in the list `a` using the variable `num`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `num` has been set to the second element of the list `a`, and `mex` was updated based on the condition of `num`. 

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `num` will take the next value from the sorted list `a`.
- If there is at least one more element in the list (which is true if `n` is greater than 1), then `num` will become the third element of `a`.
- Since `mex` is already 3 at the start of the loop, it will remain unchanged unless specified otherwise.

Based on this analysis, if we assume that `num` was the second element in the previous iteration and `n` is greater than 2 (which it must be to have a third element), the next state would reflect `num` being the third element.

Thus, to summarize the changes needed for the next iteration:

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `mex` is 3, and `num` is the third element in the list `a` (if n is greater than 2)**
