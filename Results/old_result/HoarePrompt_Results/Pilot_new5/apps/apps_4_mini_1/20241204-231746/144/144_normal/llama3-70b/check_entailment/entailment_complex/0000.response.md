To determine if the provided Python program meets the requirements specified in the problem description, we need to analyze the program's functionality and its correctness in relation to the expected output.

**Problem Description Recap**:
The program needs to find the maximum possible value of the "mex" of an array after potentially decreasing its elements. The "mex" is defined as the smallest positive integer that does not appear in the array.

**Program Analysis**:
1. The function reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `arr`.
2. It sorts `arr` to facilitate finding the "mex".
3. It initializes `mex` to 1 and iterates through the sorted array `arr`. For each element `num`:
   - If `num` equals `mex`, it increments `mex` (indicating that `mex` is present in the array).
   - If `num` is greater than `mex`, it breaks the loop (indicating that further elements cannot affect the current "mex" since they are all larger).
4. Finally, it prints the value of `mex`.

**Correctness Evaluation**:
The logic in the program correctly implements the process of calculating the "mex". Specifically:
- The program starts with `mex` set to 1, as the minimum positive integer to check.
- By sorting the array, the program can efficiently identify if each consecutive integer (starting from 1) is present in the array.
- The loop allows for skipping any integers in `arr` that are larger than the current `mex`, thus correctly terminating when the next potential "mex" is found.

**Potential Edge Cases**:
- The maximum "mex" value that can be achieved corresponds to the number of elements available in the array. If all integers from 1 to `n` are present, the result will be `n + 1`, which the program captures.
- The program handles arrays with duplicates correctly, as sorting and evaluating in order allows it to only increment `mex` when necessary.

Given these points, the program correctly computes the maximum possible "mex" value for the provided input constraints.

**Conclusion**:
The program meets the requirements of the problem description for all specified cases.

Correctness: **True**
