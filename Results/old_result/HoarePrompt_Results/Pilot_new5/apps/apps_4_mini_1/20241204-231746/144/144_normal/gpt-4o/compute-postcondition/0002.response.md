The variable `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order. The length of the list `n` remains unchanged as it only affects the ordering of the elements within `a`. Since `a` consists of positive integers and is sorted, the output will reflect this new order of `a`. 

Output State: **`n` is the length of the input list (a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), `a` is a sorted list of n positive integers in non-decreasing order where each integer a[i] satisfies 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10^9.**
