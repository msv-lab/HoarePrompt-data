The value of `mex` is incremented by 1. Given that the initial value of `mex` is 2, after the execution, `mex` will now be 3. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `mex` is 3, `num` is the second element in the list `a` if `n` is greater than 1**.
