According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the `arr` variable. Since `arr` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, the loop will execute for each element in that list. Given that `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000), the loop can execute as long as the list contains at least one element.

At the start of the loop, the variable `num` will take the value of the first element in `arr` during the first iteration. At this point, we know that `mex` is initialized to 1, which is likely used for a purpose within the loop but does not affect the loop's execution.

Therefore, for the loop to execute correctly, we need to ensure that `arr` contains at least one element, `num` should be the first positive integer in `arr`, and no additional changes are necessary for `mex`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers containing at least 1 element, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `mex` is 1**
