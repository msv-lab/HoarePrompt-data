Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `arr` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers containing at least 2 elements; `num` is the second element of `arr`; if `num` is equal to `mex`, then `mex` is either 2 or 3 depending on its previous value. Otherwise, if `num` is greater than `mex`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `mex` must be either 1 or 2 depending on the value of `num`.***
