`mex` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `mex` will now be its previous value plus 1. The states of `n`, `arr`, and `num` are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000 and must be greater than or equal to 3; `arr` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers containing at least 3 elements; `num` is the third element of `arr`; `mex` is increased by 1.**
