The value of `mex` is incremented by 1. Given that the current value of `num` is equal to `mex`, the previous value of `mex` was 1, so after the operation, `mex` becomes 2. The other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `arr` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers containing at least 1 element; `num` is the first element of `arr`; `mex` is 2; and the current value of `num` is equal to 2.**
