The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, but it operates on an even integer `n` which is constrained to the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 100. Additionally, the function processes a sequence of integers on `n` cards, where each integer is constrained to the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100. Based on the output described, the functionality of the function is to analyze this sequence of integers. 

As the specific output conditions are not defined in the provided information, the return behavior is not explicitly mentioned. Therefore, we cannot specify the exact return value. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an even integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a sequence of integers on n cards (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100), and processes this sequence to produce a result based on the defined output conditions.**
