Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly account for all scenarios outlined in the problem description. 

### Issue:
1. The program checks if the two most frequent numbers occur exactly `n // 2` times each. However, it does not consider cases where there are multiple distinct numbers that can lead to a fair game. 

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
4
1
1
2
2
```
In this case, both players can choose `1` and `2`, and they would each end up with exactly `2` cards. However, since the program only checks for the two most frequent numbers having exactly `n // 2` occurrences each, it incorrectly outputs "NO" because it assumes only the top two unique counts are valid for a fair game instead of checking all distinct pairs of numbers.

Thus, there are cases where the game can be fair, but the program incorrectly identifies it as impossible. This is why the program is deemed incorrect.
