To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the logic implemented in the function according to the problem description.

The primary goal of the program is to find two distinct integers that Petya and Vasya can choose such that they can collect all n cards and each player gets the same number of cards.

### Breakdown of the Program Logic:
1. The program reads an integer `n`, which indicates the number of cards. It then populates a list `a` with the integers on the cards.
2. A dictionary `d` is created to count the occurrences of each integer on the cards.
3. The program checks for two distinct integers that each appear exactly `n/2` times. If it finds such integers, it prints "YES" followed by the two integers. If it cannot find such integers, it prints "NO".

### Potential Issues:
1. **Distinct Requirement**: The program checks if there are two distinct integers, each appearing exactly `n/2` times. However, it does not handle the case where there might be two different integers, but one appears more than `n/2` times. For example, if the cards are `[1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2]`, the counts will indicate that `1` appears `3` times and `2` appears `3` times. The function will incorrectly output "YES" with `1` and `2`, while the game is not fair since both players cannot take equal cards.

2. **No Handling for All Same Cards**: The program does not handle the case where all cards have the same integer. For instance, if the input is `4` followed by `4, 4, 4, 4`, it should output "NO" since both players cannot choose distinct integers.

### Example Case:
For the input:
```
4
1
1
1
2
```
The expected output should be "NO" since there aren't two distinct integers with exactly `n/2` cards each.

### Conclusion:
Given these observations, the program does not accurately fulfill the requirements of the problem for all cases.

Correctness: **False**.
