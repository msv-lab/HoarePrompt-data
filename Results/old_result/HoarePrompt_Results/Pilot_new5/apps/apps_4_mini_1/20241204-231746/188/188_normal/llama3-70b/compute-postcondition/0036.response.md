Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list containing `n` input integers; `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `a` that has at least 1 key. If `d[i]` equals `n // 2` and `c` is 0, then `c` is set to 1, `a1` is equal to `i`, and `a2` is -1. If `c` is not equal to 0, then `a1` is -1, `a2` is equal to `i`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, while `i` remains the first key in `d` with `d[i]` equal to `n // 2`.***
