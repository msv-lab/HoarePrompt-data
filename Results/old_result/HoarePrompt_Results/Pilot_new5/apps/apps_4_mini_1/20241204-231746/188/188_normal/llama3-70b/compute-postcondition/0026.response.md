The variables `a1` and `a2` are both assigned the value `-1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list containing `n` input integers; `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `a` and the corresponding value is the count of occurrences of that integer in `a`; `c` is 0; `a1` is -1; `a2` is -1.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list containing `n` input integers; `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `a` and the corresponding value is the count of occurrences of that integer in `a`; `c` is 0; `a1` is -1; `a2` is -1.**
