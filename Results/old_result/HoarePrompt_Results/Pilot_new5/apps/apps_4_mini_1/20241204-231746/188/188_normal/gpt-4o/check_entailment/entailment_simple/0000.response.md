The correctness of the provided program can be analyzed based on the requirements outlined in the problem description.

**Analysis of the Program:**

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an even integer `n` and then reads `n` integers into a list called `cards`. This matches the input requirements of the problem.

2. **Counting Occurrences**: The program employs `Counter` from the `collections` module to count occurrences of each integer in the `cards` list. This is a correct approach to determine how many cards correspond to each number.

3. **Unique Numbers**: It creates a list of unique numbers from the counted cards and sorts them based on their counts. However, the sorting is done in ascending order of count, which does not directly affect the logic since the two most frequent numbers are directly accessed later.

4. **Decision Logic**:
   - The program first checks if there are fewer than 2 unique numbers. If so, it correctly prints "NO" because both players need to choose different numbers.
   - Then it checks if the two most frequent numbers have counts equal to `n // 2`. If they do, it prints "YES" along with those two numbers. This correctly identifies the fair game scenario where both players can take an equal number of cards.
   - If the above condition is not met, it prints "NO".

**Fault in the Program**:
- The logic as currently implemented only checks for the two most frequent numbers, but it does not account for the possibility of other distributions that could allow for a fair game. For example, if there are multiple distinct numbers with counts that could still satisfy the game fairness condition (i.e., two distinct numbers with equal counts that add up to n), those scenarios would be missed. 

Here is a specific failure case:
- Consider the input:
  ```
  6
  1
  1
  2
  2
  3
  3
  ```
  In this case, all three numbers (1, 2, and 3) appear twice. The program will output "NO", but in fact, it is possible for Petya to choose 1 and Vasya to choose 2 (or any other pair), leading to a fair game where each player would take 2 cards.

**Conclusion**:
Due to the programâ€™s incorrect logic in determining whether a fair game is possible, it does not satisfy the problem conditions in all cases.

Correctness: **False**
