According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is an even integer within the range of 2 to 100, the loop can execute as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 2. At the end of the last iteration, `i` will have taken values from 0 to n-1. Therefore, before the loop starts, `i` should be initialized to 0, which will be the value in the first iteration.

State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
