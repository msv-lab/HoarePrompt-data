The value of `c` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `c` is 0, so after the code executes, `c` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list containing `n` input integers; `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `a` that must have at least 1 key; `c` is 1; `a1` is equal to `i`; `a2` is -1; `i` is the first key in `d`; the current value of `d[i]` is equal to `n // 2`.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list containing `n` input integers; `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `a` that must have at least 1 key; `c` is 1; `a1` is equal to `i`; `a2` is -1; `i` is the first key in `d`; the current value of `d[i]` is equal to `n // 2`.**
