Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list containing `n` input integers; `d` is a dictionary where the next key is `i`. If `d[i]` equals `n // 2`, and if `c` is equal to 0, then `c` is increased by 1 and `a1` is set to the value of `i`. Otherwise, `a1` is set based on the value of `c`, `a2` is equal to `i`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
