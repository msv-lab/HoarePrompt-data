The provided program aims to determine if two players can choose distinct integers from a set of cards such that they can collect all cards and each player ends up with the same number of cards. 

Let's analyze the logic implemented in the program:

1. The program reads the number of cards `n` and the subsequent integers on those cards.
2. It counts the occurrences of each integer using `Counter`.
3. It then checks if there are at least two unique numbers. If not, it prints "NO."
4. If there are at least two unique numbers, it checks if the two most frequent numbers each appear exactly `n // 2` times:
   - If they do, it prints "YES" followed by those two numbers.
   - If they do not, it prints "NO."

Now, we need to identify any edge cases where the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.

### Edge Cases to Consider:
1. **All Cards Same**: If all cards are the same (for instance, input like `2` followed by `5` and `5`), the program correctly outputs "NO" since there are no distinct numbers.
2. **Different Frequencies**: For an input like `4` followed by `1, 1, 2, 2`, the program correctly identifies that both `1` and `2` exist twice and outputs "YES 1 2".
3. **Uneven Distribution**: For input like `6` followed by `1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2`, the program will output "NO" since the distribution is not even.
4. **One Distinct Number**: For input like `4` followed by `3, 3, 3, 3`, the program outputs "NO", which is correct.

### A Potential Issue:
However, the program fails to cover cases where there are exactly two unique numbers but they do not each appear `n // 2` times. 

For example:
- Input:
```
4
1
1
2
2
```
The output in this case will be "YES 1 2", which is incorrect since each player should have exactly `2` cards to make it fair. 

The correct output for this situation should be "NO" since the players cannot choose distinct numbers that allow them to collect all cards evenly.

### Conclusion:
The program has a significant oversight regarding how it checks the conditions for a fair game. It assumes the two most frequent numbers must each appear exactly half the total count of cards, which is not a general requirement according to the problem description.

Therefore, the program does not handle all edge cases correctly.

Correctness: **False**.
