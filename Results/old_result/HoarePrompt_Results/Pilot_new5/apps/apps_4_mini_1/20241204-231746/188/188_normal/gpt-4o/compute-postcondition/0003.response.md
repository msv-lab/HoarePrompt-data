The variable `unique_numbers` is assigned the sorted list of keys from the `count` Counter object, sorted by their associated counts in ascending order. The `count` object retains its previous state, as the sorting operation only affects the `unique_numbers` variable. Therefore, the details of the output state will reflect the updated `unique_numbers` while retaining the information about `n`, `cards`, and `count`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer; `cards` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 100; `count` is a Counter object containing counts of each integer in `cards`; `unique_numbers` is a sorted list of the keys of `count`, sorted by their counts in ascending order.**
