Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list containing `n` input integers; `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `a` with at least two keys having values equal to `n // 2`; `c` is 1 if one key had `d[i]` equal to `n // 2` and `a1` is set to that key; `c` is 2 if two keys had `d[i]` equal to `n // 2` with `a1` being the first and `a2` being the second key; if no keys matched, `a1` and `a2` remain -1. The current values of `a1` and `a2` are both not equal to -1, indicating that at least two keys in `d` had values equal to `n // 2`.***
