`a` is updated to include the value of `int(input())`, which accepts an input and converts it to an integer. The previous state of `a` as an empty list is changed to include the newly inputted integer. The other variables, `n` and `i`, remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list containing the input integer, `i` is 0**
