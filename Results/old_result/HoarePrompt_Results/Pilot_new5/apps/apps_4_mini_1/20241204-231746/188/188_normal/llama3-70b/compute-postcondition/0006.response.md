According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2. To continue executing the loop, `n` must be greater than 2 to allow for the third iteration (when `i` is 2). Since `n` is an even integer in the range specified, it can be 2, 4, 6, ..., 100.

State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 < n ≤ 100, `a` is a list containing the input integer with the new integer appended, `i` is 2**
