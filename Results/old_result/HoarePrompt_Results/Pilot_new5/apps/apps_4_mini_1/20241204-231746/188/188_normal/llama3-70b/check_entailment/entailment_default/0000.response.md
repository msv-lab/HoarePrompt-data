The provided program is designed to determine whether two players, Petya and Vasya, can choose distinct integers such that they can evenly split a set of cards, each marked with integers, into two equal halves.

### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an even integer `n` followed by `n` integers. This follows the problem description.
  
2. **Counting Occurrences**: The program constructs a dictionary `d` to count how many times each integer appears among the `n` integers. This is correctly implemented.

3. **Checking for Fairness**:
   - The program checks through the dictionary to see if there are exactly two distinct integers that each appear exactly `n // 2` times.
   - If it finds such a pair, it prints "YES" and the two integers; otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Edge Cases:
- The code correctly identifies that if all cards have the same integer, it cannot be fair since the integers chosen must be distinct.
  
- The program does not explicitly handle cases where the input numbers are less than 1 or greater than 100, but the problem guarantees valid input.

### Output Hints:
The output hints state that the function checks for exactly two distinct integers that appear `n // 2` times. This aligns with the logic present in the code.

### Conclusion:
Upon reviewing both the code's logic and the provided problem description, the function seems to cover the necessary cases. However, it fails in scenarios where the two distinct numbers do not exactly meet the criteria of appearing `n // 2` times, such as having numbers that appear in unequal distributions. 

#### Example of Failure:
Consider the following input:
```
4
1
1
2
2
```
In this case:
- `1` appears `2` times and `2` appears `2` times, which is valid.
Now consider:
```
4
1
1
1
2
```
In this case, it will print "NO" but the game is fair since Vasya can take `2` but cannot split it equitably.

Thus, there is an error in the logic where it assumes that the only valid scenario is where two distinct integers each occur exactly `n // 2` times, neglecting the potential for other valid distributions.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**.
