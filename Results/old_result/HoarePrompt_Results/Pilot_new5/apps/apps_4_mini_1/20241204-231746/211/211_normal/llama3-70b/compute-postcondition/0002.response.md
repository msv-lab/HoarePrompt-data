The variable `prefix_sum` is assigned a list of zeros of length `n + 1`. Since `n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `prefix_sum` will have a length of `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer equal to the input value satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `A` is a list of `n` integers where each integer a_i is equal to the input values satisfying -10^3 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^3; `a` is a list of `n` integers equal to the input values; `prefix_sum` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0.**
