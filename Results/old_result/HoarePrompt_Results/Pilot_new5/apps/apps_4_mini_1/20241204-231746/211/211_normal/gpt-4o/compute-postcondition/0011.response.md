The code snippet simply prints the value `2` to the output. It does not change any variables or affect the program state. Therefore, the initial conditions remain valid.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `A` is a list of `n` integers where each integer satisfies -1000 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `total_sum` is 0, and 'YES' is printed to the output.**
