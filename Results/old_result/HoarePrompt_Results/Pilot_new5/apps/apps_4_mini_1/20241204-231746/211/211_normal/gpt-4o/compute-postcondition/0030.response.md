Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `A` is a list of `n` integers within the range -1000 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `total_sum` is 0. If there is at least one non-zero element in `A`, 'YES' is printed along with '2', followed by two indices indicating the position of that non-zero element and the end of the list; otherwise, 'NO' is printed if all elements are zero.**
