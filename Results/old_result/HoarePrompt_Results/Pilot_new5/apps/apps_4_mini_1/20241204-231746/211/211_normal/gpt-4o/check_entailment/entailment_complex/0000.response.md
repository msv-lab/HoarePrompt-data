Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle all cases as specified in the problem description. Here are the main issues:

1. **Incorrect Output for Cases with Zero Total Sum**: 
   - When the sum of the array `A` is zero, the program attempts to find a non-zero element and splits the array into two segments. However, the problem description requires that the sum of each new array must not be zero. If the array consists of multiple zeros, the program would incorrectly print 'YES' and two segments, even though both segments would sum to zero.

2. **Missing "NO" Condition for All Zeros**:
   - The program does not correctly implement the requirement that if all elements in the array `A` are zero, it should print "NO". Instead, it only checks for at least one non-zero element after confirming that the total sum is zero, which could lead to incorrect outputs for arrays that are entirely composed of zeros.

3. **Handling of Single Element Cases**:
   - In the case where the input is a single zero (e.g., `1 0`), the program would return 'YES' and attempt to split it, which is incorrect based on the problem description. It should have directly output 'NO'.

In summary, the program fails to adhere to the strict requirements of the problem statement regarding both total sums of zero and how to handle arrays consisting solely of zeros. Thus, it does not satisfy the problem's conditions for all potential cases.
