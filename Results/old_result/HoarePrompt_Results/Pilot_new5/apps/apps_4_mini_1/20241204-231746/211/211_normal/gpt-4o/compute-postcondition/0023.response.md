According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. Since `n` is at least 2, the loop can still execute for this new value of `i`.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `A` is a list of `n` integers within the range -1000 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, and `total_sum` is 0.**
