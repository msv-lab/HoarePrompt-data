The code snippet `print('1', i + 1)` will print the string '1' followed by the value of `i + 1`. Given that `i` is initially 1, the expression `i + 1` will evaluate to 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `A` is a list of `n` integers within the range -1000 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `total_sum` is 0, 'YES' is printed, and the output printed is '1 2'.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `A` is a list of `n` integers within the range -1000 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `total_sum` is 0, 'YES' is printed, and the output printed is '1 2'.**
