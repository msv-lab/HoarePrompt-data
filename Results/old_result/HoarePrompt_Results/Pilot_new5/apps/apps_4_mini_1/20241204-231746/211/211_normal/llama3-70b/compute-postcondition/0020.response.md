The variable `l` is assigned the value of `r`. The value of `r` is 1, so `l` is now also 1. The states of the other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in the value of `l`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `r` is 1, `l` is 1, the current value of `prefix_sum[r]` is not 0, the current value of `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, and `k` is increased by 1.**
