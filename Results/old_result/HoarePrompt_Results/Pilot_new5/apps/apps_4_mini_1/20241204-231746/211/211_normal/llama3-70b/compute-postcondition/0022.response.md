According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `r` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `r` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `r` is 1. Since `n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, for the loop to execute one more time, `r` will be increased by 1. Therefore, `r` will become 2. Also, since the loop can continue with `r` values as long as `r` is less than or equal to `n`, `n` must remain greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `r` is 2**
