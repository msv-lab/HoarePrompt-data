According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the relationship between `func_1(right)` and `m`. The loop will continue as long as `func_1(right)` equals `m`. At the end of the last iteration, we have the state that `right` is equal to `mid + 2`, and since `func_1(mid + 1)` must equal `m`, we do not know the value of `func_1(right)` but it must also equal `m` for the loop to execute again.

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we do not need to change the `func_1(mid + 1)` condition since it is already satisfied. However, we need to ensure that `func_1(right)` still equals `m`. If `right` is equal to `mid + 2`, we can infer that `func_1(mid + 2)` must also equal `m` for the loop to continue.

Therefore, we need to specify that the function's output for `right` is consistent with the condition for the loop.

State: **`left` is equal to its original value minus `k`, `func_1(mid + 1)` must equal `m`, `right` is equal to `mid + 2`, `func_1(right)` must equal `m`, `m`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `zeroes`, and `result` remain unchanged.**
