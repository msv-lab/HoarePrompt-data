The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 1, `n` is 2, `m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `ans` is [1] and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
