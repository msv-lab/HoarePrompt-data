The variable `count` is initialized to 0. The value of `m` remains unchanged and continues to be an input integer in the range from 1 to 100000. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `count` is 0.

Output State: **`m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `count` is 0**.
