    #The program returns the sum of n // 5, n // 25, ..., up to the largest power of 5 that was less than or equal to the original value of n
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `n`, which is calculated by summing up the integer divisions of `n` by powers of 5 (i.e., `n // 5`, `n // 25`, etc.) until the power of 5 exceeds `n`. The function does not explicitly handle cases where `n` is negative, as it assumes `n` is non-negative based on the initial comment.

    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `low` is greater than `high`, indicating that the binary search has concluded. If `zeroes` was less than `m`, then `low` is now greater than the last mid-point evaluated, and `result` remains an empty list. If `zeroes` was greater than `m`, `high` is now less than the last mid-point evaluated, and `result` still remains an empty list. If `zeroes` was equal to `m`, `result` contains a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, with `left` and `right` adjusted based on the counts of zeroes found at those indices. The values of `zeroes`, `mid`, `left`, and `right` are all determined based on the final evaluations leading to the exit of the loop.
    return result
    #The program returns the list 'result', which contains integers from 'left + 1' to 'right - 1' if 'zeroes' was equal to 'm'. If 'zeroes' was less than or greater than 'm', 'result' remains an empty list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `m` and performs a binary search to find all integers `n` such that the factorial of `n` (`n!`) ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes. It returns a list of these integers, specifically the range from `left + 1` to `right - 1`. If no such integers exist, the function returns an empty list. It does not handle cases where `m` is less than 0 or where `zeroes` is less than `m` without finding any valid `n`, leading to an empty result.
