The code appends the value of `n` to the list `ans`. The value of `n` is 1, so after execution, `ans` will contain `[1]`. The values of `count` and `m` remain unchanged, while `ans` is updated to include the value of `n`.

Output State: **`count` is 1, `n` is 1, `m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `ans` is [1]**
