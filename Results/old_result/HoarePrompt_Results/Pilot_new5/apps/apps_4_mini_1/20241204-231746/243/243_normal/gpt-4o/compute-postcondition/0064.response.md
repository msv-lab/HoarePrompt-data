The code initializes `result` as an empty list. The previous values of `m`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, and `zeroes` remain unchanged because the code does not modify them. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2; `zeroes` is the value returned by func_1(mid); `result` is an empty list.
