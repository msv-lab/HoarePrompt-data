Correctness: **False**

The program has a logical flaw in the `func_2` function when handling the search for numbers whose factorial ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes. The problem arises particularly when `m` is large and there are no corresponding values of `n` that yield exactly `m` trailing zeroes in `n!`.

For instance, if `m = 5`, the program correctly identifies that there are no integers `n` such that `n!` has exactly 5 trailing zeroes, and it outputs `0`. However, the logic used to find the range of valid `n` values can fail to identify cases where there are no valid `n`.

The binary search in `func_2` depends on finding a specific `mid` where `func_1(mid)` equals `m`, but if the search space is exhausted without finding such a `mid`, it may return an incorrect result or skip over possible valid ranges. The boundary calculations (for `left` and `right`) may also lead to off-by-one errors or invalid ranges when `m` approaches certain limits, since the conditions to find `left` and `right` can cause the loops to run out of bounds.

To illustrate, consider `m = 0`. The program should return `1` as `0!` is the only factorial with exactly `0` trailing zeroes, but it may not handle this case correctly based on the current logic in the binary search.

Thus, the provided program does not comprehensively cover all edge cases and input scenarios as required by the problem description.
