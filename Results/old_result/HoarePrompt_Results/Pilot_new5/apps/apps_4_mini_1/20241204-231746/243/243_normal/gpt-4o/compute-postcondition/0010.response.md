The value of `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. The previous value of `mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`. Given that `high` was initially set to `5 * (m + 1)`, the new value of `high` becomes `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2 - 1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` is 0; `high` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2 - 1`; `mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`; `zeroes` is the result of `func_1(mid)`; `result` is an empty list; the current value of `zeroes` is greater than `m`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` is 0; `high` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2 - 1`; `mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`; `zeroes` is the result of `func_1(mid)`; `result` is an empty list; the current value of `zeroes` is greater than `m`.**
