The code prints the values in `ans`, which contains each integer from 1 to `n - 1`. The `count` remains unchanged, and `m` remains as an input integer between 1 and 100000. The variable `ans` contains a range of integers from 1 to `n - 1`. 

Since `print` outputs a string representation of the integers in `ans`, but does not modify the list or any other variable, the output state will reflect the unchanged states along with a representation of `ans`.

Output State: **`count` is 1, `n` is the first integer for which `n // 5 < m`, `m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `ans` contains each integer from 1 to `n - 1`, and the length of `ans` is `n - 1`.**
