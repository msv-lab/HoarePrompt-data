Output State: **`low` is greater than `high`, indicating that the binary search has concluded. If `zeroes` was less than `m`, then `low` is now greater than the last mid-point evaluated, and `result` remains an empty list. If `zeroes` was greater than `m`, `high` is now less than the last mid-point evaluated, and `result` still remains an empty list. If `zeroes` was equal to `m`, `result` contains a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, with `left` and `right` adjusted based on the counts of zeroes found at those indices. The values of `zeroes`, `mid`, `left`, and `right` are all determined based on the final evaluations leading to the exit of the loop.**
