The value of `low` is updated to be `mid + 1`. The previous value of `mid` was equal to `(low + high) // 2`, and since `low` is now updated, the previous condition of `low` being less than or equal to `high` still holds. The value of `zeroes` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `low` is now equal to `mid + 1`, `high` remains unchanged, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, and `zeroes` is the value returned by func_1(mid).

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `low` is now equal to `mid + 1`, `high` remains unchanged, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, and `zeroes` is the value returned by func_1(mid).**
