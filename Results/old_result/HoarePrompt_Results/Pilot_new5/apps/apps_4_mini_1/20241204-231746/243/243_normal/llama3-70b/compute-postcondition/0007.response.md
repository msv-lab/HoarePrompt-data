The variable `count` is incremented by 1. The value of `n` is 1, and since `n // 5` equals 0 (1 divided by 5 is 0 with integer division), the condition does not affect the incrementing of `count`. The value of `count`, which was initially 0, now becomes 1. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `count` is 1; `n` is 1**
