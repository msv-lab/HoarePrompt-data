Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will continue to execute indefinitely unless there is a break statement encountered within the loop body. Therefore, no adjustments to the program state are necessary for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `count` is 1; `n` is 1**
