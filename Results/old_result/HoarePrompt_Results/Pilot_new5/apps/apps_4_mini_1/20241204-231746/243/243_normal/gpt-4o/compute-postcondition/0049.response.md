The value of `right` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables (`left`, `m`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `zeroes`, and `result`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is equal to its original value minus `k`, `func_1(mid + 1)` must equal `m`, `right` is equal to `mid + 2`, `m`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `zeroes`, and `result` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` is equal to its original value minus `k`, `func_1(mid + 1)` must equal `m`, `right` is equal to `mid + 2`, `m`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `zeroes`, and `result` remain unchanged.**
