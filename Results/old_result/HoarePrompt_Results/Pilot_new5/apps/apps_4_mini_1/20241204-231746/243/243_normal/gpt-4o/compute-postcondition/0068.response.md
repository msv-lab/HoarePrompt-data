To determine whether the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition `func_1(left) == m`. The loop will continue to execute as long as this condition holds true.

Given the current state:
- `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000.
- `low` must be less than or equal to `high`.
- `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2.
- `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`.
- `result` is an empty list.
- `left` is equal to (low + high) // 2 - 1.
- `func_1(left) must equal m`.

To execute the loop one more time, `func_1(left)` must still equal `m`. Since `left` is defined as (low + high) // 2 - 1, it implies that if `left` is decreased (by further decrementing `low`), it may still satisfy `func_1(left) == m`.

However, we must ensure that `left` is adjusted appropriately to satisfy the condition for another iteration. As per the statement, we know that `func_1(left)` currently equals `m`, hence for the loop to run again, we must verify that `left` can remain valid and still yield `func_1(left) == m`. 

Thus, we can conclude that `left` must be less than or equal to some limit that maintains this condition. Given the lack of further specifics about the behavior of `func_1`, we cannot definitively alter `m` or `func_1(left)`. 

As such, we can simply state that the current conditions are sufficient for the loop to execute again, as they don't violate any constraints, particularly the condition for `func_1(left)` equating to `m`.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2; `zeroes` is the value returned by func_1(mid); `result` is an empty list; `left` is equal to (low + high) // 2 - 1; and func_1(left) must equal m.**
