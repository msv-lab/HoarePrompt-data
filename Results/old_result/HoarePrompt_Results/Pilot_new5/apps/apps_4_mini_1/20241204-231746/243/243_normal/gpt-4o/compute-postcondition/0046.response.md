To analyze the output state after the loop has executed, we need to consider how the variables `left`, `m`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `zeroes`, and `result` interact over the iterations of the loop.

1. The loop continues executing as long as `func_1(left) == m`. This means that `left` must be decremented as long as the return value of `func_1(left)` equals `m`.
2. Each iteration of the loop decreases `left` by 1.
3. After the loop completes, `left` will be such that `func_1(left)` is no longer equal to `m`, which implies that `left` will have reached a value for which `func_1(left)` has decreased to a value less than `m`.
4. The number of iterations is determined by how many consecutive decrements from `left` yield a return value from `func_1` that equals `m`.

Now considering the output states as the loop executes:

- **Output State after loop executes 1 time**: `left` is decremented by 1 from its original value, and `func_1(left)` is still equal to `m` before decrementing.
  
- **Output State after loop executes 2 times**: `left` is decremented by 1 again, and `func_1(left)` is still equal to `m` before the second decrement.

- **Output State after loop executes 3 times**: `left` is decremented once more, and `func_1(left)` is still equal to `m` before this decrement. 

After the loop has executed all possible times, `left` must be decremented until `func_1(left)` no longer equals `m`. The exact value of `left` after the final iteration depends on how many times the condition was true and can vary based on the implementation of `func_1`.

Therefore, after the loop concludes:
- If the loop has executed `k` times, then `left` will be the original value minus `k`, and `func_1(left)` will be less than `m`, indicating that it has dropped below the threshold.

Output State: **`left` is equal to its original value minus `k`, where `k` is the number of iterations; `func_1(left)` is less than `m`. The values of `m`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `zeroes`, and `result` remain unchanged.**
