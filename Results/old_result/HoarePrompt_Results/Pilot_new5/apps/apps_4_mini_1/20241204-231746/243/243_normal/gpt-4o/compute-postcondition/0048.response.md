To determine what needs to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the loop condition `func_1(right) == m`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `left` is equal to its original value minus `k`, which does not directly impact the loop condition.
- `func_1(left)` is less than `m`, which also does not impact the loop condition directly.
- `right` is equal to `mid + 1`, this may influence `func_1(right)`.
- `m`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `zeroes`, and `result` remain unchanged.

For the loop to execute, the condition `func_1(right) == m` must hold true. Since `right` is `mid + 1`, we need to evaluate what `func_1(mid + 1)` returns in comparison to `m`.

To ensure the loop can execute at least once:
1. We must ensure that `func_1(right)` (which is `func_1(mid + 1)`) equals `m`, which is not guaranteed based on the provided information. Thus, the state of `right` or the underlying function `func_1` needs to be adjusted such that `func_1(right) = m`.

Since there's no information about possible values of `func_1` at this `right`, we can determine that in order for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `func_1(mid + 1)` equals `m`.

State: **`left` is equal to its original value minus `k`, `func_1(mid + 1)` must equal `m`, `right` is equal to `mid + 1`, `m`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `zeroes`, and `result` remain unchanged.**
