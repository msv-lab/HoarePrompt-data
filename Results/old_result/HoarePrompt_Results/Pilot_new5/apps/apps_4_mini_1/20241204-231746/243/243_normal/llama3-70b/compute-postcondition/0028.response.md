The code appends the value of `n` to the list `ans`. The value of `n` is 2, so this means `ans` will now contain an additional element, making it [1, 2]. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`count` is 1, `n` is 2, `m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, and `ans` is [1, 2]**.
