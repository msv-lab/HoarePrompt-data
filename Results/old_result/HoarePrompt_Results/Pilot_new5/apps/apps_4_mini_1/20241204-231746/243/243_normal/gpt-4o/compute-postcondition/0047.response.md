The value of `right` is updated to `mid + 1`. The values of `left`, `m`, `low`, `high`, `zeroes`, and `result` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is equal to its original value minus `k`, where `k` is the number of iterations; `func_1(left)` is less than `m`; `right` is equal to `mid + 1`; `m`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `zeroes`, and `result` remain unchanged.
