The variable `left` is assigned the value of `mid`. The value of `mid` is calculated as (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` is 0; `high` is 5 * (`m` + 1); `mid` is (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2; `zeroes` is the result of `func_1(mid)`; `result` is an empty list; `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`; `left` is equal to `mid`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` is 0; `high` is 5 * (`m` + 1); `mid` is (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2; `zeroes` is the result of `func_1(mid)`; `result` is an empty list; `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`; `left` is equal to (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2.**
