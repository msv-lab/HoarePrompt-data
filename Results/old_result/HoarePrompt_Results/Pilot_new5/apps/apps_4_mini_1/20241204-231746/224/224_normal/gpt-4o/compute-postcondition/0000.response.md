The variable `result` is assigned the value of `1`. The value of `n` remains unchanged and is still an integer such that `2 <= n <= 10^6`. The variable `mod` is also unchanged and is equal to `10^9 + 7`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 10^6`, `mod` is equal to `10^9 + 7`, and `result` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 10^6`, `mod` is equal to `10^9 + 7`, `result` is 1**.
