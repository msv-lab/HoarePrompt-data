To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze how the loop operates based on the given variables and their current values.

1. The loop statement `for j in range(f_max_n, 0, -1)` indicates that `j` starts at `f_max_n` and decrements by 1 until it reaches 1. This means that during each iteration, `j` will take the values `f_max_n, f_max_n - 1, ..., 2, 1`.

2. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is currently `f_max_n - 1`. In the next iteration, `j` will be decremented by 1, so `j` will become `f_max_n - 2`.

3. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is greater than 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must still be greater than 0, which will be true since `j = f_max_n - 2` should be at least 1, given the constraint on `f_max_n` (which is at least 1).

4. Since `j` will now be `f_max_n - 2`, we need to ensure that `dp[j]` is updated correctly for the next iteration. The values used in the loop, including `dp[j]` and `dp[j - 1]`, should remain valid for the new value of `j`.

From the above analysis, the updated states at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`n` is in the range 2 <= `n` <= 10^6, `f_max_n` must be at least 1, `MOD` is 1000000007, `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1`, `dp[0]` is 1, for each `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` has been updated to `dp[j] + dp[j - 1]`, `i` is 2, `j` is `f_max_n - 2`, `dp[j]` is now equal to `(dp[j] + dp[j - 1]) % 1000000007`.**
