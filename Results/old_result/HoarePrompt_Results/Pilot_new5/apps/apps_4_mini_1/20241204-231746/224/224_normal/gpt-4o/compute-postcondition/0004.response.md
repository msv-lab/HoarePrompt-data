`result` is assigned the value of `result * i % mod`. The previous value of `result` is 2, the value of `i` is 3, and `mod` is equal to `10^9 + 7`. Therefore, `result` becomes `(2 * 3) % (10^9 + 7)` which equals `6`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` must be at least 3, `mod` is equal to `10^9 + 7`, `result` is 6, `i` is 3**
