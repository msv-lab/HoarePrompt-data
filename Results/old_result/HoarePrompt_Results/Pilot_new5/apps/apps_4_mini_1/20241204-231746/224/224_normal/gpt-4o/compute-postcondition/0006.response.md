To analyze the provided code snippet, we start by updating the value of `result`. 

The previous values are:
- `result` is 6
- `i` is 4
- `mod` is `10^9 + 7` (which is 1000000007)

The calculation for `result` will be as follows:
```
result = result * i % mod
       = 6 * 4 % 1000000007
       = 24 % 1000000007
       = 24
```
So, `result` is updated from 6 to 24, while all other variables remain unchanged.

Hence, the output state is: 
Output State: **`n` must be at least 3, `mod` is equal to `10^9 + 7`, `result` is 24, `i` is 4**
