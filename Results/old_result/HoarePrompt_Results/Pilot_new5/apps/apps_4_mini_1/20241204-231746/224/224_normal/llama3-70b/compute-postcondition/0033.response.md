The value of `dp[j]` is updated by adding `dp[j - 1]` to it. The variable `j` is equal to `f_max_n - 2`, so `dp[j]` becomes `dp[f_max_n - 2] + dp[f_max_n - 3]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is in the range 2 <= `n` <= 10^6, `f_max_n` must be at least 1, `MOD` is 1000000007, `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1`, `dp[0]` is 1, for each `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` has been updated to `dp[j] + dp[j - 1]`, `i` is 2, `j` is `f_max_n - 2`, `dp[j]` is now equal to `(dp[f_max_n - 2] + dp[f_max_n - 3]) % 1000000007`.

Output State: **`n` is in the range 2 <= `n` <= 10^6, `f_max_n` must be at least 1, `MOD` is 1000000007, `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1`, `dp[0]` is 1, for each `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` has been updated to `dp[j] + dp[j - 1]`, `i` is 2, `j` is `f_max_n - 2`, `dp[j]` is now equal to `(dp[f_max_n - 2] + dp[f_max_n - 3]) % 1000000007`.**
