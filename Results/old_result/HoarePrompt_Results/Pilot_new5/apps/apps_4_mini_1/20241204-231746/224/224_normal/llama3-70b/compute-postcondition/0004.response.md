According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `f_max_n`. For the loop to execute, `f_max_n` must be at least 1, since the loop iterates from `f_max_n` down to 1. The state of `dp` is defined, and since `i` is already set to 1, it does not need to be adjusted. Given that `n` is within the specified range and `f_max_n` is non-negative, we need to ensure `f_max_n` is at least 1.

State: **`n` is in the range 2 <= n <= 10^6, `f_max_n` must be at least 1, `MOD` is 1000000007, `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1` with `dp[0]` set to 1, `i` is 1**
