Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the functionality described in the problem statement. The problem requires us to compute the number of permutations of integers \(1\) to \(n\) such that \(f(p) = f_{\text{max}}(n)\).

1. The program calculates the factorial of \(n-1\) using the function `func_1`, which is not aligned with the problem requirement. The program assumes that the number of permutations meeting the condition is equal to \((n-1)!\) (factorial of \(n-1\)), which is incorrect.

2. The value \(f_{\text{max}}(n)\) and the count of permutations \(p\) such that \(f(p) = f_{\text{max}}(n)\) is not properly defined or computed in the program. The program does not determine \(f_{\text{max}}(n)\) or properly count the permutations that satisfy \(f(p) = f_{\text{max}}(n)\).

In particular, the examples provided in the problem do not match the output produced by the program. For \(n=3\), it gives an output of \(2! = 2\), but the problem states that there should be \(4\) permutations such that \(f(p) = f_{\text{max}}(3)\).

Thus, since the program fails to implement the logic required to meet the problem's description, it is deemed incorrect.
