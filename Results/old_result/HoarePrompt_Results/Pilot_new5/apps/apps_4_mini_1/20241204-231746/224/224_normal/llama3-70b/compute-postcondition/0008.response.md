The code updates `dp[j]` by adding the value of `dp[j - 1]` to it. Given that `j` is 1, this means `dp[1]` will be updated. 

Initially, we know:
- `dp[0]` is 1 (as stated in the initial state).
- The value of `dp[1]` is unspecified but will be updated based on the value of `dp[0]`.

Thus, after executing the code:
- `dp[1]` becomes `dp[1] + dp[0]`, which means `dp[1]` will take on a new value that is the sum of its previous value and `1` (the current value of `dp[0]`).

Since `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] % 1000000007`, there are no changes to this modulo operation since both `dp[1]` and `dp[0]` are not specified to exceed this limit in the current context.

The output state therefore reflects that `dp[1]` has been updated based on the initial value of `dp[0]`.

Output State: **`n` is in the range 2 <= n <= 10^6; `f_max_n` must be at least 1; `MOD` is 1000000007; `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1`, `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[1]` is updated to `dp[1] + 1` and then `dp[1]` is `dp[1] % 1000000007`.**
