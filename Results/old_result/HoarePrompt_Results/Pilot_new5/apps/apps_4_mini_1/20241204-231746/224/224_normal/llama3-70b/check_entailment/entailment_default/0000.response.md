To analyze the code provided in conjunction with the problem description, we need to examine each function and its output descriptions closely.

### Function Analysis

**Function 1: `func_1(a, b)`**

- This function is designed to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two non-negative integers using the Euclidean algorithm.
- The output hint correctly describes the function's expected behavior. The GCD is defined conventionally, including the edge case where both `a` and `b` are zero, which is acceptable. 

**Function 2: `func_2(n)`**

- This function aims to return the maximum GCD value among the integers from `1` to `n`.
- The logic iterates through all integers from `1` to `n`, maintaining a maximum GCD value computed by calling `func_1`.
- However, it appears to misunderstand the problem prompt because it does not directly compute the GCD of the prefixes of any permutation, which is required to find `f(p)`. Instead, it just calculates the maximum GCD that can be obtained from one number iteratively, which does not correspond to the permutations' GCD values.

**Function 3: `func_3(n, f_max_n)`**

- This function aims to calculate the number of permutations that yield the maximum value of `f(p)`.
- It iteratively builds a dynamic programming array to count ways to achieve a certain sum. However, it assumes that `f_max_n` is valid and does not check for bounds. There are also potential logical flaws in how permutations are counted based on the definition of `f_max_n` derived from `func_2`.

### Output Description and Hints Analysis

- The output hints for `func_1` are accurate and agree with its implementation.
- The output description for `func_2` is misleading because it does not correctly reflect the GCDs of permutations, which is what needs to be calculated according to the problem description.
- The output description for `func_3` assumes accurate values for `f_max_n`, which were incorrectly computed by `func_2`.

### Edge Cases

1. **Edge Case for `func_2`:** The function does not compute the distinct GCDs for permutations and thus may not return the correct value of `f_max(n)`. For example, for `n = 3`, it should have accounted for permutations with different arrangements leading to varying prefix GCDs.
2. **Bound Checking for `func_3`:** If `f_max_n` is greater than the initialized bounds in `dp`, it could lead to an index error. 

### Conclusion

The provided functions do not correctly address the problem as described. The misinterpretation of how to compute prefix GCDs for permutations in `func_2` and the assumptions in `func_3` both lead to the conclusion that the program fails to meet the requirements set forth by the problem description.

Correctness: **False**. 

The primary failure is the incorrect computation of maximum GCDs from permutations in `func_2`, which leads to wrong results for any test case where distinct GCD values could yield differing counts of permutations. This violates the problem's requirement that all permutations be considered, thus making the implementation incorrect as a whole.
