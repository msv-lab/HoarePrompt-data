To verify the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the functions and their annotations in the context of the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap
We need to define a function \( f(p) \) for a permutation \( p \) of integers \( 1 \) to \( n \) that counts the distinct GCDs of all prefixes of the permutation. Then, \( f_{max}(n) \) is defined as the maximum value of \( f(p) \) across all permutations of \( 1, 2, \ldots, n \). We need to count how many permutations achieve this maximum value, returning the result modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

### Functions Analysis
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - Computes the GCD of two non-negative integers using the Euclidean algorithm. It appears correct as it handles basic GCD behavior including the case when one or both numbers are zero.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - Iterates from \( 1 \) to \( n \), calling `func_1` with the current maximum GCD found so far and the current integer \( i \). This function is supposed to determine \( f_{max}(n) \), but it does not seem to correctly compute the number of distinct GCDs from the prefixes of permutations. Merely computing the GCDs and taking the maximum does not fulfill the requirement of counting distinct GCDs from the prefixes of all permutations.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - Computes a dynamic programming table to count the permutations based on the previously calculated maximum distinct GCDs. However, the way it builds the `dp` array does not seem to accurately reflect the permutations of integers \( 1 \) to \( n \) that yield \( f(p) = f_{max}(n) \). 

### Example Cases
- For \( n = 2 \), the only permutation is \([1, 2]\) yielding \( f(p) = 1 \). The output is correctly \( 1 \).
- For \( n = 3 \), the permutations where \( f(p) = 2 \) do not seem to be accurately calculated by `func_2`, as it simply finds the maximum GCD among the numbers without ensuring the logic checks for multiple permutations.
- For \( n = 6 \), multiple \( f(p) \) values need to be calculated, and the program should return \( 120 \). It is unclear if `func_2` correctly captures all distinct GCDs.

### Conclusion
The crucial point of failure is in `func_2`, where it does not properly handle the distinct counting of GCDs among the permutations. This leads to the conclusion that the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

Thus, we can confidently conclude that:

Correctness: **False**

The program fails to account for distinct GCDs properly in permutations, leading to incorrect outputs for various inputs, as shown in the analysis of the functions.
