In the provided code, the variable `dp[j]` is updated to be `dp[j]` modulo `MOD`. Since `MOD` is a large prime number (1000000007), this operation ensures that `dp[j]` remains within a manageable range, specifically from 0 to 1000000006. The variable `j` is currently set to `f_max_n - 2`, meaning that the operation directly affects `dp[f_max_n - 2]`.

The previous state of `dp[f_max_n - 2]` is retained, but its value is now constrained by the modulo operation. The other affected variables (`f_max_n`, `MOD`, and `dp`) remain unchanged in terms of their definitions, but the specific value of `dp[j]` (which is `dp[f_max_n - 2]`) is updated.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is in the range 2 <= n <= 10^6; `f_max_n` must be at least 2; `MOD` is 1000000007; `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1; `dp[0]` is 1; for each `j` from 1 to `f_max_n, `dp[j]` has been updated; `i` is 1; `j` is `f_max_n - 2; dp[j] is now dp[f_max_n - 2] modulo 1000000007.**
