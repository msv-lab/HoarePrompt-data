The code assigns the value of `max_length` to be the product of `max_speed` and `t`. The variable `max_speed` is already defined as the maximum of `v_1` and `v_2`, so its value is determined by those two variables. The value of `t` is an input integer. Other variables, such as `v_1`, `v_2`, `d`, and `min_speed`, are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`v_1` is an integer representing speed in meters per second; `v_2` is an integer representing speed in meters per second; `t` is an input integer; `d` is an input integer representing the maximum speed change per second; `max_speed` is the maximum of `v_1` and `v_2`; `min_speed` is the minimum of `v_1` and `v_2`; `max_length` is equal to `max_speed * t`.**
