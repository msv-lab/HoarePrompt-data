According to the code, the loop will execute if the range specified in the for statement is valid. The range is defined as `range(t - 1, 0, -1)`, which means the loop will iterate from `t - 1` down to 1 (inclusive). For the loop to execute at least once, `t - 1` must be greater than or equal to 1. This implies that `t` must be at least 2.

Additionally, the variable `i` will start at `t - 1` on the first iteration of the loop. Therefore, we need to adjust the states to ensure that `t` is at least 2 and initialize `i` appropriately.

State: **`v_1` is an integer, `v_2` is an integer, `t` must be at least 2, `d` is an integer, `max_speed` is the maximum of `v_1` and `v_2`, `min_speed` is the minimum of `v_1` and `v_2`, `max_length` is equal to `max_speed * t`, `min_length` is equal to `min_speed * t`, `i` is `t - 1`**
