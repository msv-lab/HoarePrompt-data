The code provided prints the value of `total_distance`, which is the sum of the elements in the `speeds` list. The state of `total_distance` relies on the pre-calculated values in `speeds`, but it is not updated or altered by the print statement itself. Therefore, we can conclude that `total_distance` is still dependent on the values in `speeds` which have already been computed based on the initial conditions.

Output State: **`speeds[i]` for `i` from 1 to `t-1` is updated based on the formula `speeds[i] = min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)`; `speeds[0]` is `v_1`; `speeds[t-1]` is `v_2`; `t` is between 2 and 100; `d` is between 0 and 10; `total_distance` is the sum of elements in `speeds`, which is printed.**
