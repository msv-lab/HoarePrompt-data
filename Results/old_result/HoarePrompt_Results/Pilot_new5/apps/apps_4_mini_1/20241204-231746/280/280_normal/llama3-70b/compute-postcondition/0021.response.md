To analyze the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to focus on the loop's behavior and how it modifies the relevant variables over time.

The loop iterates from `t - 1` down to `1`, which means it will execute a total of `t - 1` times, provided that `t` is at least 2. During each iteration, the following changes occur:

1. `max_speed` is decreased by `d`, but it cannot fall below `min_speed`.
2. `min_speed` is increased by `d`, but it cannot exceed `max_speed`.
3. `max_length` accumulates the current value of `max_speed`.
4. `min_length` accumulates the current value of `min_speed`.
5. The iteration variable `i` decreases each time from `t - 1` down to `1`.

To determine the final values of `max_speed`, `min_speed`, `max_length`, and `min_length`, we can summarize the changes over the `t - 1` iterations:

- As `max_speed` is decremented by `d` and bounded by `min_speed`, after `t - 1` iterations, `max_speed` will converge towards `min_speed`, unless `min_speed` remains below `max_speed` due to the increment of `d`.
- Conversely, `min_speed` will increase towards `max_speed`, but is limited by the same condition.

The final values of `max_length` and `min_length` depend on how many iterations have occurred and the final values of `max_speed` and `min_speed`.

Before the loop:
- `max_length` is `max_speed * t`
- `min_length` is `min_speed * t`

After all iterations:
- Since the loop runs `t - 1` times, `max_length` will have accumulated `max_speed` values `t - 1` times.
- Similarly, `min_length` will have accumulated `min_speed` values `t - 1` times.

Thus, after all iterations:
- `max_length` will be `max_length + (t - 1) * max_speed`.
- `min_length` will be `min_length + (t - 1) * min_speed`.

Now, we can summarize the final output state:

Output State: **`v_1` is an integer, `v_2` is an integer, `t` must be at least 2, `d` is an integer, `max_speed` is equal to `max(max_speed - d * (t - 1), min_speed)`, `min_speed` is equal to `min(min_speed + d * (t - 1), max_speed)`, `max_length` is equal to its original value plus `(t - 1) * max_speed`, and `min_length` is equal to its original value plus `(t - 1) * min_speed`.**
