To evaluate the impact of the code snippet, let's break down how it modifies the relevant variables based on the initial conditions provided.

1. The initial state indicates that `max_speed` is defined as the maximum of `v_1` and `v_2`, and `min_speed` is the minimum of `v_1` and `v_2`.
2. The variable `d` is subtracted from `max_speed` and then compared with `min_speed`. The maximum function ensures that `max_speed` does not drop below `min_speed`.
3. After executing the code, `max_speed` will be updated based on the formula `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`.

Let's denote:
- `max_speed = max(v_1, v_2)`
- `min_speed = min(v_1, v_2)`

The output state will reflect the updated value of `max_speed`, while all other variables retain their previous states, except for the updated `max_speed`.

Output State: **`v_1` is an integer, `v_2` is an integer, `t` must be at least 2, `d` is an integer, `min_speed` is the minimum of `v_1` and `v_2`, `max_speed` is equal to `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`, `max_length` is equal to `max_speed * t`, `min_length` is equal to `min_speed * t`, `i` is `t - 1`**
