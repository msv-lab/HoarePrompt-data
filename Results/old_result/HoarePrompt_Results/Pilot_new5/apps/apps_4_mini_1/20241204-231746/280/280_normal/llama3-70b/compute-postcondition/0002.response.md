`max_speed` is assigned the value of the maximum of `v_1` and `v_2`, which are both integers representing speeds. The states of the other variables `t` and `d` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `v_1` is an integer representing speed in meters per second; `v_2` is an integer representing speed in meters per second; `t` is an input integer; `d` is an input integer representing the maximum speed change per second; `max_speed` is the maximum of `v_1` and `v_2`.

Output State: **`v_1` is an integer representing speed in meters per second; `v_2` is an integer representing speed in meters per second; `t` is an input integer; `d` is an input integer representing the maximum speed change per second; `max_speed` is the maximum of `v_1` and `v_2`.**
