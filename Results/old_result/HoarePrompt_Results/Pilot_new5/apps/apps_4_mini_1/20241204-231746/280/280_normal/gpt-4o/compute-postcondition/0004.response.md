The code assigns the value of `v_2` to the last element of the `speeds` list, which is `speeds[t-1]` since lists in Python are zero-indexed. The initial state indicates that `speeds[0]` equals `v_1` and the other elements from `speeds[1]` to `speeds[t-1]` are still zeros. The value of `speeds[-1]` is effectively the same as `speeds[t-1]`.

Therefore, after the execution of the code, `speeds[t-1]` will now hold the value of `v_2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`v_1` is an integer based on the input; `v_2` is an integer based on the input; `t` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive); `d` is an integer between 0 and 10 (inclusive); `speeds[0]` equals `v_1`; `speeds[1]` to `speeds[t-2]` are still zeros; `speeds[t-1]` equals `v_2`.**
