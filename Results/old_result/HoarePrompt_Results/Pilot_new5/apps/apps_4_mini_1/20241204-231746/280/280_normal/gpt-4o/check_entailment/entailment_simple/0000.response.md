To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze what the program does and how it aligns with the requirements.

### Problem Requirements:
1. The speed at the beginning of the path is `v_1` and at the end is `v_2`.
2. The car travels for exactly `t` seconds.
3. The speed can change at most by `d` meters per second between any two adjacent seconds.
4. We need to calculate the maximum possible length of the path in meters.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads `v1`, `v2`, `t`, and `d`.

2. **Speed Initialization**: It initializes an array `speeds` of size `t`, setting:
   - `speeds[0]` to `v1`
   - `speeds[t-1]` to `v2`
   
3. **Speed Calculation**: In the loop that runs from `1` to `t-1`, the program calculates:
   ```python
   speeds[i] = min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)
   ```
   This logic attempts to ensure:
   - The speed at each second does not exceed the speed of the previous second plus `d` (which respects the maximum change constraint).
   - The speed does not exceed the maximum possible speed that could still allow reaching `v2` at the last second, taking into account the remaining time.

4. **Total Distance Calculation**: The total distance is computed by summing up all elements in the `speeds` list, which gives the total path length.

### Correctness Check:
- The program respects that the first speed is `v1` and the last speed is `v2`.
- The speeds between them change by at most `d` per second.
- The maximum distance is achieved by trying to maximize each speed appropriately within the constraints, ensuring that the speeds do not exceed the calculated maximum allowed speed.

### Conclusion:
1. The logic implemented in the program aligns with the requirements specified in the problem description.
2. The approach of filling in the speeds while respecting the constraints ensures that the maximum possible distance is calculated correctly.

Based on this analysis, the program is indeed correct according to the description provided.

Correctness: **True**
