The variable `move_to_l` is assigned the value of the absolute difference between `pos` and `l`. Since `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`, and `l` is also an integer between 1 and `n` with the condition that `l` is not equal to 1, we know that both variables have valid integer values within their specified ranges. The other variables (`n`, `r`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`; `l` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `l` is not equal to 1; `r` is an integer between `l` and `n`; `move_to_l` is equal to `abs(pos - l)`**
