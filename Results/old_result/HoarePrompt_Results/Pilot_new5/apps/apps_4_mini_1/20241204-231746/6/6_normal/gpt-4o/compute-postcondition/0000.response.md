The code snippet assigns new values to the variables `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` by taking input and mapping it to integers. The initial state indicates that `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, and the integers `pos`, `l`, and `r` are constrained by `n`, `l`, and `r` in terms of their valid ranges.

Since the input will allow for new values to be assigned to `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r`, the output state will reflect that these variables now hold whatever integer values were provided as input. However, the constraints on their ranges still apply.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`; `l` is an integer between 1 and `n`; `r` is an integer between `l` and `n`, and `n`, `pos`, `l`, `r` are assigned new values based on input.**
