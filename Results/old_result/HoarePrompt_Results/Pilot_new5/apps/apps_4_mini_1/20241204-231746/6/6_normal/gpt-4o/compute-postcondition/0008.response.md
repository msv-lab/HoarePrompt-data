The code calculates the absolute difference between `pos` and `l`, then adds 1 to that value. The result is printed but does not affect the state of the variables. The value of `n` remains an integer between 1 and 100, `pos` remains an integer between 1 and `n`, `l` remains an integer between 1 and `n`, and `r` remains an integer between `l` and `n` (with current value of `r` equal to `n`). The exact values of `pos` and `l` are needed to determine the resulting value, but they are not provided.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`; `l` is an integer between 1 and `n`; `r` is an integer between `l` and `n`; `l` is not equal to 1; or `r` is not equal to `n`; the current value of `r` is equal to `n`; value printed is abs(pos - l) + 1**.
