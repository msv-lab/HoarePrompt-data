The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r`. The parameter `n` is an integer that must be between 1 and 100. The parameter `pos` is an integer that must be between 1 and `n`. The parameter `l` is also an integer that must be between 1 and `n`, and the parameter `r` is an integer that must be between `l` and `n`, representing the indices of the tabs. 

The function's output is based on these parameters, but specific return values or conditions were not provided in your request. Consequently, I cannot describe the return values without additional information.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, pos, l, and r, where n is an integer between 1 and 100, pos is an integer between 1 and n, l is an integer between 1 and n, and r is an integer between l and n.**
