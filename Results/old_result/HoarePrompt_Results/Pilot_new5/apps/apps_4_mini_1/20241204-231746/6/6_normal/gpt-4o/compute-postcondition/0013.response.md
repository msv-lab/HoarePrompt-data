The code snippet provided is a `print` statement that outputs the value of `close_both_sides`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged, as the `print` function does not modify any variables. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`; `l` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `l` is not equal to 1; `r` is an integer between `l` and `n`; `move_to_l` is equal to `abs(pos - l)`; `move_to_r` is equal to `abs(pos - r)`; `close_both_sides` is equal to `min(move_to_l + (r - l + 2), move_to_r + (r - l + 2))` and the value of `close_both_sides` is printed.**
