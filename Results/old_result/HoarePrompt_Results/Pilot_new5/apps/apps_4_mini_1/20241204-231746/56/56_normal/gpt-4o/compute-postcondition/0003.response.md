The variable `bits` is initialized as an empty list. This does not affect the values of `n` and `k`, which remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state incorporates the unchanged conditions for `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5, and `k` is less than or equal to `n`; `bits` is an empty list.**
