The code snippet `smallest = bits.pop()` removes the last element from the list `bits` and assigns it to the variable `smallest`. The variable `smallest` will now hold the value of the last element that was in `bits`, and the list `bits` will have one less element. 

Since `smallest` is defined as the last element removed from `bits`, we can conclude that the new state of `bits` will be one element less than its previous size, and `smallest` will be equal to the last element that was in `bits`. 

The other variables (`n`, `k`, and the condition that `len(bits)` must be less than `k`) remain unchanged through this operation, as no operations in the code affect them.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5 and `k` ≤ `n`, `len(bits)` is less than `k`, `smallest` is the last element that was in `bits`, `bits` now includes `smallest - 1` as the last element.**
