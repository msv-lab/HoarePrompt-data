The code provided prints the elements of the list `a`, which is already sorted in reverse order, with each element converted to a string and joined by spaces. The values of `n`, `i`, and `k` are not directly affected by this operation. Thus, the output state will reflect that `'Yes'` has been printed, and the values of `a` are displayed as a space-separated string.

Output State: **`n` is 0 or less; `i` is equal to the number of times the loop executed; `a` is sorted in reverse order; the length of `a` is equal to `k; 'Yes' has been printed; the output of ' '.join(map(str, a)) is the space-separated string of elements in a.**
