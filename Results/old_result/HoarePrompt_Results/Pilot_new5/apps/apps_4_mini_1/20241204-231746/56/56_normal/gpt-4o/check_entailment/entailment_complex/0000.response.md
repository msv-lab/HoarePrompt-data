Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers, `n` and `k`, which conform to the constraints given in the problem statement (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5).

2. **Initial Checks**: 
   - The program first checks if `k > n`. If this condition is true, it returns 'No', which is correct because it's impossible to have a sum of powers of 2 that equals `n` if there are more terms (`k`) than the sum itself. This adheres to the constraint that `k` must be at least 1 and cannot exceed `n`.
   - The program then checks if the number of set bits in `n` (the positions where the binary representation of `n` has a '1') is greater than `k`. If this is the case, it returns 'No' since we cannot represent `n` as a sum of `k` terms if there are more bits set than available slots (k).

3. **Generating the Sequence**: 
   - If the number of set bits is less than or equal to `k`, the program enters a loop to adjust the number of bits until it reaches exactly `k`. It does this by repeatedly taking the smallest bit from the current set of bits, decrementing it, and adding two instances of the decremented value back to the list. This is a valid approach because it maintains the sum (since decrementing a bit value effectively means splitting a power of 2 into two smaller powers) and ensures that we can fill the required length `k` while still being able to reconstruct `n` using those bits.
   - The loop continues until the length of `bits` is equal to `k`, ensuring that there are exactly `k` terms in the final sequence.

4. **Lexicographical Order**: 
   - After ensuring that the length of `bits` is `k`, the program sorts the list in descending order. This guarantees that the output sequence is lexicographically largest, as required by the problem statement.

5. **Output Format**: 
   - Finally, the program outputs 'Yes' followed by the elements of the `bits` list joined by spaces, which matches the output requirements given in the problem description.

Overall, the program systematically checks the necessary conditions and generates a valid output that aligns with the specifications outlined in the problem description. Thus, it is correct for all valid input cases defined by the problem.
