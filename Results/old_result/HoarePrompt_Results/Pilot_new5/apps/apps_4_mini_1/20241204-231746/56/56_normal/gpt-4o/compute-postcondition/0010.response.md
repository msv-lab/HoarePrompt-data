Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5 and `k` is less than or equal to `n`, `i` is 59, and if the bit at position 60 of `n` is set, then `bits` contains the value 60 and 59 is appended to `bits`. If the bit at position 59 of `n` is also set, then 59 is appended to `bits`. If the bit at position 60 is not set, the state of `bits` remains unchanged.***
