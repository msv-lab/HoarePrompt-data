`a` is sorted in reverse order, meaning that the elements in `a` will now be arranged from highest to lowest. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged, and the length of `a`, which is equal to `k`, also remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is 0 or less; `i` is equal to the number of times the loop executed; `a` is sorted in reverse order; the length of `a` is equal to `k`.

Output State: **`n` is 0 or less; `i` is equal to the number of times the loop executed; `a` is sorted in reverse order; the length of `a` is equal to `k.**
