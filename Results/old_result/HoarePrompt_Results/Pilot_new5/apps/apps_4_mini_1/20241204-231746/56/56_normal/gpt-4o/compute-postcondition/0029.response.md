The code appends the value of `smallest - 1` to the list `bits`. The variable `smallest` is already defined as the last element that was in `bits` before it was popped. Since `bits` had one less element before this operation, the operation will not affect the other variables' states, but it will modify the list `bits` by adding a new element. 

Since `smallest` is the last element of `bits` before the pop operation, appending `smallest - 1` to `bits` adds a value that is one less than the last element of the previous `bits`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5 and `k` ≤ `n`, `len(bits)` is less than `k`, `smallest` is the last element that was in `bits` before it was popped, `bits` has one more element equal to `smallest - 1`**
