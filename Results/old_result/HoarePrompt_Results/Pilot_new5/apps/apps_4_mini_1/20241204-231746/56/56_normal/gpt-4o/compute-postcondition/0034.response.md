Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) and a positive integer `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5). It returns 'No' if `k` is greater than `n` or if the number of set bits in the binary representation of `n` is greater than `k`. If there are fewer set bits than `k`, the function generates `k` bits by decrementing the smallest index of the set bits and returns 'Yes' followed by the `k` bits sorted in descending order. If the number of set bits is equal to `k`, it returns 'Yes' followed by those bits.**
