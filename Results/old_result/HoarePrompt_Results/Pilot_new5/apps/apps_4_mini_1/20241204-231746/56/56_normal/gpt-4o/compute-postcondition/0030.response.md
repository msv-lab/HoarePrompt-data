Output State: **`len(bits)` is equal to `k`, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5 and `k` ≤ `n`, `bits` contains k elements all of which are derived from the original bits, with each element being a non-negative integer less than or equal to the smallest original index in `bits`.**
