Postcondition: ***`n` is 0 or less, `i` is equal to the number of times the loop executed, and `a` contains all the values of `x` collected during each iteration, where each `x` is equal to `n.bit_length() - 1` at that time. If the length of `a` is less than `k`, then 'No' is printed. Otherwise, 'Yes' is printed, `a` is sorted in reverse order, and the length of `a` is equal to `k`, with the output of ' '.join(map(str, a)) being the space-separated string of elements in `a`.***
