To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the program's logic in relation to the requirements outlined.

### Problem Breakdown
The problem states that Memory starts with an equilateral triangle of side length `x` and wants to change it to side length `y` while ensuring that:
1. The triangle remains a non-degenerate triangle during the changes (i.e., all sides must be positive).
2. The sides must be integers.
3. The minimum number of seconds required to change from `x` to `y` must be computed.

### Program Analysis
The annotated program reads two integers `x` and `y`, then computes the required number of seconds as follows:

```python
print((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2)
```

The expression `(x - y) // 2` calculates how many full decrements of 2 can be made from `x` to reach `y`, which effectively counts the number of seconds needed if two sides can be changed at once. The term `(x - y) % 2` checks if there is a need for an additional second to decrement the last side to ensure it reaches the exact length when the difference between `x` and `y` is odd.

### Correctness Check
1. **For `x = 6` and `y = 3`:**
   - Difference: `x - y = 3`. 
   - Seconds calculated: `(3 // 2) + (3 % 2) = 1 + 1 = 2`. 
   - However, it is known from the description that it actually takes 4 seconds to reach (3,3,3). Therefore, this is incorrect.

2. **For `x = 8` and `y = 5`:**
   - Difference: `x - y = 3`.
   - Seconds calculated: `(3 // 2) + (3 % 2) = 1 + 1 = 2`.
   - The correct number of seconds should be 3, as per the example provided in the description.

3. **For `x = 22` and `y = 4`:**
   - Difference: `x - y = 18`.
   - Seconds calculated: `(18 // 2) + (18 % 2) = 9 + 0 = 9`.
   - The correct number of seconds is 6, as shown in the example.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the minimum number of seconds needed to change the triangle from side length `x` to side length `y`. The calculations of the number of seconds are flawed, as they do not reflect the need to maintain all sides as positive integers throughout the transformation process.

Thus, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
