The code `print(abs(x - y))` calculates the absolute difference between `x` and `y`, which will be a non-negative integer. The initial state specifies that `x` and `y` are input integers, and `y` is constrained such that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`. 

The result of `abs(x - y)` will be `x - y` since `x` is always greater than `y`. Therefore, the output will be the absolute difference `x - y` while retaining the constraints on `x` and `y`.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, and the output is `x - y`.**
