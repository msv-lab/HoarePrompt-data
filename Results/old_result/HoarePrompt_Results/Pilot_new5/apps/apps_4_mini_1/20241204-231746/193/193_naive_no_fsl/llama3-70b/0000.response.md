Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain an equilateral triangle of side length `y` from one of side length `x`. 

The program simply calculates the absolute difference between `x` and `y` using `print(abs(x - y))`. However, this does not account for the constraints of maintaining a non-degenerate triangle while performing modifications on the sides. According to the problem, at any moment, all sides must remain positive integers, and the operations must be carried out in a manner that adheres to the properties of triangles.

For example, consider the input:
```
x = 6, y = 3
```

In this case, the program outputs `abs(6 - 3) = 3`. However, to turn the triangle from `(6, 6, 6)` to `(3, 3, 3)`, the steps must be:
1. Change one side to 3: `(6, 6, 3)` (1 second)
2. Change one side to 4: `(6, 4, 3)` (2 seconds)
3. Change one side to 3: `(3, 4, 3)` (3 seconds)
4. Change one side to 3: `(3, 3, 3)` (4 seconds)

Therefore, it actually takes **4 seconds** to achieve the desired state, which is not captured by the program. The program's logic fails to consider the requirements of maintaining a valid triangle throughout the modifications. 

Hence, the program is incorrect and does not fulfill the problem's requirements.
