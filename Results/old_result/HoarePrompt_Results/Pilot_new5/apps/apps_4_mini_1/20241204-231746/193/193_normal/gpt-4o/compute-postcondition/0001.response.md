The expression `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2` calculates the midpoint between `x` and `y`, rounding up if the difference is odd. The initial state indicates that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, which means both `x` and `y` are integers within the given range.

After evaluating the expression:
- Let the difference `d = x - y`.
- The integer division `(x - y) // 2` gives the floor of half the difference.
- The expression `(x - y) % 2` checks if the difference is odd (1 if odd, 0 if even), effectively rounding up when added.

Thus, the output reflects that this calculation results in the average of `x` and `y`, rounded up if the difference is odd:

Output State: **`3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, the result of the calculation is `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2` which represents the midpoint between `x` and `y` rounded up if necessary.**
