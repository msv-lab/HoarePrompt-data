Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `p` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `visited` is a list of `n` Boolean values where indices accessed during the loop are marked as True, and `cycles` includes the previous cycles along with the current `cycle`, which now also contains all indices that were part of the cycle. The variable `x` points to the node that caused the loop to terminate. If `visited[i]` was False, it is now marked as True, and the current cycle is updated accordingly.***
