The variable `data` is assigned the result of splitting the input read from `sys.stdin.read()`. The `input()` function reads the entire input as a single string, and `split()` breaks this string into a list of substrings based on whitespace. 

The previous values of `n`, `p`, and `b` remain unchanged, but the value of `data` will now be a list of strings derived from the input. The exact content of `data` will depend on the specific input provided during execution.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `p` is a list of integers representing a valid permutation of length n (1 ≤ p[i] ≤ n), `b` is a list of integers of length n consisting of 0s and 1s, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input.**
