According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`, which is currently equal to `n`. The loop will iterate while `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `n`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to `n+1`, which exceeds the range defined by `for i in range(n)`. Therefore, the loop cannot execute again as it has reached its maximum limit.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `p` is a valid permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, `b` is a list of integers, and `i` is equal to `n+1`**
