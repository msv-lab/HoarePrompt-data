The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are positive integers. After executing the function body, if `b` is 0, the function returns the value of `a`, which is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `a` and `b`, and return the value of `a` when `b` is 0, indicating that `a` is the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `a` and `b`, both positive integers, and returns `a` when `b` is 0, representing the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`.**
