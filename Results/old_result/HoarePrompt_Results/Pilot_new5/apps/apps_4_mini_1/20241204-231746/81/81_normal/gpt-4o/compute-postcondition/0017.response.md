According to the code, the loop iterates with `i` ranging from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(z))`. The condition for executing the loop again depends on the value of `i` in relation to `int(math.sqrt(z))`.

At the end of the last iteration, we have `i` as the current iteration index. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(z))`. If the previous value of `i` was the last in its range, it would now be incremented by 1.

To summarize:
- The current value of `i` will increase by 1 for the next iteration.
- The loop can execute again if the new value of `i` (which will be `i + 1`) is still less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(z))`.

Thus, if `i` is currently less than `int(math.sqrt(z))`, the next value of `i` would be `i + 1`.

State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^9, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ `y` ≤ 10^9 and `y` is a multiple of `x`, `i` is the next integer (i + 1) and must be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(z))`.**
