The variable `i` is assigned the value `5`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `x` is greater than 3, and `x` is neither divisible by 2 nor divisible by 3; `i` is now 5.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `x` is greater than 3, and `x` is neither divisible by 2 nor divisible by 3; `i` is 5**.
