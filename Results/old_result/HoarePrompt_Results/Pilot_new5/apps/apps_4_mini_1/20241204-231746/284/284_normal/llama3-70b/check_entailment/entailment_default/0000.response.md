To assess the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and the output hints.

### Problem Description Recap
- We need to find a positive integer \( m \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number for a given positive integer \( n \) (where \( 1 \leq n \leq 1000 \)).
- The output \( m \) must be in the range \( 1 \leq m \leq 1000 \).

### Program Analysis
```python
n = int(input())
for m in range(1, 1001):
    if not func_1(n * m + 1):
        print(m)
        break

def func_1(num):
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer \( n \) from input.
2. **Loop through \( m \)**: It iterates \( m \) from 1 to 1000.
3. **Check for Non-prime**: It calls `func_1` with \( n \cdot m + 1 \). If `func_1` returns `False`, it means \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number, and it prints \( m \) and breaks the loop.
4. **func_1 Implementation**:
   - Returns `False` for numbers less than 2 (correct).
   - Uses a loop up to the square root of `num` to check for divisibility. If `num` is divisible by any of these, it returns `False`, indicating that `num` is not prime.

### Edge Cases
1. **Minimum Value of \( n \)**: When \( n = 1 \):
   - The program checks \( 1 \cdot m + 1 = m + 1 \). Since \( m \) is at least 1, \( m + 1 \) will always be greater than or equal to 2. For \( m = 1 \), it checks if \( 1 + 1 = 2 \) (which is prime). For \( m = 2 \), it checks \( 1 \cdot 2 + 1 = 3 \) (which is prime). However, eventually for \( m = 3 \), \( 1 \cdot 3 + 1 = 4 \), which is not prime. So it correctly finds \( m = 3 \) as a valid output.
   
2. **Maximum Value of \( n \)**: If \( n = 1000 \):
   - The program will check \( 1000 \cdot m + 1 \) for each \( m \) from 1 to 1000. The number \( 1000 \cdot 1 + 1 = 1001 \) is not prime (divisible by 7), so it will return \( m = 1 \).

### Output Hints Analysis
The output hints describe that `func_1` checks if a number is prime by verifying if it is less than 2 or divisible by any integer from 2 to its square root. This agrees with the program's logic.

### Conclusion
- The program correctly identifies a valid \( m \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number for any \( n \) within the specified range.
- All edge cases considered (including \( n = 1 \) and various values of \( n \)) yield valid outputs per the problem description.

Correctness: **True**.
