Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n`, which is guaranteed to be within the range of 1 to 1000.

2. **Looping through `m`**: The program runs a loop for `m` from 1 to 1000. This satisfies the requirement of finding any suitable `m` such that the expression `n * m + 1` is not prime.

3. **Prime Checking Function (func_1)**: The function `func_1` checks if a number is prime:
   - If `num < 2`, it returns `False`, which is a correct behavior because prime numbers are defined as greater than 1.
   - If `num` is greater than or equal to 2, it checks divisibility from 2 up to the square root of `num`. If it finds any divisor, it returns `False`, indicating that `num` is not prime; otherwise, it returns `True`.

4. **Logic Flow**: Within the loop, the program checks if `n * m + 1` is not a prime number using `func_1`. If it finds such an `m`, it prints `m` and breaks out of the loop.

5. **Guaranteed Outputs**: The problem guarantees that there exists at least one `m` within the range of 1 to 1000 such that `n * m + 1` is not prime. The program will successfully find and print this `m` due to the comprehensiveness of its checking.

Overall, since the function systematically checks for a non-prime result for the expression and correctly identifies an `m` that satisfies the problem's conditions, it meets the requirements set forth in the problem description.
