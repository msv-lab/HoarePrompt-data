According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `num`. The loop starts at 2 and goes up to `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`. For the loop to execute, `int(num ** 0.5)` must be at least 2, which implies that `num` must be at least 4 (since `sqrt(4) = 2`).

Given that `num` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `num` ≤ 1000 and `num` is greater than or equal to 2, the minimum value of `num` that allows the loop to execute is 4. 

At the start of the loop:
- `i` should be initialized to 2, which is the starting point of the range.

Thus, the necessary conditions to ensure the loop will execute include:
1. `num` must be at least 4.
2. `i` is initialized to 2.

State: **`num` is a positive integer such that 4 ≤ `num` ≤ 1000, `i` is 2**
