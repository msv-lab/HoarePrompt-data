To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let’s analyze the given code step by step.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to find a counterexample for the hypothesis that "for each positive integer m, the number n·m + 1 is a prime number" given a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000). The program needs to output an integer m such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, and n·m + 1 is not a prime number.

### Provided Program Analysis:
```python
n = int(input())
for m in range(1, 1001):
    if not func_1(n * m + 1):
        print(m)
        break

def func_1(num):
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

### Functionality of the Code:
1. The code takes an integer input `n`.
2. It loops over integers `m` from 1 to 1000.
3. For each `m`, it computes `n * m + 1`.
4. It uses the function `func_1` to check if `n * m + 1` is not a prime number:
   - `func_1` returns `False` if the number is less than 2 or if it's divisible by any integer from 2 to the square root of the number, indicating it’s not prime.
5. If `func_1` returns `False`, it prints `m` and exits the loop.

### Potential Issues:
1. The loop checks for `m` values from 1 to 1000, which is correct according to the problem statement. However, we need to ensure that for each `n`, there exists an `m` such that `n * m + 1` is not a prime number.
2. The function `func_1` seems to be correctly implemented for prime checking.

### Example Cases:
- For `n = 1`: `1 * 1 + 1 = 2` (prime), `1 * 2 + 1 = 3` (prime), ..., `1 * 999 + 1 = 1000` (not prime). It will eventually find a counterexample.
- For `n = 2`: `2 * 1 + 1 = 3` (prime), `2 * 2 + 1 = 5` (prime), ..., `2 * 4 + 1 = 9` (not prime). It will also find a counterexample.
- For `n = 3`: `3 * 1 + 1 = 4` (not prime). This will output `1`.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` correctly identifies non-prime numbers, and the loop will eventually find an `m` such that `n * m + 1` is not prime, satisfying the requirements of the problem description. 

Since I cannot find any specific case where the program fails to provide an output as per the problem requirements, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**.
