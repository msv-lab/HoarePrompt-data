To determine the correctness of the given program according to the problem description, we need to analyze the logic and potential edge cases in the code.

The problem requires us to maximize the expected number of caught fishes when placing `k` fishes in a `n × m` pond with a scoop of size `r × r`. The expected value should be calculated based on how many fishes are caught on average when the scoop is randomly placed in the pond.

### Analysis of the Program
```python
def func():
    (n, m, r, k) = map(int, input().split())
    ans = min(k, (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1))
    print(ans / ((n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)))
```
1. **Input Reading**: The program reads four integers: `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k`.
2. **Finding the Number of Possible Scoop Positions**: The expression `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)` computes how many positions the scoop can be placed in. 
3. **Calculating the Maximum Expected Caught Fishes**: 
   - The program uses `ans = min(k, (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1))` which means it calculates the maximum number of fishes that can be caught, limited by the number of fishes available (`k`) and the total number of positions the scoop can take.
   - The expected value is then calculated as `ans / ((n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1))`.

### Potential Cases to Consider
- **Case with Zero Fishes (k = 0)**: If `k` is zero, there are no fishes to catch. The expected value should be `0.0` since no fishes can be caught regardless of the scoop's position. Currently, the program will output `0.0` as expected.
- **Case with Maximum Fishes (k = n * m)**: If `k` is equal to or exceeds the total number of cells in the pond, the expected value should be `1.0` since all positions of the scoop will always catch fishes assuming the scoop is positioned correctly. The program correctly computes this as it limits `ans` to the number of valid positions.
- **Edge Cases for r**: 
   - If `r` is equal to `n` or `m`, only one position for the scoop is available. The program would still compute this correctly.
   - If `n` or `m` is quite small compared to `r`, it should also be handled correctly.

### Conclusion
The program appears to correctly handle the expected number of caught fishes under various scenarios based on the logic provided. I did not find any cases where the program fails to adhere to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**.
