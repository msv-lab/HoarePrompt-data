According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration. Therefore, `x` will be 2, and for the loop to continue executing, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `x` is 2, `m` is the original integer value, `r` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `heap` contains `2m` elements: (-coverage(0, 0), 0, 0), ..., (-coverage(0, m-1), 0, m-1), (-coverage(1, 0), 1, 0), ..., (-coverage(1, m-1), 1, m-1)**
