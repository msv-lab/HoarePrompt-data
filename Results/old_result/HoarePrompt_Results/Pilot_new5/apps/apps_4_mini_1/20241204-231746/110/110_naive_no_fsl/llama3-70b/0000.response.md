Correctness: **False**

The program does not accurately calculate the expected number of caught fishes based on the problem description. The expected value should take into account the positions of the fishes relative to the possible positions of the scoop-net. 

For example, consider a case where:
```
Input: 
1 1 1 1
```
In this case, there is only one cell in the pond and one fish can be placed in it. The scoop-net also covers this single cell. Thus, the expected number of caught fishes should be `1.0`. 

However, the program will output:
```
ans = min(1, (1 - 1 + 1) * (1 - 1 + 1)) = min(1, 1) = 1
print(ans / ((1 - 1 + 1) * (1 - 1 + 1))) = 1 / 1 = 1.0
```
This case appears correct, but for a larger pond, the logic fails.

Consider:
```
Input: 
3 3 2 5
```
Here, we can place 5 fishes, but the scoop-net can cover at most 4 positions (each covering 4 cells). The expected number of caught fishes should be calculated by distributing the fishes in such a way that maximizes the probability of being caught by the net.

This program does not account for the distribution of fishes across the cells and merely divides the number of fishes by the total possible scoop-net positions, which isn't correct for maximizing expected catches.

Therefore, due to this fundamental flaw in the logic concerning fish placement and scoop-net positions, the program does not fulfill the requirements given in the problem description.
