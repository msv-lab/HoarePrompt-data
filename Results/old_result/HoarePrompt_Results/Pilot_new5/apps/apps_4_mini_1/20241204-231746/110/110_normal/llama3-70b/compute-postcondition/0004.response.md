Functionality: ** The function accepts four integers `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k` based on user input and calculates the minimum of `k` and the area defined by `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`. It then returns the ratio of this minimum value to the area `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`. The function does not handle potential division by zero if `n - r + 1` or `m - r + 1` is zero. **
