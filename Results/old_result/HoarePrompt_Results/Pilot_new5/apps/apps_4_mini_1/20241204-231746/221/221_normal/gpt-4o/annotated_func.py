#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ s ≤ 10^12, and x is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ x ≤ 10^12.
def func():
    a = b ^ x
    b = a ^ x
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters and appears to perform bitwise XOR operations using a variable `x`. However, it lacks a return statement, meaning it does not return any value. Additionally, the variables `a` and `b` are defined within the function, but their initial values are not provided, leading to potential edge cases where the function may not behave as intended if `b` is not initialized before being used. Thus, this function does not have a clear and defined output based on the provided annotations.
