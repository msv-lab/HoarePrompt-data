The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads two integers from input: `s`, which is a positive integer constrained between 2 and \(10^{12}\), and `x`, which is a non-negative integer constrained between 0 and \(10^{12}\). 

The function calculates the number of pairs `(a, b)` such that `a + b = s` and `a XOR b = x`, where `a` ranges from 1 to `s - 1` and `b` is defined as `b = s - a`. The result, which is the count of such pairs, is printed as output.

However, the function does not return any value; it only prints the result. The functionality of the function is as follows: 

Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters, reads two integers from input, and counts the number of pairs `(a, b)` such that `a + b = s` and `a XOR b = x`, then prints this count. **
