The variable `c` is incremented by the value of `a[i]`. The value of `i` has been incremented by 1 in previous statements, and `i` must still be less than `n` as per the initial condition. The states of the other variables are not affected directly by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order satisfying -100 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100, `b` is updated to the previous value of `b` based on the parity of `i`, `c` is updated to `c + a[i]`, `i` is now `i + 1`.**
