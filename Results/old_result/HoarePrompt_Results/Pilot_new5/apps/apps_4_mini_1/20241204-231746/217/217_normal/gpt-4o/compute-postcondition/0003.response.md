The variable `C` is assigned the value of the sum of all negative integers in the list `a`. The initial state specifies that `a` is a list of integers that can range from -100 to 100, and `B` is the sum of positive integers in `a`. The values of `n` and `B` are not affected by the code, and since `C` is determined by the specific contents of `a`, we note that `C` will be the sum of the negative integers found in `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies -100 ≤ a_i ≤ 100; `B` is the sum of positive integers in `a`; `C` is the sum of negative integers in `a`.**
