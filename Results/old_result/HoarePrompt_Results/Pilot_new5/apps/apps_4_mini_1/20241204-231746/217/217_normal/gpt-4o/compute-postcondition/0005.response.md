The code simply prints the value of `result`, which is already calculated as the difference between the sum of positive integers (`B`) and the sum of negative integers (`C`) from the list `a`. The values of `n`, `a`, `B`, and `C` remain unchanged after this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies -100 ≤ a_i ≤ 100; `B` is the sum of positive integers in `a`; `C` is the sum of negative integers in `a`; `result` is equal to `B - C` which is printed.**
