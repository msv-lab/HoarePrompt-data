Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `i + 2`, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order with -100 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100. If `i` is even, `b` is updated to `b + a[i]`, while `c` is updated accordingly based on the new `i`, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `i` is odd, `b` can be updated or set to 0 depending on the parity of the new `i`, `c` is updated to `c + a[i]`, and `i` is incremented by 1.***
