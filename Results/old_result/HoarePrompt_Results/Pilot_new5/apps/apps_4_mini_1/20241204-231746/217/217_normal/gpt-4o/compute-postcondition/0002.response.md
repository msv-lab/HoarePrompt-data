The variable `B` is assigned the value of the sum of all elements in the list `a` that are greater than zero. The value of `n` indicates the length of the list `a`, which consists of integers constrained between -100 and 100. While the specific values of the integers in `a` are not provided, `B` will be a non-negative integer reflecting the sum of the positive integers in the list. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies -100 ≤ a_i ≤ 100; `B` is the sum of positive integers in `a`.**
