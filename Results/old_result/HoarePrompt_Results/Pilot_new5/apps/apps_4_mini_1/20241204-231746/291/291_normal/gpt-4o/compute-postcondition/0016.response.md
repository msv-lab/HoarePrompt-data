Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and calculates the minimum number of segments needed, using the formula `min_segments_needed = min(2 * (a + (n + a - 1) // a))` for all integer values of `a` from 1 to the integer square root of `n`. It returns this minimum value, which represents the least number of segments necessary based on the parameters derived from `n`. **
