Correctness: **False**.

The program is intended to compute the minimum number of segments Sofia needs to draw using a ruler to create `n` squares. However, the issue arises with the way the segments are calculated based on the dimensions of the squares.

For instance, letâ€™s analyze the minimum segments needed for `n = 3`. According to the problem description, when Sofia tries to draw three squares (arranged in a way that doesn't overlap), she will actually need 4 segments (two horizontal and two vertical). However, the function calculates the minimum segments needed based on the formula used in the loop, which may not produce the correct count for certain configurations of squares.

Specifically, the calculation `segments_needed = 2 * (a + b)` may lead to undercounting the required segments based on how squares can be arranged. For `n = 3`, the segments needed should be 4 (for the structure of squares), but the function may yield a lower count based on its implementation with divisions. 

Thus, because there are cases like `n = 3` where the output does not match the expected behavior described in the problem statement, the program is deemed incorrect.
