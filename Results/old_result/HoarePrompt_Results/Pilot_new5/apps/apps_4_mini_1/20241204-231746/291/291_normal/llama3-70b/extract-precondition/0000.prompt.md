You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: Little Sofia is in fourth grade. Today in the geometry lesson she learned about segments and squares. On the way home, she decided to draw $n$ squares in the snow with a side length of $1$. For simplicity, we assume that Sofia lives on a plane and can draw only segments of length $1$, parallel to the coordinate axes, with vertices at integer points.

In order to draw a segment, Sofia proceeds as follows. If she wants to draw a vertical segment with the coordinates of the ends $(x, y)$ and $(x, y+1)$. Then Sofia looks if there is already a drawn segment with the coordinates of the ends $(x', y)$ and $(x', y+1)$ for some $x'$. If such a segment exists, then Sofia quickly draws a new segment, using the old one as a guideline. If there is no such segment, then Sofia has to take a ruler and measure a new segment for a long time. Same thing happens when Sofia wants to draw a horizontal segment, but only now she checks for the existence of a segment with the same coordinates $x$, $x+1$ and the differing coordinate $y$.

For example, if Sofia needs to draw one square, she will have to draw two segments using a ruler:  [Image] 

After that, she can draw the remaining two segments, using the first two as a guide:  [Image] 

If Sofia needs to draw two squares, she will have to draw three segments using a ruler:  [Image] 

After that, she can draw the remaining four segments, using the first three as a guide:  [Image] 

Sofia is in a hurry, so she wants to minimize the number of segments that she will have to draw with a ruler without a guide. Help her find this minimum number.


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^{9}$), the number of squares that Sofia wants to draw.


-----Output-----

Print single integer, the minimum number of segments that Sofia will have to draw with a ruler without a guide in order to draw $n$ squares in the manner described above.
