To determine the correctness of the program against the provided problem description, we need to analyze its logic and ensure that it aligns with the requirements stated in the problem.

### Problem Breakdown
Sofia needs to draw `n` squares, which consist of 4 segments each. The goal is to minimize the number of segments drawn without the use of a guide, based on whether segments can serve as guides for others based on their orientation (horizontal or vertical).

1. Each square requires 4 segments.
2. If squares are drawn adjacent to each other, some segments can serve as guides, reducing the effort required to draw new segments.

### Given Program Analysis
The program defines a function `func_1(n)`, which computes the minimum number of segments needed to draw the squares.

- It iterates through possible segment counts `a` (representing the number of vertical segments) from 1 to the integer square root of `n`.
- For each `a`, it computes `b`, which is the number of horizontal segments required based on the number of squares.
- The formula used to compute `segments_needed` is `2 * (a + b)`, which accounts for both vertical and horizontal segments.
- The minimum of these computed segment counts is returned.

### Logic Verification
1. The formula correctly represents the relationship of segments needed in a grid-like arrangement since:
   - For each count of vertical segments `a`, you derive the corresponding horizontal segments `b`.
   - The expression `2 * (a + b)` correctly accounts for the segments needing to be drawn with a ruler when squares are positioned optimally.

2. Finding the minimum across `a` up to `sqrt(n)` is logical because:
   - Generally, as you increase the number of vertical segments (increasing `a`), the horizontal segments needed will decrease, and you want to find the combination that minimizes the total segments.

### Edge Cases
- For `n = 1`, the output is `2` (two segments are needed), which matches the requirement.
- For `n = 2`, the output is `3`, consistent with the description.
- For `n = 4`, the output is `4`, reflecting that squares can be drawn with fewer segments based on guides.

### Conclusion
The program correctly computes the minimum number of segments without a guide based on the given problem constraints and optimally uses the guiding segments through its logic. 

Thus, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
