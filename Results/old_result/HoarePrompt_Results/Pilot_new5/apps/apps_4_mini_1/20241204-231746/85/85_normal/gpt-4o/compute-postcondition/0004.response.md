The value of `n` will be updated by integer division with 10. Given that `n` must be 9 or any number such that (n + 1) is a multiple of 10, the possible values of `n` could be 9, 19, 29, etc. After executing the operation `n //= 10`, the new value of `n` will be 0 for `n = 9`, 1 for `n = 19`, 2 for `n = 29`, and so forth.

The other variable, `max_9s`, remains unchanged. Thus, the output state must reflect the new value of `n` based on the possible starting values.

Output State: **`n` is 0, 1, 2, or greater based on the integer division of `(n // 10)`; `max_9s` is 1.**
