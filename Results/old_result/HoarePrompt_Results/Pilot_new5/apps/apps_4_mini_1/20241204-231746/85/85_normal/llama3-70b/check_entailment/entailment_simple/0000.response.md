Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly address the problem description for all potential cases. 

Here are the issues with the provided program:

1. **Logic Error in Pair Calculation**: The program checks if the sum of the costs of two shovels, `i` and `n - i`, ends with a certain number of nines by evaluating the condition `(i + (n - i)) % 10 ** (len(str(i + (n - i))) - 1) == 0`. This condition does not accurately determine if the sum ends in a maximum number of nines. The condition is not correctly designed to check for the maximum number of nines at the end, which is required by the problem statement.

2. **Only Considering Half of the Pairs**: The loop iterates from `1` to `n // 2`, which means it only considers half of the possible pairs (i.e., it does not check both `i` and `n - i` adequately). Each pair should be a combination of two distinct shovel costs, and the program does not account for all distinct pairs when `n` is greater than 2.

3. **Output Incorrectness**: The program simply counts the occurrences that meet the flawed condition without correctly determining the pairs that yield the maximum number of nines. 

4. **Lack of Edge Cases Handling**: The provided logic does not correctly handle cases where the maximum number of nines is zero, as required by the problem statement.

Due to these logical flaws, the program fails to solve the problem as described, resulting in an output that may not align with the expected results given the input values.
