The value of `max_9s` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `max_9s` was 0, so now `max_9s` is 1. The value of `n` remains unchanged and continues to meet its condition of being 9 or any number such that (n + 1) is a multiple of 10. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be 9 or any number such that (n + 1) is a multiple of 10; `max_9s` is now 1.

Output State: **`n` must be 9 or any number such that (n + 1) is a multiple of 10; `max_9s` is 1**
