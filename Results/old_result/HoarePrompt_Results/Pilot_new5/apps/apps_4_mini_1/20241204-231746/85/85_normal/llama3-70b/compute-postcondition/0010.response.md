The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables (`n` and `i`) remain unchanged, but `ans` will now reflect a value that is one greater than its previous value. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `i` is the incremented value of `i` (i + 1) and must be less than or equal to `n // 2`, and `ans` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `i` is the incremented value of `i` (i + 1) and must be less than or equal to `n // 2`, `ans` is increased by 1.**
