The function accepts two integers, `n` (a positive integer representing the number of skewers) and `k` (a non-negative integer representing the number of skewers turned on each side during one action). It calculates the minimum number of actions required to handle `n` skewers based on `k` and prints this number. Additionally, it prints a list of positions that represent the first skewer turned on in each action, following an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of `(k * 2 + 1)`. The function does not return any value but prints the results directly.
