The value of `i` is incremented by `2 * k + 1`. Given that `k` is a non-negative integer within the range of `0 <= k <= 1000`, the new value of `i` becomes `i + (2 * k + 1)`, which can be expressed as `2 + 2*k + (2*k + 1)`. Therefore, `i` becomes `4 + 4*k`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `2*k + 2`, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= 1000, `positions` is a list containing the values 1 and `2 + 2*k`, `i` is equal to `4 + 4*k`.**
