The variable `i` is assigned the value `1`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `k`, and `positions`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= 1000, `positions` is an empty list, and `i` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= 1000, `positions` is an empty list, `i` is 1**.
