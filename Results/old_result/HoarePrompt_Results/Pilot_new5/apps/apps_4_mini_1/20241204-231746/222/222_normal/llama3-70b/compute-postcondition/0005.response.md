According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `l`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `l`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `l` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 1. Therefore, `l` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `k` is a non-negative integer (0 <= k <= 1000), `l` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `res` includes the value 1.**
