To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the logic implemented in the code.

The aim of the program is to minimize the number of actions needed to turn over all skewers. According to the problem statement, turning a skewer will affect `k` skewers on either side, resulting in a total of `2k + 1` skewers being turned over with one action. 

### Breakdown of the Program:

1. The program reads the input values `n` (number of skewers) and `k` (number of skewers affected on each side).
2. It calculates the minimum number of actions required using the formula:
   - `l = (n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)`
   This formula gives the necessary number of actions by dividing the total skewers `n` by the number of skewers affected in one action, which is `2k + 1`.
3. It then generates a list of skewer indices to be turned over:
   - `res.append(i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1)` which calculates the index of the skewer to turn in each action.

### Examining Edge Cases:

Let's consider the edge case when `n` is small, particularly `n = 1` and `k = 0`.

- **Test Case Input**: `1 0`
  
  Here, we have:
  - `n = 1`: There's only one skewer.
  - `k = 0`: Turning a skewer only affects itself.

According to the logic of the program:
- The calculation for `l` would be:
  - `l = (1 + 0 - 1) // (0 * 2 + 1) = 0 // 1 = 0`
  
This would imply that no actions are needed, which is incorrect because the single skewer does need to be turned over.

### Conclusion: 

The program fails to account for the scenario where `n` is `1` and `k` is `0`, leading to an incorrect output of `0` actions when at least `1` action is required.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem statement in every potential case.

Correctness: **False**
