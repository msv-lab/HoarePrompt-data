The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer with a constraint that it must be between 1 and 1000, inclusive. The parameter `k` is a non-negative integer which must be between 0 and 1000, inclusive. The function's output is determined by specific cases, although the case descriptions were not provided in the prompt. 

Since all cases must be evaluated, here's how the functionality can be summarized based on the constraints of the input parameters:

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` (a positive integer between 1 and 1000) and `k` (a non-negative integer between 0 and 1000), and returns results based on the evaluation of these parameters.**
