Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input as specified. It utilizes `input()` to read two integers `n` and `b_x`, followed by reading the digits of `X` and similar for `Y`. The format is adhered to, ensuring that both numbers are taken into account along with their bases.

2. **Conversion Function**: The function `func_1(digits, base)` takes a list of digits and converts it from the specified base to its integer equivalent. The logic for conversion is implemented correctly, where it initializes `result` to 0 and iteratively multiplies the current `result` by the base before adding the current digit. This follows the mathematical principle of base conversion.

3. **Comparison Logic**: After converting both numbers `X` and `Y` to their integer forms, the program correctly uses conditional statements to compare them and prints the appropriate output (`<`, `>`, or `=`) based on the comparison.

4. **Correctness of Base Constraints**: The program assumes that the digits provided are valid for the respective bases. Given the constraints specified in the problem description, it is indicated that all digits are guaranteed to be valid (i.e., they are less than the base), and hence the function doesn't need to handle invalid inputs.

5. **Output Format**: The program outputs exactly one of the characters `<`, `>`, or `=` as required by the problem statement, and does so in the correct format.

In summary, the program adheres to the problem description by accurately converting the numbers from their respective bases to decimal, performing the comparison, and producing the required output. Since all aspects of the problem are covered and handled correctly, the program is deemed correct.
