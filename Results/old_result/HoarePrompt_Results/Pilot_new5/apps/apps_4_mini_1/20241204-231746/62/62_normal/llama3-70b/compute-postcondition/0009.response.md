The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `digits` and `base`. The parameter `digits` is a list of integers that represent the digits of a number, with the constraint that each digit is a non-negative integer less than `base`. The parameter `base` is an integer that represents the base in which the number is expressed, with the constraint that it must be between 2 and 40. After executing the function body, it returns the integer represented by the list of digits in the specified base. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `digits` and an integer `base`, and return the integer corresponding to the number represented by `digits` in the given base.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `digits` and an integer `base`, and returns the integer represented by the list of digits in the specified base.**
