According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. For the loop to execute at least once, `digits` must contain at least one element, as the for loop iterates over each element in the `digits`. The other variables, `base` and `decimal_value`, do not impact the execution of the loop itself but provide context for the state. Hence, the states that need to be adjusted are `digits` must have at least 1 element, and `digit` should be the first element in the `digits` list.

State: **`digits` must have at least 1 element, `base` is an integer between 2 and 40, `decimal_value` is 0, `digit` is the first element in the `digits` list**
