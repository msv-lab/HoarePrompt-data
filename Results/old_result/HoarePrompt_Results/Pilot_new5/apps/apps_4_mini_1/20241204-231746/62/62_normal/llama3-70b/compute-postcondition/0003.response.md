According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. If the list has at least 2 digits, the loop executes again for the second digit. At the end of the last iteration, `digits` contains at least 1 digit, and `digit` is the first digit in the list. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, the `digits` list must have at least 2 digits, and the `digit` must be the second digit in the list. 

State: **`digits` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 digits, `digit` is the second digit in the list, `base` is an integer, `result` is equal to `digit`.**
