`count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` could be either 5 or greater than 5, so after the increment, `count` is either 6 or greater than 6. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`num` is greater than or equal to (i squared plus 2 times i plus 1), `count` is either 6 or greater than 6, and `i` has been incremented by 1.**
