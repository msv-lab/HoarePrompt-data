According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the upper limit determined by `n`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to the integer square root of `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `i * i` equals `n`, which means that `i` is the integer square root of `n`. Since `i` remains unchanged if this condition is true, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will increment by 1 on the next iteration.

Thus, if `i` is incremented to `i + 1`, it would then be `i + 1` and would need to check if `i + 1` is still less than or equal to `int(n ** 0.5)`. 

Considering `n` as a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be such that `i + 1 <= int(n ** 0.5)`, which implies `n` must be at least `(i + 1) ** 2`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n` must be at least `(i + 1) ** 2` and `i` is unchanged**
