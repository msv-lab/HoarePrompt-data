The provided program aims to determine the number of different weights of splits for a given integer \( n \), as described in the problem statement. However, upon reviewing the code, it appears to be calculating the total number of divisors of \( n \) rather than the weights of its splits.

### Analysis of the Code:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    res = 0
    for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            res += 2
        if i * i == n:
            res -= 1
    print(res)
```

### Key Points:
1. **Purpose of the Function**: The purpose stated in the problem is to calculate the number of distinct weights of splits of \( n \). The function, however, calculates the number of divisors of \( n \).
  
2. **Mechanism of the Function**: 
   - It iterates from \( 1 \) to \( \sqrt{n} \) and counts how many times \( n \) can be divided by \( i \).
   - If \( n \) is divisible by \( i \), it increments the result \( res \) by \( 2 \) (for both \( i \) and \( n/i \)).
   - If \( i \) is exactly equal to the square root of \( n \), it decreases \( res \) by \( 1 \) to account for the double count of the square root.

3. **Output Hints**: The output hints state that the function prints the total number of divisors of \( n \), confirming that the function does not perform the task described in the problem.

### Edge Cases:
- The problem requires calculating weights of splits which are defined based on the sequences that sum up to \( n \) and their respective weights. The code does not account for any of these splits.
- For instance, for \( n = 8 \), the weights of splits should be considered, but the code only counts divisors.

### Conclusion:
The code does not follow the problem description and is fundamentally incorrect as it does not calculate the required output related to weights of splits. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
