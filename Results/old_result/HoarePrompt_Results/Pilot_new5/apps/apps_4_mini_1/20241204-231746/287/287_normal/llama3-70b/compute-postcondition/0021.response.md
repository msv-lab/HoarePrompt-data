The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. However, it operates based on an implicit understanding that `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 10^9. The function's behavior or output based on this integer is not specified in the provided output information. Therefore, without additional context on how the function utilizes `n`, we cannot define specific return values or cases.

Functionality: **The function accepts an implicit positive integer n (1 <= n <= 10^9) based on its constraints, but the specific return value of the function is not provided.**
