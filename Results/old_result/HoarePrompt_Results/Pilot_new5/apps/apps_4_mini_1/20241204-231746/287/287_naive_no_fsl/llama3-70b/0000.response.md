Correctness: **False**

The provided program is intended to calculate the number of different weights of splits of a given integer \( n \). However, the logic implemented does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description.

The logic in the program is based on counting the divisors of \( n \) rather than the different weights of its splits. The variable `res` counts the number of divisors of \( n \) by iterating from \( 1 \) to \( \sqrt{n} \), which is incorrect for this problem.

For instance, when \( n = 8 \):
- The expected output is **5**, representing the different weights of splits: 1 (for [8]), 2 (for [4, 4]), 3 (for [3, 3, 2]), 4 (for [2, 2, 2, 2]), and 7 (for [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]).
- However, the program will compute the number of divisors of 8, which is **4** (the divisors being 1, 2, 4, 8).

Another example with \( n = 9 \):
- The expected output is also **5** (weights 1, 2, 3, 4, and 9).
- The program would again return **3** as there are only three divisors of 9 (1, 3, 9).

The program fails to account for the actual logic needed to determine the weights of splits, leading to incorrect results. Thus, it does not satisfy the problem description for all potential cases.
