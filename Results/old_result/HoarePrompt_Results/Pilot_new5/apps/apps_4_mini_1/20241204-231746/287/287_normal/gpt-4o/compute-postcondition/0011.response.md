The variable `count` is incremented by 1. Since `count` can either be 2 or greater than 2, after the increment, `count` will be either 3 or greater than 3. The other variables, `num` and `i`, remain unchanged in terms of their conditions. Therefore, the Output State is: `num` must be greater than or equal to (i squared plus 2 times i plus 1), `count` is either 3 or greater than 3, `i` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`num` must be greater than or equal to (i squared plus 2 times i plus 1), `count` is either 3 or greater than 3, `i` is incremented by 1.**
