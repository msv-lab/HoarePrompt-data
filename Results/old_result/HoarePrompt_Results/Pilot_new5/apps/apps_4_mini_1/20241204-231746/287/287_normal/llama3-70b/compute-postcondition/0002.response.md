To determine the necessary states for the for loop to execute, we need to analyze the loop's condition and how it interacts with the given state.

1. The loop iterates over `i` in the range from 1 to `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`.
2. The key variable here is `n`, which is a positive integer (1 <= `n` <= 10^9). This means that `n` is guaranteed to be at least 1.
3. The loop will execute if `int(n ** 0.5)` is at least 1, which occurs if `n` is at least 1. Given that `n` is a positive integer, this is satisfied.
4. The variable `i` starts at 1 and will increment until it reaches `int(n ** 0.5)`, ensuring that `i` will take on values starting from 1 up to the integer value of the square root of `n`.

Given that `n` is guaranteed to be at least 1, `int(n ** 0.5)` will also be at least 1. Thus, the loop will execute at least once when `n` is 1.

### Conclusion
To ensure the loop executes, the state before the loop starts should note that:
- `n` is a positive integer,
- `res` is initialized to 0,
- `i` will start at 1 (the beginning of the range),
- `int(n ** 0.5)` needs to be at least 1, which is satisfied if `n >= 1`.

So the adjusted states are as follows:

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9, `res` is 0, `i` is 1**
