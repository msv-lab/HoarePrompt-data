The `print(res)` statement outputs the current value of `res` to the console. The value of `res` is determined by whether `n` is a perfect square or not, which affects its value based on the given conditions. However, the variables `n` and `k` are not changed by this line of code, and the initial conditions remain valid.

Output State: **`res` is the total number of divisors of `n`, which is `2 * k` if `n` is not a perfect square or `2 * k - 1` if `n` is a perfect square; `n` remains unchanged; `k` remains unchanged.**
