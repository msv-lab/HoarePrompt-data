The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The initial state specifies that `count` can be either 4 or greater than 4, so after the increment, `count` will either be 5 or greater than 5. The values of `num` and `i` remain unchanged, but we note that `i` was previously incremented by 1. 

Output State: **`num` is greater than or equal to (i squared plus 2 times i plus 1), `count` is either 5 or greater than 5, and `i` has been incremented by 1.**
