The value of `operations` is assigned the value `1`. The states of the other variables are not affected, so `n` remains an input integer, and `s` remains a string of length `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string of length `n`, and `operations` is `1`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is a string of length `n`, `operations` is 1**
