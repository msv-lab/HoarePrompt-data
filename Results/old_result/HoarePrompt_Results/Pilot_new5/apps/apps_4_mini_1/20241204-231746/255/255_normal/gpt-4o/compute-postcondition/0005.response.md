The value of `operations` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `operations` was 1, so after the increment, the new value will be 2. The other variables `n`, `s`, `i`, and the condition regarding `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `s` is a string of length `n`, `operations` is 2, `i` is 1, and the current character `s[i]` is not equal to the previous character `s[i - 1]`.**
