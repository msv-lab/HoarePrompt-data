The value of `s` is assigned the value of `input()`, which takes a user input string. The length of `s` will be equal to `n`, and it will consist only of lowercase Latin letters. The initial condition that `n` is an input integer within the range of 1 to 500 remains valid, and now we have the specific value of `s` based on the user's input. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 500; `s` is an input string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters.**
