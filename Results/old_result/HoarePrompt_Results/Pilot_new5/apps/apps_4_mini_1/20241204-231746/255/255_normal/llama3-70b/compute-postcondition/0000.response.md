The value of `n` is reassigned to the integer value obtained from user input through `input()`, which can be any integer between 1 and 500. The string `s` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 500; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 500; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters.**
