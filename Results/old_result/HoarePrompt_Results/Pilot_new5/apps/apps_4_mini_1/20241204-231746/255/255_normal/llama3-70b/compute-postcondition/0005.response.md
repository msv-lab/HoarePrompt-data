`ans` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `s` is an input string of length `n`, `ans` is 2, `i` is 1, and the character at index `i` of `s` is different from the character at index `i - 1` of `s`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `s` is an input string of length `n`, `ans` is 2, `i` is 1, and the character at index `i` of `s` is different from the character at index `i - 1` of `s.**
