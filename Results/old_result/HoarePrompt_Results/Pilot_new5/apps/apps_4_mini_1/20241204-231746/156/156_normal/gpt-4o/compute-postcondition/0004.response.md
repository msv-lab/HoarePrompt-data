`full_rows` is assigned the value of `k // (m - 1)`. The variable `k` has been modified to `k - (n - 1)`, and thus its new value is directly dependent on the original value of `k`, reduced by `n - 1`. Since `m` is within the bounds of 2 to 10^9, `m - 1` is guaranteed to be at least 1. The values of `n` and `m` are still valid as integers within their given ranges, and `k` retains its constraints but has been decremented. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9, and `n` is always even; `k` is now `k - (n - 1)`; `full_rows = (k - (n - 1)) // (m - 1)`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9, and `n` is always even; `k` is now `k - (n - 1)`; `full_rows = (k - (n - 1)) // (m - 1)`**.
