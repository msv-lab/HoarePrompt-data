Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer and `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^9. If `k` is less than `n - 1`, then `k` is incremented by 1, making `1 ≤ k < n`. Otherwise, `row` is equal to `n - full_rows` and `col` is equal to `2 + remaining_steps` if `full_rows` is even, or `col` is equal to `m - remaining_steps` if `full_rows` is odd.***
