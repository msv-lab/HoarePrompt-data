The function accepts integers `n` (even), `m`, and `k`, adjusts `k`, and prints specific coordinate-like values based on its adjusted value in relation to `n`. If `k` is less than `n - 1`, it prints `(k + 1, 1)`; if `k` is between `n - 1` and `n * 2 - 2`, it prints calculated values based on `k`; otherwise, it prints `(1, 2)`. The function does not return any values, only prints output.
