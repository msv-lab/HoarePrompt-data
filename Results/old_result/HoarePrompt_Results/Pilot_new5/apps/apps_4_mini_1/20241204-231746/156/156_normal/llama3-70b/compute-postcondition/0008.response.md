The code snippet provided does not change any of the variables `n`, `m`, or `k`. It simply prints the values `1` and `2`. Therefore, the existing conditions of the variables remain valid.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (even and 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), `m` is an input integer (2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9), `k` is now `k % (n * 2 - 2)`, `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, and `k` is greater than or equal to n * 2 - 2.**
