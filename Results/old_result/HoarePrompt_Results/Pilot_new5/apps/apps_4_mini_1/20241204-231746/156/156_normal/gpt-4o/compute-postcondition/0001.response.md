The code executes a print statement that outputs the value of `k + 1` and the value `1`. The value of `k` is given to be less than `n - 1`, and since `k` is a non-negative integer, `k + 1` will be a positive integer that is at least `1` and less than `n`. The other variables `n` and `m` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State includes the updated value of `k` as `k + 1` while retaining the constraints on `n` and `m`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and n is always even; `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9; `k` is now `k + 1`, which is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ k + 1 < n.**
