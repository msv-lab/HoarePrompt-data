According to the code, the loop continues to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `final_x` is equal to `x + (count_R - count_L)`, `final_y` is equal to `y + (count_U - count_D)`, and `i` is the current loop index. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. 

Thus, if `i` was the value used in the last iteration, then for the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `n` must be greater than `i + 1`. 

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `i` has been incremented by 1. 

State: **`final_x` is equal to `x + (count_R - count_L)`; `final_y` is equal to `y + (count_U - count_D)`; `target_pos` is equal to `(current_x + dx, current_y + dy)`; `position_map[current_x, current_y]` is now equal to `i`; `i` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `n`.**
