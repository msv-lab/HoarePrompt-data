The variable `ux` is incremented by 1. The initial state does not specify the previous value of `ux`, but since it is modified, we acknowledge that it changes. The conditions around `n`, `operations`, and `op` remain valid as none of them are affected by the increment operation on `ux`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `operations` is a string of length `n`, `op` is the first character of `operations`, `op` is not equal to 'U', `op` is not equal to 'D', `op` is 'R', `ux` is increased by 1.**
