The expression `min_length = min(min_length, i - position_map[target_pos])` calculates the minimum value between the current `min_length` and the result of `i - position_map[target_pos]`. The variable `min_length` is updated to this new minimum value. 

The values of the other variables, such as `final_x`, `final_y`, and `target_pos`, remain unchanged in this operation.

Output State: **`final_x` is equal to `x + (count_R - count_L)`; `final_y` is equal to `y + (count_U - count_D)`; `target_pos` is equal to `(current_x + dx, current_y + dy)`; the value of `target_pos` is present in `position_map`; `min_length` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `i - position_map[target_pos]`.**
