The code `dx -= 1` decrements the variable `dx` by 1. The values of `ux`, `uy`, `n`, and `ops` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State maintains the previous values of the unaffected variables while noting that `dx` has been decreased by 1.

Output State: **`ux` is the count of 'R' minus the count of 'L', `uy` is the count of 'U' minus the count of 'D', `n` is greater than 0, `ops` must have at least one element remaining, and `dx` is decreased by 1.**
