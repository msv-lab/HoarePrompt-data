Postcondition: ***`final_x` is equal to `x + (count_R - count_L)`; `final_y` is equal to `y + (count_U - count_D)`; `target_pos` is equal to `(current_x + dx, current_y + dy)`; `current_x` is increased by 1; `current_y`, `dx`, `dy`, `i` are updated to `i + 1`; `operations` and `min_length` are updated if `target_pos` is in `position_map`; `position_map[current_x, current_y]` is set to `i + 1`; and `n` is greater than `i + 1`.***
