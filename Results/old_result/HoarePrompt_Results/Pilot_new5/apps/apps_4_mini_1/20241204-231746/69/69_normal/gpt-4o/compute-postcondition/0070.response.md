The variable `current_x` is decremented by 1. The initial state indicates that `final_x`, `final_y`, and `target_pos` are determined by the values of other variables, but they are not directly affected by this operation. The variable `i` is still incremented, and its condition of being less than `n` remains valid, but its value is not affected in this operation. 

Thus, the output state reflects the change in `current_x` while retaining all other values:

Output State: **`final_x` is equal to `x + (count_R - count_L)`; `final_y` is equal to `y + (count_U - count_D)`; `target_pos` is equal to `(current_x - 1 + dx, current_y + dy)`; `position_map[current_x, current_y]` is now equal to `i`; `i` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `n`; `current_x` is decremented by 1.**
