Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 200000, `operations` is a string of length at least 2. If `op` is 'D', then `final_y` is decreased by 1. If `op` is 'L', then `final_x` is decreased by 1 while `final_y` remains unchanged. If `op` is 'R', then `final_x` is updated to `final_x + 1`, while `final_y` remains unchanged. The value of `index` is 2 in all cases.***
