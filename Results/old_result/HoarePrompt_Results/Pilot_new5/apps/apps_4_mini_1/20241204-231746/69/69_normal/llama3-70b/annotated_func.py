#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), operations is a string of length n consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R', and (x, y) are integers such that -10^9 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ops = input()
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    ux, uy, lx, ly = 0, 0, 0, 0
    for op in ops:
        if op == 'U':
            uy += 1
        elif op == 'D':

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `ux` is equal to the count of 'R' in `operations` minus the count of 'L' in `operations`, `uy` is equal to the count of 'U' in `operations` minus the count of 'D' in `operations`, `n` is a non-negative integer, and `operations` is a string of length `n`.
    dx, dy = x - ux, y - uy

        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `ux` is the count of 'R' minus the count of 'L', `uy` is the count of 'U' minus the count of 'D', `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `dx` is equal to `x - ux`, `dy` is equal to `y - uy`, `dx` is greater than or equal to 0, `dy` is greater than or equal to 0, and `res` is equal to the count of operations in `ops` that did not modify `dx` or `dy`. If `n` is 0, then `res` remains 0, `dx` is `x`, and `dy` is `y`.
        print(res)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`ux` is the count of 'R' minus the count of 'L', `uy` is the count of 'U' minus the count of 'D', and `n` is a non-negative integer representing the length of `operations`. If `dx < 0` or `dy < 0`, -1 has been printed. Otherwise, `dx` and `dy` are non-negative, and `res` is equal to the count of operations in `ops` that did not modify `dx` or `dy`, which is then printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a string `operations` consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R', and two integers `x` and `y`. It calculates the effective change in coordinates from the operations and determines the number of operations that did not contribute to reaching the target coordinates `(x, y)`. If the target coordinates are unreachable based on the operations, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the count of operations that did not alter the expected final position.
