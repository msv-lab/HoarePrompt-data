Postcondition: ***`ux` is the count of 'R' minus the count of 'L', `uy` is the count of 'U' minus the count of 'D', and `n` is a non-negative integer representing the length of `operations`. If `dx < 0` or `dy < 0`, -1 has been printed. Otherwise, `dx` and `dy` are non-negative, and `res` is equal to the count of operations in `ops` that did not modify `dx` or `dy`, which is then printed.***
