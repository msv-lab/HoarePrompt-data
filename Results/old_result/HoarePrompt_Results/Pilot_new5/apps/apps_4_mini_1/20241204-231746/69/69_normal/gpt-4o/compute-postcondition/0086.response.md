Postcondition: ***`final_x` is equal to `x + (count_R - count_L)`; `final_y` is equal to `y + (count_U - count_D)`; if the current operation is 'L', `current_x` is decreased by 1 and `target_pos` is updated to `(current_x - 1 + dx, current_y + dy)`; otherwise, `current_x` is increased by 1 and `target_pos` is updated to `(current_x + dx, current_y + dy)`. In both cases, `i` is incremented by 1, `operations` and `min_length` are updated if `target_pos` is in `position_map`, and `position_map[current_x, current_y]` is now equal to `i + 1`; `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.***
