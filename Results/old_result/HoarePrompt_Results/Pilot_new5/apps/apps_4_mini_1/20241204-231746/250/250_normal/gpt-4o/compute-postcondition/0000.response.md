The variables `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are assigned values from the input. The values for these variables will be set based on the user's input. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are now specific integers based on the input, while `a` and all other preconditions are still valid.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `l` is an integer input (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is an integer input (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is an integer input (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), and `a` is a list of n integers (0 = a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] = l)**
