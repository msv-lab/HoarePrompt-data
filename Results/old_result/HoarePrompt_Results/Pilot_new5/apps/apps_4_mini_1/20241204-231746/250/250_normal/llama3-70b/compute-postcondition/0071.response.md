The `additional_marks` list is updated by appending the value of `i + j`. Given that `i` and `j` are such that their sum is less than or equal to `l` and this sum is not present in the list `marks`, the new value of `additional_marks` will now contain at least one more element, specifically `i + j`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `need_x` is False, `need_y` is False, `additional_marks` contains at least 2 elements, `marks` is a list that must contain at least 1 element, `i` and `j` satisfy the condition that their sum is less than or equal to `l`, and this sum is not present in the list `marks`.**
