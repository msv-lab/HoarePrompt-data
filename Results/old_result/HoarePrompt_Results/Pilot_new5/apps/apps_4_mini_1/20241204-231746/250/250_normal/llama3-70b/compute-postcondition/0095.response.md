The `additional_marks` list is updated by appending the value `i + j`. Given that `i` is the second element of `marks` and `j` is a valid integer such that `i + j` meets the conditions provided, the output state will reflect this change. 

The other variables, such as `n`, `need_x`, `need_y`, `marks`, and the conditions regarding `i`, `j`, and `l`, remain unchanged as they are not affected by the operation of appending to `additional_marks`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `need_x` is False, `need_y` is False, `additional_marks` contains at least one element and now has an additional element `i + j`, `marks` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element of `marks`, there exists a valid `j` such that `i + j ≤ l`, and `j` is not in `marks`. The current value of `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and `i + j` is not in `marks`.**
