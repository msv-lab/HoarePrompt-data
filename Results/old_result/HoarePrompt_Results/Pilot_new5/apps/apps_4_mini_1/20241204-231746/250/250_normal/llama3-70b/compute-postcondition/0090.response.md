Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `need_x` is False, `need_y` is False, `additional_marks` contains at least 5 viable values, and `marks` is a list containing at least 1 element. If `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and `i + j` is not in `marks`, then `additional_marks` now contains at least 5 values and `j` is the next viable value in `additional_marks`.***
