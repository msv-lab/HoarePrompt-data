The value of `need_y` is assigned the value `True`. Since `need_y` was already `True`, its value remains unchanged. The other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `need_x` is True, and `need_y` is True.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `need_x` is True, and `need_y` is True.**
