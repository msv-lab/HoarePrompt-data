The code reads a line of space-separated integers from input, converts each of them into integers, and then stores them in a set called `marks`. This operation does not change the other variables (`n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, and `a`), but it does create a new variable `marks`.

Since `marks` is assigned the values from the input, it will contain distinct integers as per the provided input. The variable `marks` will thus be a set that includes integers between `0` and `l` based on the input values. 

The initial values of `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, and `a` remain unchanged after executing the code. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5); `l` is a positive integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9); `x` is a positive integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l); `y` is a positive integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l); `a` is a list of `n` integers (0 = a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] = l); `marks` is a set of integers from input.**
