The value of `need_y` is simply reassigned to `True`. Since `need_y` was already `True`, there is no change in its value. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, and `need_x` is True, and `need_y` remains True.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `need_x` is True, and `need_y` is True.**
