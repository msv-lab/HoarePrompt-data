The function `func` accepts the following parameters: 

1. `n`: a positive integer where \( 2 \leq n \leq 100000 \).
2. `l`: a positive integer where \( 2 \leq l \leq 10^9 \).
3. `x`: a positive integer where \( 1 \leq x < y \leq l \).
4. `y`: a positive integer where \( 1 \leq x < y \leq l \).
5. `a`: a list of `n` integers such that \( 0 = a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] = l \), representing the distances of the marks from the origin.

The function evaluates the input based on the conditions set for `x`, `y`, and the list `a`, and returns an output based on these evaluations. Specific output behavior is not detailed, but it is implied that the function processes the parameters to provide a relevant result.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (a positive integer), l (a positive integer), x (a positive integer), y (a positive integer), and a (a list of n integers), and processes these inputs to return a result based on their relationships and conditions.**
