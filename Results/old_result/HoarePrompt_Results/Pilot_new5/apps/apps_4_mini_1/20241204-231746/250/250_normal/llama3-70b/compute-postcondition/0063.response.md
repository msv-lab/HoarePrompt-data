The code `additional_marks.append(x)` adds the value of `x` to the list `additional_marks`. The initial state indicates that `additional_marks` is an empty list, so after the execution of this code, `additional_marks` will contain one element, which is `x`. The other variables `n`, `need_x`, and `need_y` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `need_x` is False, `need_y` is True if there exists at least one pair (i, j) such that `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `y`, `additional_marks` is a list containing the value `x`.**
