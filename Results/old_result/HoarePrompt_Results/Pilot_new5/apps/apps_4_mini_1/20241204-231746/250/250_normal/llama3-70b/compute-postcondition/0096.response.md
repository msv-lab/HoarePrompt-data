Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `need_x` is False, `need_y` is False, `additional_marks` contains at least one element and now includes `i + j`, `marks` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element of `marks`, and there exists a valid `j` such that `i + j ≤ l` and `j` is not in `marks`. Additionally, `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and not present in `marks`.***
