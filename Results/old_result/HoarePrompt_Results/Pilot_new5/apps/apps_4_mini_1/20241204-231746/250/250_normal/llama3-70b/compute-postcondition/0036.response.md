The variable `need_x` is assigned the value `True`, which is already its initial value, so it remains unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `need_x` is True, and `need_y` is True.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `need_x` is True, and `need_y` is True**.
