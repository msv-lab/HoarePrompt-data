The variable `marks` is assigned the value of a list created from the input, which consists of integers split by spaces and converted to integers. The previous state of the variables `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, and `a` remains unchanged, while the variable `marks` now contains a list of integers based on the input provided.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `l` is an integer input (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is an integer input (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is an integer input (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `a` is a list of n integers (0 = a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] = l), `marks` is a list of integers from input.**
