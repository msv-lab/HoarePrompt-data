The line `additional_marks = []` initializes the variable `additional_marks` as an empty list. The values of `n`, `need_x`, and `need_y` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged initial conditions and the new state of `additional_marks`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `need_x` is True if there exists at least one pair (i, j) such that `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `x`, `need_y` is True if there exists at least one pair (i, j) such that `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `y`; `additional_marks` is an empty list.**
