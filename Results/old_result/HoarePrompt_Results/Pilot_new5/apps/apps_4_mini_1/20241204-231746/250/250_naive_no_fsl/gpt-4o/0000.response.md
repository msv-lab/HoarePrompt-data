Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of additional marks required on the ruler to measure the distances `x` and `y`. Here are some potential issues:

1. **Inadequate Coverage of Cases**: The program checks for the presence of `x` and `y` by examining whether `mark ± x` or `mark ± y` exists within the initial marks. However, it does not adequately consider all combinations of distances that can be formed by the existing marks. For instance, it might miss cases where adding a mark at a calculated position could help achieve both `x` and `y` measurements.

2. **Missed Scenarios for Adding Marks**: The logic used to check whether `x` and `y` can be formed does not account for the possibility that both could be achieved with just one additional mark. For example, if the only marks are `0` and `250`, and we need to measure `185` and `230`, the program may not recognize that adding a single mark at `185` allows for measuring both `x` and `y`.

3. **Output Handling**: Even when it identifies that new marks are needed, it can only add one mark and does not properly handle scenarios where multiple marks need to be added.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input:
```
2 300 185 230
0 300
```
The desired output should indicate that we need to add two marks, specifically `185` and `230`. However, the program will incorrectly identify that it can only add one mark, resulting in an output that does not satisfy the requirements.

The flaws in logic and handling of the ranges indicate that the program doesn't consistently adhere to the requirements laid out in the problem statement across all potential cases. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for correctness.
