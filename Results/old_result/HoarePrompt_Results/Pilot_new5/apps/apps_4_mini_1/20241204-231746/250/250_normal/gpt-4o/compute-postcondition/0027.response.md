The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `a` are integers, `marks` is a list with at least 3 elements, `mark` is the third element in `marks`, `x_found` and `y_found` remain unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
