The variable `new_marks` is updated by adding the value of `mark + x` to it. The values of `mark` and `x` affect `new_marks`, while the values of `n`, `x_found`, and `y_found` remain unchanged. The specific value of `mark` is the third element in `marks`, and `x` is its current value. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated `new_marks` along with the unchanged conditions.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `mark` is the third element in `marks`, `x_found` is False, `y_found` is False, and `new_marks` now includes the value `mark + x`.**
