Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `mark` is the second element in `marks`, `x_found` is False, and `y_found` is False. If `mark + x + y`, `mark + x - y`, or `mark - x + y` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` is updated to include `mark + x`. Otherwise, if neither of those conditions are met but either `mark - x + y` or `mark - x - y` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` contains `mark - x`.***
