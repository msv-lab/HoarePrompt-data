According to the code, the loop iterates over the list `marks`. The loop will execute again for the next element in the `marks` list. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first element of `marks`. In order to execute one more time, `i` needs to be updated to the second element of `marks`.

Since `marks` contains at least 1 element, for the loop to execute again, `i` must point to the next element in the `marks` list. Therefore, `i` will be updated to the second element of the list.

State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `need_x` is False, `need_y` is False, `additional_marks` contains all viable values of `i + j` that are less than or equal to `l` and not present in `marks`, `marks` is a list containing at least 2 elements, and `i` is the second element of `marks`.**
