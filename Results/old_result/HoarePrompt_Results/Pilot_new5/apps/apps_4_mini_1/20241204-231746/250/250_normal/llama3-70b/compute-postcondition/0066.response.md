The `additional_marks` list is modified to include the value of `y`. The current value of `need_y` is `False`, and since the code doesn't change `need_y`, it remains `False`. The other variables, including `n`, remain unchanged. The Output State specifies that `additional_marks` now contains the value `y`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `need_x` is False, `need_y` is False, `additional_marks` now contains the value `y`.**
