The value of `need_y` is assigned to `True`. This means that the state of `need_y` has now been updated, while the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `i` is 0, if `marks[j] - marks[i]` is equal to `x`, then `need_x` is set to True, the current value of `marks[j] - marks[i]` is equal to `y`, and `need_y` is now True.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `i` is 0, if `marks[j] - marks[i]` is equal to `x`, then `need_x` is set to True, the current value of `marks[j] - marks[i]` is equal to `y`, and `need_y` is True.**
