Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `need_x` is False, `need_y` is False, `additional_marks` contains at least 2 elements, `marks` is a list that contains at least 1 element, if the sum of `i` and `j` is less than or equal to `l` and is not present in `marks`, then the conditions stated hold true. Otherwise, the execution does not change the state of the program.***
