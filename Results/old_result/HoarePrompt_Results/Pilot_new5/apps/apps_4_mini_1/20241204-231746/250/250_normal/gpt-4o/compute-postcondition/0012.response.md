Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `a` are integers, `marks` is a list with at least one element, `mark` is the first element in `marks`, if either `mark + y` or `mark - y` is found in `marks_set`, then `x_found` is set to True and `y_found` is set to True. The current state indicates that both `x_found` and `y_found` are True.***
