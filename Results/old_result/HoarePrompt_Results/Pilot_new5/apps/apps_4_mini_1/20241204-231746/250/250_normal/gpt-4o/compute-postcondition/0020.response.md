The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or conditional block we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `a` are integers, `marks` is a list with at least 2 elements, `mark` is the second element in `marks`, `x_found` is True, and `y_found` is True; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
