Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `mark` is the third element in `marks`, and `x_found` is False and `y_found` is False. If `mark + x + y`, `mark + x - y`, or `mark - x + y` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` includes `mark + x`. Otherwise, if `mark - x + y` or `mark - x - y` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` includes `mark - x`.***
