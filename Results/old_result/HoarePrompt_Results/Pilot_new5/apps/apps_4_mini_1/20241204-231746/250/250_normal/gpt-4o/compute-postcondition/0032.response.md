Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `a` are integers, `marks` is a list with `n` elements, `x_found` is False or `y_found` is False (at least one of them is false). If `x_found` is False, then there does not exist any `mark` in `marks` such that `mark + x` or `mark - x` is in `marks_set`. If `y_found` is False, then there does not exist any `mark` in `marks` such that `mark + y` or `mark - y` is in `marks_set`.***
