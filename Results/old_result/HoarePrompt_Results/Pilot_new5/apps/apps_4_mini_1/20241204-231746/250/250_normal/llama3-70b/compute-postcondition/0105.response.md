The code outputs the length of the `additional_marks` collection, but it does not modify any variables. The initial states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the relevant information is just the length of `additional_marks`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `need_x` is False, `need_y` is False, `additional_marks` contains all unique viable values of `i + j` that are less than or equal to `l` and not present in `marks`, `marks` is a list with at least 1 element, and the length of `additional_marks` has been printed.**
