`additional_marks` is updated by appending the value of `i + j`. The current state indicates that `i` is the first element of `marks`, and `j` is the second element of `additional_marks`. Since `additional_marks` originally contains at least 2 viable values, the new value appended will be the sum of the first element of `marks` and the second element of `additional_marks`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `need_x` is False, `need_y` is False, `additional_marks` now contains at least 3 viable values, `marks` is a list containing at least 1 element, `i` is the first element of `marks`, `j` is the second element of `additional_marks`, and the new value appended to `additional_marks` is `i + j`.**
