Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `need_x` is False, indicating that there does not exist at least one pair (i, j) such that `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `x`, `need_y` is True if there exists at least one pair (i, j) such that `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `y`, and `additional_marks` is an empty list.***
