The code snippet prints 'YES' but does not modify any variables. Therefore, the states of the other variables remain unchanged. Since the only action performed is a print statement, we state that 'YES' has been printed.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n` is at least 1234567; `a` is 0; `b` is 0; `c` is `n // 1234`; 'YES' has been printed.**
