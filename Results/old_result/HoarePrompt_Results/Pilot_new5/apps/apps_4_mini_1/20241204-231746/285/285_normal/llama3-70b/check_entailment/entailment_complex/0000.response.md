Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to determine whether a given integer `n` can be expressed as a non-negative linear combination of the numbers 1,234,567 (for houses), 123,456 (for cars), and 1,234 (for computers). 

Here’s a detailed explanation of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program takes a single integer input `n`, which is guaranteed to be within the constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), as specified in the problem description.

2. **Iterative Search**:
   - The outer loop iterates over possible values of `a`, which represents the number of houses. The loop runs from `0` to `n // 1234567`, ensuring that we consider all feasible quantities of houses that could potentially fit within `n`.
   - For each value of `a`, the inner loop iterates over possible values of `b`, which represents the number of cars. The number of cars is capped by the remaining balance after buying `a` houses, ensuring that the total spent does not exceed `n`.
   - Within the inner loop, the value of `c` (number of computers) is directly computed based on the remaining amount after accounting for the costs of houses and cars.

3. **Condition Check**: The key condition checks whether the total cost calculated (`a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234`) equals `n`. If it does, the program prints "YES" and exits.

4. **Exhaustive Search**: The nested loops systematically explore all combinations of non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c` such that their associated costs do not exceed `n`. The program will find a valid combination if it exists due to its exhaustive nature.

5. **Final Output**: If the loops complete without finding any valid combination, the program prints "NO", correctly signaling that `n` cannot be expressed as the specified linear combination.

The logic in the program aligns with the problem description, as it fulfills the requirement to check for the existence of non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c` such that their corresponding costs sum to `n`. Thus, the program meets the problem's specifications in all cases.
