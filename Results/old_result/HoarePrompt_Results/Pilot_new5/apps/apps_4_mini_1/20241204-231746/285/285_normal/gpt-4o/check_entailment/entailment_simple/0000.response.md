The program provided correctly implements the solution to the problem description. It aims to determine if it is possible to exactly spend `n` game-coins on a combination of houses, cars, and computers, with the respective costs of 1,234,567, 123,456, and 1,234 game-coins.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Loop through Houses**: The outer loop iterates over possible numbers of houses (`a`), from 0 up to the maximum number of houses that can be bought with `n` game-coins. This is calculated using `n // house_cost`, which ensures that the program does not try to buy more houses than what can be afforded.

2. **Remaining Coins After Houses**: For each number of houses, the program calculates the remaining game-coins after purchasing those houses. This is done by subtracting the total cost of the houses from `n`.

3. **Loop through Cars**: The inner loop iterates over possible numbers of cars (`b`) that can be bought with the remaining coins after buying houses. It uses a similar logic as with houses, ensuring it does not exceed the remaining budget.

4. **Check for Computers**: After determining how many houses and cars have been bought, the program checks if the remaining amount of game-coins can be evenly divided by the cost of a computer. This is done using the modulus operator. If the remaining coins after buying cars can be perfectly spent on computers (i.e., `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0`), the function returns 'YES'.

5. **Final Check**: If all possible combinations of houses and cars have been tested and none result in an exact expenditure of `n` game-coins, the function returns 'NO' to indicate that it is not possible to achieve the goal with the given coin scores.

The program addresses all scenarios as outlined in the problem description. Thus, it provides the correct output depending on whether a combination of houses, cars, and computers can exactly match `n`.

Correctness: **True**
