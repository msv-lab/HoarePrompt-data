To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the loop condition and the state variables provided.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for b in range((n - a * 1234567) // 123456 + 1):
```

1. **Understanding the Loop Range**:
   The range for `b` is computed as `(n - a * 1234567) // 123456 + 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, the result of this expression must be greater than 0.

2. **Analyzing the Variables**:
   - `n` is a positive integer at least 1234567.
   - `a` is 1.
   - `b` is the maximum value from the loop's range (this will be set by the loop itself, so it does not need to be initialized before it starts).
   - `c` is the last calculated value based on `b`, which will also be set during the loop.

3. **Calculating the Condition**:
   - Plugging in the value of `a` into the range condition gives us:
     \[
     (n - 1 * 1234567) // 123456 + 1 > 0
     \]
   - Simplifying, we need:
     \[
     (n - 1234567) // 123456 + 1 > 0
     \]
   - This means:
     \[
     (n - 1234567) // 123456 > -1
     \]
   - So, \( n - 1234567 \) must be at least 0, which implies \( n \) must be at least 1234567.

Since `n` is already stated to be at least 1234567, we have that part covered. 

4. **Final State Adjustments**:
   We also need to recognize that `b` will be initialized to the first value in the range, which is `0`. Thus, before the loop starts, `b` should be set to `0` as it is the first iteration value.

To summarize the required state adjustments:

State: **`n` is a positive integer at least 1234567, `a` is 1, `b` is 0 (the first value in the loop), `c` will be calculated based on `b`**
