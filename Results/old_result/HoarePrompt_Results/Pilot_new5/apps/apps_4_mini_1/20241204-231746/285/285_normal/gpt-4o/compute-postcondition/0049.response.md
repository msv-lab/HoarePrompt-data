Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^9 \); `house_cost` is \( 1234567 \); `a` is between \( 1 \) and \( n // house_cost \); `remaining_after_houses` is equal to \( n - a * 1234567 \); `remaining_after_houses` is greater than or equal to `car_cost`; `remaining_after_houses` must be greater than or equal to \( car_cost * (b + 1) \); `b` is currently equal to \( remaining_after_houses // car_cost \); if `remaining_after_cars` (equal to \( remaining_after_houses - (remaining_after_houses // car_cost) * car_cost \)) is divisible by `computer_cost`, the program returns 'YES', indicating that it is possible to purchase houses and cars under the given conditions with the available budget.***
