The code `exit()` terminates the execution of the program immediately. The values of the variables do not change, and since the program terminates, any further computation or output is halted. Therefore, the output state reflects the existing values of the variables before termination.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer at least 123456; `a` is 0; `b` is 2; `c` is equal to (n - 246912) // 1234; 'YES' is printed.**
