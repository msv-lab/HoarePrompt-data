`remaining_after_houses` is re-assigned the value of `n - a * house_cost`. The previous value of `remaining_after_houses` was `n - (a + 1) * house_cost`. Therefore, the new value of `remaining_after_houses` becomes `n - a * house_cost`, which is `remaining_after_houses + house_cost`. The states of the other variables remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `house_cost` is 1234567; `a` is between 0 and `n // house_cost`; `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n - a * house_cost`; `b` is between 0 and `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`; `car_cost` is a positive integer less than or equal to `remaining_after_houses`; `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost` and may or may not be divisible by `computer_cost`.**
