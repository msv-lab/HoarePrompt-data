According to the code, the loop executes for values of `a` from 0 up to `n // house_cost`. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is between 0 and `n // 1234567`, and the loop can continue to execute if there are still values of `a` left in the range.

Since the maximum value of `a` for the next iteration will be `a + 1`, we need to adjust the state accordingly. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must be less than `n // house_cost`, which means `a + 1` should be less than or equal to `n // house_cost`. Therefore, `a + 1` must be between 0 and `n // house_cost`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `house_cost` is 1234567; `a` is between 0 and `n // house_cost`, `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n - (a + 1) * 1234567` (which may result in a new value for remaining_after_houses), `b` is between 0 and `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`, `car_cost` is a positive integer less than or equal to `remaining_after_houses`; `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost` and may or may not be divisible by `computer_cost`.**
