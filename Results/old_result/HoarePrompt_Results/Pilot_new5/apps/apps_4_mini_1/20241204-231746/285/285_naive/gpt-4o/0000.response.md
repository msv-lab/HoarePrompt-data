Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine whether Kolya can spend all of his initial game-coins \( n \) on houses, cars, and computers. 

The approach taken is as follows:
1. It iterates through possible numbers of houses (represented by variable `a`), calculating the remaining coins after purchasing those houses.
2. For each possible number of houses, it then iterates through possible numbers of cars (represented by variable `b`), further calculating the remaining coins after buying those cars.
3. Finally, it checks if the remaining coins can be completely spent on computers by verifying if it is divisible by the computer cost.

This covers all combinations of purchases within the bounds of \( n \), ensuring that if there exists a valid combination of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) that satisfies the equation \( a \times 1,234,567 + b \times 123,456 + c \times 1,234 = n \), the program will find it and return "YES". If there are no such combinations, it will return "NO".

Given the constraints of \( n \) (1 ≤ \( n \) ≤ \( 10^9 \)), the nested loops will run in a reasonable time because there are limited numbers of houses and cars that can be bought with the given costs. 

Thus, all potential cases are handled correctly, confirming that the program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.
