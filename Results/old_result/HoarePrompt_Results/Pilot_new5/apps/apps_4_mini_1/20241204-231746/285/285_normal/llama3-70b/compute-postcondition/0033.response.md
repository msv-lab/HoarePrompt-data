The code snippet provided only contains a `print` statement which outputs "YES" and does not modify any variables. Therefore, the values of all the initial state variables remain unchanged. The output from the `print` statement does not affect the state of the variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer at least 1481479, `a` is 1, `b` is 2, `c` is equal to `(n - 1234567 - 246912) // 1234`, and "YES" is printed.**
