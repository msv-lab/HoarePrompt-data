The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. After executing the function body, the output is determined by several cases:

- Case_1: The function returns 'YES' indicating that the conditions for the house, car, and computer costs are satisfied as per the given initial state.
- Case_2: The function returns 'YES' indicating that the conditions for purchasing cars and computers are satisfied.
- Case_3: The function returns 'YES'.
- Case_4: The function returns 'YES' indicating that it is possible to purchase houses, cars, and computers within the defined constraints.
- Case_5: The function returns 'YES'.
- Case_6: The function returns 'YES'.
- Case_7: The function returns 'YES' indicating that the conditions set by the variables are met successfully.
- Case_8: The function returns 'YES' indicating that the conditions for purchasing houses and a car are met, with remaining funds after these purchases not being divisible by the computer cost.
- Case_9: The function returns 'YES' indicating that it is possible to purchase houses and cars under the given conditions with the available budget.
- Case_10: The function returns 'NO' indicating that no combination of houses and cars satisfies the condition for remaining_after_cars to be divisible by computer_cost.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and determine various purchasing conditions related to houses, cars, and computers based on this input, returning multiple possible 'YES' or a 'NO' based on the fulfillment of these conditions.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns 'YES' or 'NO' based on the satisfaction of various purchasing conditions for houses, cars, and computers.**
