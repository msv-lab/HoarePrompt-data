The code `exit()` does not change any of the variable values but terminates the program. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The output state will reflect that the program is exiting without modifying any variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer at least 123456; `a` is 0; `b` is 1; `c` is (n - 123456) // 1234; program exits without modifying any variables.**
