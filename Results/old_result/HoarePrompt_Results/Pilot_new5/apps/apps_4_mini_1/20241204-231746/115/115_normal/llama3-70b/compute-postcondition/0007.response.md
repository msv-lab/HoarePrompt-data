Postcondition: ***`n` is 2 or greater, `m` is between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and `ops` is an empty list. If the values at `A[0][0]`, `A[1][0]`, `A[0][1]`, and `A[1][1]` are all 1, the relevant conditions are satisfied. Otherwise, the conditions do not hold true.***
