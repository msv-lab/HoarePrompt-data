Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers containing exactly `n` rows and `m` columns where each element is either 0 or 1. If `A[i][1] == 1`, `A[i][2] == 1`, `A[i + 1][1] == 1`, and `A[i + 1][2] == 1`, then `operations` now contains an additional tuple (i + 1, 2), and `B` is a 2D list where `B[i][1] = 1`, `B[i][2] = 1`, `B[i + 1][1] = 1`, and `B[i + 1][2] = 1`.***
