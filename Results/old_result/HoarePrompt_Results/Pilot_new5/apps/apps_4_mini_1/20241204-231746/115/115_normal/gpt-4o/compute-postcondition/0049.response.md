According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. Since `m` is stated to be at least 2, the loop will execute at least twice. Before the loop starts, `i` is 0, and since `j` is not yet defined prior to the loop, it will initialize at 0 for the first iteration. 

To ensure the loop executes correctly, we need to state that `j` starts at 0 for the first iteration and will increment with each subsequent iteration. The condition that `m` is at least 2 is sufficient to guarantee that the loop will execute.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 0**
