The code appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the `operations` list. The values of `i` and `j` are not specified, but `j` is explicitly stated to be `0`. Thus the tuple will be `(i + 1, 1)`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers containing exactly `n` rows and `m` columns, where each element is either 0 or 1, `operations` now contains one tuple: `(i + 1, 1)`, `B` is a 2D list of integers containing exactly `n` rows and `m` columns, each element is 0 except for `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]`, which are all equal to 1, `j` is 0.**
