According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `operations` list. Since the loop iterates over `operations`, for it to execute one more time, the list must have at least one additional element beyond what has already been processed.

At the end of the last iteration, `operations` had at least 1 element, and the first two elements were printed. Assuming that the loop has processed the first element, the index of the last processed operation would be 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `operations` must have at least 2 elements, and the next element at index 1 must be processed.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, `i` is `n`, `j` is `m`, all elements A[i][j] are equal to B[i][j] for all i in range [0, n-1] and j in range [0, m-1], length of `operations` must be at least 2; the next element of `operations` is the third element in the list, index is 2**
