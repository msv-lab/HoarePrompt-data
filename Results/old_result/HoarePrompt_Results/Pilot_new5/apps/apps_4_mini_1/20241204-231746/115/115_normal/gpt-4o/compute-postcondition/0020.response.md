The code assigns the value 1 to four specific elements of the 2D list `B` using the indices `i`, `j`, `i + 1`, and `j + 1`. The indices `i` and `j` are already defined as `n - 1` and `0`, respectively, meaning the assignments will specifically affect `B[n - 1][0]`, `B[n - 1][1]`, `B[n][0]`, and `B[n][1]`. 

Since `A[i][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` all have current values of 1, this indicates that the values of these specific elements in `A` are not modified by the operation. The dimensions of `B` are indirectly constrained by the definitions of `n` and `m`, and it is assumed `B` is properly sized based on these dimensions.

After executing the code, the relevant elements in `B` are updated to 1. The other variables remain unchanged in their values. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers, `B` has `B[n - 1][0] = 1`, `B[n - 1][1] = 1`, `B[n][0] = 1`, `B[n][1] = 1`, `operations` is a list of tuples, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is 0.**
