According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `m`. The loop iterates as long as `j` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, and `m` is at least 2. In the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. For the loop to execute again, `m` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is at least 3, `m` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, and A[i][j] is equal to B[i][j] for all j from 0 to m-1**
