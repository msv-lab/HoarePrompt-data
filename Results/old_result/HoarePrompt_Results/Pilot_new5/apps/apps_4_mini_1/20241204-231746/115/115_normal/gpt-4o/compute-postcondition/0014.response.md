The code appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `operations`. Since `j` is `m - 1`, we can derive that `j + 1` equals `m`. Therefore, the value of `i + 1` depends on the current value of `i`. The states of the other variables, including `n`, `m`, `A`, and `B`, remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers containing exactly `n` rows and `m` columns, `B` has updated values `B[i + 1][j] = 1, B[i + 1][j + 1] = 1, B[i][j] = 1, B[i][j + 1] = 1`, `j` is `m - 1`, and `operations` now includes the tuple `(i + 1, m)`.**
