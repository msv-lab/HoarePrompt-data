The operation appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the `operations` list. The values of `i` and `j` are known: `i` is `n - 1` and `j` is `2`. 

Calculating the new values:
- `i + 1` becomes `(n - 1) + 1`, which simplifies to `n`.
- `j + 1` becomes `2 + 1`, which simplifies to `3`.

Thus, the operation will append the tuple `(n, 3)` to the `operations` list. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2; `m` is at least 3; `i` is `n - 1`; `j` is 2; `B[n-1][2] = 1`, `B[n-1][3] = 1`, `B[n][2] = 1`, `B[n][3] = 1`, `operations` now includes the tuple `(n, 3)`.**
