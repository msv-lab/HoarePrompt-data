Given the code fragment and the initial state, we can analyze the output state after all iterations of the nested loops have executed. 

The nested loops iterate over the indices of the 2D list `A`, and for each sub-square formed by the indices `(i, j)`, `(i + 1, j)`, `(i, j + 1)`, and `(i + 1, j + 1)`, it checks certain conditions based on the values in `A`. If any of the conditions are met, it appends a tuple to the `ops` list.

After all iterations of the loops execute:

1. The variable `i` will take values from `0` to `n-2` (i.e., it will end at `n-2`).
2. The variable `j` will take values from `0` to `m-2` for each value of `i`. The last value of `j` will be `m-2`.
3. The `ops` list will contain tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for any `(i, j)` pair where at least one of the conditions is true. The specific tuples in `ops` depend on the values in the 2D list `A`.

Because the maximum values for `n` and `m` are 50, and the nested loops will iterate through the entire grid minus the last row and column, we can summarize the output state as follows.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 50, `m` is between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `i` is `n - 2`, `j` is `m - 2`, and `ops` contains tuples of the form (k, l) for each (k, l) where at least one of `A[k-1][l-1]`, `A[k][l-1]`, `A[k-1][l]`, or `A[k][l]` is equal to 1, with `k` in range 1 to `n` and `l` in range 1 to `m`.**
