The `continue` statement skips the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop. In this case, it does not affect the values of any variables. The values of `n`, `m`, `A`, `i`, `j`, and `ops` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is 2 or greater, `m` is between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `ops` is an empty list. The value at `A[0][0]` is 1, the value at `A[1][0]` is 1, the value at `A[0][1]` is 1, and the value at `A[1][1]` is 1.**
