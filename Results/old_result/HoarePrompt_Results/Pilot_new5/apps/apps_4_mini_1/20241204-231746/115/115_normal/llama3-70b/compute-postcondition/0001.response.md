The value of `A` is assigned a new 2D list created by reading input values for `n` rows, where each row consists of `m` integers that are either 0 or 1. The previous conditions for `n` and `m` remain valid. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are integers such that 2 <= `n`, `m` <= 50; `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n` x `m` where each element is either 0 or 1 based on the new input values.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 2 <= `n`, `m` <= 50; `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n` x `m` where each element is either 0 or 1 based on the new input values.**
