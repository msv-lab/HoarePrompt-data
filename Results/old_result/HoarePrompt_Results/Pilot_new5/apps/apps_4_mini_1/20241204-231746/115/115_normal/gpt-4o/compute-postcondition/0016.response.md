To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we need to analyze the loop's conditions and how they affect the variables involved.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50
- `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50
- `A` is a 2D list of integers containing exactly `n` rows and `m` columns, where each element is either 0 or 1
- `operations` is an empty list
- `B` is a 2D list of integers containing exactly `n` rows and `m` columns, where each element is 0
- `i` is 0

The loop executes over `j` in the range from 0 to `m - 2`. For each `j`, the loop checks if the elements `A[i][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all equal to 1. If they are, it updates the corresponding elements in `B` to 1 and appends a tuple containing `(i + 1, j + 1)` to `operations`.

Now, after all iterations of the loop:
1. `B` will have its values updated to 1 at positions where the specified conditions for `A` were true during any of the iterations.
2. `operations` will contain all the tuples for which those conditions were met.

If no iterations meet the conditions, `B` will remain all zeros, and `operations` will remain an empty list.

Therefore, the final output state must summarize the conditions and results after all iterations.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers containing exactly `n` rows and `m` columns, where each element is either 0 or 1; `B` is a 2D list that reflects the counts of 2x2 blocks in `A` where all four elements are 1, `operations` is a list of tuples containing the positions of those blocks in 1-based indexing.**
