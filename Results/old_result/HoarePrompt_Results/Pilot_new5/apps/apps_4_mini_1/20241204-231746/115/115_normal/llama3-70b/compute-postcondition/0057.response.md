Given the initial state where `n` is 3 or greater, `m` is greater than 2, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `i` is 2, and `j` is 2. The code checks if `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all equal to 1 before executing the next line. Based on this, `ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))` appends the tuple `(3, 3)` to the list `ops`.

The variable `ops` now contains an additional tuple, but no other variables are modified.

Output State: **`n` is 3 or greater, `m` is greater than 2, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, and `ops` has the tuple (3, 3) appended.**
