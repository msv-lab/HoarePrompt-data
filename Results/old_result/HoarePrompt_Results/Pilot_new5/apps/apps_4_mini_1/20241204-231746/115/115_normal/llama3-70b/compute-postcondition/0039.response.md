Postcondition: ***`n` is 2 or greater, `m` is between 3 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, and `i` is 1, `j` is 2. If any of the conditions `A[i][j] == 1`, `A[i + 1][j] == 1`, `A[i][j + 1] == 1`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1` are met, the current iteration is skipped and the tuple `(2, 3)` is appended to `ops`. If none of these conditions are met, the iteration continues as normal.***
