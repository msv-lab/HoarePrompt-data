The statement `operations.append((i + 1, j + 1))` appends a tuple containing the values of `i + 1` and `j + 1` to the list `operations`. The values of `i` and `j` are known based on the initial state where `j` is equal to `m`. Therefore, `j + 1` will be equal to `m + 1`. The value of `i + 1` remains dependent on the current value of `i`, which is not specified in the initial state.

Given that `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `j` will also be within the same range since `j` is equal to `m`. Thus, `j + 1` will lie between 3 and 51.

The output state reflects that the tuple `(i + 1, m + 1)` has been added to the list `operations`, while all other variable conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50; `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50; `j` is equal to `m`; `operations` now contains `(i + 1, m + 1)` added to it.**
