Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` and `m`, which define the dimensions of a 2D list `A` of integers (where each element is either 0 or 1) and processes it to find the positions of the cells that have at least one adjacent cell (including diagonally) with a value of 1. If the count of such positions exceeds 2500, it prints -1; otherwise, it prints the count of positions found and the positions themselves. **
