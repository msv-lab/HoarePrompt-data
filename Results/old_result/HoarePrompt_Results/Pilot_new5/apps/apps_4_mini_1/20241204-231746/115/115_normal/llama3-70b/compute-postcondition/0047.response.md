In this code snippet, we are appending a tuple to the `ops` list. The tuple consists of the values `i + 1` and `j + 1`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2 and `j` is 0. Therefore, the values being appended are:

- `i + 1` equals `2 + 1`, which is `3`
- `j + 1` equals `0 + 1`, which is `1`

This means that the tuple `(3, 1)` will be appended to the `ops` list. The other variables and the structure of the 2D list `A` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be 3 or greater, `m` is between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `ops` list is appended with (3, 1), and the value of `A[2][0]` is 1 or `A[3][0]` is 1 or `A[2][1]` is 1 or `A[3][1]` is 1.**
