Postcondition: ***`n` is 2 or greater, `m` is between 3 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `i` is 1, `j` is 2. If `A[i][j]` is 1, `A[i + 1][j]` is 1, `A[i][j + 1]` is 1, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1, the current iteration is skipped. If none of these conditions are met, the iteration continues as normal.***
