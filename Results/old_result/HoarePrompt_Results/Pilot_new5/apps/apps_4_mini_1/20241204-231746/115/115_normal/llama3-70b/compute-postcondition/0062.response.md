The code snippet executes a `print` statement that outputs `-1`. The values of the variables `n`, `m`, `A`, `i`, `j`, and `ops` remain unchanged, as the `print` command does not alter any of them. 

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 50, `m` is between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `i` is `n - 2`, `j` is `m - 2`, and `ops` contains tuples of the form (k, l), with the current length of `ops` greater than 2500.**
