Postcondition: ***`n` must be 3 or greater, `m` is between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, and the `ops` list is unchanged unless `A[2][0]`, `A[3][0]`, `A[2][1]`, or `A[3][1]` is equal to 1, in which case, the `ops` list is appended with (3, 1).***
