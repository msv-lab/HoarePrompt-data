Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, the problem allows the creation of the target matrix `A` by performing operations on matrix `B`, where each operation sets a `2x2` submatrix to `1`. However, the implementation only checks for `2x2` blocks of `1s` in matrix `A` and attempts to create `B` based on those blocks.

Here are the key issues with the program:

1. **Incomplete Coverage of Cases**: The program only sets `1`s in `B` based on existing `2x2` blocks of `1`s in `A`, but it does not account for cases where `A` may have isolated `1`s or `1`s that do not form complete `2x2` blocks. This means that if `A` has a `1` positioned such that it cannot be part of any `2x2` submatrix (e.g., a `1` in an otherwise zeroed row or column), the program will not be able to replicate `A` in `B`.

2. **Ineffective Check for Equality**: The condition checks if `A` and `B` are equal only after attempting to fill `B`. If `A` contains `1`s in positions that do not correspond to `2x2` blocks, the program will incorrectly output `-1`, even though the input `A` might be valid and could be achieved through a series of operations.

3. **Failure to Report Operations**: The problem states that if it is possible to make `B` equal to `A`, the program should print the sequence of operations used to do so. However, it does not account for the fact that it may need to make multiple operations to fill the `B` matrix correctly, and it prematurely returns `-1` without attempting to fill all necessary positions.

These issues mean that while the program attempts to solve the problem, it does not cover all necessary cases and it could miss valid configurations of `A` that could be achieved through allowed operations on `B`. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect.
