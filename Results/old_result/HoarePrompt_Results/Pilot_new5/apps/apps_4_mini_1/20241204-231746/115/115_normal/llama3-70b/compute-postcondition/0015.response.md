Postcondition: ***`n` is 2 or greater, `m` is between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `ops` is an empty list. If any of the values `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` equal to 1, then `ops` is updated to include the tuple (1, 2). If none of these conditions are met, `ops` remains unchanged as an empty list.***
