Postcondition: ***`n` is 2 or greater, `m` is between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `i` is 1, `j` is 0. If any of the conditions `A[i][j] == 1`, `A[i + 1][j] == 1`, `A[i][j + 1] == 1`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1` hold true, `ops` now includes the tuple (2, 1). Otherwise, the program continues executing without skipping the current iteration of the loop.***
