Postcondition: ***`n` is between 2 and 50, `m` is between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `i` is `n - 2`, `j` is `m - 2`, and `ops` contains tuples of the form (k, l) for each (k, l) where at least one of `A[k-1][l-1]`, `A[k][l-1]`, `A[k-1][l]`, or `A[k][l]` is equal to 1, with `k` in range 1 to `n` and `l` in range 1 to `m. The current length of `ops` is greater than 2500.***
