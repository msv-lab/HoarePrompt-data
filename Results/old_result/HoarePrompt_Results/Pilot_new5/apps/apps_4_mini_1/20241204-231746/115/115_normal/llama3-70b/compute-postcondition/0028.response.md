The operation `ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))` adds a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `ops`. Given that `i` is 1 and `j` is 0, the tuple being added is `(1 + 1, 0 + 1)`, which evaluates to `(2, 1)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is 2 or greater, `m` is between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `ops` now includes the tuple (2, 1)**.
