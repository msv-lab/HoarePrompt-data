After evaluating the provided code snippet, we see that the values of the elements in the 2D list `B` at specific indices will be updated to 1 based on the values of `A`. Specifically, `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` will all be set to 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects these updates.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers containing exactly `n` rows and `m` columns, where each element is either 0 or 1, `operations` is an empty list, `B` is a 2D list of integers containing exactly `n` rows and `m` columns, each element is 0 except for `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]`, which are all equal to 1, `j` is 0.**
