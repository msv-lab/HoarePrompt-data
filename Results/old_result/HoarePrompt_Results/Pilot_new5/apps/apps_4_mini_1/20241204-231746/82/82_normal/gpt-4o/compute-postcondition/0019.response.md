To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we begin by analyzing the impact of the code on the current variables given the initial state.

Initial State: 
- `a` and `b` are positive integers.
- `new_a` is calculated as `(a + diff - 1) // diff * diff`.
- `candidate` is equal to `diff`.
- `new_b` is calculated as `(b + diff - 1) // diff * diff`.
- `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.

Executing the code:
```
current_lcm = func_2(new_a, new_b)
```
This line assigns the result of the function `func_2(new_a, new_b)` to `current_lcm`. The variables `new_a` and `new_b` remain unchanged, and the only variable changing its value is `current_lcm`, which now holds the output of the function.

Output State: 
**`a` and `b` are positive integers; `new_a` is calculated as `(a + diff - 1) // diff * diff`; `candidate` is equal to `diff`; `new_b` is calculated as `(b + diff - 1) // diff * diff`; `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)` (which has been updated with the function output).**
