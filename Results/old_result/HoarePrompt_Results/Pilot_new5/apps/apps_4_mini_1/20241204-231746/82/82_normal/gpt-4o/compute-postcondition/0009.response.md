To compute the output state, we analyze the provided code snippet with respect to the initial state.

The code calculates `new_a` as follows:
```
new_a = (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
```

From the initial state, we have:
- `a` is a positive integer.
- `b` is a positive integer.
- `diff` is equal to `abs(a - b)` and must be greater than 0.
- `min_lcm` is positive infinity.
- `min_k` is 0.
- `k` is 1.
- `candidate` is `k` and `candidate` is `diff`.

Since `candidate` is equal to `diff` and `diff` is `abs(a - b)`, we can express `candidate` as `abs(a - b)`.

Now substituting `candidate` into the formula for `new_a`:
```
new_a = (a + abs(a - b) - 1) // abs(a - b) * abs(a - b)
```

The calculation effectively rounds `a` up to the nearest multiple of `candidate` (which is `diff`), since `new_a` takes the ceiling of `a / candidate` and then multiplies by `candidate`.

Updating the state:
The other variables remain unchanged, and we only update `new_a` based on the calculations above.

Thus, the output state is:
Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `diff` is equal to `abs(a - b)`, `min_lcm` is positive infinity, `min_k` is 0, `k` is 1, `candidate` is `diff`, `new_a` is `(a + abs(a - b) - 1) // abs(a - b) * abs(a - b)`**.
