According to the code, the loop iterates over a list containing two candidates: `k` and `diff // k`. In order for the loop to execute, both of these candidates must be valid. 

1. Since `k` is 1, it is a valid candidate.
2. Next, we need to check the second candidate, which is `diff // k`. Given that `k` is 1, `diff // k` simplifies to `diff`. For the loop to execute, `diff` must also be a valid candidate. 

Since `diff` is derived from `abs(a - b)` and `a` and `b` are both positive integers, `diff` will always be a non-negative integer. Therefore, as long as `diff` is not zero, both candidates will be valid.

Thus, for the loop to execute, we must ensure that `diff` is greater than 0 (which it is, since `a` is not equal to `b` as they are both positive integers). 

Additionally, we can indicate the initial values of the candidates.

State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `diff` is equal to `abs(a - b)` and must be greater than 0, `min_lcm` is positive infinity, `min_k` is 0, `k` is 1, `candidate` is `k` and `candidate` is `diff`**
