The `current_lcm` variable is assigned the result of calling the function `func_2` with `new_a` and `new_b` as arguments. The values of `new_a` and `new_b` are derived from `a` and `b`, respectively. Since `new_a` is calculated as `(a + 2) // 3 * 3`, it will be the nearest multiple of 3 less than or equal to `a + 2`. The value of `new_b` is defined as the nearest multiple of 3 greater than or equal to `b`.

The exact values of `new_a` and `new_b` depend on the specific values of `a` and `b`, which are both positive integers. `current_lcm` will hold the least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b`, but its exact value is unknown without the implementation details of `func_2`.

Therefore, the output state considers all the initial conditions that remain valid after the operation, indicating that `current_lcm` has been computed.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `diff` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 9, `k` is 3, `candidate` is 3, `new_a` is equal to `(a + 2) // 3 * 3`, `new_b` is the nearest multiple of 3 greater than or equal to `b`, and `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.**
