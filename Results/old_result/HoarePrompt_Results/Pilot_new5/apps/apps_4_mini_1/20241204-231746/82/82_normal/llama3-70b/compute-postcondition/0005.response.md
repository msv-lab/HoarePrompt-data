The code snippet `a, b = b, a % b` performs a tuple unpacking assignment. The variable `a` is assigned the value of `b`, and `b` is assigned the value of `a % b`. 

Initially, `a` is equal to `a_initial % b_initial`, and since `b` must be greater than 0, we can conclude that `b` has some positive value. The new value of `a` would be the current value of `b`, while the new value of `b` would be the result of `a_initial % b_initial`.

Thus, the updated state of the variables after executing the code is:

- `a` is now equal to `b`
- `b` is now equal to `a_initial % b_initial`

Output State: **`a` is equal to `b`, `b` is equal to `a_initial % b_initial`, `b` must be greater than 0**
