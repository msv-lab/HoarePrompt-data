In this case, `current_lcm` is assigned the value of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`. The previous values of `new_a` and `new_b` are retained. The specifics of `new_a` and `new_b` depend on the initial values of `a`, `b`, and `diff`, but they remain defined based on their initial conditions.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers; `diff` is greater than or equal to 2; `k` is 2; `candidate` is `diff // k`; `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `a`; `new_b` is now `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`; `current_lcm` is now equal to `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.**
