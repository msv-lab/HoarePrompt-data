The function accepts two integers `a` and `b`, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`. The function continues to compute the GCD until `b` becomes 0, at which point it returns `a`, which holds the GCD. This implementation correctly handles the case where either `a` or `b` is 0, as GCD(0, x) is defined to be x.
