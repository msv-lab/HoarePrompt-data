According to the code, the loop iterates over `k` starting from 1 up to the integer value of the square root of `diff`. Since `k` is currently 2 at the end of the previous iteration, in order for the loop to execute one more time, the range must allow for `k` to increment. 

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and the loop will continue as long as `k` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff))`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be incremented to 3.

Additionally, since `k` is updated in the loop, we need to evaluate `diff`. If `diff` is at least 9, `int(math.sqrt(diff))` will be at least 3, allowing for one more iteration.

State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 9, `k` is 3, and `min_lcm` is the minimum least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b` after evaluating candidates.**
