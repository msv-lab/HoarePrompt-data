According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `b` is non-zero (truthy). At the end of the last iteration, `b` is equal to `b_initial % (a_initial % b_initial)`. For the loop to execute one more time, `b` must be greater than 0.

Since `b` is computed as `b_initial % (a_initial % b_initial)`, we need to ensure that the result of this operation is non-zero for the loop to continue. However, without knowing the specific values of `a_initial` and `b_initial`, we cannot definitively state the conditions that will ensure `b` is non-zero.

Thus, we can only state that `b` must be adjusted to be greater than 0. To achieve that, we need the initial values to satisfy conditions such that `b_initial` should not be equal to 0 and `a_initial % b_initial` must also not equal 0.

State: **`a` is equal to `a_initial % b_initial`, `b` must be greater than 0**
