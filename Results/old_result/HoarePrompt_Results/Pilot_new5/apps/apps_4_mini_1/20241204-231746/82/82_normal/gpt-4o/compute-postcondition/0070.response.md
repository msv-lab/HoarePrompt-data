The variable `min_lcm` is assigned the value of `current_lcm`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `diff` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 9, `k` is 3, `candidate` is `diff // 3`, `new_a` is equal to `(a + diff // 3 - 1) // (diff // 3) * (diff // 3)`, `new_b` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `b`, `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `diff` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 9, `k` is 3, `candidate` is `diff // 3`, `new_a` is equal to `(a + diff // 3 - 1) // (diff // 3) * (diff // 3)`, `new_b` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `b`, `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`.**
