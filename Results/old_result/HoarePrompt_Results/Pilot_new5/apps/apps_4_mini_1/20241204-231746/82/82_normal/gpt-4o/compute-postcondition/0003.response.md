The variable `diff` is assigned the value of the absolute difference between `a` and `b`. Since `a` and `b` are positive integers within the range of 1 to 10^9 and are not equal to each other, `diff` will be a positive integer that represents the distance between `a` and `b`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9, and `a` is not equal to `b`; `diff` is equal to `abs(a - b)`, which is a positive integer.**
