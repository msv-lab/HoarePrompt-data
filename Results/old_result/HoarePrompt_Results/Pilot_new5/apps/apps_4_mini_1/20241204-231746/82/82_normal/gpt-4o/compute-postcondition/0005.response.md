The variable `min_k` is assigned the value 0. The values of `a`, `b`, `diff`, and `min_lcm` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9, and `a` is not equal to `b`; `diff` is equal to `abs(a - b)` which is a positive integer; `min_lcm` is equal to positive infinity; `min_k` is 0.**
