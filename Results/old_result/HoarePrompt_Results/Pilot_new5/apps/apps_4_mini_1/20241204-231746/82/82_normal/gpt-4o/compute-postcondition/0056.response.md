Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2. If `diff` is divisible by `k`, then `min_lcm` is the minimum least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b` after evaluating candidates, where `new_a` is the smallest multiple of the optimal candidate greater than or equal to `a`, and `new_b` is the smallest multiple of the optimal candidate greater than or equal to `b`.***
