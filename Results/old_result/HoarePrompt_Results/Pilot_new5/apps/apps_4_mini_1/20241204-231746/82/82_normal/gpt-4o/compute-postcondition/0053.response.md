The variable `min_k` is assigned the value of `candidate`. The value of `candidate` is `diff // k`, where `k` is 2. Since `candidate` is directly assigned to `min_k` and no other variables are affected, the Output State will reflect this assignment.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers; `diff` is greater than or equal to 2; `k` is 2; `candidate` is `diff // k`; `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `a`; `new_b` is now `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`; `current_lcm` is now equal to `func_2(new_a, new_b)`; `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`; `min_k` is equal to `candidate`.**
