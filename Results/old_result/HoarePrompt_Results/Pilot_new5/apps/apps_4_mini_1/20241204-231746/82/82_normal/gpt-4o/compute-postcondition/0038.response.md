Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is greater than or equal to 2, `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`, `min_k` is the candidate that yielded the minimum least common multiple, `k` is 2, `new_a` is the smallest even number greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `b`, and the current value of `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, and the current value of `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm` or (the current value of `current_lcm` is equal to `min_lcm` and `candidate` is less than `min_k`).**
