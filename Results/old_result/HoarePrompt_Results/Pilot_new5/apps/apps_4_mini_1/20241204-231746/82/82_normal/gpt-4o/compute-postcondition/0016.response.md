According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in the list `[k, diff // k]`. The loop iterates over the candidates, which are `k` and `diff // k`. 

At the end of the last iteration, the conditions involving `min_lcm`, `current_lcm`, and `min_k` might have led to updates of `min_lcm`, `min_k`, and possibly other variables. However, the key focus is on the `candidate` variable, which is taken from the list.

Currently, `candidate` is the first element in the list, which is `k`. For the loop to execute one more time, it needs to take the second element from the list, which is `diff // k`. Therefore, `candidate` will be updated to `diff // k` for the next iteration.

The state at the start of the next iteration would require the following adjustments:
1. `candidate` changes from `k` to `diff // k`.
2. The values of `new_a` and `new_b` remain unchanged until the next iteration is processed, but they will still be dependent on the new `candidate`.

Thus, the relevant states that need adjustment for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `candidate` changes to `diff // k`.

State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers, candidate is `diff // k`, k remains 1, new_a is calculated as `(a + abs(a - b) - 1) // abs(a - b) * abs(a - b)`, new_b is calculated as `(b + diff - 1) // diff * diff`, current_lcm is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`**
