The value of `min_lcm` is updated to be equal to `current_lcm`. The other variables retain their previous values. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `diff` is equal to `abs(a - b)`, `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`, `min_k` is 0, `k` is 1, `candidate` is `diff`, `new_a` is `(a + abs(a - b) - 1) // abs(a - b) * abs(a - b)`, `new_b` is `(b + diff - 1) // diff * diff`, and `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `diff` is equal to `abs(a - b)`, `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`, `min_k` is 0, `k` is 1, `candidate` is `diff`, `new_a` is `(a + abs(a - b) - 1) // abs(a - b) * abs(a - b)`, `new_b` is `(b + diff - 1) // diff * diff`, and `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.**
