Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are positive integers; `diff` is greater than or equal to 2; `k` is 2; `candidate` is `diff // k`; `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `a`; `new_b` is now `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`; `current_lcm` is now equal to `func_2(new_a, new_b)`. If `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm` or equal to `min_lcm` while `candidate` is less than `min_k`, then `min_lcm` is updated to `current_lcm` and `min_k` is updated to `candidate`.***
