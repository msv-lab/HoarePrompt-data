Postcondition: ***`in_degree` contains the in-degrees of all vertices, `in_degree[neighbor]` has been decremented by 1, `n` is the total number of vertices, `queue` contains vertices with in-degrees of 0 excluding the removed vertex, `node` is a valid vertex in the graph, `graph[node]` contains at least one neighbor, and the current value of `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0.***
