Postcondition: ***`node` is an integer, `graph` has at least one neighbor for `node`, `visited[node]` is True, and `rec_stack[node]` is True. If `func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack)` returns True, it indicates that the node has been visited and is currently in the recursion stack, confirming its presence in the graph's traversal.***
