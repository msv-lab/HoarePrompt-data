Postcondition: ***`in_degree` contains the in-degrees of all vertices with `in_degree[neighbor]` decreased by 1. If `in_degree[neighbor]` equals 0, `queue` includes the vertex `neighbor`, which is appended to its previous values. The total number of vertices, `n`, remains unchanged, and `node` is a valid vertex in the graph with at least one neighbor, while `neighbor` is the next neighbor in the list of `graph[node]`.***
