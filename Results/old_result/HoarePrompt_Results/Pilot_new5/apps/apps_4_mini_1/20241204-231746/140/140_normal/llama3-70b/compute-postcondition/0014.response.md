Postcondition: ***`node` is an integer, `graph` has at least one neighbor for `node`, `visited[node]` is True, and `rec_stack[node]` is True. If `func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack)` returns True, the function indicates that the current node has been successfully visited and is part of the recursion stack in the graph traversal.***
