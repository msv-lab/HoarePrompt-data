The statement `in_degree[v] += 1` increments the in-degree of the vertex `v` by 1. Given that `graph[u]` must have at least one value (k > 0), it implies that `v` is one of the values in `graph[u]`. The previous structure of `in_degree` is updated only for the vertex `v`.

The states of the other variables, such as `graph`, `n`, and `u`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that the in-degree of vertex `v` has increased by 1.

Output State: **`graph` must have at least 2 keys, `n` is greater than 0, `u` is the second key in `graph`, `graph[u]` must have at least 1 value (k > 0), `in_degree[v]` is incremented by 1.**
