The operation `queue.append(neighbor)` adds the `neighbor` vertex to the `queue`. Since `in_degree[neighbor]` has been decremented by 1 and is now 0, `neighbor` qualifies to be added to the `queue`, which contains vertices with in-degrees of 0 excluding the removed vertex. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`in_degree` contains the in-degrees of all vertices, `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0, `n` is the total number of vertices, `queue` contains vertices with in-degrees of 0 including `neighbor`, `node` is a valid vertex in the graph, `graph[node]` contains at least one neighbor.**
