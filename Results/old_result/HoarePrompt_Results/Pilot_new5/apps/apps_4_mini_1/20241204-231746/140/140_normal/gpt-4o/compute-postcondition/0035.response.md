Postcondition: ***`in_degree` contains the in-degrees of all vertices. If `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0, then `queue` includes the vertex `neighbor` among the vertices with in-degrees of 0, while `n` remains the total number of vertices and `node` is a valid vertex in the graph with at least one neighbor.***
