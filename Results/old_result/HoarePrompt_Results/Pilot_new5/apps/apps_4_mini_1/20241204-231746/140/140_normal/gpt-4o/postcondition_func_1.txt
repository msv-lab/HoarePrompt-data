The function accepts a dictionary `graph` representing a directed graph with integer keys as vertices and lists of integers as directed edges. It returns a boolean value indicating whether the graph contains a cycle; specifically, it returns True if there is a cycle (not all vertices can be processed due to unprocessed vertices), and False if the graph is acyclic (all vertices can be processed). The function assumes that `n` (the number of vertices) is at least 2, but it does not handle cases where vertices have no edges, which may lead to misleading results in the context of cycle detection.
