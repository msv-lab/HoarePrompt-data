According to the code, the loop iterates over the neighbors of the current `node` in the `graph`. The loop will execute once for each neighbor of `node`. Since `graph` has at least one neighbor for `node`, at the end of the last iteration of the loop, `neighbor` would be the current neighbor being processed, and the loop will execute again for the next neighbor in the list.

Given that `visited[node]` is True and `rec_stack[node]` is True, we need to consider the following:

1. The loop iterates over each neighbor of `node`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `neighbor` must refer to the next neighbor in the list.
2. If `neighbor` was the last neighbor during the previous iteration, the loop would not execute again.

Thus, we need to advance `neighbor` to the next neighbor in the list and ensure that the conditions regarding `visited` and `rec_stack` for the new `neighbor` are still valid.

Since `graph[node]` has at least one neighbor, if `neighbor` was previously false (not visited), and if the function did not return true, it will remain false. If `visited[neighbor]` is true, it indicates that the neighbor has already been visited, and we would need to ensure that `rec_stack[neighbor]` is still false.

Assuming `neighbor` is moved to the next index in the neighbor list, and given that we know `graph` has at least one neighbor, we can state:

State: **`node` is an integer, `graph` has at least one neighbor for `node`, `visited[node]` is True, `rec_stack[node]` is True, `neighbor` is the next neighbor in the list, `visited[neighbor]` is True or remains False, `rec_stack[neighbor]` is False if `visited[neighbor]` is True**
