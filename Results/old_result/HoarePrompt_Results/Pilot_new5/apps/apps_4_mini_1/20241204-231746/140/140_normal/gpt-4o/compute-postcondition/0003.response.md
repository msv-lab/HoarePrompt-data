The variable `in_degree[v]` is incremented by 1. The specific value of `in_degree[v]` was not provided, but it must exist since `v` is presumably a key in `in_degree`, which is likely a dictionary. The conditions regarding `graph`, `n`, and `u` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`graph` must have at least 1 key, `n` must be greater than 0, `u` is the first key in the graph, `graph[u]` must have at least 1 value, and `in_degree[v]` is incremented by 1.**
