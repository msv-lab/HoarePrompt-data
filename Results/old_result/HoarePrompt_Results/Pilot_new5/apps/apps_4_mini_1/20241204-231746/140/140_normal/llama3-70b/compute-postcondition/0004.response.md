Postcondition: ***`node` is an integer, `graph` has at least one neighbor for `node`, `visited[node]` is True, `rec_stack[node]` is True, `neighbor` is the first neighbor in `graph[node]`, the current value of `visited[neighbor]` is False, and the result of `func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack)` is True.***
