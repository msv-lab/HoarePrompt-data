n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the graph (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), m is an integer representing the number of directed edges (1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)), and each directed edge is represented by a pair of integers (u, v) such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n and u ≠ v. The graph may contain cycles.
