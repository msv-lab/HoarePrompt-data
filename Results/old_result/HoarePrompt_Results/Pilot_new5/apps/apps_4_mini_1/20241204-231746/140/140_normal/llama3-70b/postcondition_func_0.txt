The function accepts an integer `node`, a list of tuples `graph` representing directed edges, a list of boolean values `visited` to track visited vertices, and a list of boolean values `rec_stack` to track vertices in the recursion stack. It performs a depth-first search to detect cycles in the directed graph. The function returns True if a cycle is found or if the node is currently being explored, and returns False if the node has been fully processed without detecting cycles.
