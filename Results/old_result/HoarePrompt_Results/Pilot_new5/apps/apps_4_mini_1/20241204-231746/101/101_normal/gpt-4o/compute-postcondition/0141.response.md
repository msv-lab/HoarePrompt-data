Postcondition: ***`top` is 2, `bottom` is 2, `left` is 0, `right` is 2, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, and `j` is 2. If `j` is greater than `right`, then `right` is updated to 2, while `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `i`, `n`, `m`, and `j` remain unchanged. If `j` is not greater than `right`, the values of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `i`, `n`, `m`, and `j` stay as they are.***
