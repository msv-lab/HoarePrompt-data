After executing the code `top = i`, the variable `top` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 2. The other variables retain their previous values since they are not affected. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`top` is 2, `bottom` is 2, `left` is 0, `right` is 1, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, and `j` is 2**.
