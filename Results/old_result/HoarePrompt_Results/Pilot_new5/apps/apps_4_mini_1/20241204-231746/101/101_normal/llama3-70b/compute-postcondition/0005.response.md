The code updates `min_x` and `min_y` by taking the minimum of their current values and the values of `x` and `y`, respectively. The values of `n`, `m`, `pixels`, and `white_pixels` are not affected by this operation. The exact values of `min_x` and `min_y` cannot be determined without knowing the initial values of `min_x`, `min_y`, `x`, and `y`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `pixels` must contain at least one 'w', `white_pixels` must be a list containing at least one tuple representing coordinates of 'w', `min_x` is updated to min(min_x, x), `min_y` is updated to min(min_y, y)**.
