The code assigns the value `'.'` to the element at `pixels[i][j]`. In the given initial state, `i` is 2 and `j` is 1. The values of `n`, `m`, and the contents of `pixels` are not affected by this assignment, but now `pixels[2][1]` holds the value `'.'`. Therefore, the Output State will reflect the unchanged variables while including the updated state of `pixels`.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, and `pixels[2][1]` is '.'**
