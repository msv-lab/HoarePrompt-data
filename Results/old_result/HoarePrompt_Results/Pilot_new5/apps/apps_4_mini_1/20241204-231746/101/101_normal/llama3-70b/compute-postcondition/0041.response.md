Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `pixels[i][j]` is updated based on the conditions for all columns `j` from 0 to `m-1`, with `pixels[i][j]` being either '+', '.', or unchanged if it was 'w' originally. If `m` is 0, the loop does not execute and `pixels[i][j]` remains unchanged for all `j`.**
