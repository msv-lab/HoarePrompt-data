The code assigns the value `'+'` to `pixels[i][j]`, where `i` is currently 1 and `j` is also 1. The values of `n`, `m`, and other variables remain unchanged. There are no specific constraints on the values in the `pixels` array provided, but it is assumed that `pixels` is a valid 2D array structure. 

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `i` is 1, `m` must be greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 1, `pixels[1][1]` is '+'**.
