`left` is assigned the value of `j`. The value of `j` is 1, so `left` becomes 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the Output State is: `n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, `left` is 1, `right` is either 0 or None, `m` is greater than 0, and `j` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, `left` is 1, `right` is either 0 or None, `m` is greater than 0, and `j` is 1.**
