Postcondition: ***`top` is either 1 or equal to `i`, `bottom` is 1, `left` is equal to `j`, `right` is equal to `j` if `top` was None, `j` is incremented by 1, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 1, and the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w' if `i` is less than `top`. If `i` is greater than `bottom`, the condition confirms that `bottom` remains 1, preserving all other conditions stated in the precondition. Otherwise, there is no else part to modify the state.***
