The code `pixels[i][j] = '+'` modifies the `pixels` array at the position defined by the indices `i` and `j`. The variable `i` has a value of `1`, and `j` has a value of `2`. Therefore, the position being modified in the `pixels` array is `pixels[1][2]`, which will now hold the value `'+'`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, and `pixels[1][2]` is now '+'**.
