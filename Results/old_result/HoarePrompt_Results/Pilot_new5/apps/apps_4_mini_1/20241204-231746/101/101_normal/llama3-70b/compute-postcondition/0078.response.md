The code assigns the value `'+'` to the element at the index `[i][j]` of the `pixels` array. The values of `i` and `j` are 2 and 1, respectively, and the array `pixels` is assumed to be structured to accommodate these indices. The values of `n`, `m`, and `j` remain unchanged because they are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, and pixels[2][1] is set to '+'**
