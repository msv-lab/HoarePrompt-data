The variable `frame_width` is assigned the value of `right - left + 1`. The values of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `n`, `m`, and `frame_height` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `top` is the minimum row index of 'w' characters, `bottom` is the maximum row index of 'w' characters, `left` is the minimum column index of 'w' characters, `right` is the maximum column index of 'w' characters, `n` is the number of rows, `m` is the number of columns, `frame_height` is equal to `bottom - top + 1`, and `frame_width` is equal to `right - left + 1`.

Output State: **`top` is the minimum row index of 'w' characters, `bottom` is the maximum row index of 'w' characters, `left` is the minimum column index of 'w' characters, `right` is the maximum column index of 'w' characters, `n` is the number of rows, `m` is the number of columns, `frame_height` is equal to `bottom - top + 1`, `frame_width` is equal to `right - left + 1`.**
