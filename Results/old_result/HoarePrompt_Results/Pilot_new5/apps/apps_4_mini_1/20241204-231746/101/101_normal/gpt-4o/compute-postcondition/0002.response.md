To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to examine the variables involved in the loop, specifically focusing on `m` and `j`. The loop will execute if `m` is at least 1. Since we know from the initial state that `n` is at least 1, it does not directly affect the execution of the loop. However, we need to ensure that `m` is properly defined.

At the beginning of the loop:
- `j` should start at 0, which is already set correctly in the initial state.
- `m` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute, which is not mentioned but assumed to be true.

Given that `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are initialized to None, we do not have specific values assigned to them yet, and they donâ€™t influence the loop's execution directly unless they are utilized within the loop body.

Thus, the necessary states to ensure the loop can execute are:
- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `j` starts at 0.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `top` is None, `bottom` is None, `left` is None, `right` is None, `m` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0**
