Postcondition: ***`top` is equal to `i`, `bottom` is 1, `left` is equal to `j`, `right` is equal to `j` if `j` is greater than `right`. If `j` is less than or equal to `right`, the state of the program remains unchanged, with `n` being at least 2, `i` being 1, `m` greater than or equal to 1, and the current value of `screen[i][j]` being 'w'.***
