The code updates `max_x` and `max_y` using the `max` function, which means `max_x` will take the greater value between the current `max_x` and `x`, while `max_y` will take the greater value between the current `max_y` and `y`. The values of `min_x` and `min_y` remain unchanged, and no other variables are affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `pixels` must contain at least one 'w', `white_pixels` must be a list containing at least two tuples representing coordinates of 'w', `min_x` is updated to min(previous min_x, x), `min_y` is updated to min(previous min_y, y), `max_x` is updated to max(previous max_x, x), `max_y` is updated to max(previous max_y, y)**
