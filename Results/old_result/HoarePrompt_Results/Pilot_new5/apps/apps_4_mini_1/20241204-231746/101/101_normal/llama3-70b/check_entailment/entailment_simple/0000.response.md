To analyze the provided program against the problem description, we need to evaluate whether it satisfies all conditions specified in the problem.

### Key Requirements from the Problem Description:
1. The program must find the smallest square frame of pixels with a width of 1 pixel that surrounds all white pixels ('w').
2. The frame should not exceed the bounds of the monitor.
3. Any pixels that are white ('w') should remain unchanged.
4. If it is not possible to create such a frame, the program should output `-1`.

### Breakdown of the Program:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the dimensions of the monitor and the state of pixels correctly.
   - It constructs a list of coordinates for all white pixels.

2. **Finding Frame Boundaries**:
   - The program calculates `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y`, which represent the bounds of the white pixels correctly.

3. **Frame Size Check**:
   - It calculates the size of the frame needed. Here, it uses `frame_size = max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`.
   - The frame size check (`if (frame_size > max(n, m))`) is intended to ensure that the frame does not exceed the monitor's boundaries. However, this condition might not be sufficient to determine if a valid frame can be drawn, as it only checks whether the calculated frame size exceeds the monitor's maximum dimension.

4. **Frame Drawing**:
   - The program then attempts to draw the frame by iterating through the pixel grid, updating appropriate boundary pixels to '+'.
   - It does not change the 'w' pixels, which is correct.
   - However, the program provides no mechanism to validate that the entire frame can be drawn without exceeding the limits of the monitor or ensuring that it fully surrounds the white pixels.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the modified pixel grid.

### Key Issues Identified:
- The program will report `-1` prematurely if the frame size exceeds either dimension of the monitor, but it does not consider cases where the necessary frame might still fit within the screen boundaries, especially when the white pixels are tightly packed.
- The frame drawing logic assumes that the frame can always be drawn with the calculated boundaries, which is not always the case. For instance, if the calculated boundaries result in a frame that overlaps with the monitor's edges or does not properly surround the white pixels, it can lead to incorrect outputs.

### Conclusion:
The program does not consistently meet the requirements set forth in the problem description due to insufficient checks on the feasibility of the frame drawing and possible premature output of `-1`. Therefore, the correctness of the program according to the problem description is:

Correctness: **False**
