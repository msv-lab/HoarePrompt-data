The values of `left` and `right` are both assigned the value of `j`, which is currently 0. Therefore, after executing the code, `left` and `right` will both become 0. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`top` is 2, `bottom` is 2, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 1, `j` is 0, the value of `screen[2][0]` is 'w', and the current value of `top` is 2.**
