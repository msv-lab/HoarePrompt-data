The code `pixels[i][j] = '+'` assigns the value `'+'` to the element at the position `[i][j]` in the `pixels` array. The initial state indicates that `pixels[i][j]` is currently a dot ('.'). No other variables are directly affected by this assignment, so we maintain their previous values and conditions.

In conclusion, the output state reflects that the value at `pixels[i][j]` has changed from a dot to a plus sign.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 0, `j` is either equal to `min_y` or `max_y`, and `pixels[i][j]` is now a '+'**
