The statement `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. However, since no variables are modified by this statement and we don't have the context of being inside a loop, we can't change any variable values. 

The values of the variables remain unchanged in this scenario. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with an additional note that we are skipping the current iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 1, `j` is 1 and we skip the current iteration of the loop.**
