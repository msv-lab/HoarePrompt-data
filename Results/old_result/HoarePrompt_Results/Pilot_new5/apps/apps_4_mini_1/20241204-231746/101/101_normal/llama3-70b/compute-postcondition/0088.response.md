Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 2000, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 1, and `j` is 2. If either `i` equals `min_x`, `max_x`, `j` equals `min_y`, or `max_y` and `pixels[2][2]` is '+', then the function proceeds with the current condition. Otherwise, if `pixels[2][2]` is 'w', the current iteration of the loop is skipped, and if `pixels[2][2]` is '.', the loop continues with the next iteration.***
