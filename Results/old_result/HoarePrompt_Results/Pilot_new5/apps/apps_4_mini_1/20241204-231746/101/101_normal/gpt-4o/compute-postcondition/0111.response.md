`left` is assigned the value of `j`, which is 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `left` is being set to `j`, its previous value of `None` is replaced by 0. The state of `j` remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `top` is 2, `bottom` is 2, `left` is 0, `right` is None, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 1, `j` is 0, the value of `screen[2][0]` is 'w', and the current value of `j` is still less than `left`, which is now 0.

Output State: **`top` is 2, `bottom` is 2, `left` is 0, `right` is None, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 1, `j` is 0, the value of `screen[2][0]` is 'w', and the current value of `j` is less than `left`, which is 0.**
