Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 2000, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than 2, and `j` is 2. If the condition is met, `pixels[0][2]` is set to '+'. If the condition is not met, and `pixels[0][2]` is 'w', the program skips to the next iteration of the most internal loop. Otherwise, `pixels[0][2]` remains '.', and the values of `n`, `i`, `m`, and `j` remain unchanged.***
