Postcondition: ***`top` is less than or equal to `bottom + 1`, `i` is equal to `bottom + 1`, `left` is less than or equal to `right`, and all elements `result[i][j]` for `j` in the range from `left` to `right` that were originally '.' remain updated to '+'. If `i` is equal to `top`, `bottom`, or `j` is equal to `left` or `right`, then `result[i][j]` is updated to '+'.***
