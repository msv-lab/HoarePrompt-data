To find the impact of the code on the program, we start by determining how the `frame_size` is calculated based on the existing variables:

1. **Input Variables**:
   - `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are used to calculate `frame_size`.

2. **Calculation**:
   - The expression `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y)` calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum coordinates for both x and y. This returns the larger of the two differences.
   - Then, we add 1 to that result to account for the frame size.

3. **Effect on Variables**:
   - The variable `frame_size` will now hold the computed value based on the values of `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y`.

Since we don't have specific values for `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y`, the output state will maintain the ranges of the other variables while indicating the new value of `frame_size`:

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `pixels` must contain at least one 'w', `white_pixels` must be a list containing the coordinates of all 'w' in `pixels`, `min_x` is the minimum x-coordinate of all 'w', `min_y` is the minimum y-coordinate of all 'w', `max_x` is the maximum x-coordinate of all 'w', `max_y` is the maximum y-coordinate of all 'w', `frame_size` is equal to max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1.**
