The value of `top` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 1. Since `top` can be either 1 or equal to `i`, after this assignment, `top` will definitely be equal to 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `top` is 1, `bottom` is 1, `left` is equal to `j`, `right` is equal to `j` if `top` was None, `j` is incremented by 1, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 1, and `screen[i][j]` is 'w'.

Output State: **`top` is 1, `bottom` is 1, `left` is equal to `j`, `right` is equal to `j` if `top` was None, `j` is incremented by 1, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 1, and `screen[i][j]` is 'w'**.
