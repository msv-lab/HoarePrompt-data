Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `top` is 0, `bottom` is None, `left` is None, `right` is None, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and the element at `screen[0][0]` is equal to 'w'. If the current value of `i` is less than `top`, then the execution continues with that condition satisfied.***
