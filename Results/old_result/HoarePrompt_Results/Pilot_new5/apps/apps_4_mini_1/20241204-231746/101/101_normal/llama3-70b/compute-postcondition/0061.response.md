The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables directly; it merely skips the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, the variables `n`, `i`, `m`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
