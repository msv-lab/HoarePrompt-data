The code assigns the value of `i` to `bottom`. The initial state specifies that `i` is 1. Therefore, `bottom` will be updated to 1, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The output state reflects the updated values, confirming that `bottom` is now equal to `i`.

Output State: **`top` is either 1 or equal to `i`, `bottom` is 1, `left` is equal to `j`, `right` is equal to `j` if `top` was None, `j` is incremented by 1, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `screen[i][j]` is 'w' if `i` is less than `top`, and `bottom` is now 1.**
