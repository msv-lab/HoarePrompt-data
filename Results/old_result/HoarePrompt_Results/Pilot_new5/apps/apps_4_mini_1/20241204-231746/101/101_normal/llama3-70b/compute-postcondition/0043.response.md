According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. For the loop to execute, `m` must be at least 1. Since the current state indicates that `m` is greater than or equal to 0, it could be 0, which would prevent the loop from executing. To ensure that the loop can execute, `m` should be adjusted to be at least 1. The variable `j` will start at 0 when the loop begins its first iteration.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `i` is 1, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 0**
