Postcondition: ***If `top` is None, `top` is 2, `bottom` is 2, `left` is 1, `right` is 1, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, and `j` is 1. Otherwise, `top` is 2, `bottom` is 2, `right` is 1, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 1, and if `j` is greater than `right`, which is 0, `right` is updated to 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. If `j` is not greater than `right`, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
