Functionality: ** The function accepts two integer parameters, `n` (number of rows) and `m` (number of columns), along with a list of strings `screen` representing a grid of pixels. It identifies the smallest rectangle that contains all 'w' (white pixel) characters in the grid. If no 'w' characters are found or if the rectangle formed has a height or width less than 2, it returns -1. Otherwise, it modifies the boundaries of this rectangle to replace '.' (black pixels) with '+' and returns the updated grid. The function ensures that `screen` has at least one 'w' character, as guaranteed by the input conditions. **
