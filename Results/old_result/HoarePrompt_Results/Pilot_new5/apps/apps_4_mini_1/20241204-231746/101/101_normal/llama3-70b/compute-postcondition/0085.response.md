The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Therefore, the current values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 1, and `j` is 2; continue has been executed, skipping the current iteration of the loop.**
