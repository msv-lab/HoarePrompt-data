The code assigns the value of `j` to `right`. The initial value of `j` is 0, so after executing the code, `right` will also be set to 0. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`top` is 2, `bottom` is 2, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 1, `j` is 0, the value of `screen[2][0]` is 'w', the current value of `j` is greater than `right`.**
