According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `white_pixels` list. If `white_pixels` contains at least three tuples representing coordinates of 'w', the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `white_pixels` contains at least two tuples, indicating that at least two coordinates were processed. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `white_pixels` must contain at least three tuples. 

Since the loop iterates over each tuple in `white_pixels`, after processing the last tuple, the next iteration will access the third tuple in the list. Thus, the updated state would reflect that `x` and `y` correspond to the coordinates of the third tuple.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `pixels` must contain at least one 'w', `white_pixels` must be a list containing at least 3 tuples representing coordinates of 'w', `min_x` is updated to min(previous min_x, x), `min_y` is updated to min(previous min_y, y), `max_x` is updated to max(previous max_x, x), `max_y` is updated to max(previous max_y, y)**
