According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `pixels`. If `pixels` has at least 2 rows, the loop will execute again for the second row. At the end of the last iteration, `pixels` must have at least 1 row, and `row` is now a string formed by joining the elements of the first row in `pixels`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `pixels` must have at least 2 rows, and `row` will be the string formed by joining the elements of the second row in `pixels`.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `pixels` must have at least 2 rows, `row` is the string formed by joining the elements of the second row in `pixels`**
