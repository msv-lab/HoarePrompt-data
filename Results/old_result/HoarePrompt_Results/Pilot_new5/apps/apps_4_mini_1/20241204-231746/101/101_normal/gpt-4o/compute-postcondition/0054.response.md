The value of `left` is assigned the value of `j`, and `right` is also assigned the value of `j`. The previous states of the variables indicate that `left` and `right` are both `None` before this assignment. After the execution, both `left` and `right` will have the same value as `j`, while the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `top` is 1, `bottom` is 1, `left` is equal to `j`, `right` is equal to `j`, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, and the current value of screen[i][j] is 'w'.

Output State: **`top` is 1, `bottom` is 1, `left` is equal to `j`, `right` is equal to `j`, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, and the current value of screen[i][j] is 'w'.**
