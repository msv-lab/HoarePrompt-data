Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 2000, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, and `j` is 2. If the condition is met (either `i` equals `min_x`, `max_x`, `j` equals `min_y`, or `max_y` and `pixels[1][2]` is '.'), then `pixels[1][2]` is updated to '+'. Otherwise, if `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', the loop continues to the next iteration. If `pixels[i][j]` is not 'w', then `pixels[1][2]` remains '.', and the loop proceeds with the current values of `n`, `i`, `m`, and `j`.***
