According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `white_pixels` list, which must contain at least one more tuple for the loop to run again. At the end of the last iteration, `white_pixels` contains at least one tuple representing coordinates of 'w', and `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` have been updated based on the last processed pixel coordinates `(x, y)`.

Since the loop processes each tuple in `white_pixels`, to execute one more time, the next iteration will access the next tuple in the list. Therefore, if `white_pixels` has at least one more tuple after the last processed one, we can determine the new state.

Let's assume that the loop has processed the first tuple in `white_pixels`, which corresponds to the coordinates `(x, y)`. For the loop to execute one more time, the state needs to reflect the next coordinates in the `white_pixels` list.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `pixels` must contain at least one 'w', `white_pixels` must be a list containing at least two tuples representing coordinates of 'w', `min_x` is updated to min(min_x, x), `min_y` is updated to min(min_y, y), `max_x` is updated to max(max_x, x), `max_y` is updated to max(max_y, y)**
