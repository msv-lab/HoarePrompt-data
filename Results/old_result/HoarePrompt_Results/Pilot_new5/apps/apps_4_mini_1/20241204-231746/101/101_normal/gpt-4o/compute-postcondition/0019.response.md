Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, `left` is 0, `right` is None, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and the element at `screen[0][0]` is equal to 'w'. Since the condition `j > right` evaluates to false (as `j` is 0 and `right` is None), the state remains unchanged.***
