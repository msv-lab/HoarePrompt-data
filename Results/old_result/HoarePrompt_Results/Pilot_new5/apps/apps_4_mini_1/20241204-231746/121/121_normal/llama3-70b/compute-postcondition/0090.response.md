Postcondition: ***`res` is a string containing characters from `s` with '?' replaced by characters from 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' based on their availability, `count['A']`, `count['C']`, `count['G']`, and `count['T']` reflect their final decremented values, `count['?']` remains 0, `avg` is equal to `n // 4`, and all values in `count` are 0 (meaning there are no remaining counts for 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T').***
