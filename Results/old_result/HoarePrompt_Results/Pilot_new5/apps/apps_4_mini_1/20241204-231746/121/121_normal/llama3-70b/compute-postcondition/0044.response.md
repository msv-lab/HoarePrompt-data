Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 255 and `s` is a string of length `n`. If `c` is '?', then `count['A']`, `count['C']`, `count['G']`, and `count['T']` are all less than or equal to `avg` (where `avg` is `n // 4`), `count['?']` remains 0, and `res` contains the first `n // 4` valid characters from 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' in the order they were available from `count`. Otherwise, if `c` is not equal to '?', `count['A']`, `count['C']`, `count['G']`, and `count['T']` are unchanged, `count['?']` remains 0, `avg` is still equal to `n // 4`, and `res` is updated to equal `c`.***
