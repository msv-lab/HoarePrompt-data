Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 255; `s` is a string of length `n`; `count['A']` is `avg - count['A']`; `count['C']` is `avg - count['C']`; `count['G']` is `avg - count['G']`; `count['T']` is `avg - count['T']`; `count['?']` is 0; `avg` is equal to `n // 4`; `res` is equal to `nc`; the current value of `c` is '?'; if `count[nc]` is greater than 0, then `count[nc]` is decreased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the previous conditions remain unchanged as there is no else part.***
