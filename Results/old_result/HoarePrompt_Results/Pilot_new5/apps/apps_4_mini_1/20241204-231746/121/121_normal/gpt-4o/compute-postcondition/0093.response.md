Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `s` is a string of length `n`, and `counts` reflects the counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' such that each count is equal to or less than `target_count`. If `result[i]` is '?', then `result` contains the characters that were added during the loop iterations, and `i` is the index after all necessary characters have been added to `result`.***
