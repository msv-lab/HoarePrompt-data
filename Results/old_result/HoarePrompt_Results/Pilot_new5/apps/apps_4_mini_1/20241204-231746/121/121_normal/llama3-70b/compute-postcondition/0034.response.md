The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 255, `s` is a string of length `n`, `count['A']` is `avg - count['A']`, `count['C']` is `avg - count['C'] - 1`, `count['G']` is `avg - count['G']`, `count['T']` is `avg - count['T']`, `count['?']` is 0, `avg` is equal to `n // 4`, `res` is equal to `2 * nc`, `c` is '?', `nc` is 'C', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
