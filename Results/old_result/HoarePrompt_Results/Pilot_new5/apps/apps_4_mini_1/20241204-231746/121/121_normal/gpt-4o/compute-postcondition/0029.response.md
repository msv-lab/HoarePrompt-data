Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `s` is a string of length `n`, `counts` contains exactly 4 elements corresponding to the counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', and `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`. If `counts[char]` is greater than `target_count`, the function returns nothing. Otherwise, the condition for the else part is not applicable.***
