The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `s` is a string of length `n`, `counts` has at least `n + 2` characters, `char` is the next character in `counts`, `i` remains `n`, `result[n]` is assigned the value of `char`, `counts[char]` has been incremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
