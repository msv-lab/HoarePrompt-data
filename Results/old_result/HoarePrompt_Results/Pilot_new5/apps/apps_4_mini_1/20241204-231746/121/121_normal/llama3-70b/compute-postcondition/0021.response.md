To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished executing, we analyze the given initial state and the operations performed in the loop.

### Given Initial State:
- `n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 255.
- `s` is a string of length `n`.
- `count['A']` is the number of occurrences of 'A' in `s`.
- `count['C']` is the number of occurrences of 'C' in `s`.
- `count['G']` is the number of occurrences of 'G' in `s`.
- `count['T']` is the number of occurrences of 'T' in `s`.
- `count['?']` remains 0.
- `avg` is equal to `n // 4`.

### Code of the loop:
```python
for c in 'ACGT':
    count[c] = avg - count[c]
```

### Output State After All Iterations of the Loop:
The loop iterates over the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'. For each character `c`, the value of `count[c]` is updated to be `avg - count[c]`. 

After executing the loop for all characters in 'ACGT', the values of `count['A']`, `count['C']`, `count['G']`, and `count['T']` will be as follows:
- `count['A']` will become `avg - count['A']`, which is `avg - (number of A's in s)`.
- `count['C']` will become `avg - count['C']`, which is `avg - (number of C's in s)`.
- `count['G']` will become `avg - count['G']`, which is `avg - (number of G's in s)`.
- `count['T']` will become `avg - count['T']`, which is `avg - (number of T's in s)`.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop, the output state will be:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 255, `s` is a string of length `n`, `count['A']` is `avg - count['A']`, `count['C']` is `avg - count['C']`, `count['G']` is `avg - count['G']`, `count['T']` is `avg - count['T']`, `count['?']` remains 0, `avg` is equal to `n // 4.`**
