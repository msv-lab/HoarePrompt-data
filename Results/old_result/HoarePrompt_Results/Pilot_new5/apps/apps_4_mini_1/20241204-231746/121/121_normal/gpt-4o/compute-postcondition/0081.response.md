Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `s` is a string of length `n`, and `counts` contains 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' with counts less than or equal to `target_count`. If `counts[char]` is less than `target_count`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. There is no else part in the code.***
