The variable `target_count` is assigned the value of `n // 4`. Since `n` is the integer value of `int(data[0])` and is a multiple of 4, `target_count` will be an integer that represents one-fourth of `n`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the integer value of `int(data[0])`, `s` is the string value of `data[1]` of length `n`, `data` is a list of strings resulting from splitting the input, and `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `int(data[0])`, `s` is the string value of `data[1]` of length `n`, `data` is a list of strings resulting from splitting the input, `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`.**
