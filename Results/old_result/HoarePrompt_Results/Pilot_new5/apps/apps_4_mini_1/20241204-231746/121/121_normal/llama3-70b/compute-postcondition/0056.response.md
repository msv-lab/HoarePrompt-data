Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 255, `s` is a string of length `n`, `c` is the next character from `s`, and `count['?']` remains 0. If `count['C']` is greater than 0, `res` is updated to include 'AC' if it previously included 'A', `count['C']` is now one less than its previous value, and if `count['A']` was greater than 0, then `count['A']` is also now one less than its previous value; if `count['A']` is less than or equal to 0, no changes are made to `res`, `count['A']`, or the internal loop. Otherwise, no changes are made to `res`, `count['A']`, or `count['C']`.***
