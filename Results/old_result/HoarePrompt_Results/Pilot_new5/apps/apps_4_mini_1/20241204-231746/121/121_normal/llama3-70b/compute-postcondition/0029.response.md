The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 255; `s` is a string of length `n`; `count['A']` is `avg - count['A']`; `count['C']` is `avg - count['C']`; `count['G']` is `avg - count['G']`; `count['T']` is `avg - count['T']`; `count['?']` is 0; `avg` is equal to `n // 4`; `res` is equal to `nc`; the current value of `c` is '?'; `count[nc]` is equal to its previous value minus 1, and `count[nc]` is greater than 0 before the operation and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
