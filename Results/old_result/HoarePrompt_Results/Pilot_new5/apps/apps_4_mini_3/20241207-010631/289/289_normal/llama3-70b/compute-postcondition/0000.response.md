In this case, the variable `n` is reassigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `n` will take a new integer value based on user input. The initial condition indicates that `n` is already an integer within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, but after running the code, `n` will reflect the new integer input provided by the user. Other variables or states remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer that takes a new input value.**
