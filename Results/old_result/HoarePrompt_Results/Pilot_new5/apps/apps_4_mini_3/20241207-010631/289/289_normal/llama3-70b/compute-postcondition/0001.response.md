The code calls the `bit_length()` method on `n`, which returns the number of bits necessary to represent `n` in binary, excluding the sign bit. The expression `n.bit_length() - 1` will therefore yield the highest bit position (index) that is set to 1 in the binary representation of `n`. The previous value of `n` is retained as the new input value.

Output State: **`n` is an integer that takes a new input value; the output is `n.bit_length() - 1`, which is the highest bit position set in the binary representation of `n`.**
