According to the code, the loop executes over the list `[k, diff // k]`. For the loop to run, we need to consider the values of `k` and `diff`. 

1. `k` is initialized to 1, which is a valid candidate.
2. `diff` is defined as `abs(a - b)`, and since `a` and `b` are integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` will always be a positive integer.
3. The second candidate in the list is `diff // k`, which equals `diff // 1 = diff`. 

Thus, the list of candidates will always contain at least one element (which is `1`), and potentially a second element which is `diff`, depending on its value.

To summarize:
- For the loop to execute, at least one candidate (in this case, `k`) is always present, and since `diff` is guaranteed to be positive, `diff // k` will also be valid. 

Thus, the loop will always have at least one valid candidate, making it executable.

State: **`a` is an integer such that `1 <= a <= 10^9`, `b` is an integer such that `1 <= b <= 10^9`, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is equal to `abs(a - b)`, `min_lcm` is positive infinity, `min_k` is 0, `k` is 1, and `diff` is divisible by `k`, which is guaranteed because `k` is 1.**
