In the code snippet provided, the values of `a` and `b` are updated. The variable `a` is assigned the current value of `b`, and `b` is assigned the result of `a % b`. 

Given the initial state:
- `a` is the current value of `b`, let's denote that value as `b_current`.
- `b` must be adjusted to a non-zero value and still less than `previous_a`, which we will denote as `previous_a`.

After executing the code:
- `a` will now hold the value `b_current`.
- `b` will be updated to the result of `a % b`. Since `a` is `b_current`, we can express `b` as `b_current % b` (considering `b` was adjusted to some valid non-zero value).

We know `b` is a non-zero value and less than `previous_a`, but the exact value of `b` is not specified, so we note it as a valid non-zero value.

Output State: **`a` is `b_current`, `b` is `b_current % b`, and `b` is a non-zero value less than `previous_a`.**
