Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`, `k` is at least 1 and less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1`, `diff` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `candidate` is equal to `diff // k`. If the `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm` or equal to `min_lcm` and `candidate` is less than `min_k`, then `min_lcm` is updated to `current_lcm` and `min_k` is updated to `candidate`. Otherwise, the values of `min_lcm` and `min_k` remain unchanged.***
