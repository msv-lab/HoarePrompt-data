The variable `new_b` is calculated as `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`. Given that `candidate` is equal to `diff // k`, and `diff` is equal to `|a - b|` (the absolute difference between `a` and `b`), we can deduce the value of `new_b`.

The value of `new_b` becomes the multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b`, taking into account the value of `candidate`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`, `k` is at least 1 and less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1`, `diff` is greater than or equal to `k`, `candidate` is equal to `diff // k`, `new_a` is calculated as (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate, and `new_b` is calculated as (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate.**
