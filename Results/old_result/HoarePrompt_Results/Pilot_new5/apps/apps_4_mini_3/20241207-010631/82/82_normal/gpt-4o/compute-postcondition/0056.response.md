Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are integers such that `1 <= a <= 10^9`, `1 <= b <= 10^9`, and `a` is not equal to `b`. If `diff % k == 0`, `k` is incremented by 1 and must be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff))`, resulting in `min_lcm` as the minimum least common multiple calculated from pairs of `new_a` and `new_b`, `min_k` as the candidate that produced `min_lcm`, and `current_lcm` as the least common multiple computed by the last values of `new_a` and `new_b`. If the loop did not execute, then `min_lcm` and `min_k` retain their initial values.***
