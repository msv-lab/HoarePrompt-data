To derive the output state, let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step.

1. The initial state provides the following:
   - `a` is an integer in the range (1 <= a <= 10^9)
   - `b` is an integer in the range (1 <= b <= 10^9) with `a != b`
   - `k` is incremented by 1 and is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff))`, where `diff` is presumably calculated as `abs(a - b)`
   - `candidate` is defined as `diff // k`
   - `new_a` is computed as `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`
   - `new_b` is computed as `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`
   
2. The line of code being executed is:
   ```
   current_lcm = func_2(new_a, new_b)
   ```
   This line will call the function `func_2` with `new_a` and `new_b` as arguments. The result will be assigned to `current_lcm`. However, the exact value of `current_lcm` cannot be determined as we don't have the definition of `func_2`.

3. The variables `new_a` and `new_b` are computed based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `candidate`, which will be updated in output state based on the calculations performed.

Since we cannot determine the specific values of `current_lcm`, we will include the changes made to `new_a` and `new_b`, but we will note that `current_lcm` holds the result of the function without specifying its value.

Output State: **`a` is an integer (1 <= a <= 10^9), `b` is an integer (1 <= b <= 10^9) with `a != b`, `k` is incremented by 1 and is less than or equal to int(math.sqrt(diff)), `candidate` is equal to `diff // k`, `new_a` is calculated as (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate, `new_b` is calculated as (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate, `current_lcm` is assigned the value returned by func_2(new_a, new_b).**
