The function accepts two positive integers `x` and `y` and computes their greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm. The function will return `x`, which will be equal to the GCD when the loop completes, at which point `y` will be 0. It correctly handles large integers up to \(10^9\) but does not account for cases where `x` or `y` is 0, as the GCD is typically defined for positive integers. Therefore, if either input is zero, undefined behavior may occur based on the mathematical definition of GCD.
