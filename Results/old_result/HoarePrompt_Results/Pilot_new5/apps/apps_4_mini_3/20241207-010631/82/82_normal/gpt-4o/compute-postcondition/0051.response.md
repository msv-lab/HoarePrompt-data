To determine the output state, we must analyze the impact of the provided code snippet on the initial state. 

Initial State:
- `a` is an integer (1 <= a <= 10^9)
- `b` is an integer (1 <= b <= 10^9, a != b)
- `k` is incremented by 1 and must be less than or equal to int(math.sqrt(diff))
- `candidate` is equal to k + 1
- `new_b` is calculated as (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate

The line of code executed is:
```
current_lcm = func_2(new_a, new_b)
```

Analysis step-by-step:
1. The variable `new_b` has already been defined, and it is based on the value of `b` and `candidate`.
2. The function `func_2` calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of `new_a` and `new_b`. However, `new_a` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot update or infer its value through this operation. We retain the context that `new_b` was computed using `b` and the `candidate`.
3. The output value of `current_lcm` will depend on `func_2`, which isn't defined here. Therefore, while we can state that `current_lcm` is assigned some value, we cannot define that value. 

Based on the analysis, the only changes we can identify pertain to `current_lcm`, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`a` is an integer (1 <= a <= 10^9), `b` is an integer (1 <= b <= 10^9, a != b), `k` is incremented by 1 and must be less than or equal to int(math.sqrt(diff)), `candidate` is equal to k + 1, `new_b` is calculated as (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate, `current_lcm` is assigned the value from func_2(new_a, new_b).**
