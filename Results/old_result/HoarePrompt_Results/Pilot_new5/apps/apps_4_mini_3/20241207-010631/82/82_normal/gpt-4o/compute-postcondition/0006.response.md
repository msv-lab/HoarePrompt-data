According to the code, the loop will execute based on the value of `diff`. The loop runs for values of `k` starting from 1 up to `int(math.sqrt(diff))`. For the loop to execute at least once, `diff` must be at least 1, which it is since `a` and `b` are different integers and `diff` is equal to `abs(a - b)`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `k` will take values starting from 1, but before the loop begins, `k` should be initialized to its starting value, which is 1. 

Thus, to summarize the necessary states for the loop to execute:

State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9`, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is equal to `abs(a - b)`, `min_lcm` is equal to positive infinity, `min_k` is 0, `k` is 1**
