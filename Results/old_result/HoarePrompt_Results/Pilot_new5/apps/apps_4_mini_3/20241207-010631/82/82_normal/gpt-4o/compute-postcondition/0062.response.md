Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer such that `1 <= a <= 10^9`, `b` is an integer such that `1 <= b <= 10^9`, `a` is not equal to `b`, `k` is at least 1 and less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1`, `diff` is greater than or equal to `k`, `new_a` is equal to `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is equal to `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, the current value of `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, and the current value of `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm` or (current_lcm is equal to `min_lcm` and the current value of `candidate` is less than `min_k`).***
