Output State: **`a` is an integer such that `1 <= a <= 10^9`, `b` is an integer such that `1 <= b <= 10^9`, `a` is not equal to `b`, `current_lcm` is assigned the value of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_lcm` remains unchanged, `min_k` remains unchanged, `candidate` is `diff // k`, `new_a` is calculated as `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is calculated as `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.**
