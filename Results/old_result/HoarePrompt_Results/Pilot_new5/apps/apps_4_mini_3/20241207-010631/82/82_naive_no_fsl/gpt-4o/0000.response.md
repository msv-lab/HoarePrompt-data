To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze its logic against the problem description and evaluate if it handles all potential edge cases.

The problem requires finding the smallest non-negative integer \( k \) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \( a+k \) and \( b+k \) is minimized. If there are multiple values of \( k \) that achieve the same minimum LCM, the smallest \( k \) should be returned.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Handling Equal Inputs**:
    - The program checks if \( a \) and \( b \) are equal. If they are, it returns \( 0 \) immediately. This is correct because the LCM of two equal numbers \( n \) is \( n \), and adding zero does not change the values.

2. **Calculating Differences**:
    - The program calculates the absolute difference \( \text{diff} = |a-b| \). This is an important step because the potential values of \( k \) that could minimize LCM are closely related to this difference.

3. **Iterating Potential Candidates**:
    - The program iterates from \( 1 \) to \( \sqrt{diff} \) to find all divisors of \( \text{diff} \). For each divisor \( k \), it calculates two candidates for \( a+k \) and \( b+k \) based on the divisor, and computes their LCM.
    - The LCM is computed using `func_2`, which employs the GCD calculated by `func_1`.

4. **Finding Minimum LCM and Corresponding k**:
    - The program keeps track of the minimum LCM found and the corresponding \( k \). If it finds a smaller LCM or the same LCM with a smaller \( k \), it updates the results.

### Potential Issues:

1. **Iteration Over Candidates**:
    - The program only considers candidates derived from the divisors of the difference. While this approach may yield the correct result in many cases, it may not account for all possible values of \( k \). Specifically, it misses values of \( k \) greater than the largest divisor of \( \text{diff} \).
    
2. **Edge Cases**:
    - For example, consider \( a = 1 \) and \( b = 10 \). The difference is \( 9 \) with divisors \( 1, 3, 9 \). The program will check for \( k \) values \( 1, 3, \) and \( 9 \), but it may not explore values like \( 0 \) or \( 2 \), which can yield different LCMs. 

3. **No k = 0 Check**:
    - The program does not explicitly consider \( k = 0 \) before starting its loop. Thus, there may be cases where the optimal \( k \) is \( 0 \) but is not checked.

### Example of Failure:

Consider the input pair \( a = 1 \) and \( b = 10 \). The expected optimal \( k \) should be \( 0 \) because:

- \( \text{LCM}(1+0, 10+0) = \text{LCM}(1, 10) = 10 \)
- \( \text{LCM}(1+1, 10+1) = \text{LCM}(2, 11) = 22 \)
- \( \text{LCM}(1+2, 10+2) = \text{LCM}(3, 12) = 12 \)
- Continuing this shows that \( k = 0 \) gives the smallest LCM, which is not considered by the current logic.

### Conclusion:

The program does not check all appropriate values of \( k \), particularly \( k = 0 \) or any values greater than the largest divisor of \( \text{diff} \). This lack of coverage leads to its potential failure for specific inputs.

Correctness: **False**
