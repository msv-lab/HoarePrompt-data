The function `func_3` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are integers, constrained such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\). After executing the function body, if `a` is equal to `b`, the function returns 0, indicating that the values of integers `a` and `b` are equal. In another scenario, the function returns `min_k`, which is a candidate that resulted in the minimum least common multiple of modified values `new_a` and `new_b` from valid candidates, or 0 if no valid candidates were found. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept two integers `a` and `b`, and return 0 if they are equal, or return the minimum candidate leading to the least common multiple of the modified values if they are not equal. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, returns 0 if `a` is equal to `b`. If `a` is not equal to `b`, it returns `min_k`, the minimum candidate resulting in the least common multiple of modified values, or 0 if no valid candidates exist.**
