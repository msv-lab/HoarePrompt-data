To determine the output state after executing the code, let's analyze the provided information step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `a` is an integer such that `1 <= a <= 10^9`
   - `b` is an integer such that `1 <= b <= 10^9`
   - `a` is not equal to `b`
   - `candidate` is equal to `k`
   - `new_a` is equal to `(a + k - 1) // k * k`
   - `new_b` is equal to `(b + k - 1) // k * k`

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The line `current_lcm = func_2(new_a, new_b)` assigns the result of the function `func_2` when called with `new_a` and `new_b` as arguments to the variable `current_lcm`.

3. **Impact Analysis**:
   - The code does not modify the values of `a`, `b`, `k`, `new_a`, or `new_b`. However, it computes a new value, `current_lcm`, which is derived from `new_a` and `new_b`.

4. **Output State**:
   - After executing the code, the preconditions remain largely unchanged except for the addition of the `current_lcm` variable.

Output State: **`a` is an integer such that `1 <= a <= 10^9`, `b` is an integer such that `1 <= b <= 10^9`, `a` is not equal to `b`, `candidate` is `k`, `new_a` is equal to `(a + k - 1) // k * k`, `new_b` is equal to `(b + k - 1) // k * k`, and `current_lcm` is equal to `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.**
