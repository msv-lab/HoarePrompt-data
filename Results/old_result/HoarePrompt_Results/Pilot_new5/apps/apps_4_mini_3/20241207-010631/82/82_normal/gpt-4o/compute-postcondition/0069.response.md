The code assigns the value of `current_lcm` as the result of calling `func_2(new_a, new_b)`. The variables `new_a` and `new_b` are calculated based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `candidate`, but the specific values of `new_a` and `new_b` are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine their exact values or how `func_2` processes them. However, the function call `func_2(new_a, new_b)` implies that `current_lcm` will hold the least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b` after execution.

The states of other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the output state includes all the valid information from the initial state while indicating the assignment of `current_lcm`.

Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`, `k` is at least 1 and less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1`, `diff` is greater than or equal to `k`, `candidate` is calculated as `diff // k`, `new_a` is calculated as `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is calculated as `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`; `current_lcm` is calculated as `func_2(new_a, new_b)`**.
