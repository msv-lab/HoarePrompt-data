The variable `min_lcm` is assigned the value of positive infinity (`float('inf')`). This assignment does not change the values of the other variables `a`, `b`, and `diff`, which remain as integers within their specified range, with `1 <= a, b <= 10^9`, `a` not equal to `b`, and `diff` equal to `abs(a - b)`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9`, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is equal to `abs(a - b)`, and `min_lcm` is equal to positive infinity.**
