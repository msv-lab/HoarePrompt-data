According to the code, the loop iterates over the values in the list `[k, diff // k]`. The `candidate` variable takes on each value sequentially. Since the loop iterates over the values in the list, after the previous iteration has completed, `candidate` would have taken on the last value in the list, which is `diff // k` in the second iteration.

To execute one more time, the loop needs to process the first candidate value, which is `k`. As such, the next state for the loop should indicate that `candidate` is now `k` and the loop is ready to execute for this value.

State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that `1 <= a <= 10^9`, `1 <= b <= 10^9`, `a` is not equal to `b`, `candidate` is `k`**
