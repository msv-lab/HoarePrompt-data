To evaluate the correctness of the provided code based on the problem description and the output hints, we will analyze each function and look for potential edge cases.

### Analysis of the Functions

**Function 1: `func_1`**
```python
def func_1(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x
```
- **Description**: This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm.
- **Edge Cases**: The function correctly handles positive integers, and since both `x` and `y` are required to be positive, there are no issues with edge cases here.

**Function 2: `func_2`**
```python
def func_2(m, a, b):
    g = func_1(a, b)
    if g != 1:
        return func_2(m // g, a // g, b // g) * g
    k = a + b - 1
    if m < k:
        return (m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2
    sum_k = k * (k + 1) // 2
    sum_m = m * (m + 1) // 2 - k * (k - 1) // 2
    return sum_k + sum_m
```
- **Description**: This function calculates the sum of reachable distinct integers by the frog based on the parameters `m`, `a`, and `b`.
- **Edge Cases**: 
  - The function checks if `g` (GCD of `a` and `b`) is not equal to 1, and recursively processes the function. This might cause issues for very large values of `m`, as the recursion could lead to a deep call stack or inefficient computations.
  - The condition `if m < k:` handles cases where the maximum reachable integer is less than the jump parameters combined. However, if `k` is equal to `m`, it still computes correctly.
  - The summation logic appears sound, but we need to ensure that it correctly handles all ranges of `m`.

### Output Hints Verification
- The hints provided alongside the functions indicate that:
  - `func_1` correctly computes the GCD and seems to handle positive integers properly.
  - `func_2` effectively handles cases where `m` is less than `k` and sums up integers correctly.
  
### Conclusion
While the logic in both functions seems robust based on the provided descriptions and hints, potential issues arise primarily from the handling of very large values of `m`, particularly given the constraints \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\). The recursion in `func_2` could lead to inefficiencies or stack overflow in certain edge cases, especially if the value of `g` is large.

### Final Assessment
Upon reviewing the logic and considering the edge cases, it appears that the program does not account for all potential cases, particularly when `m` is significantly large relative to `g`. This could lead to incorrect results or inefficiencies due to excessive recursion.

Correctness: **False**. 

**Explanation**: The recursive approach in `func_2` for very large values of `m` might fail or produce incorrect results, especially since the function depends on the GCD. This could lead to unexpected behavior and does not meet the problem requirements for all potential values.
