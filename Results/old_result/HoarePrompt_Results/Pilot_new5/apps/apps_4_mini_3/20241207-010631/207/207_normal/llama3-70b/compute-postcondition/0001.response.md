The code initializes a list `dp` with `m + 1` elements, all set to `0`. The values of `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as they are positive integers from input. The list `dp` is now populated but its specific values depend on `m`. Since `m` is a positive integer, `dp` will contain `m + 1` zeros.

Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros.**
