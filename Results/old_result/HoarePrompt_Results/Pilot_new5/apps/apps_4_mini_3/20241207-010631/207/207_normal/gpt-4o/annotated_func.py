#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are positive integers.
def func_1(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `y` is 0, `x` is the greatest common divisor of the original values of `x_old` and `y_old`.
    return x
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x_old` and `y_old`, where `y` is 0 and `x` holds that GCD value.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers `x` and `y`, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers. The function correctly handles the calculation using the Euclidean algorithm until `y` becomes 0. There are no apparent edge cases or missing functionality in the provided code, as both parameters are required to be positive integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: m is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9, a is a positive integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^5, and b is a positive integer such that 1 <= b <= 10^5.
def func_2(m, a, b):
    g = func_1(a, b)
    if (g != 1) :
        return func_2(m // g, a // g, b // g) * g
        #The program returns the result of func_2 with parameters (m // g), (a // g), and (b // g), all multiplied by g, where g is the output of func_1(a, b) and g is not equal to 1.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9; `a` is a positive integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^5; `b` is a positive integer such that 1 <= b <= 10^5; `g` is equal to 1, which is the output of `func_1(a, b)`
    k = a + b - 1
    if (m < k) :
        return (m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2
        #The program returns the result of (m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2, where m is a positive integer such that 1 <= m < k, and k = a + b - 1.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9; `a` is a positive integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^5; `b` is a positive integer such that 1 <= b <= 10^5; `g` is equal to 1; `k` is equal to `a + b - 1`; `m` is greater than or equal to `k`
    sum_k = k * (k + 1) // 2
    sum_m = m * (m + 1) // 2 - k * (k - 1) // 2
    return sum_k + sum_m
    #The program returns the sum of sum_k and sum_m, where sum_k is equal to k times (k + 1) divided by 2, and sum_m is equal to m times (m + 1) divided by 2 minus k times (k - 1) divided by 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three positive integer parameters `m`, `a`, and `b`. It calculates the greatest common divisor `g` of `a` and `b` using `func_1`. If `g` is not equal to 1, it recursively calls itself with `m` divided by `g`, `a` divided by `g`, and `b` divided by `g`, and multiplies the result by `g`. If `m` is less than `k` (where `k = a + b - 1`), it returns the sum of the first `m` positive integers. Otherwise, it calculates the sum of the first `k` integers and the adjusted sum of the first `m` integers, returning their total. The function handles cases where `m` is less than `k` and where the recursion occurs when `g` is greater than 1.
