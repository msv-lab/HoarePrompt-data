The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `m`, `a`, and `b`. Here are the details regarding the parameters and the return values:

1. `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\).
2. `a` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^5\).
3. `b` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 10^5\).

Based on the output:

- **Case 1**: If a certain condition is met (specifically, if \(g\), the output of `func_1(a, b)`, is not equal to 1), the function returns the result of `func_2` with parameters \((m // g)\), \((a // g)\), and \((b // g)\), all multiplied by \(g\).
  
- **Case 2**: If \(m\) is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m < k\) (where \(k = a + b - 1\)), the function returns the result of the formula \((m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2\).

- **Case 3**: The function returns the sum of `sum_k` and `sum_m`, where:
  - `sum_k` is equal to \(k \times (k + 1) / 2\).
  - `sum_m` is equal to \(m \times (m + 1) / 2 - k \times (k - 1) / 2\).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept three positive integers \(m\), \(a\), and \(b\) and return a value based on conditional logic that involves calculations related to those parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters m, a, and b (all positive integers) and returns different results based on conditional checks involving these parameters and their relationships.**
