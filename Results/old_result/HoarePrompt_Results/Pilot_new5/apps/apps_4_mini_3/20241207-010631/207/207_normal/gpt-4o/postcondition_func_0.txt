The function accepts two positive integers `x` and `y`, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers. The function correctly handles the calculation using the Euclidean algorithm until `y` becomes 0. There are no apparent edge cases or missing functionality in the provided code, as both parameters are required to be positive integers.
