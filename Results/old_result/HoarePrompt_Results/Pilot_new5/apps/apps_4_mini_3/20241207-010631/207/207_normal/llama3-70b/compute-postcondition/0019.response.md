Postcondition: ***`m`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers, and `i` is 0. If `i - b` is greater than or equal to 0, there is no change to the program state due to an out-of-bounds access on `dp`. If `i + a` is less than or equal to `m`, then `dp[a]` is updated to `dp[a] + dp[0]`. Otherwise, there is no change in the program state.***
