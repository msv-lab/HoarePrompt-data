To assess the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we first analyze the code in detail and compare it against the requirements.

### Problem Description
The problem requires us to compute the number of distinct integers a frog can reach using two types of jumps (forward by `a` and backward by `b`) starting from position `0`, and then to calculate the sum of these counts for all integers from `0` to `m`.

### Code Analysis
```python
def func():
    (m, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    dp = [0] * (m + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    for i in range(m + 1):
        if i + a <= m:
            dp[i + a] += dp[i]
        if i - b >= 0:
            dp[i] += dp[i - b]
    print(sum(dp))
```

1. **Dynamic Programming Array (`dp`)**:
   - `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to reach position `i`.
   - `dp[0]` is initialized to `1` since the frog starts at position `0`.

2. **Forward and Backward Jumps**:
   - The code correctly implements the two jump types:
     - `i + a <= m` allows the frog to jump forward.
     - `i - b >= 0` allows it to jump backward.

3. **Counting Distinct Positions**:
   - The final result printed is the sum of all positions reachable from `0` to `m`, which is represented by the sum of the `dp` array.

### Potential Edge Cases
- The program does not effectively handle the situation where it may encounter large values for `m`, as `dp` will attempt to allocate a list of size `m + 1`, which may lead to memory issues (especially for `m` nearing `10^9`).
- The logic for counting reachable positions using backward jumps may be flawed. Specifically, the second condition `dp[i] += dp[i - b]` increments the current position's count based on the previous position. This is unnecessary, as it counts the ways multiple times without distinguishing unique reachable integers.

### Output Hints Analysis
- The output hints indicate that the function calculates the number of ways to reach each index from `0` to `m` based on the defined steps. However, this does not align with the problem that requires summing `f(i)`, the number of distinct integers the frog can reach.
- The hints suggest the function prints the total number of ways to reach index `m`, which diverges from the requirement to calculate `f(i)` for all `i` from `0` to `m`.

### Conclusion
The code does not maintain the integrity of the problem description, particularly in terms of efficiently calculating the number of distinct integers reachable. Additionally, the memory consumption for very large `m` is not addressed, leading to potential execution failures. Therefore, the correctness of the program based on the problem description is:

Correctness: **False**.

The program fails to accurately calculate the required sums and potentially runs into memory issues for large inputs.
