To verify the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze both the program and the requirements carefully.

### Problem Description Summary
1. A frog can jump from position `k` to `k+a` or `k-b` on the number line.
2. We need to calculate `f(x)`, the number of distinct integers the frog can reach starting from `0` and staying within the interval `[0, x]`.
3. Our goal is to compute the sum `âˆ‘ f(i)` for `i` from `0` to `m`.

### Program Analysis
1. **Function `func_1(x, y)`** computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. This is a mathematical operation and is correctly implemented.
  
2. **Function `func_2(m, a, b)`**:
   - It first computes the GCD of `a` and `b`. If `g` is not `1`, it recursively calls itself with reduced parameters (`m // g`, `a // g`, `b // g`) and multiplies the result by `g`. This part is supposed to simplify the problem using the properties of GCD.
   - If `g == 1`, it checks if `m < k`, where `k = a + b - 1`. If so, it returns the sum of integers up to `m`, which counts all integers from `0` to `m`, as the frog can reach all positions in this range if `m` is less than `k`.
   - If `m >= k`, it calculates two sums: `sum_k` is the sum of numbers from `0` to `k`, and `sum_m` is the sum of numbers from `0` to `m` minus the sum of numbers from `0` to `k-1`. This calculation reflects the number of distinct reachable integers up to `m`.

### Key Observations
- The recursive structure in `func_2` suggests an intention to reduce the problem size by the GCD, which could be appropriate in cases where `a` and `b` share common factors.
- The calculations of the sums are based on mathematical formulas for the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, which is correct in general.
- However, the relationship between the sums and the distinct integers reachable by the frog is not explicitly validated against the jumps allowed by `k+a` and `k-b`.

### Potential Issues
1. The function calculates sums based on `k` and `m` but does not sufficiently validate whether `f(i)` for `i` in `[0, m]` aligns with the actual reachable integers from the jumps allowed by `a` and `b`.
2. Edge cases where `a` is very small relative to `b`, or vice versa, might lead to incorrect counting of reachable integers. The jumps could lead to situations where certain integers are reachable that would not be captured by a simple sum calculation.

### Conclusion
The program does not rigorously ensure that it counts all distinct integers reachable based on the jump mechanics described. Specifically, it assumes that by calculating sums using `k` and `m`, it captures the essence of the frog's reachable positions, but this is not guaranteed to hold for all inputs.

Hence, the program does not satisfy the problem description in all cases.
