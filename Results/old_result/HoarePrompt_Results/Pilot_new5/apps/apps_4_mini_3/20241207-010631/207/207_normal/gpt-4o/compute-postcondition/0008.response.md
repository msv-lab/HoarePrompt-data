The value of `sum_k` is assigned the value of `k * (k + 1) // 2`. The variable `k` is equal to `a + b - 1`, which is a positive integer because both `a` and `b` are positive integers within their respective ranges. Therefore, `k` will also be a positive integer. The calculation for `sum_k` will yield a positive integer value as well since it's computed using a valid formula for the sum of the first `k` integers. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9; `a` is a positive integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^5; `b` is a positive integer such that 1 <= b <= 10^5; `g` is equal to 1; `k` is equal to `a + b - 1`; `m` is greater than or equal to `k`; `sum_k` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2`.**
