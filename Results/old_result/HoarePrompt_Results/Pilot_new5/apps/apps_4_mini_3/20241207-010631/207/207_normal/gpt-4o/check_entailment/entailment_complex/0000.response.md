To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze how the program operates and whether it covers all cases specified in the problem.

The problem requires the calculation of the sum of reachable integers by a frog starting from position 0 and making jumps of size `a` to the right or `b` to the left, constrained within the interval `[0, x]` for each integer `x` from `0` to `m`.

### Analysis of the Code

1. **Function `func_1(x, y)`**: This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm. It does not contain any edge cases since it only works with positive integers. 

2. **Function `func_2(m, a, b)`**: 
   - It first computes the GCD of `a` and `b`. If `g` (the GCD) is not equal to 1, it recursively calls itself with reduced values of `m`, `a`, and `b`, multiplied by `g`. This is a form of optimization to handle common factors.
   - If `m < k` (where `k = a + b - 1`), it returns the sum of the first `m` integers, which is indeed `1 + 2 + ... + m = (m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2`.
   - If `m` is greater than or equal to `k`, it calculates the sum of the first `k` integers and the adjusted sum of the first `m` integers.

### Possible Issues

While the program seems to handle the cases mentioned in the problem, let's critically assess if it meets the requirement to find the correct sum of reachable integers:

- The logic for calculating reachable integers seems valid when `m < k`. However, in the case where `m >= k`, the algorithm assumes that counting integers up to `k` and adjusting for the total count up to `m` will yield the correct number of reachable integers. This may not accurately reflect the total reachable integers for larger values of `m` where the jump mechanics allow the frog to reach additional integers.

- The recursive division by `g` (GCD) may lead to a scenario where the function does not correctly account for all reachable integers, especially if `m` is a multiple of `g`. The logic might miss certain reachable integers that depend on `a` and `b` in a more complex manner than a simple summation.

### Edge Case Example

Consider the input where:
- `m = 6`
- `a = 4`
- `b = 5`

By manual calculation:
- `f(0) = 1` (only 0)
- `f(1) = 1` (only 0)
- `f(2) = 1` (only 0)
- `f(3) = 1` (only 0)
- `f(4) = 1` (only 0)
- `f(5) = 3` (reachable: 0, 4, 5)
- `f(6) = 3` (reachable: 0, 4, 5)

The expected sum is `1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 10`, which matches the example output. 

However, when we consider cases where a wide range is covered by `a` and `b`, and when multiple iterations of jumps can result in combinations of reachable integers, the function's summation logic may not fully encapsulate the reachable integers due to the simplifications made.

### Conclusion

The program fails to guarantee correctness for every potential case, particularly when larger ranges and combinations of `a` and `b` come into play. 

Thus, the evaluation yields the following conclusion:

Correctness: **False** 

The program does not handle cases where the combinations of jumps can reach integers not accounted for by the summation logic, potentially missing reachable integers based on the constraints provided.
