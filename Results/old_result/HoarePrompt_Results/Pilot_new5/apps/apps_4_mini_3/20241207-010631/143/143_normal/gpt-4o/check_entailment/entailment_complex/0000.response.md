To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program carefully.

**Program Logic:**
1. The program reads the number of types of bottles (`n`) and the required amount of lemonade (`L`).
2. It reads the costs of each type of bottle into the `costs` list.
3. The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the minimum cost required to acquire at least `L` liters of lemonade.
4. The program uses dynamic programming to determine the minimum cost for each possible volume of lemonade that can be purchased using the available bottle types.
5. The volume of each type of bottle is calculated as \(2^i - 1\) for the \(i\)-th type, and it considers that the number of bottles is infinite.
6. The function accumulates costs while ensuring that it doesn't exceed the required amount of lemonade.

**Key Steps in the Function:**
- It initializes an array `dp` with a high cost value to represent the minimum cost of obtaining each volume of lemonade up to the maximum possible (30 types of bottles).
- It updates this array based on the costs of the provided bottle types.
- It evaluates the cost of purchasing bottles of different volumes, ensuring to minimize costs while accommodating the need for at least `L` liters.

**Evaluation Against the Problem Description:**
- The program correctly calculates the minimum cost to obtain at least `L` liters by considering both the costs of bottles and the exponential growth of bottle volumes.
- It handles cases where `L` might be large and ensures that the solution is optimal by leveraging previous computations through dynamic programming.

**Conclusion:**
The program satisfies the requirements of the problem description. It takes into account the different volumes and costs of the lemonade bottles, calculates the possible combinations, and returns the minimum cost to buy at least the required amount of lemonade.

Thus, the correctness of the program can be confirmed:

Correctness: **True**
