`dp[0]` is assigned the value `0`. The variable `dp` is a list of `L + 1` elements initially set to `float('inf')`, which means all elements of `dp` are infinite except for `dp[0]`, which is now `0`. The states of the other variables, `n`, `L`, `c`, and `costs`, remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30; `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9; `c` is a list of `n` positive integers where each integer `c[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ c[i] ≤ 10^9; `costs` is a list of integers derived from input; `dp` is a list of `L + 1` elements where `dp[0]` is 0 and all other elements are `float('inf')`.**
