Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 30`, `L` is a positive integer such that `L ≥ 2`, `c` is a list of `n` positive integers, `costs` is a list of integers, `j` is `n`, and `vol` is 2. If `vol` is less than or equal to `i`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the sum of `dp[i - 2]` and `costs[n]`.***
