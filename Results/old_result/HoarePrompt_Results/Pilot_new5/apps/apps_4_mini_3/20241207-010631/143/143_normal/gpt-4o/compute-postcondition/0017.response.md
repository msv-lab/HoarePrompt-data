The variable `answer` is assigned the value of `max_cost`. There are no conditions or calculations affecting other variables in the provided code snippet. The values of `n`, `i`, and `dp` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the assignment. Thus, the output state reflects the unchanged values along with the updated value of `answer`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 30); `i` is 31; for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `dp[i]` has been updated to `min(dp[i], c[i])`; for `i` from `n` to 30, `dp[i]` is updated to `min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] * 2)`, where `dp[i]` was previously `max_cost`; `answer` is `max_cost`**
