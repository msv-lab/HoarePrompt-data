The variable `current_cost` is incremented by the value of `dp[i]`. The value of `i` is 29, so `current_cost` becomes `current_cost + dp[29]`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 30), `i` is 29, `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + dp[29]`, `dp` is updated accordingly, `answer` is updated to min(previous answer, current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[i])**
