The code initializes a list `dp` with 31 elements, each set to the value of `max_cost`. The initial state does not affect the values of `n`, `L`, `costs`, and `max_cost`, but it changes the state of the variable `dp`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 30), `L` is a positive integer (1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9), `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each `c_i` is a positive integer (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9), `max_cost` is 10^18, `dp` is a list of 31 integers where each element is equal to `max_cost`.**
