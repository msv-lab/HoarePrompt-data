Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n`, a positive integer `L`, and a list of positive integers `costs`. It computes and returns the minimum cost based on a dynamic programming approach, where it considers both the costs provided in the list and the doubling of previous costs. The function effectively handles cases where `L` may be greater than the maximum representable value based on the number of bits calculated in the iterations. It ensures that the output reflects the minimum accumulated cost while adjusting for the available budget `L`. **
