The loop iterates from 1 to 30, updating the values of `dp[i]` based on the minimum of the current value and twice the value of the previous index. The updates only affect indices from `n` to 30, since `dp[i]` for `i` from 0 to `n-1` has already been updated to `min(dp[i], c[i])`.

After all iterations of the loop have executed, the following holds true:

1. `n` is an integer in the range from 1 to 30.
2. The variable `i` will take on the value 31 after the loop has completed, although there is no `dp[31]`.
3. The values of `dp[i]` for `i` from 0 to `n-1` have been updated to `min(dp[i], c[i])`.
4. The values of `dp[i]` for `i` from `n` to 30 will be updated based on the previous values, specifically `dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] * 2)`.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop, the final state of the variables is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 30); `i` is 31; for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `dp[i]` has been updated to `min(dp[i], c[i])`; for `i` from `n` to 30, `dp[i]` is updated to `min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] * 2)`, where `dp[i]` was previously `max_cost`.**
