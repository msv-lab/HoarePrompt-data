The code appends a list of `max_cost` values to the existing `costs` list, ensuring that the resulting list `c` has a total length of 31. Since `costs` contains `n` integers and `n` is between 1 and 30, the number of `max_cost` values added will be `31 - n`.

The value of `c` will thus consist of the original `costs` values followed by `(31 - n)` times `max_cost`. 

The variables that are affected are `c`, which will now hold the new list, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 30), `L` is a positive integer (1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9), `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each `c_i` is a positive integer (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9), `max_cost` is 10^18, `dp` is a list of 31 integers where each element is equal to `max_cost`, `c` is a list of 31 integers consisting of the original `costs` followed by `(31 - n)` times `max_cost`.**
