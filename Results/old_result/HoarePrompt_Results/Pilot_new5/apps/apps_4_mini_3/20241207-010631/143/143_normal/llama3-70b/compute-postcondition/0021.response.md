The variable `j` is currently 0. The expression `2 ** j - 1` will be evaluated. Since `j` is 0, `2 ** j` equals `2 ** 0`, which is 1. Therefore, `vol` will be assigned the value `1 - 1`, which equals `0`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `L` is a positive integer such that `L` ≥ 2, `c` is a list of `n` positive integers, `costs` is a list of integers, `dp` is updated such that `dp[1]` contains the minimum cost to achieve the volume of `1` using the first `n` items, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `vol` is 0.**
