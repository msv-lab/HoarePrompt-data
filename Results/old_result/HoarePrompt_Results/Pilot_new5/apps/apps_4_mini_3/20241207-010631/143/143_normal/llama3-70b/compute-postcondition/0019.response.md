According to the code, the loop iterates from `1` to `L`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `L`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, which means the next value of `i` will be 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `L` must be at least 2 since `i` will increase by 1 with each iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, `L` is a positive integer such that L ≥ 2, `c` is a list of `n` positive integers, `costs` is a list of integers, `dp` is updated such that dp[1] contains the minimum cost to achieve the volume of `1` using the first `n` items, `i` is 2.**
