The expression `L -= 1 << i` means that `L` is decreased by `1` shifted left by `i` bits. Given that `i` is currently `30`, `1 << i` is equal to `1 << 30`, which is `1073741824`. Thus, `L` becomes `L - 1073741824`.

Since `L` was previously greater than or equal to `1 << 30` (which is `1073741824`), after the operation, `L` will be reduced to a value that is still greater than or equal to `0` (since `L` must have been at least `1073741824` before the operation).

The other variables (`n`, `dp`, `answer`, `current_cost`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 30), `i` is 30, `dp` is updated accordingly, `answer` is `max_cost`, `current_cost` is the previous value plus `dp[30]`, `L` is L - 1073741824 (still ≥ 0)**.
