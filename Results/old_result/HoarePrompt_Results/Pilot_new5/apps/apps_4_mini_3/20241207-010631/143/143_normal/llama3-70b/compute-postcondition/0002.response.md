The variable `dp` is assigned a list containing `L + 1` elements, each initialized to `float('inf')`. The precondition states that `L` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq L \leq 10^9\), implying that the list will have a length of at least 2 and up to \(10^9 + 1\). The other variables (`n`, `c`, and `costs`) are not altered by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30; `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9; `c` is a list of `n` positive integers where each integer `c[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ c[i] ≤ 10^9; `costs` is a list of integers derived from input; `dp` is a list of `L + 1` elements initialized to `float('inf')`.**
