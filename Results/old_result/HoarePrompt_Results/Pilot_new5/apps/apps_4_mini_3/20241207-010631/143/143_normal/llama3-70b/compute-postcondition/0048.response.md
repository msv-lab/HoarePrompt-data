Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `L` is a positive integer such that `L` ≥ 3, `c` is a list of `n` positive integers, `costs` is a list of integers, `dp[2]` contains the minimum cost to achieve the volume of 2 using the first `n` items, and `dp[3]` is updated to reflect the minimum cost to achieve the volume of 3 using the first `n` items, considering all valid `vol` values derived from `2 ** j - 1` for `j` in the range of `0` to `n-1`. If no `vol` values are less than or equal to `i`, then `dp[3]` remains unchanged from its initial value.**
