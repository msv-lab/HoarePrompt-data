The statement `L -= 1 << i` means that `L` is decremented by `2^i`, where `i` is 29. Thus, `L` is reduced by `2^29`, which is 536870912. The other variables `n`, `current_cost`, `dp`, and `answer` are not directly affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 30), `i` is 29, `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + dp[29]`, `dp` is updated accordingly, `answer` is updated to min(previous answer, current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[i]), and `L` is decreased by 536870912.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 30), `i` is 29, `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + dp[29]`, `dp` is updated accordingly, `answer` is updated to min(previous answer, current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[i]), and `L` is decremented by 536870912.**
