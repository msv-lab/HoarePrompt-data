According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 30) and must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `dp[1]` is updated to `min(dp[1], c[1])**
