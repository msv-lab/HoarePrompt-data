The variable `vol` is assigned the value of `2 ** j - 1`. Given that `j` is equal to `1`, we can calculate `vol` as follows:

- `vol = 2 ** 1 - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1`

The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `L` is a positive integer such that `L` ≥ 2, `c` is a list of `n` positive integers, `costs` is a list of integers, `dp` is updated, and `vol` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `L` is a positive integer such that `L` ≥ 2, `c` is a list of `n` positive integers, `costs` is a list of integers, `dp` is updated, `vol` is 1.**
