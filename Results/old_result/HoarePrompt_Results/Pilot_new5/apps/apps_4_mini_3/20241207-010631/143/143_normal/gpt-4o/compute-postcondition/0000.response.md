The variable `max_cost` is assigned the value of \(10^{18}\). The other variables `n`, `L`, and `costs` remain unchanged and their conditions still hold.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 30), `L` is a positive integer (1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9), `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each `c_i` is a positive integer (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9), `max_cost` is 10^18**
