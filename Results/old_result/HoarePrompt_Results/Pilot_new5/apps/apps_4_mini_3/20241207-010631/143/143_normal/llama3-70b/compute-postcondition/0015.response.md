In the provided code snippet, the variable `vol` is assigned the value `2 ** j - 1`. Given that `j` is defined as `n - 1`, we can substitute `j` with `n - 1`. The calculation for `vol` becomes `2 ** (n - 1) - 1`.

Since `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 30`, we know that `j` will be at least `0` (when `n = 1`) and at most `29` (when `n = 30`). Therefore, `vol` will take on values corresponding to the calculation `2 ** (n - 1) - 1`, leading to the following possible outcomes for `vol`:

- If `n = 1`, `vol = 0`
- If `n = 2`, `vol = 1`
- If `n = 3`, `vol = 3`
- If `n = 4`, `vol = 7`
- ...
- If `n = 30`, `vol = 1073741823`

The states of the other variables (`L`, `c`, `costs`) remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, `L` is a positive integer such that L ≥ 1, `c` is a list of `n` positive integers that must have at least 2 elements, `costs` is a list of integers, `j` is `n - 1`, `vol` is equal to `2 ** (n - 1) - 1`.**
