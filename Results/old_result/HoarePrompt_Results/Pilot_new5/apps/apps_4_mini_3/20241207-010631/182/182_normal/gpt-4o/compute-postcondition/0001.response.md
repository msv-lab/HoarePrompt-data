The variable `normalized_angle` is assigned the value of `x % 360`. The value of `x` is an input integer that can range from -10^18 to 10^18. The result of the modulus operation will always yield a value between 0 and 359, inclusive. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `normalized_angle` based on the input `x`.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer such that -10^18 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18; `normalized_angle` is equal to `x % 360` and will be in the range [0, 359]**.
