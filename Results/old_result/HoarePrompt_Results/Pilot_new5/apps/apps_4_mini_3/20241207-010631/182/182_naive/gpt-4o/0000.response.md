To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to evaluate whether the logic in the program accurately implements the requirements laid out.

### Problem Requirement Recap:
1. The angle input can be between -10^18 and 10^18.
2. Positive values represent clockwise rotation, and negative values represent counter-clockwise rotation.
3. We need to calculate the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed to minimize the image's deviation from being upright.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program does the following:
- It reads an integer input to represent the camera's rotation angle.
- It normalizes this angle by taking the modulo with 360 to ensure it falls within the range of a full circle.
- It calculates the number of 90-degree clockwise turns required by determining how many times a 90-degree turn would need to be applied to achieve an upright image.

### Critical Evaluation:
1. **Normalization**: The line `normalized_angle = x % 360` correctly reduces any angle to its equivalent within a circular range. However, for negative angles, the result of the modulo operation may also be negative, hence this needs to be adjusted for correct interpretation.
2. **Calculating Turns**: The calculation `(360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4` aims to compute the number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed. However, this approach does not account for negative angles properly. For example, if `x` is `-60`, the normalized angle would be `300`, and the program would compute the turns as `(360 - 300) // 90 % 4`, resulting in `0` turns, which is incorrect because it needs to return `3` turns instead. 

### Example Case:
For `x = -60`, the expected output is `3`, but the program outputs `0` due to incorrect handling of the negative angle normalization. 

### Conclusion:
Since there is a case where the program does not fulfill the requirements mentioned in the problem description, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to correctly compute the required number of turns for negative angles due to the way it handles normalization and turn calculations.
