According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `2 * k + 2`. Given that `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must also be less than or equal to `n`.

Since `i` is calculated as `2 * k + 2`, we need to ensure that this value does not exceed `n`. Therefore, to allow the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust `n` to be at least equal to `i`, which means `n` must be at least `2 * k + 2`.

No other states need to be adjusted in this case.

State: **`n` must be at least equal to `2 * k + 2`, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= 1000, `positions` is [1], `i` is equal to `2 * k + 2**
