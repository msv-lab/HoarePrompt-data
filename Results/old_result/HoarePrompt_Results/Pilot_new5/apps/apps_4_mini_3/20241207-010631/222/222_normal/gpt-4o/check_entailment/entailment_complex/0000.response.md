Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements outlined in the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Incorrect Skewer Selection**: The function `func_1` generates a list of odd numbers starting from 1 and increments by a step size of `(2 * k + 1)`. However, the problem states that Miroslav should turn skewer number `i`, which turns over the closest `k` skewers from each side of `i`. This means that the skewer positions selected should not simply be odd numbers, but should be spaced out based on how many skewers are turned over when one skewer is flipped.

2. **Missing Even Index Handling**: The approach of selecting only odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...) does not guarantee that all skewers will be turned over. For example, if `n = 6` and `k = 1`, the expected result is to turn skewers 1 and 6. The produced output (`1, 3, 5`) does not account for the even skewers (2, 4, 6) being turned over, which leads to some skewers remaining in the initial state.

3. **Inefficient Approach**: The method only attempts to turn skewers based on a fixed pattern of odd numbers instead of strategically planning which skewers to turn to ensure that all are covered with the minimum number of flips as stated in the problem.

In summary, the program does not implement the correct logic to turn over all skewers in the minimal number of actions, and it does not consider the even skewers, leading to potential cases where not all skewers are turned over. Thus, it fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.
