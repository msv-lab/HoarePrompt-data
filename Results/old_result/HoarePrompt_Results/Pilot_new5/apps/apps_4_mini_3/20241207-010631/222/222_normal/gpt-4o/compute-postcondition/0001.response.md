The variable `i` is assigned the value of 1. The initial states of `n`, `k`, and `positions` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= 1000, `positions` is an empty list, `i` is 1**
