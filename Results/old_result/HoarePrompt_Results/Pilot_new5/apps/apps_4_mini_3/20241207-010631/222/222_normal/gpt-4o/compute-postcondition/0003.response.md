The variable `i` is appended to the `positions` list. Since `i` is currently 1, the list `positions` will now contain the single value `[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= 1000, `positions` now contains the value `[1]`, `i` is still 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= 1000, `positions` is [1], `i` is 1**
