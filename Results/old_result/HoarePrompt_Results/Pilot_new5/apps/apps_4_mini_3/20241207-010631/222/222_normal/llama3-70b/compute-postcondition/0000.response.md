`n` and `k` are assigned values based on the input received, where `map(int, input().split())` converts the input split by space into integers. The previous conditions of `n` and `k` remain valid, but their specific values will now be determined by the user input. Therefore, the output state will reflect the specific values assigned to `n` and `k` based on that input.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `k` is an input non-negative integer (0 <= k <= 1000)**
