The initial state indicates that `n` must be at least equal to `4 * k + 4`, `positions` is a list containing `[1, i, i]`, and `i` is equal to `4 * k + 3`. 

When executing the code `i += 2 * k + 1`, the value of `i` is updated. The previous value of `i` is `4 * k + 3`, and we need to calculate the new value of `i`.

New value of `i`: 
```
i = (4 * k + 3) + (2 * k + 1) 
  = 4 * k + 3 + 2 * k + 1 
  = 6 * k + 4
```

The value of `positions` remains unchanged as `[1, i, i]`, but we must update `i` in this list to reflect its new value.

Therefore, the updated state of the variables is:
- `n` must be at least equal to `4 * k + 4`.
- `positions` is `[1, 6 * k + 4, 6 * k + 4]`.
- `i` is `6 * k + 4`.

Output State: **`n` must be at least equal to `4 * k + 4`, `positions` is [1, `6 * k + 4`, `6 * k + 4`], `i` is `6 * k + 4`**.
