Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. 

### Explanation of the Issues:
1. **Incorrect Selection of Skewers**: The algorithm only selects odd-numbered skewers starting from 1. This is not guaranteed to cover all skewers, especially when `n` is even or when `k` is greater than 0. For example, if `n = 6` and `k = 1`, the program would output positions `[1, 3, 5]`, which would leave skewers `2`, `4`, and `6` unturned.

2. **Skipping Skewers**: The increment `i += 2 * k + 1` causes the program to skip over skewers that should be turned. The correct approach would involve computing the necessary positions to maximize the number of skewers turned over, ensuring that all indexes are covered.

3. **Output Formatting**: The program does not ensure that skewers are turned in a way to minimize the number of operations. The problem states that the algorithm should turn all skewers, and the program fails to account for scenarios where the skewers need to be turned in a more nuanced way based on `k`.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to satisfy the requirements of the problem description because it does not reliably and completely turn over all skewers as described. It uses an incorrect logic for selecting which skewers to turn, thereby not ensuring that the minimal number of actions needed to turn over all skewers is achieved.
