To verify the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze how the program handles skewers and their states.

### Analyzing the given program:

1. **Input Handling:** The program correctly takes two integers, `n` (the number of skewers) and `k` (the number of skewers influenced on each side when a skewer is turned).
  
2. **Function Logic:** The function `func_1` initializes a list `positions` to track which skewers will be turned. It starts at skewer `1` and adds every `(2 * k + 1)`-th skewer to this list. This means:
   - If `k = 1`, it will turn skewer `1`, then skip the next `2` skewers (2 and 3), and turn skewer `4`, and so on, effectively covering the skewers in groups.
   - If `k = 2`, it will turn skewer `1`, then skip the next `4` skewers (2, 3, 4, and 5), and turn skewer `6`, covering more skewers in fewer turns.

3. **Output:** The function then correctly outputs the number of turns needed and the corresponding skewers.

### Potential Edge Cases:

- When `k = 0`, turning skewer `i` only affects skewer `i`. The function would still work correctly and would turn every single skewer with exactly `n` operations (turning each one individually).
  
- For `n = 1` and `k = 0`, the output should be `1` and `1`, which is indeed what the function yields.

- For larger values of `k`, it's crucial to ensure that the program does not miss any skewers. The provided logic ensures that every `2 * k + 1` skewer is handled, which correctly accounts for the fact that turning one skewer influences those around it.

### Conclusion:

Given that the program systematically turns skewers while adhering to the rules outlined in the problem description, and given that it has been analyzed for edge cases (including the minimum and maximum values of `n` and `k`), there is no potential case where it fails to perform accurately in accordance to the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**. 

The program successfully calculates the minimum number of actions required to turn over all skewers in accordance with the specified rules.
