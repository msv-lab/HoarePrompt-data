The code initializes an empty list `res`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `l` remain unchanged as the list `res` is being created. 

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `k` is an input non-negative integer (0 <= k <= 1000), `l` is equal to (n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1), `res` is an empty list.**
