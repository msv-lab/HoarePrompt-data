According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. Right before the loop, `i` is 1, and `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000. Since `i` (1) is less than or equal to `n` (which can be 1 or greater), the loop can execute at least once. There is no need to adjust any states for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= 1000, `positions` is an empty list, `i` is 1**
