The provided program aims to determine the minimum number of actions required to turn over all skewers, given the number of skewers `n` and the number of skewers `k` that are affected by each turning action.

Upon examining the code, the function `func_1(n, k)` correctly initializes a list `positions` and uses a while loop to iterate through the skewers. It adds skewer positions to `positions` every `(2 * k + 1)` steps, starting from skewer `1`.

However, the problem description states that when skewer number `i` is turned, it affects the `k` skewers on either side, meaning that turning skewer `i` actually flips skewers in the range `[i-k, i+k]`, which may cover skewers that are not being turned at all if we only select every `(2 * k + 1)`th skewer starting from `1`. 

For example, consider the case when `n = 5` and `k = 1`:
- The skewer positions affected by turning skewer `1` would be `[1, 2]`, turning skewer `3` would affect `[2, 3, 4]`, and turning skewer `4` would affect `[3, 4, 5]`. 
- The correct output would require us to ensure that every skewer is turned correctly.

The output hints also provide a description that aligns with the code's function, indicating that it calculates odd positions based on a step of `(2 * k + 1)`. However, this step does not guarantee that all skewers will be fully turned, as there may be skewers missed within the ranges.

To summarize, the program does not fulfill the requirement of turning over all skewers in every potential case, particularly when `n` and `k` create scenarios where not all skewers are accounted for in the output.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
