The variable `res` is assigned the value `0`. The initial state of `n` does not change and remains a positive integer equal to the input value. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer equal to the input value such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9; `res` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer equal to the input value such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9; `res` is 0**.
