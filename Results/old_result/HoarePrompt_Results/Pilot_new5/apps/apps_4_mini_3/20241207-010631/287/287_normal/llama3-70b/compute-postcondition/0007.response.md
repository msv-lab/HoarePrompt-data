`res` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `res` is 2, so after the execution of the code, `res` becomes 1. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, `res` is 1, and `i` is 1 if `n` is divisible by `i`; if `n` is not divisible by `i`, the value of `res` remains 0. The current value of `i` satisfies the condition that `i * i` equals `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, `res` is 1, and `i` is 1 if `n` is divisible by `i`; if `n` is not divisible by `i`, the value of `res` remains 0. The current value of `i` satisfies the condition that `i * i` equals `n`.**
