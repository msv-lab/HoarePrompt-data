The function accepts an integer `num` within the range of 1 to \(10^9\) and calculates the total number of divisors of `num`, returning this count. The function accounts for both the divisor and its complement (i.e., `num / i`) when `i` is not equal to `num // i`, ensuring all divisors are counted accurately.
