According to the code, the loop can execute again if the condition `i * i <= num` holds true. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, meaning `i * i` is 4. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the condition `4 <= num` must be satisfied. Since `num` is an integer such that `1 <= num <= 10^9`, the minimum value for `num` that satisfies the condition is 4. 

Thus, `num` must be at least 4 for the loop to execute one more time. There are no other states that need to be adjusted. 

State: **`num` must be greater than or equal to 4, `count` is 2, `i` is 2**
