Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer input `n` provided by the user, calculates the total number of divisors of `n`, and prints this total. It correctly accounts for perfect squares by ensuring that the square root is only counted once if `n` is a perfect square. However, the function lacks error handling for invalid input and does not return any value, it only prints the result.**
