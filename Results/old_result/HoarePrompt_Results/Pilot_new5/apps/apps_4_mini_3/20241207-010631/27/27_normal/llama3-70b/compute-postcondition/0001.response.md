The variable `a1` is assigned the value of `x` raised to the power of `y` raised to the power of `z`. Since `x`, `y`, and `z` are positive real numbers, the computed value of `a1` will also be a positive real number. The states of the other variables (`x`, `y`, `z`) remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `x`, `y`, and `z` are positive real numbers inputted by the user, satisfying 0.1 ≤ `x`, `y`, `z` ≤ 200.0; `a1` is equal to `x ** (y ** z)`.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are positive real numbers inputted by the user, satisfying 0.1 ≤ `x`, `y`, `z` ≤ 200.0; `a1` is equal to `x ** (y ** z)`.**
