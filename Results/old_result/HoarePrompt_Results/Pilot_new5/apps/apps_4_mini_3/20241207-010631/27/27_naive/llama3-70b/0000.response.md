Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when there are multiple maximum values among the expressions. According to the problem description, if there are many maximums, it is required to print the one that comes first in the list. However, the current implementation simply uses `index(max(a))`, which will return the index of the first occurrence of the highest value in the list `a`. This is not necessarily the correct behavior in case the maximum value occurs at multiple positions, as it does not ensure that the first one in the list `b` is printed if there are ties.

For example, consider the input:
```
2.0 4.0 2.0
```
The calculated values could result in multiple expressions yielding the same maximum value, but due to how floating-point arithmetic works, the program might not consistently produce the expected result of the first occurring maximum in case of ties. Thus, the program can potentially output the wrong expression for certain inputs.
