The function accepts three positive real numbers `x`, `y`, and `z`, each constrained between 0.1 and 200.0 with one decimal place. It evaluates various exponentiation expressions involving these numbers, finds the maximum value among them, and outputs the corresponding expression as a string. It does not return any value but prints the result directly.
