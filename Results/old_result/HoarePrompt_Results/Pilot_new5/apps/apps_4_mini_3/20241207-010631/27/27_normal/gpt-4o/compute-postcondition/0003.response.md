The code finds the maximum value and its corresponding expression from the `expressions` list, which contains pairs of calculated values and their labels. This means `max_value` is assigned the highest value from the first elements of the pairs in `expressions`, and `max_expr` is assigned the corresponding expression.

Since the exact values of `expressions` are not provided in the initial state, we know that `max_value` is the highest among those calculated values, and `max_expr` is the label associated with that maximum value.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are positive real numbers such that 0.1 ≤ `x`, `y`, `z` ≤ 200.0, each number has exactly one digit after the decimal point; `max_value` is the maximum value from the expressions; `max_expr` is the corresponding expression associated with `max_value`.**
