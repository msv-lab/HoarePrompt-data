The variable `a10` is assigned the value of `z` raised to the power of `y`, which is then raised to the power of `x`. Thus, `a10 = z ** (y ** x)`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are positive real numbers inputted by the user satisfying 0.1 ≤ `x`, `y`, `z` ≤ 200.0; `a1` is equal to `x`; `a2` is equal to `x`; `a3` is equal to `x`; `a4` is equal to `x`; `a5` is equal to `y`; `a6` is equal to `y`; `a7` is equal to `y`; `a9` is equal to `z`; `a10` is equal to `z ** (y ** x)`.**
