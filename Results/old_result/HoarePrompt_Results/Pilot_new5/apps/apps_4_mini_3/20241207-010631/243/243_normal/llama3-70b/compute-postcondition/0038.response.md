The function `func` does not accept any parameters as indicated by its definition. It appears to operate under a specific constraint that relates to the variable `m`, which is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100000\). However, without further context on how `m` is utilized or what the function returns, we cannot specify the return values or behavior of the function.

Since the prompt does not provide any output conditions or cases related to the value of `m`, I cannot determine the exact return value of the function. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` can only be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its return value is undefined based on the provided information.**
