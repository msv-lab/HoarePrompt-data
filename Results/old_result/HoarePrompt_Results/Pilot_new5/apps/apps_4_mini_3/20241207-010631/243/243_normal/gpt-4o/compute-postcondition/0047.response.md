The variable `right` is assigned the value of `mid + 1`. The values of `m`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `zeroes`, and `result` remain unchanged from their initial state. The initial value of `left` is `mid - k`, which is not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `right` and maintains the valid information for other variables.

Output State: **`left` is equal to `mid - k`, `func_1(left)` is no longer equal to `m`, `m`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `zeroes`, and `result` remain unchanged; `right` is equal to `mid + 1`.**
