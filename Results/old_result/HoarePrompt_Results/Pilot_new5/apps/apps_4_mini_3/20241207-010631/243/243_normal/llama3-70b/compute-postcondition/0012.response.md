According to the code, the loop is a `while True` loop, which means it can execute indefinitely and will proceed to the next iteration without any conditions to check. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for the state. 

State: **`m` is an input integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 100000, `count` is 0, and `n` is 1**
