To determine if the loop can execute again, we need to analyze the condition `func_1(left) == m`. The loop will continue executing as long as this condition holds true.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `m` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq m \leq 100,000 \)
- `low` is 0
- `high` is equal to \( 5 \times (m + 1) \)
- `result` is an empty list
- `mid` is equal to \( (5 \times (m + 1)) // 2 \)
- `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`
- `left` is at least `m`

We need to ensure that the condition `func_1(left) == m` remains true for the loop to execute one more time.

Since `left` is at least `m`, it is possible that `func_1(left)` could continue to return `m` depending on its behavior and the relation between `left` and `m`. However, without information about how `func_1` behaves, we can't confidently say that it will continue to equal `m` without further adjustments.

However, for the loop to execute once more, `left` must not increase such that it causes `func_1(left)` to return a value different from `m`. Given that `left` is at least `m`, it could remain unchanged to maintain the condition. Therefore, no specific changes are necessary, but we must ensure `func_1(left)` continues to return `m`.

Thus, adjusting the states isn't necessary, but confirming that `func_1(left)` is still equal to `m` is implied.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` is 0; `high` is equal to 5 * (`m` + 1); `result` is an empty list; `mid` is equal to (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2; `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`; `left` is at least `m`, and func_1(left) must be equal to `m`**
