The variable `high` is assigned a new value which is `mid - 1`. The state of `mid` remains unchanged, and the other variables (`m`, `low`, `zeroes`) are also not affected. The constraint that `low` remains less than or equal to `high` is still valid after this operation. 

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` remains less than or equal to `high; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `high` is now `mid - 1`; `zeroes` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(mid)`.**
