The value of `left` is assigned the value of `mid`. The variable `mid` is equal to (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2, which is a specific calculation based on the positive integer `m`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` is 0; `high` is equal to 5 * (`m` + 1); `result` is an empty list; `mid` is equal to (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2; `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`; `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`; `left` is equal to (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` is 0; `high` is equal to 5 * (`m` + 1); `result` is an empty list; `mid` is equal to (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2; `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`; `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`; `left` is equal to (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2.**
