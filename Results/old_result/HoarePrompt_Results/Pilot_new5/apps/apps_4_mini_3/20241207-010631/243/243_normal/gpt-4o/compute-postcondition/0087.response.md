The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `m`. `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000. After executing the function body, it returns a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1` that satisfy certain conditions related to `func_1` and the search space defined by `low` and `high`. If `zeroes` is equal to `m`, then the result contains all values where `func_1(value) == m`. If no matches are found, the result will be an empty list. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a positive integer `m` and return a list of integers based on specific conditions related to that integer and other parameters, or an empty list if no conditions are satisfied.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer m and returns a list of integers from left + 1 to right - 1 that satisfy certain conditions related to func_1 and the search space defined by low and high. If no matches are found, it returns an empty list.**
