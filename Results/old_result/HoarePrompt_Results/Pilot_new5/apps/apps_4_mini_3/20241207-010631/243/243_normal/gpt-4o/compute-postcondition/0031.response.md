Postcondition: ***`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000. If `zeroes` is greater than `m`, then `high` is updated to `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2 - 1`, while `low` remains 0, `mid` equals to `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`, and `result` remains an empty list. If `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`, then `left` is less than its original value, `func_1(right)` is not equal to `m`, `low` stays at 0, `high` equals `5 * (m + 1)`, `mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`, `right` is updated by the number of times the loop executed, and `result` contains integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, breaking from the most internal loop or statement.***
