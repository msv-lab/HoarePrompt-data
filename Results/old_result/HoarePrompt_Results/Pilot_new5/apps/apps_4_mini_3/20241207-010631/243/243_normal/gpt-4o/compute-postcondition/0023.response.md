Output State: **`left` is at least less than the original value of `left`, `func_1(left)` is not equal to `m`, `m` is still a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000, `low` is 0, `high` is equal to 5 * (`m` + 1), `result` is an empty list, `mid` is equal to (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2, `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`, `right` is equal to the original value of `right` + 1, and `func_1(right)` must be adjusted so that func_1(right) is not equal to m.**
