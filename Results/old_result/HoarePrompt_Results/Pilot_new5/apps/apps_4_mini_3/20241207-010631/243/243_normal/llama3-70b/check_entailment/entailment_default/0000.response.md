To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the description, let's analyze the code step-by-step.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to find the number of positive integers \( n \) such that \( n! \) (the factorial of \( n \)) ends with exactly \( m \) trailing zeroes. Trailing zeroes in factorials primarily arise from factors of 5 (and 2, but 5's are the limiting factor). The number of trailing zeroes in \( n! \) can be computed using the formula:

\[ \text{trailing\_zeroes}(n) = \left\lfloor \frac{n}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{25} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{125} \right\rfloor + \ldots \]

The program should output the count of such integers \( n \) and the integers themselves.

### Program Review
```python
def func():
    m = int(input())
    count = 0
    n = 1
    while True:
        if n // 5 ** count >= m:
            break
        count += 1
    n = 1
    ans = []
    while True:
        if n // 5 ** count < m:
            break
        ans.append(n)
        n += 1
    print(len(ans))
    print(' '.join(map(str, ans)))
```

### Initial Assessment
1. **First Loop**:
   - The loop increments `count` until `n // 5 ** count` (starting with \( n=1 \)) is no longer greater than or equal to \( m \). However, this seems incorrect because the loop doesn't calculate the actual trailing zeroes for any \( n \).
   
2. **Second Loop**:
   - This loop starts from \( n=1 \) and appends \( n \) to the answer list as long as `n // 5 ** count < m`. Again, this logic seems flawed as it doesn't correctly compute normal trailing zero counts for factorials.

### Edge Cases
1. For \( m = 5 \): The program prints `0`, but we need to verify if no integers \( n \) actually yield exactly 5 zeroes in their factorial. According to the description, \( 5! = 120 \), \( 6! = 720 \), \( 7! = 5040 \), \( 8! = 40320 \), and \( 9! = 362880 \) result in exactly `1` trailing zero, not 5.
2. For \( m = 1 \): The factorials \( 5!, 6!, 7!, 8!, 9! \) (as mentioned in the example) yield 1 trailing zero, and thus the program should return the values from `5` to `9` as valid outputs.

### Output Hints Review
The hints imply that the function attempts to find values of \( n \) leading to exactly \( m \) zeroes, but based on our assessment of the actual implementation, it doesn't perform the necessary calculations to achieve this goal.

### Conclusion
The program does not follow the problem description accurately, as it fails to calculate the required number of trailing zeroes effectively. The logic for counting and returning the integers \( n \) is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not work correctly, especially for edge cases like \( m = 5 \). It fails to compute the actual count of trailing zeroes and returns incorrect results based on the factorial calculations for integers.
