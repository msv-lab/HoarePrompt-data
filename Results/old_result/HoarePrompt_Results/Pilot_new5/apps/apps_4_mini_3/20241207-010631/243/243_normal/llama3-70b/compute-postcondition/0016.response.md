To determine the output state after the while loop executes, we need to analyze the loop's behavior based on its condition and the variables involved.

The loop continues to run as long as `n // 5 ** count` is less than `m`. The variable `count` starts from 0 and increases by 1 in each iteration. The loop breaks when `n // 5 ** count` becomes greater than or equal to `m`.

Now, let's break down the output state depending on how many times the loop has executed:

1. **Output State after the loop executes 1 time:** 
   - This means that on the first iteration, the condition `n // 5 ** count >= m` was not satisfied, so `count` is still 0 and remains unchanged. 
   - Therefore, we have: `m` is an input integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 100000; `count` is 0; `n` is 1.

2. **Output State after the loop executes 2 times:** 
   - In the second iteration, the condition was still not satisfied, hence `count` increments to 1.
   - Thus, the state is: `m` is an input integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 100000; `count` is 1; `n` is 1.

3. **Output State after the loop executes 3 times:** 
   - On the third iteration, `count` increments to 2, but the condition still does not hold.
   - So we get: `m` is an input integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 100000; `count` is 2; `n` is 1.

Now, let's consider the final output state after all iterations of the loop have executed:
- The loop continues until `n // 5 ** count` is no longer less than `m`. The maximum value of `count` before the loop breaks will be such that `5 ** count` exceeds `n/m`.
- When the loop eventually breaks, `count` will hold the value such that `n // 5 ** count >= m`, meaning the last increment of `count` would have resulted in the condition being satisfied.
- Therefore, the output state will reflect that `count` is now the first value that made `n // 5 ** count` equal to or exceed `m`.

The output state after all iterations of the loop reflect the following:
- `count` will be the smallest integer such that `5 ** count` is greater than or equal to `n / m`.

Summarizing all of this, the final output state is:

Output State: **`count` is the smallest integer such that `n // 5 ** count >= m`, `n` is 1, original value of `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 100000.**
