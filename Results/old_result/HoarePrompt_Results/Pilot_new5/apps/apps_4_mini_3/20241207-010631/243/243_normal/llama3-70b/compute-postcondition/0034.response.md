The variable `n` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `n` is 3, so after the operation, `n` will be 4. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 0, `n` is 4, `ans` is a list containing 1, 2, and 3.

Output State: **`count` is 0, `n` is 4, `ans` is a list containing 1, 2, and 3**
