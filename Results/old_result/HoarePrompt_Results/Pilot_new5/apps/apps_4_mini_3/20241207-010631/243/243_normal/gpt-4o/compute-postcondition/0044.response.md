To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to consider the condition `func_1(left) == m`. In the previous state:

- `left` is equal to `mid - 2`
- `func_1(left)` must still equal `m`
- `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000
- `low` needs to remain less than or equal to `high`

Since the loop condition is that `func_1(left)` equals `m`, we need to ensure that whatever changes occur in the next iteration do not cause `func_1(left)` to become different from `m`.

For the loop to be executed one more time, `left` should be adjusted to ensure that `func_1(left)` equals `m` again. If `left` is decreased (e.g., moving to the next integer down), we must guarantee that `func_1(left)` still returns `m`. Therefore, it can be stated that `left` must remain equal to `mid - 2` for the loop to continue executing.

Thus, the current state of `left` must be such that `func_1(left)` still equals `m` after the next iteration. 

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` needs to remain less than or equal to `high; `mid` is (low + high) // 2; `zeroes` is the result of `func_1(mid); `result` is an empty list; `left` is equal to `mid - 2` and `func_1(left)` must still equal `m`**
