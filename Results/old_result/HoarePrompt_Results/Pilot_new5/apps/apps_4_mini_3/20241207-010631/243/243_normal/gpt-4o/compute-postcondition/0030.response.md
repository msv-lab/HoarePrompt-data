The code `break` causes an immediate exit from the nearest enclosing loop or statement control structure. Since there are no variables being modified by this statement itself, the values of the other variables remain unchanged, and we are left with the same conditions as before, just indicating that we have exited the loop. 

The output state reflects that the loop has been exited and maintains the conditions of all other variables:

Output State: **`left` is at least less than the original value of `left`, `func_1(right)` is not equal to `m`, `m` is still a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000, `low` is 0, `high` is equal to 5 * (`m` + 1), `mid` is equal to (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2, `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`, `right` is equal to the original value of `right` + the number of times the loop executed, `result` is now a list containing integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
