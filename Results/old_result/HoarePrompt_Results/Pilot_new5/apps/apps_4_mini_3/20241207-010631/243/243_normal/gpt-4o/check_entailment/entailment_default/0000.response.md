To determine the correctness of the provided code based on the problem description and the output hints, let's analyze the functions and their intended functionality step by step.

### Analysis of Functions

#### Function 1: `func_1(n)`
- **Purpose**: Counts the number of trailing zeroes in `n!`.
- **Logic**: It calculates the count of trailing zeroes based on the number of times `n` can be divided by powers of 5.
- **Output Hint**: The hint correctly describes that it sums the integer divisions of `n` by powers of 5 until the power exceeds `n`.

#### Function 2: `func_2(m)`
- **Purpose**: Finds all integers `n` such that `n!` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes.
- **Logic**: It performs a binary search to find the range of integers `n` that yields exactly `m` trailing zeroes.
- **Output Hint**: The hint states that it returns a list of integers `n` for which the factorial of `n` has exactly `m` trailing zeroes, which is aligned with the code.

### Edge Cases to Consider
1. What happens if `m` is at its lower bound (1)?
2. What happens if `m` is at its upper bound (100,000)?
3. The code should return `0` if there are no integers `n` such that `n!` has exactly `m` trailing zeroes. The hint correctly interprets this behavior.

### Checking the Implementation
- **For `m = 1`**: The output hint suggests that there are 5 integers (`5, 6, 7, 8, 9`) for which the factorial ends with exactly 1 trailing zero, which aligns with the calculations.
- **For `m = 5`**: The output hint states that there are `0` values, which is also correct since the only occurrences of trailing zeroes are at higher numbers (starting from 25! and so forth).

### Concluding on Correctness
The logic of both functions seems to be sound, and the output hints align with the code's intent and expected behavior. There donâ€™t appear to be any edge cases that the function does not handle properly based on the problem description and provided examples.

Therefore, the overall correctness of the program can be summarized as follows:

Correctness: **True**
