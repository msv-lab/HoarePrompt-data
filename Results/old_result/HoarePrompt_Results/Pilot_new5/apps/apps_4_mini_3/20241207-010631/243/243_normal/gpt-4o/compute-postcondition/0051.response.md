The value of `right` is incremented by 1. Prior to this operation, `right` was equal to `mid + 2`. Consequently, after the increment, `right` will equal `mid + 3`. The other variables (`left`, `func_1(left)`, `func_1(right)`, `m`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `zeroes`, and `result`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`left` is equal to `mid - k`, `func_1(left)` is no longer equal to `m`, `func_1(right)` must be equal to `m`, `m`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `zeroes`, and `result` remain unchanged; `right` is equal to `mid + 3`.**
