The value of `zeroes` is assigned the result of the function `func_1(mid)`. The variable `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`, which means it takes the average of `low` and `high` and floors it. The values of `m`, `low`, `high`, and `mid` remain constrained by their initial conditions.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` remains less than or equal to `high; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `zeroes` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(mid)`.**
