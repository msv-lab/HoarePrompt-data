According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `func_1(right) == m`. For the loop to execute one more time, `func_1(right)` must be equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `func_1(right)` must be adjusted so that `func_1(right)` is not equal to `m`. Given this state, for the loop to continue executing, we need to ensure that the state of `func_1(right)` still holds its condition of being equal to `m`.

Therefore, we need to modify the state such that `func_1(right)` is adjusted back to equal `m`, since the task states it currently needs to be adjusted to not equal `m`. 

State: **`left` is at least less than the original value of `left`, `func_1(right)` must be adjusted back to equal m, `m` is still a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000, `low` is 0, `high` is equal to 5 * (`m` + 1), `result` is an empty list, `mid` is equal to (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2, `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`, `right` is equal to the original value of `right` + 1**
