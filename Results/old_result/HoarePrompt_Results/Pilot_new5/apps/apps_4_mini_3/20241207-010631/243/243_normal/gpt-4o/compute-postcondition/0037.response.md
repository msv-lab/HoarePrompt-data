The code updates the value of the variable `high`, setting it to `mid - 1`. The variable `mid` is defined as `(low + high) // 2`, which means its value depends on the current values of `low` and `high`. Thus, after executing the code, `high` will be decreased by 1 while the other variables remain unchanged. 

Since `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000, and `low` must remain less than or equal to `high`, the output state will reflect this adjustment.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` needs to remain less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is (low + high) // 2; `high` is now `mid - 1`; `zeroes` is the result of `func_1(mid)`.**
