The variable `left` is assigned the value of `mid`. The value of `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, which means `left` will now hold the value of the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high` by 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` remains less than or equal to `high; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `zeroes` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(mid)`; `result` is an empty list; `left` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`.**
