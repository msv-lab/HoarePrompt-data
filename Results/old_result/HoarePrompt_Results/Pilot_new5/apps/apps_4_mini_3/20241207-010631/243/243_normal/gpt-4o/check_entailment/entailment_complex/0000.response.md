To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze both the logic of the code and the accompanying annotations. 

The task is to find the number of positive integers \( n \) such that \( n! \) (the factorial of \( n \)) ends with exactly \( m \) trailing zeroes. The number of trailing zeroes in a factorial is determined by the number of times the factors 5 contribute to the overall product, since there are typically more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in the factorial's decomposition.

### Breakdown of the Code Logic

1. **Function `func_1(n)`**:
   - This function calculates the number of trailing zeroes in \( n! \) by summing the integer divisions of \( n \) by powers of 5. This is a standard method to count trailing zeroes.
   - Annotation confirms that this function is correctly computing the number of trailing zeroes for a given \( n \).

2. **Function `func_2(m)`**:
   - This function uses a binary search approach to find all integers \( n \) such that \( n! \) ends with exactly \( m \) trailing zeroes.
   - It initializes a search space from `low = 0` to `high = 5 * (m + 1)`. This upper limit is chosen because for \( m \) trailing zeroes, \( n \) must be at least around \( 5m \).
   - The function checks the number of trailing zeroes for the midpoint and adjusts the search space accordingly.
   - If `zeroes` equals \( m \), it attempts to find all integers that yield exactly \( m \) zeroes by expanding outwards from `mid` until it finds numbers that do not meet the condition.

### Checking Against Problem Description and Edge Cases

Now, let's consider the edge cases and the correctness of the program:
- For \( m = 1 \):
  - The output should be \( 5 \) (as \( 5!, 6!, 7!, 8!, 9! \) all have exactly 1 trailing zero).
- For \( m = 5 \):
  - The output should be \( 0 \) (since no \( n! \) has exactly 5 trailing zeroes).
  
### Potential Issues:
1. The upper limit of the search space (`high = 5 * (m + 1)`) is somewhat arbitrary but reasonable because it should sufficiently cover the range needed. However, it's essential to ensure that all possible integers giving exactly \( m \) trailing zeroes are considered.
   
2. The edge case where \( m \) is very close to the maximum limit (like \( m = 100000 \)) has not been explicitly tested in the given example outputs, which raises concerns about the performance and correctness.

3. The code does not explicitly handle cases where \( m \) is not achievable (e.g., if there is no integer \( n \) such that \( n! \) has exactly \( m \) trailing zeroes). The binary search should be able to find this, but the logic for determining the range may be flawed if it does not properly adjust or cover all ranges.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the implementation and the edge cases, I believe there could be scenarios where the code does not correctly determine the range of numbers \( n \) that yield exactly \( m \) trailing zeroes. Specifically:
- If \( m \) is set to values like 5, it should output 0, but if the binary search does not terminate correctly before reaching specified edge cases, it might yield incorrect results.

Thus, while the logic of counting trailing zeroes seems valid, the overall search mechanism could potentially miss valid integers or incorrectly report zeroes in certain cases.

Correctness: **False**
