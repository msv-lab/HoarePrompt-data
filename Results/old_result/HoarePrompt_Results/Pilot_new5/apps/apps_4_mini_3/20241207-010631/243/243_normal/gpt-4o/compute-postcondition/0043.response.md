The value of `left` is decremented by 1. Since `left` was previously equal to `mid - 1`, after the operation, `left` becomes `mid - 2`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` needs to remain less than or equal to `high; `mid` is (low + high) // 2; `zeroes` is the result of `func_1(mid); `result` is an empty list; `left` is equal to `mid - 2` and `func_1(left)` must still equal `m`.
