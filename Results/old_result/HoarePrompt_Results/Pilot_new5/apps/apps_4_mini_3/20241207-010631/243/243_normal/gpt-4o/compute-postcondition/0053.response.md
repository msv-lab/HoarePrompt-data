The code `right += 1` increments the value of `right` by 1. The initial state indicates that `right` is equal to `mid + 3`. Therefore, after the execution, `right` will be updated to `mid + 3 + 1`, which simplifies to `mid + 4`.

The other variables remain unchanged, so the output state will reflect this change.

Output State: **`left` is equal to `mid - k`, `func_1(left)` is no longer equal to `m`, `func_1(right)` must be equal to `m`, `m`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `zeroes`, and `result` remain unchanged; `right` is equal to `mid + 4.**
