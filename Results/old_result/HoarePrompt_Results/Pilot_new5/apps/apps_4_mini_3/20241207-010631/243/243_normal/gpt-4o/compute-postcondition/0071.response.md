`left` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `left` was such that `func_1(left)` equals `m`, but the exact value of `left` is not specified. Therefore, after the execution, `left` will equal its previous value minus 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`left` must be such that `func_1(left + 1)` equals `m`, and `left` is now equal to its previous value minus 1.**
