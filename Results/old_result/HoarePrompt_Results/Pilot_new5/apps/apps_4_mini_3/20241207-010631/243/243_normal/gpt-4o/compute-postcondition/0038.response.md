The code initializes `result` as an empty list. This operation does not affect any of the other variables (`m`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `zeroes`), and there are no other calculations or assignments occurring. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `result` is now an empty list while retaining the current states of the other variables.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` needs to remain less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is (low + high) // 2; `zeroes` is the result of `func_1(mid) ; `result` is an empty list.**
