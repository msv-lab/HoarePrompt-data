The variable `m` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means it will take an integer input from the user. The condition states that `m` is an integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, so after executing the code, we can say that `m` will now hold an input integer value within that range. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`m` is an input integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 100000**
