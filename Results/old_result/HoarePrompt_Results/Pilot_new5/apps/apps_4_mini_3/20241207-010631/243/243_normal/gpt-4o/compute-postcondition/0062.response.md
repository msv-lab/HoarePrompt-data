The value of `low` is updated to `mid + 1`. The value of `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`, and since `low` was previously less than or equal to `high`, updating `low` does not affect those constraints. Other variables, `m` and `zeroes`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` is now `mid + 1` (which is greater than the previous value of `low`); `high` remains unchanged; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `zeroes` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(mid)`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` is now `mid + 1`; `high` remains unchanged; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `zeroes` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(mid)`.**
