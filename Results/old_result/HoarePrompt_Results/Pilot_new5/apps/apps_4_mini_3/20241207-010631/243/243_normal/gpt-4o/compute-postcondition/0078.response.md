According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `func_1(right) == m`. At the end of the last iteration, we have `func_1(right)` equal to `m`, which means the loop can execute for one more time. However, since `right` was adjusted by 1 to ensure that `func_1(right) == m` after the increment, we need to ensure that `right` is still satisfactory for the loop condition.

For the loop to run again, it must stay true that `func_1(right) == m`. In the current state, we do not have information about how the loop body might affect `right`, and therefore, we must keep `right` at its current value where `func_1(right) == m` remains valid.

Thus, the necessary adjustments are not related to `left` since its conditions do not influence the loop execution, as the loop is solely dependent on `right`.

State: **`left` is such that `func_1(left + 1)` does not equal `m`, `func_1(left)` is less than `m`, `right` is such that `func_1(right) == m`**
