Output State: **`right` is such that `func_1(right) == m + k` for some positive integer k where `k` is the number of times the loop executed; `left` is such that `func_1(left + 1)` does not equal `m`, and `func_1(left)` is less than `m`; `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop.**
