The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The initial conditions state that `ans` is set to 1, leading to the new value of `ans` being 2. The other variables `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `ans` is 2, and `i` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `ans` is 2, `i` is 2**
