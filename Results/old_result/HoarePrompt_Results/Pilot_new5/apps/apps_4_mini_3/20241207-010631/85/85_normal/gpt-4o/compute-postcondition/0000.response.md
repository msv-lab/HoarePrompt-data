The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since it is given that `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, after the execution of the code, `n` will hold a specific integer value that falls within this range based on user input. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and `n` is assigned an input integer value within that range.**
