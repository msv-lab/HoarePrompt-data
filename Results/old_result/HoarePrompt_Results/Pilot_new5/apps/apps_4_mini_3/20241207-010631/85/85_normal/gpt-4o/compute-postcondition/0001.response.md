The variable `max_9s` is initialized to `0`. The initial state indicates that `n` is an integer within the range 2 to 10^9, but this range does not affect `max_9s`. Since no calculations or operations with `n` are performed, the output state only reflects the new value of `max_9s`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `max_9s` is 0**
