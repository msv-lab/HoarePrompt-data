According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop iterates from `1` to `n // 2`, inclusive. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least `2` because if `n` is `2`, `n // 2 + 1` will be `2`, and the loop will execute once with `i` being `1`. 

Since the initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`, `ans` is irrelevant to the loop execution because it does not influence the loop's index `i`. 

At the beginning of the loop, `i` will start at `1`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `ans` is 0, `i` is 1**
