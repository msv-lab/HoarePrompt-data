Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find pairs of shovels whose total cost ends with the maximum possible number of nines. Specifically, the condition used to determine whether a pair (i, n - i) yields a sum that ends with nines is flawed.

The key requirement is to count pairs such that their total cost ends with the maximum possible nines, which means we should look for pairs where the last digit (or last digits) of their sum is a series of 9s. In practice, this means the sum should be as close to a number ending in `99...9` as possible.

Hereâ€™s why the current program is incorrect:
- The condition `(i + (n - i)) % 10 ** (len(str(i + (n - i))) - 1) == 0` does not actually check if the last digits of the sum are nines. It only checks if the sum is a multiple of a certain power of ten, which is not sufficient to determine if it ends with nines.

A simple counterexample is:
- For `n = 14`, the expected output is `9`, as there are valid pairs like (1, 8), (2, 7), etc. However, the logic currently in place will not correctly count these pairs because it relies on faulty criteria to determine valid pairs.

Therefore, the implementation does not fulfill the requirements set forth in the problem description.
