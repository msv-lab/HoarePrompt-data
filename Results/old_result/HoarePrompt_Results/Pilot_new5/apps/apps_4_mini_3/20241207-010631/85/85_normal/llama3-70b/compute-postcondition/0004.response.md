The value of `ans` is incremented by 1, so `ans` will now be 1. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `ans` is 1, `i` is 1, and the expression (i + (n - i)) % 10.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `ans` is 1, `i` is 1, and the expression (i + (n - i)) % 10**.
