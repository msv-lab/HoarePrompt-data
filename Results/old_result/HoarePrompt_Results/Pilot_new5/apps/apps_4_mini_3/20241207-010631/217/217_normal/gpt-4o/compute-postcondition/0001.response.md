The variable `a` is assigned the value of a list created from the input split into space-separated integers and converted to integers using `map`. The length of the list is determined by `n`, which specifies how many integers were provided. The elements of `a` will be integers that fall within the specified range of -100 to 100. The value of `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range [1, 100]; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -100 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100, as input by the user.**
