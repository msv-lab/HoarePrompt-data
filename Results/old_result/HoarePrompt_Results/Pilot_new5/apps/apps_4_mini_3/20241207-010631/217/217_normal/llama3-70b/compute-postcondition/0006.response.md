The value of `b` is incremented by `a[i]`. Given that `i` is even, `a[i]` takes the value of the element at the even index of the sorted list `a`. The value of `b` changes from 0 to `0 + a[i]`, which is `a[i]` since `b` was initially 0. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order where each integer `a_i` satisfies -100 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100, `b` is `a[i]`, `c` is 0, `i` is 0, and the current value of `i` is even.**
