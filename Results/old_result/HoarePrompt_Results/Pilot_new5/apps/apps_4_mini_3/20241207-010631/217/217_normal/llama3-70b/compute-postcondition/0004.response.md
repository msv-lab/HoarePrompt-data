According to the code, the loop iterates `n` times, where `n` is guaranteed to be at least 1 based on the given constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). Thus, the loop is set to execute. 

At the start of the loop, the variable `i` will take on values from 0 to `n-1` during its execution. Therefore, before the loop starts, the state should reflect that `i` is initialized to 0 (the first value it will take).

Since `b` and `c` do not affect the execution of the loop and are initialized to 0, they can remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is an input integer satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order where each integer `a_i` satisfies -100 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100, `b` is 0, `c` is 0, `i` is 0**
