The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. `n` is an integer constrained such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 100 \). The parameter `a` is a list containing `n` integers, where each integer \( a_i \) satisfies the constraint \( -100 \leq a_i \leq 100 \). After executing the function body, it processes the input and returns a value based on the conditions defined in the logic. 

However, without specific conditions provided, I cannot detail the output behavior. Based on the information given, I can only outline the parameters. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` integers (-100 ≤ a_i ≤ 100).**
