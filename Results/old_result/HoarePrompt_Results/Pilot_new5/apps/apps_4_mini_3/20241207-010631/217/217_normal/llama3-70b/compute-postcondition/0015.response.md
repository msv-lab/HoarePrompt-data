The value of `b` is updated by adding the value of `a[i]` to it. The variable `i` is an odd integer, so it points to an index in the list `a`. As `a` is sorted in descending order, `a[i]` will be one of the integers in the list. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Thus, we can summarize the output state as follows: 
- `n` is an input integer satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order.
- `i` is an odd integer.
- `b` is updated to `b + a[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order; `i` is an odd integer; `b` is updated to `b + a[i]`.**
