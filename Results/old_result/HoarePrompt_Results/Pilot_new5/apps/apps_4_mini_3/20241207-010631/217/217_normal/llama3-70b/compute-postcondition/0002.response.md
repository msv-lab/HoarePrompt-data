The code `a.sort(reverse=True)` sorts the list `a` in descending order. The initial state specifies that `n` is an input integer and `a` is a list of `n` integers within the given bounds. The values of `n` and `a` remain valid but `a` is now sorted in reverse order.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order where each integer `a_i` satisfies -100 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100.**
