Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n`, which represents the number of operations, and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of symbols '+' and '-'. This aligns perfectly with the input requirements stated in the problem description.

2. **Initial Stone Count**: The program starts with a stone count of `0`. This is permissible because the problem allows for the assumption that Vasya has at least enough stones to perform the operations. The program appropriately handles the case where Vasya cannot take a stone when there are none by ensuring that the stone count never goes below `0`.

3. **Operation Execution**:
   - For every '+' operation, the program increments the stone count by `1`.
   - For every '-' operation, it decrements the stone count by `1` but ensures that the count does not go below `0` using `max(0, stones - 1)`. This is crucial as the problem states that the pile cannot be empty before taking stones.

4. **Output**: After processing all operations, the final stone count is printed, which represents the minimal possible number of stones left after the operations. This aligns with the requirement of the problem to find the minimal possible number of stones after all operations.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles edge cases, including when all operations are '+' or when all are '-', as demonstrated in the provided examples in the problem statement. The way it processes operations ensures that it always adheres to the rules defined by the problem.

Given these points, the program adheres to the problem description for all possible cases, confirming its correctness.
