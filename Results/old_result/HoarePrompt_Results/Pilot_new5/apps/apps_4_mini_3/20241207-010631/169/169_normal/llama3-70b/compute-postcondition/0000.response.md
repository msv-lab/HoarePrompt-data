The value of `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial constraints on `n` (that it is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100) still hold true, but the specific value of `n` will now depend on the input provided. The string `s` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100; `s` is a string of length n consisting of the characters '+' and '-' only.**
