Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description. Specifically, the logic in the function fails to account for the scenario where the minimal possible number of stones in the pile after all operations must consider the initial state of the pile.

1. The problem states that the pile must be non-empty before each operation of taking a stone. This means if the number of "-" operations exceeds the number of "+" operations, we need to ensure that there were enough stones to take from. However, the program prints `0` if `minus_count > plus_count` instead of accounting for the minimum needed stones to allow for all "-" operations.

2. The correct approach should involve calculating the maximum stones required at the beginning to allow the operations to proceed without violating the non-empty condition. The program needs to ensure that the result takes into account the number of stones that must have been present initially before any "-" operations were executed.

3. For example, if there are 3 "-" operations and 2 "+" operations, the minimum initial count of stones should have been 3, allowing for all subtractions to occur. The program currently just outputs `0` in this scenario, which is incorrect according to the problem description.

Thus, the implementation does not adhere to the requirements of the problem, as it does not correctly calculate the minimum possible number of stones after the operations while considering the necessary initial condition of the pile being non-empty during each "-" operation.
