`The variable `s` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts a string input from the user. The value of `n` remains unchanged, as it is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100; `s` is an input string.`

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100; `s` is an input string**
