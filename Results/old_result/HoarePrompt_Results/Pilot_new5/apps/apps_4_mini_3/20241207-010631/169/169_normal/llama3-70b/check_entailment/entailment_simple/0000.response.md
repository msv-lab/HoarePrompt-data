To determine the correctness of the provided program with respect to the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step:

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. Vasya has a pile of stones and performs `n` operations, either adding or taking stones.
2. The pile must never be empty before a take operation.
3. The goal is to find the minimal possible number of stones remaining after `n` operations.

### Program Logic:
1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads an integer `n` (the number of operations).
   - It reads a string `s` of length `n`, consisting of '+' and '-'.

2. **Counting Operations**:
   - `minus_count` counts the number of '-' operations (stones taken).
   - `plus_count` counts the number of '+' operations (stones added).

3. **Computing the Result**:
   - If `minus_count` is greater than `plus_count`, it means Vasya would need more stones to satisfy the take operations than he received from the add operations. In this case, the output is `0`, meaning that the minimum pile size can be zero (if he had started with enough stones to make all take operations possible).
   - Otherwise, the output is `plus_count - minus_count`, which represents the net number of stones remained after all operations.

### Evaluation of Correctness:
- The program correctly checks if the number of take operations exceeds the number of add operations. If it does, it outputs `0`, which is correct because we can't have a negative number of stones.
- If the take operations do not exceed the add operations, the program calculates the net stones left correctly by `plus_count - minus_count`.

### Edge Cases:
- The program handles the edge cases mentioned in the problem description:
  - For a case with only '-' operations, if there are more take operations than available stones initially, it correctly prints `0`.
  - For a case with only '+' operations, it correctly returns the count of '+'.
  - Mixed operations are handled as well, ensuring that the starting condition of not being able to take stones when none are present is adhered to.

### Conclusion:
Overall, the program adheres to the problem description requirements. It correctly computes the minimal number of stones left based on the operations performed, considering all necessary conditions.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
