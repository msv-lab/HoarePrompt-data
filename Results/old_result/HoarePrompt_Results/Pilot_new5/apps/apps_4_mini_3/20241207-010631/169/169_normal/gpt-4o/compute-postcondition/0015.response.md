Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `s` is a non-empty input string with at least 2 characters, and `operation` is the second character in `s`. If `operation` is '+', then `stones` is either 1 or 2 based on the increment. If `operation` is '-', then `stones` remains 1 or 0.***
