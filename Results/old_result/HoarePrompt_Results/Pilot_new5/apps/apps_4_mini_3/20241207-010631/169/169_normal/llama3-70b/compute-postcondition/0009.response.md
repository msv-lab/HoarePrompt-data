The function `func` does not explicitly accept parameters in its signature. However, it operates on two implicit parameters: `n`, which is a positive integer constrained between 1 and 100, and `s`, which is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '+' and '-'. 

The function's output is determined by the contents of `s`. While the specifics of the output are not provided, we can infer that the function will perform some operations based on the characters in `s`. Since the details of those operations and the exact result are not defined, we will focus on what is known.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept an implicit positive integer `n` and a string `s` of that length, but the specific return value or output behavior based on these inputs is not detailed.

Functionality: **The function accepts two implicit parameters: a positive integer `n` (1 <= n <= 100) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of '+' and '-' characters. The exact return value based on these parameters is not specified.**
