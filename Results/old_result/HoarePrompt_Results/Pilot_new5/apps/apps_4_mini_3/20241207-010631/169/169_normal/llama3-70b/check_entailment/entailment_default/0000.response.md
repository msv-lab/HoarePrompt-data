To assess the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze it step by step.

### Problem Description:
Vasya performs a series of operations on a pile of stones, either adding one stone with a `+` or taking one stone with a `-`. The goal is to determine the minimal possible number of stones left in the pile after all operations, given that the pile must never be empty before a `-` operation.

### Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    minus_count = s.count('-')
    plus_count = s.count('+')
    if minus_count > plus_count:
        print(0)
    else:
        print(plus_count - minus_count)
```

1. **Counting Operations**: 
   - `minus_count` counts how many times Vasya took a stone (`-`).
   - `plus_count` counts how many times Vasya added a stone (`+`).

2. **Logic**:
   - If the number of `-` operations exceeds the number of `+` operations, the output is `0`. This is logically consistent with the need for the pile to never be empty before performing a `-` operation.
   - Otherwise, the program computes and prints `plus_count - minus_count`, which represents the net increase in stones after performing all operations.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Only `-` Operations**: For example, an input of `3` followed by `---` should yield `0`, which the program handles correctly.
2. **Only `+` Operations**: For an input of `4` followed by `++++`, the output should be `4`, which is also handled correctly.
3. **Mixed Operations**: For an input of `2` followed by `-+`, the output should be `1` since starting with at least 1 stone allows for these operations to complete without violating the pile's non-empty condition.

### Output Hints Agreement:
The output hints state that the function counts `-` and `+` characters, checks their relationship, and prints results accordingly. This aligns with the logic seen in the code. 

The output hints also mention that if `minus_count` exceeds `plus_count`, it prints `0`, which is indeed correct and consistent.

### Conclusion:
After reviewing the program and the output hints, it is clear that the program correctly implements the logic needed to determine the minimal number of stones left in the pile after all operations, as described in the problem statement. 

No edge cases where the program does not comply with the requirements were found, and the logic holds for all potential inputs within the specified constraints.

Correctness: **True**.
