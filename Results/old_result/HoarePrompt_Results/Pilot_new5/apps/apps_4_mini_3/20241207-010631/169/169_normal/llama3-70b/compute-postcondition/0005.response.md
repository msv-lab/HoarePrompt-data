The code executes a print statement which outputs the value `0`. The values of the variables `n`, `s`, `minus_count`, and `plus_count` remain unchanged because the print statement does not modify any variables. However, it is important to note that the output value is `0`.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters '+' and '-' only; `minus_count` is the count of '-' in `s`; `plus_count` is equal to `s.count('+')`; the current value of `minus_count` is greater than the current value of `plus_count`; 0 has been printed.**
