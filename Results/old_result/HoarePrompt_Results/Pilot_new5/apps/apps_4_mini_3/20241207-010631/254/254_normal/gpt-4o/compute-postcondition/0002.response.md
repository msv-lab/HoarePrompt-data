The variable `gcd_all` is assigned the value of `math.gcd(gcd_k1_k2, k3)`, which means it calculates the greatest common divisor of `gcd_k1_k2` (the greatest common divisor of `k1` and `k2`) and `k3`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will include `k_1`, `k_2`, `k_3`, and `gcd_all`.

Output State: **`k_1`, `k_2`, and `k_3` are integers such that 1 ≤ `k_i` ≤ 1500 for i = 1, 2, 3; `gcd_k1_k2` is the greatest common divisor of `k1` and `k2`; `gcd_all` is the greatest common divisor of `gcd_k1_k2` and `k3`.**
