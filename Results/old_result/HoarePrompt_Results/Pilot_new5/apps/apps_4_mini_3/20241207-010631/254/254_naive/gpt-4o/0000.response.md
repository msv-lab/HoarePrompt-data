Correctness: **False**.

The program checks if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the given intervals \( k1 \), \( k2 \), and \( k3 \) is equal to 1 in order to print "YES". However, this logic is flawed. 

For example, consider the input `2 2 2`. In this case, the GCD is 2 (not 1), but it is possible to choose times (e.g., \( x1 = 1 \), \( x2 = 2 \), \( x3 = 3 \)) that will cover all seconds after the 2nd second, as all garlands will be lit at every even second (2, 4, 6, ...). Hence, this should output "YES", but the program will incorrectly output "NO".

This demonstrates that the program does not handle all cases correctly, leading to its incorrectness.
