The code assigns the value of `b` to `a` and the value of `a % b` to `b`. This means that `a` will now hold the value that `b` had before the assignment, and `b` will be updated to the remainder of `a` divided by `b`. 

Given that `b` must be greater than 0, the result of `a % b` will be a non-negative integer that is less than `b`. The values of `a` and `c` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an integer, `b` is now assigned the value `a % b`, which is a non-negative integer less than its previous value, and `c` remains an integer.

Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is now `a % b`, `c` is an integer**
