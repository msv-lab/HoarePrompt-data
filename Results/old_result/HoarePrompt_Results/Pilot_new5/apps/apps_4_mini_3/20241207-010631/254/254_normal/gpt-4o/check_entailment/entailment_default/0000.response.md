The provided program seems to be trying to determine whether it is possible to switch on three garlands such that at least one is lit at every second after a certain time has passed. The approach taken involves calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the three intervals `k1`, `k2`, and `k3`. If the GCD is 1, it implies that the intervals are coprime, which is a necessary condition for ensuring that the garlands can light up every second eventually. If the GCD is greater than 1, it indicates that there will be some intervals where none of the garlands will be lit.

**Analysis of the code:**
1. The code correctly calculates the GCD of the three intervals.
2. It checks the GCD to determine if it equals 1, which would mean that it is possible to cover all seconds.
3. The output correctly reflects "YES" if the GCD is 1 and "NO" if it is greater than 1.

**Output hints:**
The output hints state that the function checks the GCD of the input integers and prints 'YES' if it is 1 and 'NO' otherwise. This aligns with our understanding of the problem description.

**Potential Edge Cases:**
1. If all three integers are the same and greater than 1 (for example, `k1 = 2`, `k2 = 2`, `k3 = 2`), the GCD will be 2, and the function will return "NO", which is correct because there will be seconds where no garland will be lit.
2. When one of the integers is 1 (for instance, `k1 = 1`, `k2 = 2`, `k3 = 3`), the GCD will be 1, leading to a "YES", which is also correct since the garland with interval 1 would be lit every second, thus covering all seconds.

**Conclusion:**
The program does indeed follow the problem description for all potential cases. The logic checks if there is a possibility of lighting up every second based on the GCD of the intervals, and the output hints agree with the function's operations.

Correctness: **True**.
