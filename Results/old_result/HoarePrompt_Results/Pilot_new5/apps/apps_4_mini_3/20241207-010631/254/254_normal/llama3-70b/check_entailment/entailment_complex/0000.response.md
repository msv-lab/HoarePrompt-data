To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the program and how it attempts to determine if Mishka can choose moments to switch on the garlands such that at least one garland is lit at every second after the maximum switch-on time.

### Problem Description Recap
Mishka has three garlands with intervals `k1`, `k2`, and `k3`. The goal is to determine if he can choose times `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` in such a way that after the maximum of these times (i.e., `max(x1, x2, x3)`), at least one garland is lit during every second.

### Analysis of the Program
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three integers `k1`, `k2`, `k3` representing the intervals of the three garlands.

2. **Least Common Multiple (LCM) Calculation**: The program calculates the LCM of the three intervals using the formula:
   \[
   \text{lcm}(k1, k2, k3) = \frac{k1 \times k2 \times k3}{\text{gcd}(k1, k2) \times \text{gcd}(k2, k3) \times \text{gcd}(k1, k3)}
   \]
   The use of the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) here is correct in finding the LCM of the three intervals.

3. **Condition for At Least One Garland Lit**: The condition checked is whether:
   \[
   \text{lcm} \mod k1 == 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \text{lcm} \mod k2 == 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \text{lcm} \mod k3 == 0
   \]
   If all three conditions hold, it means that the LCM is a multiple of each `k1`, `k2`, and `k3`, indicating that the garlands will light at regular intervals without gaps.

4. **Output**: The program prints "YES" if the conditions are met and "NO" otherwise.

### Verification of Correctness
The program correctly implements the conditions needed to determine if at least one garland will be lit at every second after the maximum switch-on time. 

- The calculation of LCM ensures that it finds a time after which the lighting cycles of the garlands will repeat without gaps.
- If the LCM is a multiple of all three intervals, it implies that there is a synchronization in their lighting, ensuring that at least one garland will be on at every second after the maximum of the switch-on times.

### Counter-Examples
The program would fail if:
- If `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` have a common multiple that allows all three garlands to light up in such a way that there are intervals where none are lit, but the current logic would correctly return "NO" in such a case.

### Conclusion
The program, under all conditions defined by the input constraints, will output the correct determination of whether Mishka can successfully ensure that at least one garland is lit during every second. 

Thus, the program meets the problem requirements as stated.

Correctness: **True**
