To analyze the code snippet provided, we have the following variables in the initial state:

- `n`: an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000
- `a`: a list of `n` integers
- `length`: the next integer in the list `a`, specifically `length = a[i + 1]`
- `current_cost`: remains unchanged initially

The code modifies `current_cost` as follows:

```
current_cost += length - (t + 1)
```

1. The value of `length` is taken from the list `a` at index `i + 1`.
2. The value of `t` is subtracted from `length` and then we subtract 1.
3. The updated value of `current_cost` is calculated by adding this result to the existing value of `current_cost`.

The specific calculations depend on the values of `length` and `t`, but we do not have their specific values in the initial state.

Since `current_cost` is being modified, we will note that it has been updated with the expression:

```
current_cost = current_cost + (length - (t + 1))
```

As there are no constraints given about `length` or `t`, we can only express the output state with the variables in their updated form.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `length` is `a[i + 1]`, `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + (length - (t + 1))`**.
