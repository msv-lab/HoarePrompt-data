Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 100; `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` integers; `mid` is greater than 1; the `cost` is the computed sum of min(abs(x - 1), abs(x - 2)) for x in `sticks`; if `cost` is less than `min_cost`, then `min_cost` is updated to `cost`, `min_t` is updated to `i`, and `i` remains 1. Otherwise, `min_cost` and `min_t` retain their previous values and `i` remains 1.***
