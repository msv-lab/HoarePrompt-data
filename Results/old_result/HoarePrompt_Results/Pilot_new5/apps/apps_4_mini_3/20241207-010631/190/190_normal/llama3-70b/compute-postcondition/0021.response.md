The value of `min_cost` is assigned the value of `cost`, which is computed as the sum of `min(abs(x - 1), abs(x - 2)) for x in sticks`. The initial state of the variables does not change except for `min_cost`. Therefore, the output state remains with the existing values of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 100; `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` integers; `mid` is 2; `cost` is computed as the sum of `min(abs(x - 1), abs(x - 2)) for x in sticks; `min_cost` is equal to `cost`.**
