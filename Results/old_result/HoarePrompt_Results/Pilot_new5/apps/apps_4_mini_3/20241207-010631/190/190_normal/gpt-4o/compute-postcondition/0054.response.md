According to the code, the loop iterates over a range of values for `t` from 1 to 100. At the end of the last iteration, the variable `t` must have reached the last value that is less than 100. Since the `for` loop includes the value of `t` from 1 to 100 (where the loop terminates when `t` reaches 101), if `t` is currently at 100, the loop cannot execute again, and the state needs to reflect that the next value of `t` would be 101. 

At the end of the last iteration, if `current_cost` is calculated based on the adjustments made for each length in list `a`, and since `current_cost` is less than `min_cost`, the values of `min_cost` and `best_t` are updated accordingly. If `current_cost` remains 0 (with the list `a` being empty), the values retain their previous values.

Since the loop will not execute anymore after `t = 100`, the next state should indicate that `t` is now at 101, and `current_cost`, `min_cost`, and `best_t` should reflect their values post the last iteration.

State: **`current_cost` is calculated, `min_cost` retains its updated value, `best_t` retains its updated value, `t` is 101**
