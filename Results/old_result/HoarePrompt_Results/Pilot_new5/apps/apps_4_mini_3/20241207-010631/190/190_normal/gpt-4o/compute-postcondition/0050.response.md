Postcondition: ***`current_cost` is the total cost calculated based on the adjustments made for each length in list `a` relative to `t`, `min_cost` is the minimum cost found among all calculated costs, `best_t` is the value of `t` that resulted in `min_cost`, `n` is an input integer such that `1 <= n <= 1000`, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is a positive integer such that `1 <= a_i <= 100`. The current value of `current_cost` is less than `min_cost`.***
