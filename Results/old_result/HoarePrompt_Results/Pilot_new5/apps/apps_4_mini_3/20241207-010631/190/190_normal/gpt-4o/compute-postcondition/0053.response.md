Postcondition: ***`current_cost` is the total cost calculated based on the adjustments made for each length in list `a` relative to `t`. If `current_cost` is less than `min_cost`, then `min_cost` is updated to be `current_cost`, and `best_t` is set to `t`. If the list `a` is empty, `current_cost` remains 0 and `min_cost` and `best_t` retain their previous values.***
