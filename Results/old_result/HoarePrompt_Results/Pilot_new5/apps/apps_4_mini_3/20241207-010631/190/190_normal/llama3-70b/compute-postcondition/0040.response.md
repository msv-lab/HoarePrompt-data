Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where each integer `a_i` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 100; `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` integers; `mid` is less than 100; `i` is equal to 100; `cost` is a non-negative integer equal to `sum(min(abs(x - 100), abs(x - 99)) for x in sticks). If `cost` is less than `min_cost`, then `min_cost` is updated to be equal to `cost` and `min_t` is set to 100.***
