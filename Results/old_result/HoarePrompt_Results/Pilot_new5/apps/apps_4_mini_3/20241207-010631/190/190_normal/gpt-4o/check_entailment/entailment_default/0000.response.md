To assess the correctness of the given Python program based on the provided problem description and output hints, let's analyze the code closely.

### Problem Description Recap
- We have `n` sticks of positive lengths.
- We want to adjust these lengths such that all sticks are "almost good" for some integer `t`, meaning that each stick's length should be within 1 unit of `t`.
- The cost of changing a stick's length is defined as the absolute difference between its original length and the new length.
- The task is to find the optimal `t` that minimizes the total cost of these adjustments.

### Program Analysis
1. **Input Handling**: The program takes an integer input `n` followed by a list of integers representing the stick lengths.
  
2. **Cost Calculation**: The program iterates through possible values of `t` from 1 to 100 (inclusive). For each `t`, it computes the `current_cost`:
   - If a stick's length is less than `t - 1`, it adds the cost to raise it to `t - 1`.
   - If a stick's length is greater than `t + 1`, it adds the cost to reduce it to `t + 1`.
   - If a stick's length is within `[t - 1, t + 1]`, no cost is incurred for that stick.

3. **Tracking Minimum Cost**: The program keeps track of the minimum cost encountered and the corresponding value of `t`.

4. **Output**: Finally, it prints the optimal `t` and the minimum cost.

### Edge Cases
- **All Sticks Are Already Almost Good**: If all stick lengths are already within 1 unit of a certain `t`, the cost should be `0`. The code should handle this correctly since it calculates costs for each stick independently and does not incur any cost when lengths are already within the desired range.
  
- **Minimum Lengths**: The program only considers lengths from 1 to 100, which aligns with the problem's constraints. However, it should also handle cases where the stick lengths vary widely; the code does this by allowing adjustments for all lengths.

- **Single Stick Case**: The program should work correctly when there is only one stick, as it would compute the cost for that single length against all potential values of `t` from 1 to 100.

### Output Hints Validation
The output hints state that the function correctly calculates the minimum adjustment cost required to transform the lengths such that they are all within one unit of an optimal target `t`. The hints indicate that the function should be able to return both the optimal `t` and the associated minimal cost.

Upon reviewing the provided output hints, they agree with the code's logic. The function properly iterates through possible `t` values and computes costs in a way that aligns with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion
The code appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement and handles the edge cases effectively. Since there are no observed contradictions between the code, the problem statement, and the output hints, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**. 

The program successfully determines the optimal `t` and the minimum cost for adjusting stick lengths for all valid cases described.
