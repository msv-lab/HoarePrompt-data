Postcondition: ***`current_cost` is either 98 (if `length` is less than 100) or `length - 104` (if `length` is greater than or equal to 100); `min_cost` retains its updated value; `best_t` retains its updated value; `t` is 101; `length` is the third element in `a`, `a` must contain at least 3 elements. If `length` is greater than `t + 1`, then `current_cost` is updated accordingly.***
