The value of `current_cost` is incremented by `length - (t + 1)`. Since `length` is greater than `t + 1`, the expression `length - (t + 1)` will yield a positive integer. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 100, `length` is the first element in the list `a`, which is greater than or equal to `t - 1`, the current value of `length` is greater than `t + 1`, and `current_cost` is increased by `length - (t + 1)`.**
