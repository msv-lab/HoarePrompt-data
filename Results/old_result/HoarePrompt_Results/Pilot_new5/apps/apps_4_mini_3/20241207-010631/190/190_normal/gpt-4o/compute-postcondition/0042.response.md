Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer within the range [1, 1000], `a` is a list containing `n` positive integers in the range [1, 100], and `length` is the last element of the list `a`. If `length` is greater than `t + 1`, then `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + (length - (t + 1))`.***
