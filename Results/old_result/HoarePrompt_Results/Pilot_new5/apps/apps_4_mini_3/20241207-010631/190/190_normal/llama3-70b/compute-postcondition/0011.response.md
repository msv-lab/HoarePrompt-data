The variable `min_cost` is assigned the value of `cost`. The other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. The output state reflects that `min_cost` is now equal to the current value of `cost`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 100; `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` integers; `mid` is greater than 1; `cost` is the sum of min(abs(x - (mid - 1)), abs(x - mid)) for x in `sticks`; `t` is equal to `mid`; `min_cost` is equal to `cost`; `min_t` is equal to `mid`; `i` is equal to `mid - 1`; the current value of `cost` is less than `min_cost`; `min_cost` is now equal to `cost`.**
