Postcondition: ***`current_cost` is 100 - `length` if `length` is less than 100, while `min_cost` and `best_t` retain their updated values, `t` is 101, `length` is the first element in `a`, and `a` is a non-empty iterable. If `length` is greater than or equal to 100, then `current_cost` is `length - 102`, with `min_cost` and `best_t` still retaining their updated values, `t` is 101, `length` is the first element in `a`, and `a` is a non-empty iterable.***
