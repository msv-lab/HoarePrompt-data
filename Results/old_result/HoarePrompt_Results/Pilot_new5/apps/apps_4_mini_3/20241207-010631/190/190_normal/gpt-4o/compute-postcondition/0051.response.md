The variable `min_cost` is assigned the value of `current_cost`. The previous value of `current_cost` is less than the previous value of `min_cost`, meaning that `min_cost` is now updated to be equal to `current_cost`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`current_cost` is the total cost calculated based on the adjustments made for each length in list `a` relative to `t`, `min_cost` is equal to `current_cost`, `best_t` is the value of `t` that resulted in `min_cost`, `n` is an input integer such that `1 <= n <= 1000`, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is a positive integer such that `1 <= a_i <= 100**
