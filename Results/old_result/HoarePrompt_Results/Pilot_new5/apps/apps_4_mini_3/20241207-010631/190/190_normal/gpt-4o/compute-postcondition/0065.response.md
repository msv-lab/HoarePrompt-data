To determine the output state after executing the provided code, we first analyze the initial conditions and the operation performed in the code snippet.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `current_cost` is either `100 - length` (if `length < 100`) or `length - 102` (if `length >= 100`).
   - `min_cost` retains its updated value.
   - `best_t` retains its updated value.
   - `t` is `101`.
   - `length` is the second element in array `a`, which has at least 2 elements.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The code `current_cost += t - 1 - length` implies that we will be adding the value of `t - 1 - length` to `current_cost`.
   - Given that `t` is `101`, we calculate:
     - `t - 1 = 101 - 1 = 100`
   - Thus, the expression becomes:
     - `current_cost += 100 - length`

3. **Impact on `current_cost`**:
   - Depending on the value of `length`, `current_cost` changes as follows:
     - If `length < 100`, then `current_cost` was `100 - length`. After the code executes, the new value will be:
       - `current_cost = (100 - length) + (100 - length) = 200 - length`.
     - If `length >= 100`, then `current_cost` was `length - 102`. After the code executes, the new value will be:
       - `current_cost = (length - 102) + (100 - length) = -2`.

4. **Final Output State**:
   - We need to express the final output state reflecting the changes in `current_cost`, while keeping all other variables in their updated form.
   - Since the exact value of `length` is not specified, we will express the final state conditionally based on `length`.

Therefore, the output states are:
- If `length < 100`: `current_cost` is `200 - length`.
- If `length >= 100`: `current_cost` is `-2`.

Since we cannot ascertain the specific value of `length`, we will represent both cases in the output state.

Output State: **`current_cost` is either `200 - length` (if `length < 100`) or `-2` (if `length >= 100`); `min_cost` retains its updated value; `best_t` retains its updated value; `t` is 101; `length` is the second element in `a`, `a` must have at least 2 elements.**
