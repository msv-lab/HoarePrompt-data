Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 100; `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` integers; `mid` is 2; `cost` is computed as the sum of `min(abs(x - 1), abs(x - 2)) for x in sticks. If `cost` is less than `min_cost`, then `min_cost` is updated to be equal to `cost` and `min_t` is set to `i`.***
