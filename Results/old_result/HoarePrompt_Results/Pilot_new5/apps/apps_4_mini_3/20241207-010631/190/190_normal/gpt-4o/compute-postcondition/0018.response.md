Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 100, `length` is the next integer in the list `a` (if available), and `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + (t - 1 - length)` if `length` is less than `t - 1`. Otherwise, if `length` is greater than `t + 1`, `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + (length - (t + 1))`; if `length` is not greater than `t + 1`, the value of `current_cost` remains unchanged.***
