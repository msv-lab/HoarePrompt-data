According to the code, the loop iterates through values of `t` from 1 to 100. The loop will execute regardless of the values of `n`, `a`, `min_cost`, and `best_t`, as the loop's execution is independent of these variables. 

However, it is important to note the initialization state of `t`. At the start of the loop, `t` must be initialized to the first value in the range, which is 1.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 100, `min_cost` is float('inf'), `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1**
