The variable `min_cost` is assigned the value of `cost`. The value of `cost` is computed as the sum of `min(abs(x - 1), abs(x - 2))` for each `x` in `sticks`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged, including `min_t` which retains its previous value, `n`, `a`, `sticks`, `mid`, and `i`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 100; `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` integers; `mid` is greater than 1; `cost` is the computed sum of min(abs(x - 1), abs(x - 2)) for x in `sticks`; `min_cost` is equal to `cost`; `min_t` retains its previous value; `i` is 1.**
