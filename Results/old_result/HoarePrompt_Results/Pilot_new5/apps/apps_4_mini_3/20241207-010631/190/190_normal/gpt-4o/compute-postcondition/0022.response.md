Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `length` is `a[i + 1]`, and `current_cost` remains unchanged. If `length` is greater than `t + 1`, then `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + (length - (t + 1))`. Otherwise, `current_cost` remains unchanged.***
