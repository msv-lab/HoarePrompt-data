To determine the output state after executing the code snippet, we analyze the provided initial state and the impact of the code.

### Initial State Analysis:
- `n` is an input integer such that `1 <= n <= 1000`.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is a positive integer such that `1 <= a_i <= 100`.
- `length` is defined as the next element in the list `a`, meaning `length = a[n]`.
- The list `a` has at least `n + 2` elements, ensuring that we can access `a[n]` without index errors.
- `current_cost` is previously defined and holds some integer value.

### Code Impact:
The code `current_cost += length - (t + 1)` modifies the value of `current_cost`. 
- The expression `length - (t + 1)` represents the difference between the value of `length` and `t + 1`. 
- The value of `length` can be taken directly from `a[n]`.
- The value of `t` is not defined in the initial state, but it is assumed to be some integer value.

### Output Calculation:
- After executing the code, `current_cost` will have the new value of `current_cost` plus the computed difference from `length - (t + 1)`.
- Therefore, the updated state will reflect this change in `current_cost`.

### Output State:
As a result, the valid preconditions remain unchanged except for the updated value of `current_cost`. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that `1 <= n <= 1000`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is a positive integer such that `1 <= a_i <= 100`, `length = a[n]`, `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + (length - (t + 1))`.**
