According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1.

This means that the new value for `i` will be 2. since `n` must still be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `i` is 2**
