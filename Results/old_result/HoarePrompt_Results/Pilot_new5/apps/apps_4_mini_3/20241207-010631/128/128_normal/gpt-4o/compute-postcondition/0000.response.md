The code initializes an empty list `regular_sales`. This does not affect any other variable or the initial state of `n`, `f`, or `days`. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `regular_sales` has been initialized as an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of days (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `f` is a non-negative integer representing the number of days to choose for sell-out (0 ≤ f ≤ n), `days` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two non-negative integers k_i and l_i (0 ≤ k_i, l_i ≤ 10^9), `regular_sales` is an empty list.**
