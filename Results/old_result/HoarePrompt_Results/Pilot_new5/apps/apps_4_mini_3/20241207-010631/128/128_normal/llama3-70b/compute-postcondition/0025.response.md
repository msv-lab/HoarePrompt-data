Given the Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `i` is 2, and the code snippet:

```
sold += min(days[i][0] * 2, days[i][1])
```

Now, let's analyze the impact of the code on the state of the program:

1. The variable `sold` is updated by adding the minimum of two values: `days[i][0] * 2` and `days[i][1]`.
2. The index `i` is given as 2, which means that `days[2][0]` and `days[2][1]` will be used in the calculation.
3. The values of `days[2][0]` and `days[2][1]` must be known to determine the exact update to `sold`, but since they are not provided, we can express the changes in a general form.

Thus, the output state will reflect that `sold` has been updated based on the computation involving `days[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `i` is 2, `sold` is updated by adding `min(days[2][0] * 2, days[2][1])`**.
