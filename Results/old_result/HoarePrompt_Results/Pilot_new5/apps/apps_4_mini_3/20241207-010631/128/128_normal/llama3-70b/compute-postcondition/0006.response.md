The variables `k` and `l` are assigned values based on user input, which are converted to integers from a string of space-separated values. The values of `n` and `f` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `f` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `f` ≤ `n`; `days` now contains a tuple `(k, l)`, where `k` and `l` are assigned input integers.**
