The code `regular_sales.append(min(k, l))` appends the value of `min(k, l)` to the list `regular_sales`. The values of `k` and `l` are derived from the third tuple in the `days` list. Since `n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer, and `days` contains at least 3 tuples, the values of `k` and `l` are valid. The previous state of `regular_sales` will have one additional value after this code executes.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer, `days` is a non-empty list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, `k` is the first element of the third tuple in `days`, `l` is the second element of the third tuple in `days`, `potential_sales_increase` includes the value `min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l)` appended, `regular_sales` now includes `min(k, l)` appended.**
