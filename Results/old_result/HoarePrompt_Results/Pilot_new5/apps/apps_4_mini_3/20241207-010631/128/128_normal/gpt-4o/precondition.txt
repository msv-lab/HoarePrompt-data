n is a positive integer representing the number of days (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), f is a non-negative integer representing the number of days to choose for sell-out (0 ≤ f ≤ n), and days is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two non-negative integers (k_i, l_i) representing the number of products on the shelves (k_i) and the number of clients expected (l_i) for each day (0 ≤ k_i, l_i ≤ 10^9).
