The code `days.append((k, l))` appends a tuple consisting of the values of `k` and `l` to the list `days`. The values of `k` and `l` are obtained from user input, and they are not specified beyond that. Therefore, the variable `days` will be updated to include a new tuple `(k, l)`, and the initial state of `n` and `f` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `f` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `f` ≤ `n`, `k` is an integer from input, `l` is an integer from input, `days` now includes a new tuple `(k, l)`**
