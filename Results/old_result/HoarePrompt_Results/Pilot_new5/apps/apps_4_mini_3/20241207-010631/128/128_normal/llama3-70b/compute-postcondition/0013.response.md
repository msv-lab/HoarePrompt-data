The value of `sold` is initialized to 0. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `f` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `f` ≤ `n`; `days` is sorted in descending order based on the values of `l - k`; `sold` is 0.
