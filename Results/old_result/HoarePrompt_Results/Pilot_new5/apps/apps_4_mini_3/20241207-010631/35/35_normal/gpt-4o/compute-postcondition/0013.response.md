To determine whether the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition `low < high`.

At the end of the last iteration, we know:
- `high` is greater than the new `low`, which implies that `low` is less than `high`, making the condition `low < high` true.
- Given that `low` is updated to `mid + 1` when `can_distribute(mid)` returns true, and `high` is updated to `(low + high) // 2` when `can_distribute(mid)` returns false, we need to ensure that `low` remains less than `high` for another iteration.

Since we know `low` is currently less than `high`, and we do not have specific values for `low` and `high`, but we know that `high` must be greater than `low`, the loop will execute again without needing any adjustments.

State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers. `high` is greater than `low`.**
