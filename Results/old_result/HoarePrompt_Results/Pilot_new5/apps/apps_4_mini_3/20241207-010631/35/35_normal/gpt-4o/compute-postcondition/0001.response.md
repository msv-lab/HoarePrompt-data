The function `can_distribute` accepts a parameter `x`. The variables `a` and `b` are non-negative integers representing the number of pieces of two cakes, and `n` is a positive integer representing the number of plates. The function returns a boolean expression indicating whether the sum of pieces of cake `a` (divided by `x`) and pieces of cake `b` (divided by `x`) is greater than or equal to the number of plates `n`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `can_distribute` is to accept an integer `x` and determine if the total number of plates can be distributed based on the pieces of the two cakes divided by `x`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter x and returns a boolean indicating whether the sum of pieces of cake a divided by x and pieces of cake b divided by x is greater than or equal to the number of plates n.**
