The value of `mid` is currently equal to `(low + high) // 2`. The statement `low = mid + 1` updates the value of `low` to be one greater than `mid`. Since `high` remains unchanged, the relationship between `low`, `high`, and `mid` is affected. The output state maintains all other variables but updates `low` based on the calculation.

Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers; `high` is greater than the new `low`, and the new `low` is `mid + 1`, where `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2.**
