Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer representing the number of plates (2 ≤ n ≤ a + b), `a` is an integer representing the number of pieces of the first cake (1 ≤ a ≤ 100), `b` is an integer representing the number of pieces of the second cake (1 ≤ b ≤ 100), `low` is 1, `high` is `min(a, b) + 1`, `mid` is either 1 or 2 (specifically, (1 + (min(a, b) + 1)) // 2), and it is not possible to distribute `mid` plates among the pieces of cake, meaning that `can_distribute(mid)` is false.***
