The function accepts three integer parameters: `n`, `a`, and `b`, where `n` represents the number of plates, `a` is the number of pieces of the first cake, and `b` is the number of pieces of the second cake. It determines the maximum number of plates that can be distributed evenly based on the minimum pieces available between the two cakes. The function returns `min(a, b)`, which represents the maximum number of plates that can be distributed, assuming the distribution can always be achieved if there are enough pieces.
