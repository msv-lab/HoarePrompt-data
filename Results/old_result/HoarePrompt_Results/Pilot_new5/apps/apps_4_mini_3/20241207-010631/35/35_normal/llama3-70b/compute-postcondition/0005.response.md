Postcondition: ***`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers, and `x` is the minimum of `n`, `a`, and `b`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `x`, `b` is greater than or equal to `x`, and the sum of `a - x` and `b - x` is greater than or equal to `x`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
