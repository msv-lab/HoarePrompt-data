You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: It's New Year's Eve soon, so Ivan decided it's high time he started setting the table. Ivan has bought two cakes and cut them into pieces: the first cake has been cut into a pieces, and the second one — into b pieces.

Ivan knows that there will be n people at the celebration (including himself), so Ivan has set n plates for the cakes. Now he is thinking about how to distribute the cakes between the plates. Ivan wants to do it in such a way that all following conditions are met:  Each piece of each cake is put on some plate;  Each plate contains at least one piece of cake;  No plate contains pieces of both cakes. 

To make his guests happy, Ivan wants to distribute the cakes in such a way that the minimum number of pieces on the plate is maximized. Formally, Ivan wants to know the maximum possible number x such that he can distribute the cakes according to the aforementioned conditions, and each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.

Help Ivan to calculate this number x!


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers n, a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b) — the number of plates, the number of pieces of the first cake, and the number of pieces of the second cake, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible number x such that Ivan can distribute the cake in such a way that each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 2 3

Output
1

Input
4 7 10

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the first example there is only one way to distribute cakes to plates, all of them will have 1 cake on it.

In the second example you can have two plates with 3 and 4 pieces of the first cake and two plates both with 5 pieces of the second cake. Minimal number of pieces is 3.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
(n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(n, a, b))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of plates (2 ≤ n ≤ a + b), a is an integer representing the number of pieces of the first cake (1 ≤ a ≤ 100), and b is an integer representing the number of pieces of the second cake (1 ≤ b ≤ 100).
def func_1(n, a, b):
    low, high = 1, min(a, b) + 1
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        if can_distribute(mid):
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `low` is equal to `min(a, b) + 1`, `high` is equal to `min(a, b) + 1`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers representing the number of plates and pieces of the two cakes. If the loop executed, it implies that `low` was initially less than `high`, and the maximum number of plates that can be distributed is `min(a, b)`. If `low` equals `high`, it indicates that the maximum number of plates has been determined.
    return low - 1
    #The program returns low - 1, where low is equal to min(a, b) + 1, indicating the maximum number of plates that can be distributed is min(a, b). Therefore, the output is min(a, b).

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers representing the number of pieces of two cakes, and n is a positive integer representing the number of plates, such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b.
def can_distribute(x):
    return a // x + b // x >= n
    #The program returns a boolean expression indicating whether the sum of pieces of cake a (divided by x) and pieces of cake b (divided by x) is greater than or equal to the number of plates n, where a and b are non-negative integers representing the number of pieces of two cakes, and n is a positive integer representing the number of plates.


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
