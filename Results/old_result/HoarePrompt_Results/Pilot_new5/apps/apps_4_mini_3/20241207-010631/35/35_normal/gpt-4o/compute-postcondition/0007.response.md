Postcondition: ***`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers representing the number of plates and pieces of two cakes respectively. If `can_distribute(mid)` returns true, then `low` is either 2 or 3, `high` is `min(a, b) + 1`, and `mid` is either 1 or 2. Otherwise, `low` remains 1, `high` equals `mid` which is either 1 or 2, and it is not possible to distribute `mid` plates among the pieces of cake.***
