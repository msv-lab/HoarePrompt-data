The value of `x` is assigned the minimum of `n`, `a`, and `b`. Since `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers with values taken from input, the specific values will determine the value of `x`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (value from input), `a` is an integer (value from input), `b` is an integer (value from input), `x` is min(n, a, b)**
