The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers; `x` is a minimum of `n`, `a`, and `b` that has been decremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
