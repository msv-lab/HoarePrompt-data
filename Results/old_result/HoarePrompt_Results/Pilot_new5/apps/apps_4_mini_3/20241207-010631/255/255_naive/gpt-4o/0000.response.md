Correctness: **False**.

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations needed to delete the entire string. The main issue is that it only counts the transitions between different characters in the string instead of properly accounting for contiguous substrings of identical characters.

For example, consider the input:

Input:
```
4
aaaa
```

In this case, the minimum number of operations needed to delete the string "aaaa" is 1 (since we can delete the entire substring "aaaa" in one operation). However, the program would output 1 because it starts with `operations = 1` and does not increment based on the conditions given.

Another case is:

Input:
```
5
aabbc
```

For "aabbc", the minimum operations are 3 (delete "aa", then "bb", and finally "c"). The program would incorrectly output 4 because it counts each change from 'a' to 'b' and from 'b' to 'c'.

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements specified in the problem description, confirming that it is incorrect.
