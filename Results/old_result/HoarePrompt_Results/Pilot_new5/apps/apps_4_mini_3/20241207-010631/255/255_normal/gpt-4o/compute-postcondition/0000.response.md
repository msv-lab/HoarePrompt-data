The variable `n` is reassigned the value of `int(input())`, which means it will now hold an integer value provided by the user. The initial state defined that `n` was an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 500 \), but the specific value before this code execution is unknown as it is dependent on user input. The string `s` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the user's input (1 <= n <= 500), `s` is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters**.
