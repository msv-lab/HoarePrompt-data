The value of `operations` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `operations` was 1, so after the operation, `operations` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be at least 2, `s` is an input string of length `n`, `operations` is 2, `i` is 1, and the current value of `s[i]` is not equal to the current value of `s[i - 1]`.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `s` is an input string of length `n`, `operations` is 2, `i` is 1, and the current value of `s[i]` is not equal to the current value of `s[i - 1]**.
