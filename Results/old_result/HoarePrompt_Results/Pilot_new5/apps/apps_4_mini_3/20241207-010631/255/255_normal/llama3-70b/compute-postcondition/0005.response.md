The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ans` is 1, so the new value of `ans` becomes 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `s` is the user-entered string, `ans` is 2, and the character at index `i` of `s` is not equal to the character at index `i - 1` of `s`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `s` is the user-entered string, `ans` is 2, and the character at index `i` of `s` is not equal to the character at index `i - 1` of `s.**
