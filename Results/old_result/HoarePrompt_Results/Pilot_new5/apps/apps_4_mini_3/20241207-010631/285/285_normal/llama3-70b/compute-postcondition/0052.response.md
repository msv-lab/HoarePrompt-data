The command `exit()` terminates the program execution but does not affect the values of the variables. Therefore, the states of the variables remain unchanged. The output state will reflect that the program has exited after printing 'YES'.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 4938254; `a` is 2; `b` is 2; `c` is equal to `(n - 2469046) // 1234; and 'YES' is printed.**
