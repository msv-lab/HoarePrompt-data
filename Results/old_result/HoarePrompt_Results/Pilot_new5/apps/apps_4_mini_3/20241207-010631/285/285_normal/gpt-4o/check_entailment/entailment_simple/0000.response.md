Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program accepts a single integer `n`, which represents the initial game-coin score, within the allowed range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\).

2. **Cost Definitions**: The costs for houses, cars, and computers are defined correctly as:
   - House cost: 1,234,567 game-coins
   - Car cost: 123,456 game-coins
   - Computer cost: 1,234 game-coins

3. **Iterative Checks**: The program uses nested loops to explore possible combinations of houses (`a`) and cars (`b`) within the budget `n`. 
   - The outer loop iterates over the number of houses (`a`), ranging from 0 up to the maximum number of houses that can be purchased with `n`.
   - The inner loop iterates over the number of cars (`b`) that can be purchased with the remaining coins after buying `a` houses.

4. **Remaining Coins Check**: After determining how many houses and cars can be bought, the program checks if the remaining coins (after purchasing the houses and cars) can be exactly divided by the cost of a computer. This is done using the modulus operation:
   - `if remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0:`
   If this condition is met, it indicates that there exists a non-negative integer `c` (number of computers) that can be purchased with the remaining coins.

5. **Correct Output**: If any combination of `a`, `b`, and `c` (where `c` is derived from the remaining coins) meets the condition, the program returns 'YES'. If the loops complete without finding such a combination, it returns 'NO'.

6. **Completeness**: The program checks all possible combinations of houses and cars that could be purchased with `n`, ensuring that all potential ways to spend `n` game-coins are considered. 

Overall, the program accurately implements a solution to the problem as described, accounting for all valid cases. Thus, it meets the requirements of the problem description.
