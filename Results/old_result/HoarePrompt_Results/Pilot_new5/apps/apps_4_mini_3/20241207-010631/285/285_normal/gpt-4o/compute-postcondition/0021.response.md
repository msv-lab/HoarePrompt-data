To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the provided conditions:

1. `remaining_after_houses` is defined as `n - house_cost`. This means that `remaining_after_houses` should be a non-negative value for the loop to make sense. Therefore, `n` must be greater than or equal to `house_cost`.

2. The loop iterates with `b` ranging from `0` to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`. For the loop to execute at least once, `remaining_after_houses // car_cost` must be at least `0`. This is guaranteed if `remaining_after_houses` is non-negative and `car_cost` is greater than `0`.

3. Given that `car_cost` is defined to be greater than `0` and less than or equal to `n`, this condition ensures that `remaining_after_houses` can be divided by `car_cost`.

Now, we need to state what conditions must be satisfied to ensure the loop executes.

State: **`n` is at least `1234567`, `house_cost` must be less than or equal to `n`, `remaining_after_houses` is non-negative, `car_cost` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `n`, `b` is 0**.
