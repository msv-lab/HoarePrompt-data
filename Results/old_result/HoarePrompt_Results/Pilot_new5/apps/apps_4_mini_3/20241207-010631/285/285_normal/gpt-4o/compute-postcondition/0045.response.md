Postcondition: ***`n` is at least `1234567`, `house_cost` is less than or equal to `n`, `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n - (k + 1) * house_cost`, `car_cost` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `n`, `b` is 1, `remaining_after_houses` is greater than or equal to `car_cost`, `n` is greater than `house_cost * (k + 1)`, and `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `remaining_after_houses - car_cost`. If `remaining_after_cars` is divisible by `computer_cost`, the program returns 'YES', indicating that the conditions for purchasing houses and cars are satisfied. Otherwise, the program does not return 'YES'.***
