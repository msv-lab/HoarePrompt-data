The code snippet provided executes a print statement. It does not change any of the variable values, and therefore, the output is simply the string 'YES'. The variables retain their previous values. The Output State reflects this unchanged state along with the print action.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `a` is 0; `b` is 1; `c` is equal to `(n - 123456) // 1234; 'YES' has been printed**.
