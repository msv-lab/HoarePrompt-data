Postcondition: ***`n` is at least `1234567`, `house_cost` is less than or equal to `n`, `remaining_after_houses` is non-negative, `car_cost` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `n`, `b` is 1, and `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `remaining_after_houses - car_cost` and is not divisible by `computer_cost`. If `remaining_after_cars` is divisible by `computer_cost`, the program returns 'YES'.***
