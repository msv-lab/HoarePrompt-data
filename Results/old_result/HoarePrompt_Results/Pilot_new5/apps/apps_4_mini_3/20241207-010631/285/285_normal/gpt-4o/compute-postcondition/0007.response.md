Postcondition: ***`n` is at least `1234567`, `a` is `0`, `remaining_after_houses` equals `n`, `car_cost` is greater than `0` and less than or equal to `1234567`, `b` is `0`, `remaining_after_cars` equals `n`, and `remaining_after_cars` is divisible by `computer_cost` (i.e., `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0`).***
