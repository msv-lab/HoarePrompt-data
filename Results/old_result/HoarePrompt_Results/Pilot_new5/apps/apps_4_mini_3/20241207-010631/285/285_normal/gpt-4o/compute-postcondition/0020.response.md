The variable `remaining_after_houses` is updated to reflect the new value after subtracting the cost of `a` houses from `n`. Given that `a` is 1 and `remaining_after_houses` is initially equal to `n`, the updated value will be `remaining_after_houses = n - house_cost`. The other variables remain unchanged in their definitions.

Output State: **`n` is at least `1234567`, `a` is 1, `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n - house_cost`, `car_cost` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `n`, `b` is equal to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`, `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `n - (remaining_after_houses // car_cost) * car_cost**
