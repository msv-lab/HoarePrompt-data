Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n`, which represents Kolya's initial game-coin score, adhering to the constraint \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\).

2. **Iterative Search**: The program uses two nested loops to iterate over possible values for `a` (houses) and `b` (cars). The outer loop iterates over possible counts of houses that Kolya could buy, with the maximum number of houses being determined by \(n // 1234567\). The inner loop determines the maximum number of cars by reducing the remaining coins after buying `a` houses.

3. **Computers Calculation**: For each combination of `a` and `b`, the program calculates the remaining coins after subtracting the total spent on houses and cars. It then computes how many computers could be bought with the remaining coins, ensuring that `c` is non-negative.

4. **Exact Match Check**: The condition `if a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234 == n` checks whether the total spent matches the initial score `n`. If a valid combination is found, it prints 'YES' and exits.

5. **Exhaustive Exploration**: If no valid combination is found after exhausting all possibilities for `a` and `b`, the program prints 'NO'.

The program correctly encapsulates the logic required to determine if the total score `n` can be constructed using non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c` for the given prices of the houses, cars, and computers respectively. Thus, it aligns perfectly with the problem requirements.

Overall, the program is capable of checking all possible combinations within the allowed range of `n`, and it produces the appropriate "YES" or "NO" output based on whether `n` can be expressed as the desired linear combination. Therefore, it adheres strictly to the problem description, confirming its correctness.
