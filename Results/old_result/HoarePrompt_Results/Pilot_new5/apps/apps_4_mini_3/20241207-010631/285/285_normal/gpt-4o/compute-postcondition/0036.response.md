The variable `remaining_after_houses` is assigned the value of `n - a * house_cost`. The initial state provides that `a` is equal to `k + 1`, so we can substitute that into our calculation. Thus, the new value of `remaining_after_houses` will be calculated based on the values of `n`, `k`, and `house_cost`. 

Other variables in the initial state remain unchanged:

- `n` is at least `1234567`
- `house_cost` must be less than or equal to `n`
- `remaining_after_houses` is now updated
- `car_cost` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `n`
- `b` is equal to the maximum number of cars that can be purchased without exceeding `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`
- `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`
- `a` is equal to `k + 1`
- `n` must be greater than `house_cost * (k + 1)`

Output State: **`n` is at least `1234567`, `house_cost` must be less than or equal to `n`, `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n - (k + 1) * house_cost`, `car_cost` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `n`, `b` is equal to the maximum number of cars that can be purchased without exceeding `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`, `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`, `a` is equal to `k + 1`, and `n` must be greater than `house_cost * (k + 1)`.**
