To determine what needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we must analyze the provided state and the for loop condition.

1. The loop is structured as `for b in range(remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1):`. For the loop to execute, the expression `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1` must be greater than 0.
2. The variable `remaining_after_houses` is defined as `remaining_after_houses = n - (k + 1) * house_cost`. 
   - For `remaining_after_houses` to be positive, we need `n > (k + 1) * house_cost`. This condition is already stated as `n must be greater than house_cost * (k + 1)`, so this part is satisfied.
3. Additionally, since `car_cost` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `n`, it implies that `remaining_after_houses // car_cost` must also yield a non-negative integer.
4. If `remaining_after_houses` is positive and `car_cost` is also positive, then `remaining_after_houses // car_cost` will yield a non-negative integer, ensuring that the expression `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1` will be at least 1.

Given that all the conditions specified in the original state are satisfied, we can conclude:

- `b` will start at 0 (since Python's `range` function starts at the first integer, which is 0).
- The loop will iterate as long as `b` is less than or equal to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`.

Thus, the necessary states for the loop to execute are as follows:

State: **`n` is at least `1234567`, `house_cost` must be less than or equal to `n`, `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n - (k + 1) * house_cost`, `car_cost` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `n`, `b` is 0, `remaining_after_houses` must be greater than or equal to `car_cost`, `n` must be greater than `house_cost * (k + 1)`**
