Postcondition: ***`n` is at least `1234567`, `house_cost` is less than or equal to `n`, and `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n - (k + 1) * house_cost`. `car_cost` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `n`, `b` is 2, `remaining_after_houses` is greater than or equal to `2 * car_cost`, and `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `remaining_after_houses - 2 * car_cost`. If `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0`, the program returns 'YES', indicating sufficient funds remain after purchasing houses to afford 2 cars at the specified costs.***
