The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. No variables are modified, and no assignments occur. The output state reflects that the program exits without modifying the values of any variables. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer that is at least 1234567; `a` is 1; `b` is 1; `c` is equal to (n - 1234567 - 123456) // 1234; the program exits.**
