To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished executing, we need to analyze the range of values for `b` and the resulting calculations for `c` based on the conditions provided.

The loop iterates `b` from `0` to `(n - a * 1234567) // 123456 + 1`. Given that `a` is always `2`, we can calculate the maximum possible value for `b`:

- The maximum value for `b` occurs when:
  \[
  b_{\text{max}} = \left(\frac{n - 2469134}{123456}\right) + 1
  \]
  
This means that the loop can execute as long as `n` is sufficiently large to accommodate values for `b`.

For the output state after all iterations of the loop:

1. If the loop executes, the values of `b` will reach the maximum defined by the loop condition, and hence:
   - The last value of `b` will be `b_{\text{max}}`.
   - The calculation for `c` will be:
     \[
     c = \left(\frac{n - 2469134 - b_{\text{max}} \times 123456}{1234}\right)
     \]

2. The condition for printing "YES" is that:
   \[
   a \times 1234567 + b \times 123456 + c \times 1234 = n
   \]
   This condition must hold true for at least one of the values of `b` that the loop iterates over.

3. If `n` is less than `2 * 1234567`, the loop does not execute, and the values remain as initially defined.

Thus, summarizing these points, we can state the final output state after all iterations of the loop have executed:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer that is at least `2 * 1234567`, `a` is 2, `b` is the maximum value determined by `(n - 2469134) // 123456`, `c` is the result of `(n - 2469134 - b * 123456) // 1234` calculated using the maximum `b`. If the condition `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234` equals `n`, then 'YES' has been printed.**
