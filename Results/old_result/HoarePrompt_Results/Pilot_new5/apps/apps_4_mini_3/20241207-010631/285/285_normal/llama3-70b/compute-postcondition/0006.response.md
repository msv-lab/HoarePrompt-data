The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables do not change, but the program will cease execution and not return any further output. Therefore, the output state retains all the previous variable conditions without any updates to their values.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is 0, `b` is 0, `c` is equal to `n // 1234`, the expression `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234` equals `n`, and 'YES' has been printed. The program execution has been terminated.**
