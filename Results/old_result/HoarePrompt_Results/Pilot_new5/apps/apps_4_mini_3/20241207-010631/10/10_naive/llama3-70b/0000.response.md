To evaluate the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step and consider potential edge cases.

### Overview of the Program:
1. The program reads the number of sofas and their coordinates, then it reads counts for sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of Grandpa Maks's sofa.
2. It defines a function `func_1` which counts how many sofas are positioned relative to a given sofa (left, right, top, bottom).
3. The program checks each sofa to see if it matches the provided counts and prints the index of the first matching sofa or -1 if none match.

### Potential Issues to Consider:
1. **Incorrect Coordinate Comparisons**: The function `func_1` checks the coordinates of the sofas to determine their relative positions. However, it only compares based on the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the top-left corner of the sofas. This is problematic because the coordinates provided could represent either the upper or lower part of a sofa, leading to incorrect counting.
   
2. **Handling of Adjacent Sofas**: If two sofas share a side but are treated as separate entities, the program may miscount the counts for left/right/top/bottom neighbors. The conditions in `func_1` might not correctly account for when sofas are adjacent vertically or horizontally.

3. **Edge Cases with Bounds**: The program does not handle scenarios where counts are at their maximum or minimum bounds. For instance, if `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are all zero, there must be a sofa with no neighbors at all, which could easily be missed by the current logic.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Let's consider a scenario:

- **Input**:
    ```
    3
    3 3
    1 1 1 2
    1 2 1 3
    2 1 2 2
    0 2 0 0
    ```
This input has:
- Sofa 1: Cells (1,1) and (1,2)
- Sofa 2: Cells (1,2) and (1,3)
- Sofa 3: Cells (2,1) and (2,2)

The expected counts are `0` to the left, `2` to the right, `0` above, and `0` below. However, it is impossible for any sofa to satisfy this condition based on this configuration, as all sofas are either adjacent or overlapped. The program will output -1 correctly, but it may also incorrectly identify a sofa as satisfying the conditions due to its simplistic checking logic.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the program and considering potential edge cases, it is clear that the program has flaws in its logic regarding counting the sofas' relative positions accurately. 

Correctness: **False**.
