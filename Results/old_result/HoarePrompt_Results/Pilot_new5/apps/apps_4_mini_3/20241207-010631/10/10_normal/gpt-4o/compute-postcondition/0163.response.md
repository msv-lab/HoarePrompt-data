The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `right_count[i]`, `left_count[i]`, `bottom_count[i]`, `top_count[i]` represent the counts of sofas as defined, `target_sofa` is `d + 1`, `i` is `d` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
