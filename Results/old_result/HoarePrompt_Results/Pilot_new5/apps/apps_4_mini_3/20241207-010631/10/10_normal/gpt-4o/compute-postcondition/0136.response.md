Postcondition: ***`right_count[i]`, `left_count[i]`, `bottom_count[i]`, and `top_count[i]` remain unchanged unless `y1 > y2_j` and `y2 > y2_j`, in which case `top_count[i]` is incremented by 1. If `y1 < y1_j` and `y2 < y1_j`, then `right_count[i]`, `left_count[i]`, and `bottom_count[i]` are incremented by 1. Otherwise, all counts remain unchanged, and `i`, `j`, and `d` remain unchanged with `d` still greater than `j + 1`, while `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` also remain unchanged.***
