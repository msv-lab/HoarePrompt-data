Postcondition: ***`sofa` is an integer (1 ≤ sofa ≤ 100000) and `sofas` is a list containing at least one tuple. If `s` does not equal `sofa`, and the first element of the first tuple in `sofa` is greater than the first element of the first tuple in `s` while the second element of the first tuple in `sofa` is equal to the second element of the first tuple in `s`, then `left`, `top`, and `right` are set to 1, while `bottom` remains 0. If these conditions are not satisfied, the values of `left`, `top`, `bottom`, and `right` remain unchanged (with `right` equal to 0).***
