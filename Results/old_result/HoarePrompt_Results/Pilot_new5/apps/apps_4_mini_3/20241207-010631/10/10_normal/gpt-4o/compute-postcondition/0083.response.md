Postcondition: ***`y1` is greater than `y2_j`, `y2` is greater than `y2_j`, `bottom_count[i]` is incremented by 1, `top_count[i]` is incremented by 1, `right_count[i]` and `left_count[i]` remain unchanged, `j` is incremented by 1, and `d` is greater than `j + 1`. If `i` is equal to `j`, the current iteration of the loop is skipped.***
