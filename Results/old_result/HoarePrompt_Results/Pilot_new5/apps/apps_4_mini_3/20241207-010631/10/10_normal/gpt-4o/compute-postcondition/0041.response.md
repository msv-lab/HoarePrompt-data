The value of `right_count[i]` is incremented by 1. The variable `i` is currently 1, so `right_count[1]` will be incremented by 1. The other variables `d`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, and `x2`, `y2` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`d` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are all assigned the values from `sofas[0]`, `right_count[1]` is incremented by 1.**
