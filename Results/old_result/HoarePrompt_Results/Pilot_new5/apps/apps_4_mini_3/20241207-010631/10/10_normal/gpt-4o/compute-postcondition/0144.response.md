Postcondition: ***`right_count[i]` is incremented by 1 if `x1` is less than `x1_j` and `x2` is less than `x1_j`, `left_count[i]` is incremented by 1, while `bottom_count[i]`, `top_count[i]`, `i`, `d`, `j`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` remain unchanged. If `x1 > x2_j` and `x2 > x2_j`, the aforementioned conditions apply.***
