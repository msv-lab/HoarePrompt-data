Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because the `func_1` function does not properly calculate the counts of sofas relative to the specified sofa. Specifically, it only checks for sofas that share the same row or column, which is not sufficient to determine the relative positions of sofas in the manner specified in the problem description.

### Issues in the Code:

1. **Incorrect Condition Checks**: 
   - The function checks if the coordinates (x1, y1) of the current sofa are compared to the coordinates of other sofas (x1, y1) only. This does not account for the fact that each sofa occupies two adjacent cells defined by their coordinates.
   - For example, if the two coordinates of a sofa are (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), then to check if another sofa is to the left, right, top, or bottom, it should consider both cells. The current implementation fails to do this.

2. **Sofa Representation**:
   - The function should be using the full representation of each sofa (both coordinates) to properly ascertain whether one sofa is to the left, right, above, or below another. The current comparison only looks at the first coordinate pair.

3. **Logical Errors**:
   - The `if` statements checking for left, right, top, and bottom conditions are not properly formulated to handle the relationships between two distinct sofas correctly. 
   - The logic should ensure that both parts of the sofa are considered when determining their relative positions.

### Example of Incorrect Behavior:
For the input:
```
2
3 2
3 1 3 2
1 2 2 2
1 0 0 1
```
According to the problem description, for the first sofa, the counts should reflect its position relative to the second sofa:
- The first sofa has 0 to its left, 2 to its right (the second sofa is to the right), 0 to its top, and 2 to its bottom (the second sofa is below).
- However, the given implementation would not yield the correct counts because it improperly checks the coordinates based on shared row or column logic without considering two cells of the sofa.

Therefore, the program does not fulfill the requirements set out in the problem description, leading to incorrect outputs in various scenarios. 

In conclusion, since the program does not correctly implement the logic needed to determine the relative positions of the sofas, it fails to fully comply with the problem requirements.
