According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `d`. If `d` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `d` must be greater than 0, so for the loop to be executed one more time, `d` must be decreased by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `d` must be greater than 1. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `sofas`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`) remain unchanged.

State: **`d` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input positive integer, `m` is an input positive integer, `sofas` is a list containing the tuple (x1, y1, x2, y2)**
