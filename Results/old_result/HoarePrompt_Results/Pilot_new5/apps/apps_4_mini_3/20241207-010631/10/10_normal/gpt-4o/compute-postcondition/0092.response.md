Postcondition: ***`y1` is greater than `y2_j`, `y2` is greater than `y2_j`, `bottom_count[i]` is incremented by 1, `top_count[i]` is incremented by 1, `right_count[i]` is incremented by 1, `left_count[i]` remains unchanged, `j` is incremented by 1, `d` is greater than `j + 1`, and `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned the values from `sofas[j]` if `y1 < y1_j` and `y2 < y1_j`.***
