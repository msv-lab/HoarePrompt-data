According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `d`. If `d` is greater than 1, the loop can execute once more. At the end of the last iteration, `d` must be greater than 1, indicating that it could be 2 or more. Thus, for the loop to execute one additional time, `d` will need to be decremented by 1, making it 1 or greater. Since the loop runs `d` times, after the current iteration, `d` should be reduced to 1 while maintaining the values of `n`, `m`, and `sofas` as they are.

State: **`d` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input positive integer, `m` is an input positive integer, `sofas` is a list containing the previous tuples plus (x1, y1, x2, y2)**
