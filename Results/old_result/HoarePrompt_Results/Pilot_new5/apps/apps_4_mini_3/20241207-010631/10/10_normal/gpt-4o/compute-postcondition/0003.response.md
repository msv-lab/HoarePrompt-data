According to the code, the loop will execute `d` times. For the loop to execute, `d` must be at least 1. The variables `n`, `m`, and `sofas` do not affect the execution of the loop itself, but given that `sofas` is initialized as an empty list, it may be expected to be modified within the loop.

To ensure that the loop executes, `d` must be greater than 0, and the loop variable (which is not used in the loop body) will take on values from 0 to `d - 1`. 

Thus, the necessary adjustments to the state before the loop is executed are:
State: **`d` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input positive integer, `m` is an input positive integer, `sofas` is an empty list**.
