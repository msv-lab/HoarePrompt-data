The function `func` accepts parameters that are implicitly defined within its structure. It does not take any arguments directly, but it operates on the following inputs:

1. `d`: a positive integer representing the number of sofas (1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5).
2. `n`: a positive integer representing the width dimension of the storehouse (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5).
3. `m`: a positive integer representing the height dimension of the storehouse (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5).
4. For each of the `d` sofas, there are four integers (x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2) which represent the coordinates of the sofa (1 ≤ x_1, x_2 ≤ n, 1 ≤ y_1, y_2 ≤ m).
5. Finally, the function processes four integers (cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b) which represent the counts of sofas around Grandpa Maks's sofa (0 ≤ cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b ≤ d - 1).

Based on the processing of these inputs, the function likely performs calculations or checks related to the positioning or counting of sofas within the storehouse.

Functionality: **The function operates on the number of sofas, the dimensions of the storehouse, the coordinates of each sofa, and the counts of sofas around Grandpa Maks's sofa, but does not accept parameters directly.**
