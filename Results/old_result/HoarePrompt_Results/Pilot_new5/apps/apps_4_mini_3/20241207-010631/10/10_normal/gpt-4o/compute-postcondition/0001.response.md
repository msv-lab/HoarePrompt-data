The line of code `n, m = map(int, input().strip().split())` takes input from the user and splits it into two integers, assigning them to `n` and `m`. Since `n` and `m` are both positive integers, their values are updated based on the input provided. The initial conditions of `d`, as well as any other variables, remain valid.

Output State: **`d` is an input integer representing the number of sofas; `n` is an input positive integer; `m` is an input positive integer.**
