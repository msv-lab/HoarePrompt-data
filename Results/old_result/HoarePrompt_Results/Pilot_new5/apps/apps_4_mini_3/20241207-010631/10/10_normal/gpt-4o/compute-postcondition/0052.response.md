The variable `j` is incremented by 1, and `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are assigned the values from `sofas[j]`. The values of `y1`, `y2`, `y1_j`, `y2_j`, `d`, and `i` remain unchanged, while `j` has a new value based on the increment and the assignment from `sofas[j]`.

Output State: **`y1`, `y2`, `y1_j`, `y2_j` maintain their respective values; `d` remains unchanged; `i` remains unchanged; `j` is incremented by 1; `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned the values from `sofas[j]`.**
