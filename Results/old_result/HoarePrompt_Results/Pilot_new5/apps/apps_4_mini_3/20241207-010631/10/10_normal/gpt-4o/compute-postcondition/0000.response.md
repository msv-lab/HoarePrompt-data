The variable `d` is assigned the value `int(input().strip())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Other variables (`n`, `m`, `x_1`, `y_1`, `x_2`, `y_2`, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes that `d` is now an input integer representing the number of sofas.

Output State: **`d` is an input integer representing the number of sofas; `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000); `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000); each of the next `d` lines contains four integers (x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2) such that (1 ≤ x_1, x_2 ≤ n, 1 ≤ y_1, y_2 ≤ m); the last line contains four integers (cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b) such that (0 ≤ cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b ≤ d - 1).**
