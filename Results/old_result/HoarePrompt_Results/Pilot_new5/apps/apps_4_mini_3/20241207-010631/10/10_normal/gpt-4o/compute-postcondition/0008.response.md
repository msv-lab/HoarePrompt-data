The code appends a tuple (x1, y1, x2, y2) to the list `sofas`. The values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are assigned from input but their specific values are not provided in the initial state. Other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `sofas` now contains an additional tuple.

Output State: **`d` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input positive integer, `m` is an input positive integer, `sofas` is a list containing the previous tuples plus (x1, y1, x2, y2)**
