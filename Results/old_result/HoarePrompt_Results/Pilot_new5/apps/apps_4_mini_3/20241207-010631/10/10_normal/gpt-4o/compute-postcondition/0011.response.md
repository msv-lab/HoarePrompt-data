The code `sofas.append((x1, y1, x2, y2))` adds a new tuple containing the values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` to the list `sofas`. The initial state indicates that `sofas` contains previous tuples, but it does not specify what those tuples are. The values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are expected to be input integers.

Therefore, the output state should reflect that `sofas` has been updated to include the new tuple while maintaining the conditions of the other variables.

Output State: **`d` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input positive integer, `m` is an input positive integer, `sofas` is a list containing the previous tuples plus (x1, y1, x2, y2).**
