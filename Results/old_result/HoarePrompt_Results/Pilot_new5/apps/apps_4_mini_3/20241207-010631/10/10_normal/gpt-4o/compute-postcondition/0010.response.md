In this code, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are assigned values based on input. The values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` will depend on user input and will be integers. The other variables are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State will include the updated values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` based on the input provided. 

Output State: **`d` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input positive integer, `m` is an input positive integer, `sofas` is a list containing the previous tuples plus (x1, y1, x2, y2), where x1, y1, x2, y2 are input integers.**
