Postcondition: ***`d` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are all assigned the values from `sofas[0]`. The current values of `y1` and `y2` are both less than `y1_j`. If `x1` is greater than `x2_j` and `x2` is greater than `x2_j`, then `right_count[0]` is incremented by 1 if `x1 < x1_j` and `x2 < x1_j`, and `left_count[i]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the values of `d`, `i`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `right_count[0]`, and `left_count[i]` remain unchanged.***
