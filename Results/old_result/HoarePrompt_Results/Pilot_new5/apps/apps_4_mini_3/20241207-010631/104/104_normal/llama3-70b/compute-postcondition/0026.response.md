Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `i` is 1, `max_erase` is the maximum number of consecutive elements that can be erased from `a` starting at index `i`, `j` is `n`, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where `1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000. If the condition `all(a[k] - a[i] == k - i for k in range(i, j))` holds true for some value of `j`, then `max_erase` could be updated based on the maximum consecutive sequence found; otherwise, it remains equal to its initial value or the highest value found during the iterations.**
