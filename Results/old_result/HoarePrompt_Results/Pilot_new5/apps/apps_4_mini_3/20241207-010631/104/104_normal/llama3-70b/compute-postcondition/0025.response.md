Postcondition: ***`n` must be at least 4, `i` is 1, `j` is 4. If the condition holds true that for all `k` in the range from `i` to `j`, the difference `a[k] - a[i]` equals `k - i`, then `max_erase` is updated to the maximum of its current value and 2. If the condition does not hold, no changes are made.***
