The variable `a` is assigned the value of a list created from the integer inputs provided, where the inputs are separated by spaces. The variable `n` remains a positive integer in the range of 1 to 100, but `a` will now contain exactly `n` integers, which are specified by the user. These integers will still satisfy the condition `1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000`, given that the user input conforms to these constraints.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers where `1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000`, and `a` is an input list of integers from the user.**
