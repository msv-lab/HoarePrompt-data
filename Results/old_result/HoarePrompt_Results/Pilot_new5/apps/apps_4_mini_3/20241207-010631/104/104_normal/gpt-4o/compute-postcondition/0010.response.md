The code snippet provided simply prints the value of `max_erase`. Since `max_erase` is not altered by the print statement, its value remains unchanged. Thus, the output state will reflect the unchanged values of the variables.

Output State: **`max_erase` is the maximum gap between consecutive integers in `a` minus 1; `n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000.**
