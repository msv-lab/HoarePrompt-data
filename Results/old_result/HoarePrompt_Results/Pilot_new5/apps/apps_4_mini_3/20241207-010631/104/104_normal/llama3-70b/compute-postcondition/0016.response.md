According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop starts at `i + 1` and goes up to `n + 1`. Since `i` is equal to 1, the loop will start at index 2 (`1 + 1`) and end at `n + 1`. 

To ensure that the loop can execute, the following conditions must hold:
- `n` must be at least 2 (because it starts at `i + 1`, which is 2), allowing for at least one iteration of the loop when `j` starts from 2 and goes to at most `n + 1`.
- `j` will be initialized to 2 when the loop starts (since `j` initially is equal to `n`).

Thus, to modify the states accordingly for the loop to execute, we can summarize as follows:

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 1, `max_erase` is the maximum number of consecutive elements that can be erased from `a`, `j` is 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000**
