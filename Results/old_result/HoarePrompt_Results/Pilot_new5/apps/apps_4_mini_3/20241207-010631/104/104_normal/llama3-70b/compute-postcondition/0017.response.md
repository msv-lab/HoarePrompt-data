Postcondition: ***`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 1, `max_erase` is the maximum number of consecutive elements that can be erased from `a`, `j` is 2, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where `1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000. The elements at indices from `i` to `j-1` in `a` are consecutive, meaning that the difference between each consecutive element is equal to the difference in their indices (i.e., `a[1] - a[1] == 1 - 1` and `a[2] - a[1] == 2 - 1`).***
