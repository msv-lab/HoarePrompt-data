According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop iterates with `j` starting from `i + 1` which is 3 (since `i` is 2), and goes up to `n + 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `j` is 4. To execute the loop one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will become 5 in the next iteration.

For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than or equal to `n + 1`. Given that `n` is a positive integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 100, the maximum value for `j` in the next iteration (which is 5) must satisfy `5 <= n + 1`, meaning `n` must be at least 4 for this condition to hold.

Thus, after adjusting for the next iteration, the states should reflect these changes:

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 100, `i` is 2, `j` is 5, if the condition `all((a[k] - a[i] == k - i for k in range(i, j)))` is true, then `max_erase` is updated to max(previous `max_erase`, 1). Otherwise, `max_erase` remains unchanged.**
