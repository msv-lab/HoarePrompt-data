The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `arr` is a sorted list of `n` input integers; `num` is the next element in `arr` after the current one; `mex` is unchanged unless `num` equals `mex` in the next iteration, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
