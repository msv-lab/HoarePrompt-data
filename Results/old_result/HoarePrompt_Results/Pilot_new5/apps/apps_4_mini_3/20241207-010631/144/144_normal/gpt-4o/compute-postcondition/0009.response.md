The value of `mex` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `mex` is unknown. The states of the other variables (`n`, `a`, and `num`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers that must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element in the list `a`, and `mex` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers that must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element in the list `a`, `mex` is increased by 1.**
