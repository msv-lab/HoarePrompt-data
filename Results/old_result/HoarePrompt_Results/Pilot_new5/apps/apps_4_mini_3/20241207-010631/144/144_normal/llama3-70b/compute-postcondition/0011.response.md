Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `arr` is a sorted list of `n` input integers with at least 1 element. If `num`, the first element in `arr`, is equal to `mex`, then `mex` is incremented by 1. If `num` is not equal to `mex` and `num` is greater than `mex`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
