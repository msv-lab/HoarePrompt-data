To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to verify that it accurately computes the maximum possible value of the mex for any array configuration under the constraints given by the problem description.

### Understanding the Problem
The problem is asking for the maximum possible mex of a modified array \( b \) that can be formed from a given array \( a \). The key points are:
1. You can decrease any element in \( a \) to any smaller positive integer.
2. The maximum value of mex is determined by ensuring that all integers from 1 up to some maximum are included in \( b \).

### Analysis of the Program
1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads an integer \( n \) and a list of integers \( a \).
2. **Sorting**: The program sorts the array \( a \). This is beneficial for the logic that follows.
3. **Mex Calculation**: 
   - The variable `mex` is initialized to 1, which corresponds to the smallest positive integer we are checking for presence in \( b \).
   - The for loop iterates through each number in the sorted array \( a \):
     - If the current number \( num \) is greater than or equal to `mex`, it indicates that `mex` can be included in \( b \) (either by not reducing \( num \) or reducing some larger number).
     - The program then increments `mex` to check for the next positive integer.
4. **Output**: Finally, it prints the maximum value of `mex`.

### Why the Program is Correct
- By sorting the array, the program ensures that it checks the smallest numbers first, allowing it to increment the `mex` correctly when possible.
- The condition `if num >= mex` guarantees that we can include all integers from 1 up to the computed `mex - 1` in the resultant array \( b \). This aligns perfectly with the operations allowed (decreasing elements).
- The final value of `mex` represents the first positive integer that could not be included, thus achieving the maximum possible mex.

### Conclusion
The program effectively implements the logic required to solve the problem as outlined in the description, ensuring that it computes the maximum possible mex after applying the allowed operations on array \( a \).

Correctness: **True**
