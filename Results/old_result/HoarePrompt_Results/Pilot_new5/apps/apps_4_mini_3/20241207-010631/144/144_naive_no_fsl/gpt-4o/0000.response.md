Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum possible value of mex after Alyona applies her operations on the array. 

Here's the reasoning:

1. **Understanding of mex**: The program correctly identifies that the mex of an array is the smallest positive integer that does not appear in it.

2. **Sorting the input**: By sorting the array, the program ensures that we can efficiently check for the smallest missing positive integer in a single pass through the array.

3. **Iterating through the sorted array**: The loop checks each number in the sorted array. If the current number is greater than or equal to the current value of `mex`, it increases `mex`. This means the program is effectively tracking which positive integers can be constructed from the available numbers in the array.

4. **Performance**: The solution runs in O(n log n) time complexity due to the sorting step, which is efficient given the constraint of n up to 100,000.

5. **Edge cases**: The code takes into account that Alyona can choose not to modify any elements, as it allows for `mex` to start at 1 and potentially increment through the available integers. 

All given example cases and potential edge cases are handled correctly by the logic of the program. Thus, I find no potential case where the program fails to meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
