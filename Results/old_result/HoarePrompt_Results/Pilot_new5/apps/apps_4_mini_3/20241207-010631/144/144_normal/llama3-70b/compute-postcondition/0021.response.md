Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `arr` is a sorted list of `n` input integers; if `num` equals `mex`, then `mex` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `mex` remains unchanged unless `num` equals `mex` in the next iteration, and if `num` is greater than `mex`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
