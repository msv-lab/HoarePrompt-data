The function accepts a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000) and a list of `n` positive integers. It calculates the smallest positive integer (mex) that is not present in the list. The function sorts the list and iterates through it, incrementing `mex` whenever it finds a number equal to `mex`. If it encounters a number greater than `mex`, the loop breaks. Finally, it prints the value of `mex`.
