The value of `mex` is incremented by 1. The initial state indicates that `mex` will change only if `num` equals `mex` in the next iteration, but since that condition is not evaluated in this step, we do not need to change any values regarding that condition for this execution. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `arr` is a sorted list of `n` input integers; `num` is the next element in `arr` after the current one; `mex` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `arr` is a sorted list of `n` input integers; `num` is the next element in `arr` after the current one; `mex` is incremented by 1.**
