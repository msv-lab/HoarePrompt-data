Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `arr` is a sorted list of `n` input integers that must have at least 1 element; `num` is the first element in `arr`, which is not equal to `mex`. If `num` is greater than `mex`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
