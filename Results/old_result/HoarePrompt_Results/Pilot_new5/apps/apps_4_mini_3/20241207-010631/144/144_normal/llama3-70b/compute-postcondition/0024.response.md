The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, and `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where each element `a[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10^9. The function processes the list `a` based on its elements and returns an output based on specific conditions defined in the function. 

However, without specific output cases provided, we can't delineate the exact return values. Therefore, we can only state the accepted parameters and their constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000) and a list a of n positive integers (1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10^9).**
