The variable `mex` is incremented by 1. Since `num` is the first element in the sorted list `a`, which consists of positive integers, the current state of `num` is greater than or equal to `mex`. 

After the increment, `mex` will now be one greater than its previous value. The values of `n`, `a`, and `num` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `num` is the first element in the list `a`, and `mex` is now incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `num` is the first element in the list `a`, and `mex` is now incremented by 1.**
