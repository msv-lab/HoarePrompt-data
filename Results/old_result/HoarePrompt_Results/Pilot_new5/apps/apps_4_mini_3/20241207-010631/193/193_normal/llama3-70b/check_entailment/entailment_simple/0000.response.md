The provided program attempts to compute the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain an equilateral triangle of side length `y` from a starting side length `x`. However, it simply calculates and prints the absolute difference between `x` and `y` using `print(abs(x - y))`.

This approach is incorrect for the following reasons:

1. **Incorrect Calculation**: The absolute difference `abs(x - y)` does not account for the constraints of maintaining a non-degenerate triangle during the transformation. The program should be considering the operations needed to reduce the sides to ensure that the triangle remains valid with positive area throughout the process.

2. **Specific Operations**: The problem requires an understanding of how to manipulate the sides while ensuring that the triangle's integrity (i.e., being non-degenerate) is maintained. The program does not simulate or account for the operations that would be required to reduce the side lengths step by step to a valid configuration. 

3. **Example Counterexamples**: For example, if `x = 6` and `y = 3`, the program would output `3`, which is incorrect. The correct sequence of operations requires 4 seconds as demonstrated in the problem description.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
