The values of `x` and `y` are assigned based on the input provided. The code will take two integer inputs and assign them to `x` and `y` respectively. However, the specific values for `x` and `y` are unknown since they depend on the user input. The constraints still hold: `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`. Therefore, `x` and `y` are now specifically defined integers obeying the specified constraints.

Output State: **`3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, `x` and `y` are integers based on user input.**
