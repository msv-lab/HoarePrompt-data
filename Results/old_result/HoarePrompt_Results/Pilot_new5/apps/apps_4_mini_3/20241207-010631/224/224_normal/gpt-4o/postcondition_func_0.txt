The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 <= n <= 10^6) and a positive integer `mod`. It computes and returns the factorial of `n` modulo `mod`. The function does not handle cases where `n` is less than 2 or greater than 10^6, but given the constraints in the annotations, it is expected to work within these bounds.
