The line of code `dp[j] %= MOD` modifies the value of `dp[j]` by taking the modulo with `MOD`. The previous state indicates that `dp[j]` was updated to `dp[j] + dp[j - 1]`, and this operation will now constrain `dp[j]` to be within the bounds set by `MOD`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `f_max_n - 1`, `dp[j]` is now `dp[j] + dp[j - 1]` modulo `MOD`, and `dp[j - 1]` is `dp[f_max_n - 2]`.**
