The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `n` and `f_max_n`. The parameter `n` is an integer that should be in the range of 2 to 10^6. The parameter `f_max_n` is a non-negative integer representing the maximum value of a function f(p) among all permutations of integers from 1 to n. After executing the function body, it returns `dp[f_max_n]`, which is the sum of all original `dp[k]` for k from 0 to `f_max_n`, modulo `MOD`, provided that `f_max_n` is greater than or equal to 1. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept an integer `n` and a non-negative integer `f_max_n`, and return the sum of certain values from a dynamic programming array based on the input parameters. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) and a non-negative integer f_max_n, and returns the sum of dp[k] for k from 0 to f_max_n modulo MOD, where f_max_n is greater than or equal to 1.**
