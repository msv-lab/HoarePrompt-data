The variable `dp[j]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[j - 1]` to it. The initial values of `j` is `f_max_n - 2`, and `dp[j - 1]` is equal to `dp[f_max_n - 2]`. The values of `dp` are affected by the calculation, but the other variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `dp[j]`, while maintaining the other details of the initial conditions.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `f_max_n - 2`, `dp[j]` is `dp[j] + dp[j - 1]`, where `dp[j - 1]` is `dp[f_max_n - 2`**
