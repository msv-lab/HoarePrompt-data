Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the number of permutations of integers \(1, 2, \ldots, n\) such that \(f(p) = f_{max}(n)\). 

Here's a potential case that demonstrates the issue:

1. For \(n = 4\):
   - The expected output is not calculated correctly by the program. The maximum value \(f_{max}(4)\) should be evaluated properly based on the GCD of prefixes of different permutations.
   - However, the program directly computes \(f(p)\) for \(n = 2\) correctly, but for \(n > 2\), it calculates \(result = func_1(n - 1, MOD)\) which is essentially calculating \((n-1)!\). This is not necessarily equal to the count of permutations where \(f(p) = f_{max}(n)\).

After analyzing, we find that the program does not take into account the correct logic to compute the permutations that yield \(f(p) = f_{max}(n)\). 

Hence, the program fails for a broader set of inputs beyond those explicitly stated in the problem description and the examples given. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
