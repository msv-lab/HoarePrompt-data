According to the code, the loop iterates from `f_max_n` down to 1. The loop continues to execute as long as `j` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `f_max_n`, and since `j` is decremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be updated to `f_max_n - 1`. Additionally, the condition for the loop to continue requires that `j` remains greater than 0, which means `f_max_n` must be at least 2 (since `j` starts at `f_max_n` and is decremented). 

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- `j` will be `f_max_n - 1`
- `f_max_n` must remain greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `i` is 2, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `j` is `f_max_n - 1`, and `dp[j]` is updated to be `dp[j] % MOD` but its exact value is unknown.**
