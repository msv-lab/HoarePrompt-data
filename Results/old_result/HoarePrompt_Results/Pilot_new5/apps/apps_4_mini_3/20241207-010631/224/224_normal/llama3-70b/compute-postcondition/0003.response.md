According to the code, the loop will execute for values of `i` starting from 1 up to `n` inclusive. The only variables that need to be considered for the loop to execute are `i` and `n`. Since `n` is given to be an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\), it guarantees that `n` is at least 2, which means that the loop will have at least one execution.

At the start of the loop, `i` will initialize to 1. Therefore, since the loop condition is defined as `range(1, n + 1)`, `i` will iterate through all integers from 1 to `n` inclusive. 

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows: `i` must start at 1, and `n` must be valid as already stated (between 2 and \(10^6\)).

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `i` is 1**
