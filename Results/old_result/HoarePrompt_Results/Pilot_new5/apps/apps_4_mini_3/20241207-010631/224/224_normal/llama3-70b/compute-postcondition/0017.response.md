The line `dp[j] %= MOD` modifies the value of `dp[j]` by taking the modulo of `dp[j]` with `MOD`. The value of `dp[j]` is updated, but the exact amount of change depends on its prior value, which is not specified. 

Therefore, the output state will reflect that `dp[j]` has now been updated to be `dp[j] % MOD`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `i` is 2, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 0, and for each `j` from `f_max_n` down to 1, `dp[j]` is updated to be `dp[j] % MOD`.**
