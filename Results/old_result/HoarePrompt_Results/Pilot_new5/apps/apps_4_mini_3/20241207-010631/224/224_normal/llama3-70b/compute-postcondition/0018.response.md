According to the code, the loop will execute while `j` is greater than 0, decrementing `j` by 1 with each iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, which means the loop has completed its iterations and cannot execute again.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be set to a value greater than 0. Since `f_max_n` is mentioned to be at least 1, and the loop initializes `j` to `f_max_n`, the only way for the loop to execute again is by ensuring that `f_max_n` is at least 2, allowing `j` to start at `f_max_n` (which is at least 1).

Therefore, the state requires adjustment for `j` to be set to `f_max_n` (which should be at least 1), and `f_max_n` should be at least 2 to ensure the loop can run again since `j` would start at that value.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `i` is 2, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `j` is `f_max_n`, and for each `j` from `f_max_n` down to 1, `dp[j]` is updated to be `dp[j] % MOD`.**
