According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop starts at 2 and continues while `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 4. Since `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^6, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 4.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 10^6, `mod` is a positive integer, `result` is 6, `i` is 4**
