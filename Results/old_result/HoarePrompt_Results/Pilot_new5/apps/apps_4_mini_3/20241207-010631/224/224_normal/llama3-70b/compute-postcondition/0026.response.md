According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `f_max_n` is at least `1`. The loop starts from `f_max_n` and decrements `j` until it reaches `1`. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to `3`, which does not affect the loop execution.
- `i` is `3`, which also does not affect the loop execution.
- `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to `1`, which is crucial for the loop to execute.
- `j` is initialized to `0`, but the loop will set `j` to `f_max_n` and then decrement.

For the loop to execute, the following conditions must hold:
- `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to `1` to ensure that the loop has valid iterations.
- `j` will take the value of `f_max_n` in the first iteration, so at the start of the loop, `j` will equal `f_max_n`.

Thus, the necessary conditions for the loop to execute can be summarized as follows:

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is equal to f_max_n**
