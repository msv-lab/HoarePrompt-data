According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the variable `j` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `f_max_n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be decremented by 1, making it `f_max_n - 2`. Additionally, since `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to continue executing, `f_max_n` must still be at least 1. 

Thus, the updated states should reflect `j` being `f_max_n - 2`, and `f_max_n` should remain unchanged as long as it is still valid.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `f_max_n - 2`, `dp[j]` is now `dp[j] + dp[j - 1]` modulo `MOD`, and `dp[j - 1]` is `dp[f_max_n - 2]`**
