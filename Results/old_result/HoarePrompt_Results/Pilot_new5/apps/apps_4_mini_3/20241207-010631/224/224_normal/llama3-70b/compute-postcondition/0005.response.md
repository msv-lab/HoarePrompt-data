The code `dp[j] += dp[j - 1]` updates the value of `dp[j]` by adding to it the value of `dp[j - 1]`. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^6 \).
- `i` is 1.
- `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `j` is `f_max_n`.

The execution modifies `dp[j]`. The value of `dp[j]` is increased by the amount stored in `dp[j - 1]`, but the specifics of these values are not provided in the initial state.

Thus, while the value of `dp[j]` is updated, the values of `n`, `i`, `f_max_n`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6; `i` is 1; `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `j` is `f_max_n`; `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] + dp[j - 1]`.**
