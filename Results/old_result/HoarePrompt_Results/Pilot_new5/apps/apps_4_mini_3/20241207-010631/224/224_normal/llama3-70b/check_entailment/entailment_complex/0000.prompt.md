You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Let's define a function $f(p)$ on a permutation $p$ as follows. Let $g_i$ be the greatest common divisor (GCD) of elements $p_1$, $p_2$, ..., $p_i$ (in other words, it is the GCD of the prefix of length $i$). Then $f(p)$ is the number of distinct elements among $g_1$, $g_2$, ..., $g_n$.

Let $f_{max}(n)$ be the maximum value of $f(p)$ among all permutations $p$ of integers $1$, $2$, ..., $n$.

Given an integers $n$, count the number of permutations $p$ of integers $1$, $2$, ..., $n$, such that $f(p)$ is equal to $f_{max}(n)$. Since the answer may be large, print the remainder of its division by $1000\,000\,007 = 10^9 + 7$.


-----Input-----

The only line contains the integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^6$) — the length of the permutations.


-----Output-----

The only line should contain your answer modulo $10^9+7$.

-----Note-----

Consider the second example: these are the permutations of length $3$:  $[1,2,3]$, $f(p)=1$.  $[1,3,2]$, $f(p)=1$.  $[2,1,3]$, $f(p)=2$.  $[2,3,1]$, $f(p)=2$.  $[3,1,2]$, $f(p)=2$.  $[3,2,1]$, $f(p)=2$. 

The maximum value $f_{max}(3) = 2$, and there are $4$ permutations $p$ such that $f(p)=2$.
Annotated Functions:
n = int(input())
f_max_n = func_2(n)
print(func_3(n, f_max_n))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`, `b` is 0, and the loop executes as long as the original value of `b` is positive.
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`, where `b` is 0 and the loop does not execute since `b` is not positive.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. If `b` is initially 0, the function will immediately return `a` as the GCD. The function correctly handles all cases, including when one or both integers are zero, but it assumes that `a` and `b` are positive integers as per the initial state.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6.
def func_2(n):
    res = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        res = max(res, func_1(res, i))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^6; `res` is the maximum value among `func_1(0, 1)`, `func_1(res, 2)`, ..., `func_1(res, n)`; `i` is `n`.
    return res
    #The program returns res, which is the maximum value among func_1(0, 1), func_1(res, 2), ..., func_1(res, n)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` (where 2 <= n <= 10^6) and computes the maximum value from a sequence of calls to `func_1`, starting with `func_1(0, 1)` and subsequently passing the maximum value computed so far (`res`) along with the current index `i` for each value from 2 to `n`. It returns this maximum value after evaluating all calls.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, and f_max_n is a non-negative integer representing the maximum value of f(p) among all permutations of integers from 1 to n.
def func_3(n, f_max_n):
    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
    dp = [0] * (f_max_n + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(f_max_n, 0, -1):
            dp[j] += dp[j - 1]
            dp[j] %= MOD
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6; `i` is `n`; `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `j` is 0; `dp[j]` is the sum of all original `dp[k]` for `k` from 0 to `f_max_n` modulo `MOD`, and for each `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` is updated to be the sum of original `dp[j]` and original `dp[j - 1]`, all taken modulo `MOD`.
    return dp[f_max_n]
    #The program returns dp[f_max_n], which is the sum of all original dp[k] for k from 0 to f_max_n modulo MOD, where f_max_n is greater than or equal to 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) and a non-negative integer `f_max_n` (where f_max_n must be greater than or equal to 1), and returns the value of `dp[f_max_n]`, which represents the number of ways to select `f_max_n` items from `n` distinct items, calculated using dynamic programming and taken modulo 10^9 + 7. It does not handle the case when `f_max_n` is less than 1 correctly, as the code assumes f_max_n is at least 1.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
