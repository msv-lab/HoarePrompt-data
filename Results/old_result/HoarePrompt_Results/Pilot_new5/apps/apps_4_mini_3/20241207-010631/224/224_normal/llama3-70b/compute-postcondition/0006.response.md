In this case, the operation involves taking the value of `dp[j]` and applying the modulus operation with `MOD` to it. The previous value of `dp[j]` is not specified, but we know that `dp[j]` is updated in some way before this operation.

Since `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] + dp[j - 1]`, its new value is determined by the previous value of `dp[j]` plus `dp[j - 1]`. 

After the modulus operation, `dp[j]` will now be equal to `(dp[j] + dp[j - 1]) % MOD`.

The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6; `i` is 1; `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `j` is `f_max_n`; `dp[j]` is updated to `(dp[j] + dp[j - 1]) % MOD`.**
