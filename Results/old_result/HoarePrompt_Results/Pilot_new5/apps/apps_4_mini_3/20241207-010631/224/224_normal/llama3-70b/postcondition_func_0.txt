The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. If `b` is initially 0, the function will immediately return `a` as the GCD. The function correctly handles all cases, including when one or both integers are zero, but it assumes that `a` and `b` are positive integers as per the initial state.
