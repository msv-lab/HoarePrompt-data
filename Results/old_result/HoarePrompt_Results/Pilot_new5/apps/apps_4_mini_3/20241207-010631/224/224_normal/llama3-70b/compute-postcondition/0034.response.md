The code `dp[j] %= MOD` modifies the value of `dp[j]` to be the remainder of `dp[j]` when divided by `MOD`. The initial condition does not specify the exact values of `dp[j]` or `MOD`, but it states that `j` is equal to `f_max_n - 2`, and `f_max_n` is greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, `j` must be at least 1.

Since `dp[j]` is updated but the specific value of `dp[j]` before the operation is not known, we can't determine the exact new value of `dp[j]`, but we can say it is now equal to `dp[j] % MOD`. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `f_max_n - 2`, `dp[j]` is now `dp[j] % MOD`, where `dp[j - 1]` is `dp[f_max_n - 2`.**
