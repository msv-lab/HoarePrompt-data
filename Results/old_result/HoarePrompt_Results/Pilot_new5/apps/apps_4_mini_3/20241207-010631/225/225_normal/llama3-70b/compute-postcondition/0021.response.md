The value of `max_jump` is updated to be the maximum between its previous value and `i + 1`. The variable `i` is currently `2`, so `i + 1` equals `3`. The previous value of `max_jump` is not specified, so it remains unknown. The states of the other variables are not affected by this code. 

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `last_vowel` is 1 if the character at index 1 of `s` is a vowel, `max_jump` is updated to max(max_jump, 3)**.
