The code snippet defines a set called `vowels` consisting of the characters 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', and 'Y'. This operation does not alter any existing variables or values but introduces a new variable.

The initial state remains unchanged for the string `s`, and the variable `vowels` is newly defined. 

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, and the length of `s` does not exceed 100; `vowels` is {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}.**
