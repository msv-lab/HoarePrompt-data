To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we analyze the provided variables and their implications.

1. The loop is set to run for `i` in the range of `n`, which is the length of the string `s`. Since `s` is a non-empty string with a length between 1 and 100, `n` is guaranteed to be at least 1. This means the loop will execute at least once.

2. The variable `i` will start from 0 and increment up to `n-1`. Therefore, at the beginning of the first iteration, `i` should be 0.

3. The other variables (`max_jump` and `last_vowel`) do not affect the execution of the loop itself but may influence the operations within the loop body. However, since the task is solely focused on the state at the start of the loop, their initial values do not require adjustment for the loop to execute.

4. Given that the loop will start execution with `i` initialized to 0 and `n` being a positive integer, there are no further conditions to set for the loop's execution.

Thus, the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute are minimal.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters, `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is 0, `max_jump` is 0, `last_vowel` is -1**
