The variable `n` is assigned the value of the length of the string `s`. Since `s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `n` will take a specific value that is a positive integer between 1 and 100, inclusive. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100; `vowels` is 'AEIOUY'; `n` is the length of `s`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 100.**
