To analyze the provided code snippet, we begin with the initial state:

- `s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters.
- `n` is the length of `s`.
- `i` is 1.
- `last_vowel` is 0.

The line of code executed is:
```
max_jump = max(max_jump, (i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1)
```

Here, `i` is 1 and `last_vowel` is 0, thus:
- The expression `(i - last_vowel)` evaluates to `(1 - 0)`, which equals `1`.
- Dividing this by `2` gives `1 // 2`, which equals `0` (since integer division).
- Adding `1` results in `0 + 1`, which equals `1`.

Now, we need to compare this computed value of `1` with the previous value of `max_jump`. We do not have the initial value of `max_jump`, but it could either remain unchanged or be updated to `1`.

Since we don't have explicit information about `max_jump`, we can't definitively state its final value. However, the important note is that `max_jump` will be assigned the maximum value between its current value and `1`.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged variables along with the result of the `max` operation as it pertains to `max_jump`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters, `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is 1, `last_vowel` is 0, `max_jump` is max(max_jump, 1)**.
