To analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the initial state, we first note that the `max_jump` variable is being updated based on the comparison of its current value and the expression `i - prev_pos`.

Here's the breakdown:

1. `max_jump` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and `i - prev_pos`.
2. The value of `i` is given as `1`, but the value of `prev_pos` is not provided, meaning its value can affect the calculation of `i - prev_pos`.
3. The initial state indicates that `s` is a non-empty string with a length greater than 1, but it does not affect the computation directly.

Since we cannot determine the exact output for `max_jump` without the value of `prev_pos`, we include it in our output state as part of the calculation.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string that must have a length greater than 1, `i` is 1, `max_jump` is max(max_jump, 1 - prev_pos)**.
