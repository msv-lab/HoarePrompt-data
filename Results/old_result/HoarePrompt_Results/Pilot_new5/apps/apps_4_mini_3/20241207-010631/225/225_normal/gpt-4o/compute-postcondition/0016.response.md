To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we need to analyze how the variables change based on the loop code and the initial state. 

The loop iterates over each character of the string `s`, which is guaranteed to be non-empty and consists only of capital English letters. The vowel set is defined as `{'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}`.

1. **Initial State**:
   - `s` is a non-empty string (length â‰¥ 1).
   - `vowels` is `{'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}`.
   - `max_jump` starts at 1.
   - `prev_pos` starts at -1.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - As the loop iterates through the string, `i` takes values from `0` to `len(s) - 1`.
   - When a vowel is found at index `i`, `max_jump` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `i - prev_pos`, and `prev_pos` is updated to `i`.

Given that `s` is non-empty, the loop will always execute `len(s)` times. 

3. **Final Values**:
   - After all iterations, `prev_pos` will be the index of the last vowel found in `s`. If no vowels were found, `prev_pos` remains `-1`.
   - `max_jump` will be the maximum distance found between consecutive vowels, and it will be at least `1` if any vowel is present since the first vowel's position will always be considered.

Therefore, if:
- No vowels exist in `s`, `max_jump` will remain `1` and `prev_pos` will stay `-1`.
- If at least one vowel exists, `max_jump` will reflect the maximum gap between the last found vowel and the previous one (or the start of the string initially) up to the last vowel's position.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `max_jump` is the maximum jump between consecutive vowels or 1 if there are no vowels, `prev_pos` is the index of the last vowel found or -1 if no vowels were found.**
