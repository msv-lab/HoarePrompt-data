The variable `last_vowel` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 0. The initial state mentions that `s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters and that the current value of `s[i]` is a vowel, confirming that `last_vowel` will be set to a valid index of a vowel. The other conditions regarding `max_jump` remain valid, as they are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters, `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is 0, `last_vowel` is 0, if `last_vowel` is -1 then `max_jump` is set to 1, otherwise `max_jump` is at least 1 and `last_vowel` is greater than or equal to 0.**
