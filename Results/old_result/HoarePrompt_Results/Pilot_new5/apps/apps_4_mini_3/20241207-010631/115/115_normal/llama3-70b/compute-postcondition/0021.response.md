Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers (0s and 1s) with dimensions `n x m`, `ops` contains tuples representing the positions (i + 1, j + 1) for each pair of adjacent cells checked where at least one cell is equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is `m - 2`. The loop executes `m - 1` times. If any of the cells checked during the last iteration hold the value 1, the final state of `ops` reflects all valid positions according to the conditions stated in the loop code.**
