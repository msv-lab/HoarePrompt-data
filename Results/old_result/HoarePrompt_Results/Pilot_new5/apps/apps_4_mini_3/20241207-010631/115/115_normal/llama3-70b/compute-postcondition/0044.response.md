The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop and move on to the next iteration. However, in this context, there are no variables being modified in the execution context provided. The values of the variables remain unchanged, but the execution flow skips to the next iteration of the loop (if there was one). 

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the initial state, with the addition of the fact that execution will skip to the next loop iteration.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `m` is between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers (0s and 1s) with dimensions `n x m`, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is 0, and execution will skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
