Postcondition: ***`n` is between 2 and 50, `m` is between 2 and 50, `i` is 0, `B` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, and `operations` is a list of coordinates of detected 2x2 blocks of 1s in `A` or empty. If `A[i][j]` is not equal to `B[i][j]`, the function returns -1. If `A[i][j]` is equal to `B[i][j]`, there is no return value (None).***
