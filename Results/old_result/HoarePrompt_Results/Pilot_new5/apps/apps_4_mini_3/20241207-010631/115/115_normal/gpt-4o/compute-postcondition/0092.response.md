To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the information provided:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` and `m` are integers between 2 and 50.
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `j` is `m - 1`.
   - All values of `A[i][j]` are equal to the corresponding values of `B[i][j]` for all valid indices.
   - The length of `operations` is printed but is undefined without further context.

2. **Code of the Loop**:
   ```
   for op in operations:
       print(op[0], op[1])
   ```

3. **Output State Analysis**:
   - The loop iterates over `operations`, printing the first two elements of each operation.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `operations` must contain at least one element.
   - After all iterations, `operations` will have been fully processed.

Given these points, let's deduce the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished. If there are `k` operations in total, then:

- If `k = 0`, the loop does not execute, and `operations` would remain undefined or empty.
- If `k > 0`, all operations would have been printed, meaning `n` and `m` still lie between 2 and 50, with no change to their values.

### Final Output State
Since `operations` must have been defined with `k` elements, the conditions after all iterations will be as follows:

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `m - 1`, and all elements of `operations` have been printed.**
