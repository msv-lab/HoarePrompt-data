The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. However, since no specific loop context or conditions are provided in the initial state or the code snippet, we cannot determine the conditions under which `continue` would be evaluated. The values of the other variables remain unchanged as the code does not modify them.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers (0s and 1s) with dimensions `n x m`, `j` is `m - 1`, and the `ops` remains unchanged.**
