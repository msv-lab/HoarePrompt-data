Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions n x m. If `A[0][1]`, `A[0][2]`, `A[1][1]`, and `A[1][2]` are all equal to 1, then `operations` contains the values [(1, 1), (1, 2)], and `B` is updated with `B[0][1] = 1`, `B[0][2] = 1`, `B[1][1] = 1`, `B[1][2] = 1`. Otherwise, no changes occur in the state of `B`.***
