The code snippet simply prints `-1`. It does not modify any variables in the initial state. All variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state retains all the information from the initial state.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers (0s and 1s) with dimensions `n x m`, `ops` contains tuples representing the positions (i + 1, j + 1) for each pair of adjacent cells checked where at least one cell is equal to 1 across all iterations of the loop. The current length of `ops` is greater than 2500.**
