The `continue` statement does not change the values of `n`, `m`, or `j`, but it will skip the current iteration of the loop in which it is placed. Therefore, while there is no change in the variable values, the program logic will move to the next iteration of the loop. The values of the variables remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `m` is between 2 and 50, `j` is `m - 2`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
