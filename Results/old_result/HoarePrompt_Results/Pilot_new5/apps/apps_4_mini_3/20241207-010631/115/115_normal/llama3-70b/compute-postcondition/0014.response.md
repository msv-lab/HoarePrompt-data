The code appends the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `ops`. Given that `i` is 0 and `j` is 1, the new tuple to be appended is `(0 + 1, 1 + 1)` which equals `(1, 2)`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers (0s and 1s) with dimensions `n x m`, `ops` is a list containing the tuples (1, 1) and (1, 2), `i` is 0, `j` is 1.**
