Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, and the value of `A[2][j]` is equal to the value of `B[2][j]` for all `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`. Additionally, for all `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`, `A[i][j]` is equal to `B[i][j]`.***
