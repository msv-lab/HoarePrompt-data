Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Faulty Condition for Operations**: The logic used to determine whether to add an operation does not properly account for the requirement of being able to form a 2x2 submatrix of 1s. The program checks if at least one of the four positions in a 2x2 submatrix is 1 to decide whether to add the operation, which is insufficient. Instead, the program should only add an operation when all four positions are 0 (indicating that the operation can make them all 1s).

2. **Final Check for Equality**: The program does not verify if it's possible to convert matrix B into matrix A after the operations. Specifically, it should check if there are any remaining 0s in matrix A that cannot be turned into 1s. The current implementation ends by printing the number of operations, but it does not address whether the resultant matrix B matches matrix A after performing the recorded operations.

3. **Output Requirement**: When it is impossible to create matrix A from matrix B, the program should output -1. However, it fails to perform a comprehensive check to determine whether all required 1s can be achieved in matrix B.

Overall, the approach used in the program does not correctly solve the problem by ensuring that all necessary conditions are met for producing matrix A from matrix B, leading to the conclusion that the implementation does not meet the problem requirements.
