Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers (0s and 1s) with dimensions `n x m`, `ops` contains tuples representing the positions (i + 1, j + 1), `i` is 1, `j` is 0. The value of `A[1][0]` is 1, the value of `A[2][0]` is 1, the value of `A[1][1]` is 1, and the value of `A[2][1]` is 1.***
