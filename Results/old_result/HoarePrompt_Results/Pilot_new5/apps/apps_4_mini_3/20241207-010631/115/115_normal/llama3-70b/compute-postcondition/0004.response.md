According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop will execute if `m - 1` is at least 1, which means `m` must be at least 2. The state before the loop indicates that `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, so it satisfies this condition.

Since `j` is initialized to 0 before the loop starts, it will take on values starting from 0 up to `m - 2` during the iterations of the loop. No further adjustments to the other states are necessary for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers (0s and 1s) with dimensions `n x m`, `ops` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `j` is 0**
