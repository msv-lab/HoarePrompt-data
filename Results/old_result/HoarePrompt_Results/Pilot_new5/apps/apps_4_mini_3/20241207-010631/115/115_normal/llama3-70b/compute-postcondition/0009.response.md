The code appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `ops`. The values of `i` and `j` are both `0`, so the tuple appended to `ops` will be `(1, 1)`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers (0s and 1s) with dimensions `n x m`, `ops` is a list containing the tuple (1, 1), `i` is 0, `j` is 0. Additionally, at this point, either `A[i][j]` is equal to 1, or `A[i + 1][j]` is equal to 1, or `A[i][j + 1]` is equal to 1, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is equal to 1.**
