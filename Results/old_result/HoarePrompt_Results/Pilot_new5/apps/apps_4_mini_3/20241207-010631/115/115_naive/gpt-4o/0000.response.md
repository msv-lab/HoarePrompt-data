To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze how it handles the requirements set out in the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
- We have two matrices `A` (which can contain `0`s and `1`s) and `B` (which is initialized to all `0`s).
- We are allowed to perform operations on `B` to convert it into `A` by replacing certain `2x2` submatrices in `B` with `1`s.
- The goal is to determine whether it's possible to make `B` equal to `A`, and if it is, output the sequence of operations.

### Program Analysis:
1. The program initializes an empty list `operations` to record the operations performed.
2. It initializes matrix `B` to be a zero matrix of the same size as `A`.
3. It iterates through possible `2x2` positions in `A` and checks if each of the four elements of the `2x2` submatrix is `1`.
   - If they are, it sets the corresponding `2x2` elements in `B` to `1` and records the operation (coordinates adjusted for 1-based indexing).
4. After processing, the program checks if `B` matches `A`.
5. If they match, it prints the number of operations and the operations themselves. If they do not match, it returns `-1`.

### Potential Failure Case:
The program does not handle the situation where `A` has a `1` in a position that cannot be filled by a `2x2` submatrix. For example:
- Consider a case where `A` has a `1` in the first row and the last column of a matrix larger than `2x2`. 
- For example, for `n=3`, `m=3`:
```
A = [
    [0, 0, 1],
    [0, 0, 1],
    [0, 0, 0]
]
```
In this case:
- The program will never find a `2x2` submatrix that can fill the `1` at `A[0][2]`, resulting in `B` being unable to match `A` even though `A` requires a `1` in that position.

Thus, the program fails to account for instances where single `1`s that cannot be covered by any `2x2` operations exist in matrix `A`.

### Conclusion:
Given that the provided program fails to handle cases where `1`s exist in positions that cannot be filled by any `2x2` operations, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
