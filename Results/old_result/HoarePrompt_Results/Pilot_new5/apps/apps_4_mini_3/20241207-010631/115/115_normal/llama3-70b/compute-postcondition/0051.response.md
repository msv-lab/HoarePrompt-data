Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `m` is between 2 and 50, and `A` is a 2D list of integers (0s and 1s) with dimensions `n x m`. If `A[i][j] == 1`, `A[i + 1][j] == 1`, `A[i][j + 1] == 1`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1`, the loop continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, the program does not execute any actions as there is no else part.***
