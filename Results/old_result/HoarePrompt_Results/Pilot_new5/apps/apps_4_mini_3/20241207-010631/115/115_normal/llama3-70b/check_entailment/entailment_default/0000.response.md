Let's analyze the provided code and the problem description step-by-step.

**Problem Description:**
The goal is to make matrix `B` equal to matrix `A` by performing operations on `B`, where each operation allows setting a `2x2` submatrix of `B` to `1`. The program must determine if it's possible to replicate matrix `A` starting from `B`, and if so, it should output the sequence of operations.

**Program Code:**
```python
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    A = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
    ops = []
    for i in range(n - 1):
        for j in range(m - 1):
            if A[i][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and (A[i][j + 1] == 1) and (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1):
                continue
            if A[i][j] == 1 or A[i + 1][j] == 1 or A[i][j + 1] == 1 or (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1):
                ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))
    if len(ops) > 2500:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(len(ops))
        for op in ops:
            print(op[0], op[1])
```

**Initial Assessment of the Code:**
1. The program takes the dimensions of the matrices `n` and `m` and reads the matrix `A`.
2. It initializes an empty list `ops` to collect operations.
3. It iterates over all possible `2x2` submatrices in `A` and checks for conditions to determine if an operation is needed.
4. If all four elements of a `2x2` submatrix are `1`, it skips adding an operation. However, if at least one element in the `2x2` submatrix is `1`, it records that position as an operation.
5. It then checks if the number of operations exceeds `2500` and prints the result accordingly.

**Potential Issues:**
- The program does not check if it's possible to turn `B` into `A` accurately. It only appends operations based on partial checks of `1`s in `A`. 
- There is a lack of a definitive condition to check if all required `1`s in `A` can be formed by the operations that set `2x2` blocks in `B`. 
- The program could list positions that do not lead to a valid configuration of `B` equal to `A` since it only checks for the presence of `1`s and not whether the structure of `A` can be replicated.

**Output Hints:**
- The hints state that the function collects positions corresponding to `1`s in `A` but fails to handle edge cases where certain configurations of `1`s might not be possible to achieve with the operations defined.
- The hints imply that it could return `-1` for cases where it's impossible, but the logic to decide when to output `-1` seems insufficient.

**Conclusion:**
The code does not correctly follow the problem description, as it fails to ensure that the operations can actually achieve the desired matrix `A`. The logic only focuses on counting which `1`s can be part of potential operations but does not ensure that the resulting matrix `B` can match `A` after performing the operations.

Correctness: **False**. The program does not account for all necessary conditions that must be satisfied for `B` to equal `A`. For example, it could fail in cases where the structure of `1`s in `A` requires more than the operations can achieve.
