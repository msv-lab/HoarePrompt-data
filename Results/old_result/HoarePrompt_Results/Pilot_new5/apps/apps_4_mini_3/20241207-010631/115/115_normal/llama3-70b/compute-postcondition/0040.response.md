Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers (0s and 1s) with dimensions `n x m`. After the loop executes completely, `ops` contains tuples representing the positions (i + 1, j + 1) for each pair of adjacent cells checked where at least one cell is equal to 1, across all columns in row `i` and `i + 1`. If none of the cells satisfied the condition during any iteration, then `ops` remains unchanged from its initial state.**
