The code appends a tuple containing the values `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `operations`. The previous value of `i` is `n - 1` and `j` is `0`, so `i + 1` will be `n` and `j + 1` will be `1`. Thus, the tuple `(n, 1)` is added to `operations`. The states of all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `B` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `operations` contains all coordinates of detected 2x2 blocks of 1s in `A` plus the new coordinate `(n, 1)`, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `0`, `B[n - 1][0]` is 1, `B[n - 1][1]` is 1, `B[n][0]` is 1, `B[n][1]` is 1.**
