In the code, the values at specific coordinates in the 2D list `B` are being assigned the value `1`. Given that the current values in `A` indicate that a 2x2 block of 1s has been detected at coordinates `(i, j)`, we can identify that the following assignments will take place in the list `B`:

- `B[i][j]` will be set to `1`
- `B[i][j + 1]` will be set to `1`
- `B[i + 1][j]` will be set to `1`
- `B[i + 1][j + 1]` will be set to `1`

Since `i` is `n - 1` and `j` is `0`, we can substitute these values into the assignments:
- `B[n - 1][0]` is set to `1`
- `B[n - 1][1]` is set to `1`
- `B[n][0]` is set to `1`
- `B[n][1]` is set to `1`

After executing the code, the values of the variables that have changed are the specific entries in the 2D list `B`. The dimensions of `A` and `B` remain the same, and the other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `B` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `operations` contains all coordinates of detected 2x2 blocks of 1s in `A`, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `0`, `B[n - 1][0]` is 1, `B[n - 1][1]` is 1, `B[n][0]` is 1, `B[n][1]` is 1**.
