Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions n x m, `operations` contains the coordinates where 2x2 blocks of 1s were found in `A`, `B` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions n x m, where elements are set to 1 for each position that is part of a detected 2x2 block of 1s in `A`, and `i` is 0. The loop executes `m - 1` times, where `j` takes values from 0 to `m-2`. If no 2x2 block of 1s is found, `operations` remains empty, and `B` remains a matrix of zeros.**
