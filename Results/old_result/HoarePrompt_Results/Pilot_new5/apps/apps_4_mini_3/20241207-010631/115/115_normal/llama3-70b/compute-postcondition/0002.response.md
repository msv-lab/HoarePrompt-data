The code initializes `ops` as an empty list. The variables `n`, `m`, and `A` remain unchanged since the code does not modify them. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of these variables and the new state of `ops`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers (0s and 1s) with dimensions `n x m`, and `ops` is an empty list.**
