Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer between 3 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `j` is 2, and `B[i][1] = 1`, `B[i][2] = 1`, `B[i][3] = 1`, `B[i + 1][1] = 1`, `B[i + 1][2] = 1`, `B[i + 1][3] = 1` if `A[i][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all equal to 1, and the tuple `(i + 1, 3)` is appended to `operations`. Otherwise, the state of `B` and `operations` remains unchanged.***
