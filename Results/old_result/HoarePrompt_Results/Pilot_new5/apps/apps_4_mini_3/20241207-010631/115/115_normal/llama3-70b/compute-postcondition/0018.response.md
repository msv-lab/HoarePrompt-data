Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers (0s and 1s) with dimensions `n x m`, `ops` is a list containing the tuples (1, 1) and (1, 2), `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `m` must be greater than 2. If `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all equal to 1, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the execution does not continue to the next iteration.***
