The code `print(len(ops))` outputs the length of the list `ops`. Since `ops` contains tuples representing the positions checked in the 2D list `A`, the length of `ops` indicates the number of such positions where at least one cell is equal to 1.

The values of `n` and `m` are not directly affected by this code, and the 2D list `A` also remains unchanged. The only variable that is relevant in this case is `ops`, which has a length that will be printed.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers (0s and 1s) with dimensions `n x m`, `len(ops)` is the number of tuples in `ops` indicating positions of adjacent cells checked**.
