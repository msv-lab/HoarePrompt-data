To analyze the impact of the provided code snippet, we start with the initial state:

Initial State: `n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `operations` contains the coordinates of detected 2x2 blocks of 1s in `A`, `j` is 1.

The code snippet:
```
B[i][j] = B[i][j + 1] = B[i + 1][j] = B[i + 1][j + 1] = 1
```

Now, let's break down the operations:
- The code is setting four elements in a 2D list `B` to the value of 1. These elements are determined by the indices involving `i` and `j`:
    1. `B[i][j]`
    2. `B[i][j + 1]`
    3. `B[i + 1][j]`
    4. `B[i + 1][j + 1]`
   
Given that `j` is set to 1, the specific indices affected would be:
- `B[i][1]`
- `B[i][2]` (because `j + 1 = 2`)
- `B[i + 1][1]`
- `B[i + 1][2]`

Therefore, these four elements in the list `B` will be updated to 1.

The values of `n`, `m`, `A`, `operations`, and `j` remain unchanged. However, the state of the 2D list `B` changes for the specified indices.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `operations` contains the coordinates of detected 2x2 blocks of 1s in `A`, `j` is 1, and `B[i][1] = 1`, `B[i][2] = 1`, `B[i + 1][1] = 1`, `B[i + 1][2] = 1`.**
