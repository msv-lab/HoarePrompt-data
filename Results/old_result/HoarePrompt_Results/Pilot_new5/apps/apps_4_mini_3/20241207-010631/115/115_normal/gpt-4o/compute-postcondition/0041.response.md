Postcondition: ***If `A[i][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all equal to 1, then `B` is updated such that `B[n - 1][2]` and `B[n][2]` are set to 1, `operations` contains all coordinates of detected 2x2 blocks of 1s in `A`, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is 1, and `(n, 2)` is appended to `operations`; otherwise, the state of `B` and `operations` remains unchanged.***
