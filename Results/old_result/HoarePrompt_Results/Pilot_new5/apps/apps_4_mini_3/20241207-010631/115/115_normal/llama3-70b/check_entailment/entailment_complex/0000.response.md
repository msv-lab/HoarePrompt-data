The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements specified in the problem description. 

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the dimensions of the matrix `n` and `m`, and then reads the matrix `A`. This part is correct and aligns with the problem statement.

2. **Logic for Operations**:
   - The program checks each possible `2x2` submatrix of `A`. It only attempts to store the positions of cells (i, j) if at least one of the cells in that `2x2` submatrix has a value of `1`.
   - The check `if A[i][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and A[i][j + 1] == 1 and A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1:` is designed to skip fully filled `1`s `2x2` submatrices, but this is not a correct approach. This does not ensure that all required positions can be covered with the operations defined in the problem statement.

3. **Operation Count**: The program collects positions but does not guarantee that performing operations at these positions will lead to producing matrix `B` that matches matrix `A`. This is a critical failure because not all `1`s in `A` may be reachable due to the way the operations are defined.

4. **Output**: The program prints the length of the `ops` list and the list itself, but it doesn't indicate whether the transformation to matrix `A` is feasible or not. If a `1` exists in positions where it cannot be turned into a `1` through available operations, the program would still output the incorrect result.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not ensure that the collected operations will allow the transformation of matrix `B` into matrix `A`, it does not fulfill the requirements of the problem. The operations chosen are based on incomplete logic.

Thus, the final verdict is:

Correctness: **False**
