Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers between 2 and 50, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, and for all `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`, `A[i][j]` is equal to `B[i][j]`. If `A[i][j]` is not equal to `B[i][j]`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, the values of `A[i][j]` and `B[i][j]` remain equal, and no return is specified.***
