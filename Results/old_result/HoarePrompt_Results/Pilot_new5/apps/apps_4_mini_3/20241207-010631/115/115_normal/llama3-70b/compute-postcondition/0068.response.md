The code prints the values of `op[0]` and `op[1]`, which are elements of the second tuple in the `ops` variable. The initial state indicates that `ops` must have at least 2 tuples, which means `op` will also have valid values. The precondition about `n`, `m`, and `A` remains unchanged since they are not affected by the print statement.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers between 2 and 50; `A` is a 2D list of integers (0s and 1s) with dimensions `n x m`; `op[0]` and `op[1]` have been printed.**
