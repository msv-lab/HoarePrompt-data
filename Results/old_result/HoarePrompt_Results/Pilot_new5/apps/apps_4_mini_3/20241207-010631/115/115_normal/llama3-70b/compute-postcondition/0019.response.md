The code executes the statement `ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))`, which appends the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `ops`. Given that `i` is 0 and `j` is 2, the tuple being appended will be `(1, 3)`.

The conditions regarding the 2D list `A` are not affected since the code does not modify `A`, and the conditions concerning the loop iteration are not evaluated here. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers (0s and 1s) with dimensions `n x m`, `ops` now contains the tuples (1, 1), (1, 2), and (1, 3), `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `m` must be greater than 2.**
