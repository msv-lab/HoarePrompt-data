The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `ticket`. `ticket` is a string composed of digits with a length between 2 and 100, where each digit is an integer from 0 to 9. After executing the function body, if the total sum of digits in `ticket` is odd, the function returns `False`. If the total sum is even, the function returns `True` if the number of segments in `ticket` that have a sum of digits equal to `target_sum` is greater than or equal to 2; otherwise, it does not explicitly state what is returned in this case. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `ticket` of digits and return whether the total sum of the digits is even and if there are at least 2 segments matching the target sum. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter ticket, returns False if the total sum of digits is odd; returns True if the total sum is even and there are at least 2 segments in ticket with a sum equal to target_sum.**
