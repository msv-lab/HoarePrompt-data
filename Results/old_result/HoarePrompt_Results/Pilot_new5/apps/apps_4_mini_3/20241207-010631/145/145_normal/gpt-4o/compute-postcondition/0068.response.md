To evaluate the output state after all iterations of the loop:

Given that `n` is between 2 and 100, and considering the loop which sums ticket elements and counts segments equal to `target_sum`, the following deductions can be made:

- The loop iterates `n` times, once for each ticket. 
- Each time `current_sum` equals `target_sum`, it resets to 0 and `segment_count` increments.
- If `current_sum` does not equal `target_sum`, it will accumulate the ticket values.
- After the loop finishes executing, `current_sum` will either be 0 (if the last segment ended with `target_sum`) or a non-zero value (if the last segment did not complete, and thus not equal `target_sum`).
- The `segment_count` will reflect the total segments that equaled `target_sum` during the entire iteration.

Assuming that during the iterations, `current_sum` has matched `target_sum` k times, the final values will be:

- `segment_count` will be k.
- `current_sum` will be the sum of remaining ticket elements that did not complete a segment by the end of the loop.
- The value of `i` will be `n - 1` after the last iteration.

Thus, the output state summarizes the possible final state of the variables:

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 100, `i` is `n - 1`, `segment_length` is 3, `current_sum` is the remainder of ticket elements not part of any completed segment, `segment_count` is the total number of segments formed with the sum equal to `target_sum`.**
