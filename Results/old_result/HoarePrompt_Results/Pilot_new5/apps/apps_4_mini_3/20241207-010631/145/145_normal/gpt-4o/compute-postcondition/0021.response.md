Postcondition: ***`n` is between 2 and 100, `segment_length` is 1, `target_sum` is the result of `segment_sum(0, 0)`, `current_sum` is the sum of ticket values processed that did not complete the last segment, `segment_count` is the number of complete segments found, `i` is `n - 1`. The current value of `current_sum` is 0, and the current value of `segment_count` is greater than 1.***
