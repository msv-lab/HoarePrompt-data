The value of `target_sum` is assigned the result of the function call `segment_sum(0, segment_length - 1)`. Given that `segment_length` is 2, the parameters passed to `segment_sum` will be 0 and 1. The calculation of `target_sum` depends on the implementation of the `segment_sum` function, which is not provided. However, it is understood that `target_sum` will now hold the value returned by that function call based on the current context.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged, as they are not directly impacted by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 100, `segment_length` is 2, `target_sum` is the result of `segment_sum(0, 1)`, `current_sum` is not equal to 0 or `segment_count` is less than or equal to 1, `segment_count` is the number of complete segments found, and `i` is `n - 1`.**
