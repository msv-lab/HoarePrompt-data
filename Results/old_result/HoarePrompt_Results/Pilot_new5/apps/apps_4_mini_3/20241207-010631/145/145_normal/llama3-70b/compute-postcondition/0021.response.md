The value of `curr_sum` is reset to 0. The previous value of `curr_sum` is equal to the previous `curr_sum` plus the integer value of `digit`. Therefore, after the assignment, `curr_sum` now becomes 0. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`ticket` is a string of digits with length at least 1, `curr_sum` is 0, `segments` is 3, `digit` is the next character in the `ticket` after the last one processed.**
