The function accepts a string `ticket` consisting of digits and two integers `start` and `end`. It returns the sum of the numeric values of the digits in `ticket` from index `start` to index `end`, inclusive. The function assumes that the indices are valid according to the constraints provided (0 <= start <= end < length of ticket). If the indices are invalid, the behavior of the function is not defined.
