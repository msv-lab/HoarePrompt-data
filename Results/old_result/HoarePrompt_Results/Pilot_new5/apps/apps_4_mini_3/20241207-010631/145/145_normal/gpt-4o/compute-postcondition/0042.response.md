The value of `segment_count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `segment_count` is 2, so the new value becomes 3. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 2 and 100, `segment_length` is 2, `segment_count` is 3, `current_sum` is 0, `i` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 100, `segment_length` is 2, `segment_count` is 3, `current_sum` is 0, `i` is 2**
