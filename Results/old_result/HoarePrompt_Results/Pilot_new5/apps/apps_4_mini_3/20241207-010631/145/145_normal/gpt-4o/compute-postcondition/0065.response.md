The variable `current_sum` is assigned the value `0`. This operation directly updates the value of `current_sum`, while other variables (`n`, `i`, `segment_length`, `segment_count`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `current_sum`.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 100, `i` is 2, `segment_length` is 3, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 2**
