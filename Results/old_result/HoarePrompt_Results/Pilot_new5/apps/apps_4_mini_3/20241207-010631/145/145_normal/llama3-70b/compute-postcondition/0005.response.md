The variable `curr_sum` is assigned the value `0`. Since the states of the other variables are not affected, the Output State is: `ticket` is a string of digits with length n (2 <= n <= 100), each digit is an integer between 0 and 9; `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket`, and `total_sum` is an even number; `target_sum` is equal to `total_sum // 2; `curr_sum` is 0.
