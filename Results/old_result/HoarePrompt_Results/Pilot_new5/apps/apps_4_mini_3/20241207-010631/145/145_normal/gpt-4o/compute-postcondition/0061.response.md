The code increments `segment_count` by 1. The previous value of `segment_count` is 1, so after the execution, its new value will be 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 100, `i` is 1, `segment_length` is 3, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 2**
