The variable `curr_sum` is assigned the value of 0, which overwrites its previous value (which was the integer value of `digit`). The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `ticket` is a string of digits with length at least 2, `curr_sum` is 0, `segments` is 2, `digit` is the first character of `ticket`.

Output State: **`ticket` is a string of digits with length at least 2, `curr_sum` is 0, `segments` is 2, `digit` is the first character of `ticket`**.
