The variable `current_sum` is assigned the value of `0`. The previous value of `current_sum` was `target_sum + int(ticket[2])`, but we do not know the specific values of `target_sum` and `int(ticket[2])`. The other variables retain their values since they are unaffected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 100, `segment_length` is 1, `target_sum` is the result of `segment_sum(0, 0)`, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 2, `i` is 2**
