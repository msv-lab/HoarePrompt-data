The variable `curr_sum` is incremented by the value of `digit`. Since `digit` is the first character of `ticket`, which is a string of digits, its value can be interpreted as an integer. The current value of `curr_sum` is 0, so after the increment, `curr_sum` will equal the integer value of `digit`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`ticket` is a string of digits with length at least 2, `curr_sum` is the integer value of `digit`, `segments` is 1, `digit` is the first character of `ticket`**.
