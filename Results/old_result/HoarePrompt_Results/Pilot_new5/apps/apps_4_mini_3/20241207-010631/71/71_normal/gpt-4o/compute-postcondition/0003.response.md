`to_remove` is assigned the value `0`. The states of `n`, `k`, and `count_zeros` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representation of a non-negative integer between 0 and 2,000,000,000; `k` is an integer between 1 and 9; `count_zeros` is 0; `to_remove` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a non-negative integer between 0 and 2,000,000,000; `k` is an integer between 1 and 9; `count_zeros` is 0; `to_remove` is 0**.
