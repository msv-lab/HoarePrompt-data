Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-empty string representation of a non-negative integer, `k` is an integer between 1 and 9, and `digit` is the next digit in `n`. If `count_zeros` equals `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If not, the program continues executing without any further changes to the variables.***
