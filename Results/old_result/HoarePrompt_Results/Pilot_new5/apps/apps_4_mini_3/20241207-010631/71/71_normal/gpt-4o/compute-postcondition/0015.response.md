The value of `to_remove` is incremented by 1. The other variables, including `n`, `k`, and `digit`, remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-empty string representation of a non-negative integer, `k` is an integer between 1 and 9, `digit` is the next digit in `n` (from the end), and `to_remove` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string representation of a non-negative integer, `k` is an integer between 1 and 9, `digit` is the next digit in `n` (from the end), `to_remove` is increased by 1.**
