The values of `n` and `k` are assigned new values based on the input provided. The input is split into two parts, both of which are converted to strings. The initial conditions state that `n` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 2,000,000,000 and `k` is a positive integer between 1 and 9. After the execution of the code, `n` and `k` will now hold string representations of the values obtained from the input. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a non-negative integer between 0 and 2,000,000,000; `k` is a string representation of a positive integer between 1 and 9.**
