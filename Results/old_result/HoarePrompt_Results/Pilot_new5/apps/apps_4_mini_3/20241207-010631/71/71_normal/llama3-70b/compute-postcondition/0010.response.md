The value of `n` is updated by performing integer division by 10. Initially, `n` is equal to `n_original / 100`, which means it is a positive value (since `n_original` is greater than or equal to 10). After the operation `n //= 10`, the new value of `n` becomes `(n_original / 100) // 10`, which simplifies to `n_original // 1000`. The states of the other variables, `n_original`, `k`, and `w`, remain unchanged except for `w`, which was increased by 1 before this operation.

Output State: **`n` is equal to `n_original // 1000`, `n_original` is greater than or equal to `10`, `k` must be such that `n % 10`, `w` is increased by 1**
