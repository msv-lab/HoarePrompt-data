According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n` and the value of `k`. The loop continues as long as `n % 10 ** k` is not equal to 0. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is equal to `n_original / 100`, and `n_original` is greater than or equal to 10. This means that `n` is at least 0.1. For the loop to execute one more time, `n % 10 ** k` must still not equal 0. 

For example:
- If `k` is 1, then `10 ** k` is 10, and `n % 10` must not equal 0.
- If `k` is 2, then `10 ** k` is 100, and `n % 100` must not equal 0.

We need to adjust the state of `n` such that `n` does not satisfy the condition `n % 10 ** k == 0` for the next iteration. 

However, since we know that `n` is already `n_original / 100` and that `n_original` is greater than or equal to 10, we do not need to adjust `n_original`. We just need to ensure `k` is set appropriately so that `n` will still not be divisible by `10 ** k`.

Thus, we keep `k` unchanged but must ensure that `n` is not divisible by `10 ** k`. Therefore, the current state of `n` (which is `n_original / 100`) should remain because it is already valid as long as `k` has not been adjusted to make `n % 10 ** k` equal to 0.

State: **`n` is equal to `n_original / 100`, `n_original` is greater than or equal to `10`, `w` is increased by 1, and `k` must be such that `n % 10 ** k != 0`.**
