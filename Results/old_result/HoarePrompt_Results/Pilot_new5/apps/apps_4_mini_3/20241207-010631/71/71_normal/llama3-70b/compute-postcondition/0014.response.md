Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and a positive integer `k`. It calculates the number of digits removed from `n` until `n` becomes divisible by 10 raised to the power of `k`. The function then prints the count of digits removed (`w`). If `n` is already divisible by 10^k, it returns 0 since no digits need to be removed. The final value of `w` represents how many digits were discarded before reaching divisibility, up to a maximum of `k`. **
