The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-empty string representation of a non-negative integer, `k` is an integer between 1 and 9, `count_zeros` is updated to 1 if `digit` is '0' or remains 0 if `digit` is not '0', and `to_remove` is updated to 0 if `digit` is '0' or to 1 if `digit` is not '0'. The current value of `count_zeros` equals `k`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string representation of a non-negative integer, `k` is an integer between 1 and 9, `count_zeros` is updated to 1 if `digit` is '0' or remains 0 if `digit` is not '0', `to_remove` is updated to 0 if `digit` is '0' or to 1 if `digit` is not '0`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
