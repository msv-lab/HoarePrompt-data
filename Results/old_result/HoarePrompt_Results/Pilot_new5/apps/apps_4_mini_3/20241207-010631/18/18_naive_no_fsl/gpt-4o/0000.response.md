Correctness: **True**

The provided program accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of how it handles various cases:

1. **When `t <= k`:** The program correctly outputs `t`, which represents the number of spectators that are standing at time `t` since spectators start standing one by one up to `k`.

2. **When `k < t <= n`:** The program outputs `k`, which indicates that the maximum number of spectators standing is `k`, as the first `k` spectators are still standing while the next spectators have not yet started to sit down.

3. **When `n < t < n + k`:** The program calculates `n + k - t` to determine how many spectators are still standing after some spectators have begun to sit down. This correctly accounts for the fact that after time `n`, we start to see spectators sitting down in the order they stood up.

The program handles all edge cases according to the described behavior of the Mexican wave, including the transitions between standing and sitting spectators. As such, it will produce the correct output for all valid inputs within the specified ranges.

Since no potential case has been found where the program does not meet the requirements of the problem statement, the conclusion is that the program is correct.
