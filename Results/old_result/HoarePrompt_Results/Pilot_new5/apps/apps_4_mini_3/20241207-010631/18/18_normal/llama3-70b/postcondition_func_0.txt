The function accepts three integers `n`, `k`, and `t`, and evaluates a condition based on their values. It prints the minimum of `t` and `k` if `t` is less than or equal to `n`. If `t` is greater than `n`, it calculates and prints `k - (t - n) % k`, which represents a cyclical calculation involving `k`. The function does not return any value.
