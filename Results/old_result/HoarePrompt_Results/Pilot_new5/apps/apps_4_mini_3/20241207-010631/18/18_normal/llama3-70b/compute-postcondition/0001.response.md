To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we analyze the conditions based on the initial state of the variables. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9)
- `k` is an integer (1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`)
- `t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` < `n + k`)

The code snippet:
```
print(min(t, k) if t <= n else k - (t - n) % k)
```

Now we evaluate the impact:

1. If `t <= n`, then the output will be `min(t, k)`. In this case, `min(t, k)` would take the lesser of `t` or `k`.
2. If `t > n`, the output will be calculated as `k - (t - n) % k`. This expression determines how much `t` exceeds `n`, and adjusts `k` accordingly based on the modular arithmetic.

In both scenarios, the code does not modify the values of `n`, `k`, or `t`, it only determines an output based on their current values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`, and 1 ≤ `t` < `n + k`. The output is either `min(t, k)` if `t <= n`, or `k - (t - n) % k` if `t > n`.**
