The function accepts three integers, n, k, and t, from user input, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k. It then returns the following values based on the relationship of t with k and n: if t is less than or equal to k, it returns t; if t is less than or equal to n, it returns k; if t is greater than n, it returns n + k - t, which could potentially result in a negative integer.
