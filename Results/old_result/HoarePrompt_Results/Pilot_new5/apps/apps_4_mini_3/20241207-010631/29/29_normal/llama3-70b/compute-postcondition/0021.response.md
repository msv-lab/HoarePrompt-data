The code appends a formatted string to the `script` list. The string that gets appended is created using the values of `file` and `i`. Here, `file` is the third element of `examples`, and `i` is 3. Therefore, the string appended will be `f'move {file} {i}'`, which translates to `move {third_element_of_examples} 3`.

The value of `script` will now include this new string, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` contains at least one tuple with the second element equal to 1, `examples` is a list containing at least 3 elements, `script` contains the string `move {first element of examples} 1`, `move {file} 2`, and `move {third element of examples} 3`, `i` is 3, `file` is the third element of `examples`.**
