The code creates a new list called `examples` that consists of the first elements of tuples in `files` where the second element (the `type_` integer) is equal to 1. Since `files` is sorted in descending order based on the second element, this filtering will include only those tuples that meet the condition.

The initial state of `n` does not directly affect the outcome of the `examples` list, as it is unchanged and primarily serves as a context for the overall state. The variable `files` is still valid, but we will now include `examples`.

Given that `files` is sorted and contains tuples, the resulting `examples` will be a list of the first elements from those tuples where their corresponding second element is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000); `files` is sorted in descending order based on the second element of each tuple; `examples` is a list of the first elements of tuples in `files` where the second element is 1.**
