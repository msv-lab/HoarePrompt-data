According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `regular` list. The loop will execute as long as there are more elements in `regular` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `len(examples) + 2`, which means it is currently pointing to the next index in the `regular` list. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `regular` must have at least `len(examples) + 3` elements because `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration. Since `i` is currently `len(examples) + 2`, the next value of `i` will be `len(examples) + 3`, and it will correspond to the next element in the `regular` list.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- `i` will be `len(examples) + 3`
- `file` will be the next element in `regular` corresponding to this new index.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` contains at least one tuple with the second element equal to 1, `examples` is a list containing the first elements of those tuples, `regular` must contain at least `len(examples) + 3` elements, `i` is equal to `len(examples) + 3`, `file` is the element from regular corresponding to the new index, and `script` now includes the string `f'move {file} {i}'` appended.**
