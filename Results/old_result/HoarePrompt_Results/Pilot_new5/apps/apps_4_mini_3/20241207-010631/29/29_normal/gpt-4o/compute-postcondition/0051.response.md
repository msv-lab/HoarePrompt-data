The given code appends a formatted string to the `moves` list based on the current state of `examples[i]` and the index `i`. The condition that `examples[i]` is not equal to `str(i + 1)` is already met, and we know that `temp_counter` has already been updated prior to this operation.

The impact of the code on the program is that it creates a new entry in the `moves` list that reflects a move using the current value of `examples[i]` and `i + 1`. No other variable is modified in this line of code.

Thus, the output state reflects the unchanged status of all other variables, but we will indicate that a move string has been appended to the `moves` list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `temp_counter` is updated to `2 * n + k + 1`, `examples[i]` is `str(2 * n + k)`, `moves` now includes 'move {examples[i]} {i + 1}'**.
