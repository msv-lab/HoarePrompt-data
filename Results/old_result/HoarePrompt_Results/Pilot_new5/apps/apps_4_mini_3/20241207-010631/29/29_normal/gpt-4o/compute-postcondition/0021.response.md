The variable `temp_counter` is assigned the value of `n + 1`. Given that `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100,000, the value of `temp_counter` will range from 2 to 100,001, depending on the value of `n`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `files` is a list of tuples containing `n` tuples, `examples` contains the names of all files where `type_` is '1', `regulars` contains the names of all files where `type_` is not '1', `moves` is an empty list, `temp_counter` is `n + 1`.**
