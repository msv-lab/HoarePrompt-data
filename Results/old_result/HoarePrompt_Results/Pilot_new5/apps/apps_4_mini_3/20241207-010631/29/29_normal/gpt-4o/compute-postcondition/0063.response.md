The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Given that `temp_counter` is initially greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 2 * n + 1, the new value of `temp_counter` will be between 2 and 2 * n + 2 after the increment. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`temp_counter` is greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 2 * n + 2; `str(temp_counter)` is now assigned to `examples[i]`; `moves` includes the updated string `f'move {str(temp_counter)} {temp_counter}'`.**
