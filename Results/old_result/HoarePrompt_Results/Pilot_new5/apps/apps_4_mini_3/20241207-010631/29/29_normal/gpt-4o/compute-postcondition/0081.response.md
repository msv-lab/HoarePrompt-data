Output State: **`temp_counter` is `2 * n + 2`, `examples` contains strings from `1` to `2 * n`, `moves` includes the new operation `move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}`, `files_set` includes all strings from `str(n + 1)` to `str(2 * n)`, `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `regulars` is a non-empty iterable, `i` is still 0, `target` is equal to `2 * n + 1`, and `regulars[i]` is now equal to `str(2 * n + 1)`.**
