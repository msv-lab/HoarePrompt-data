Postcondition: ***`temp_counter` is `2 * n + 2`, `files_set` contains strings from `str(n + 1)` to `str(2 * n)`, `examples` contains strings from `1` to `2 * n`, `i` is equal to `len(regulars)`, `target` is equal to `2 * n + i + 1`, `regulars[i]` is not equal to `str(target)`, the operation 'move {regulars[i]} {2 * n + 1}' is added to `moves`, and `temp_counter` is appended to `moves`, and `regulars[i]` is updated to `str(2 * n + 1)`***
