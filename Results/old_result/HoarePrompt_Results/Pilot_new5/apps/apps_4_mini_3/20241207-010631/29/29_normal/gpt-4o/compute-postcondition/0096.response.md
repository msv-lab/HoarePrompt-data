The code assigns `regulars[i]` the string representation of `temp_counter`. The value of `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 1`, which is a specific expression based on the value of `n`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is `2 * n + 1`, `files_set` contains strings from `str(n + 1)` to `str(2 * n)`, `examples` contains strings from `1` to `2 * n`, `moves` includes the new operation 'move {regulars[i]} {2 * n + 1}' and {temp_counter} appended to `moves`, `i` is equal to `len(regulars)`, `target` is equal to `2 * n + i + 1`, `regulars[i]` is `str(2 * n + 1)`**.
