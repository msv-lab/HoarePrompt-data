The code `print(line)` outputs the value of `line`. The value of `line` is assigned as `script[0]`, and since `script` contains `m` entries formatted as `move {file} {i}`, the value of `line` will be the first entry of that format. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` contains at least one tuple with the second element equal to 1, `examples` is a list containing the first elements of those tuples, `regular` contains at least `len(examples) + m` elements, `i` is `len(examples) + m`, `script` contains `m` entries formatted as `move {file} {i}`, `line` is `script[0]` which is printed.**
