The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Since `temp_counter` must be adjusted to be equal to `2 * n`, its previous value must have been `2 * n`. Therefore, after the increment, `temp_counter` becomes `2 * n + 1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 1`, and `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`.**
