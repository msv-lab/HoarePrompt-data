To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions of the `while` loop:

```
while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue executing as long as two conditions are met:
1. `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`.
2. The string representation of `temp_counter` must be present in `files_set`.

From the provided state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `temp_counter` must be adjusted to be between `n + 1` and `2 * n`.
- `files_set` contains strings from `str(n + 1)` to `str(2 * n)`.
- `target` is `2 * n + 4`.

Given that `temp_counter` is incremented by 1 at the end of the last iteration, the current value of `temp_counter` is between `n + 1` and `2 * n`, but it must also be checked if it still fits within `files_set`.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need:
- `temp_counter` to be less than or equal to `2 * n` (which is already satisfied since it is between `n + 1` and `2 * n`).
- `temp_counter` must be present in `files_set`, which contains strings from `str(n + 1)` to `str(2 * n)`. Therefore, `temp_counter` must be within that range when converted to a string.

If `temp_counter` is currently at `2 * n`, to ensure the loop can run again, `temp_counter` should be incremented to `2 * n + 1`, which will not satisfy the `temp_counter <= 2 * n` condition. Therefore, the only way for the loop to execute again is if `temp_counter` remains at a maximum of `2 * n`.

Thus, we can conclude that:
- `temp_counter` should not exceed `2 * n`.

No other states need to be adjusted, as `files_set` already contains the required strings for the current value of `temp_counter`.

State: **`temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`, `temp_counter` is between `n + 1` and `2 * n`**
