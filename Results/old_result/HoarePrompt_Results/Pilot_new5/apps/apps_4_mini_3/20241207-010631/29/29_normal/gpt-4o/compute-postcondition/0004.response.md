Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `files` is a list of tuples that contains at least 1 tuple, `examples` is an empty list, `regulars` is an empty list, and `name` and `type_` are extracted from a string `file` that is split into two parts. The current value of `type_` is '1'.***
