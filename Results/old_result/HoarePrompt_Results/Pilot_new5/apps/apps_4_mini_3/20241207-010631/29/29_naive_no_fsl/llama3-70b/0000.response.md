Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the case where the new filenames ("1", "2", ..., "n") may collide with existing filenames. If any of the existing filenames are within the range of "1" to "n", moving a file to that name will overwrite it, which is not the intended behavior according to the problem description.

For instance, consider the following test case:

```
3
1 1
2 0
3 1
```

In this case, the program will attempt to rename "1" to "1", which would result in overwriting the existing file "1". This conflicts with the requirement that all new filenames must be distinct integers starting from 1 without any overlaps. 

Thus, the program does not fulfill the correct logic as described in the problem, leading to incorrect functionality.
