Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). If `examples[i]` is not equal to `str(i + 1)`, then `temp_counter` is set to `2 * n + 2`, `files_set` contains all strings from `str(n + 1)` to `str(2 * n)`, `moves` has been updated with a new entry `move {examples[i]} {temp_counter}`, and `examples[i]` has been updated to `str(2 * n + 1)`. The condition `examples[i]` is not equal to `str(i + 1)` holds true.***
