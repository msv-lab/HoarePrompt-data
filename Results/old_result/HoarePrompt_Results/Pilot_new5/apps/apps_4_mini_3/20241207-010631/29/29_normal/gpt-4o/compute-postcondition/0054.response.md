According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `temp_counter` and `files_set`. The loop can execute if `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and if `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`. 

Right before the loop, `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), meaning `2 * n` is also a positive integer. However, we do not have the current value of `temp_counter` or information about `files_set`. 

To ensure the loop executes at least once:
1. `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`.
2. `str(temp_counter)` must be present in `files_set`.

Since we don't know the specific values of `temp_counter` and `files_set`, we cannot make concrete adjustments. However, for the loop to execute once, we can infer that `temp_counter` needs to be adjusted if it currently exceeds `2 * n`, and `files_set` must include `str(temp_counter)`.

Thus, assuming `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n` or `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, adjustments must be made.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and temp_counter must be less than or equal to 2 * n and str(temp_counter) must be in files_set**
