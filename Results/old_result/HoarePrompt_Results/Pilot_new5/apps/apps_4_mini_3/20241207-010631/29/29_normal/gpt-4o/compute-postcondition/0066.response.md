To analyze the impact of the code given the initial state, let's break down the assignment step by step:

1. `moves.append(f'move {examples[i]} {i + 1}')` modifies the `moves` list by adding a new string formatted with:
   - The value of `examples[i]`, which was previously updated to `str(temp_counter)`.
   - The value of `i + 1`, which refers to the current index incremented by 1.

Given the conditions:
- `examples[i]` is equal to `str(temp_counter)`.
- The index `i` provides the current position in the list `examples`.

Now, re-evaluating the changes:
- `examples[i]` remains `str(temp_counter)`.
- The value `i + 1` is simply incrementing the index.
- The `moves` list will now include the new string formatted with `str(temp_counter)` and the integer value `i + 1`.

Putting it all together, the output state reflects that:
- `examples[i]` still equals `str(temp_counter)`.
- `moves` has been updated to include a new entry formatted as `move {str(temp_counter)} {i + 1}`.

**Output State:** **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `examples` has been processed up to index `i`, `examples[i]` is equal to `str(temp_counter)`, `temp_counter` is between 2 and 2 * n + 2 inclusive, and `moves` includes the new string `f'move {str(temp_counter)} {i + 1}'`.**
