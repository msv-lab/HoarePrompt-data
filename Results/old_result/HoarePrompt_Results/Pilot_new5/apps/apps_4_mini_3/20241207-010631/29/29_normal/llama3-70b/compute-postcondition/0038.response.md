The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters directly through its signature. However, it is implied that it processes a number `n`, which is a positive integer indicating the number of subsequent lines to be read. Each of these lines consists of a distinct filename (a string of digits and small English letters, with a length ranging from 1 to 6) and a type that can either be "1" (for example test) or "0" (for regular test). 

After processing the input, the function's output has not been specified in the provided information. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact return value or what the function does with the input filenames and types. 

Functionality: **The function processes input from the standard input, where the first line contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), followed by n lines each containing a distinct filename and a type (either "1" or "0"). The exact output of the function is not specified.**
