The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `temp_counter` is `2 * n + k`, so after the increment, the new value of `temp_counter` becomes `(2 * n + k) + 1`. The value of `examples[i]` is assigned the string representation of the previous value of `temp_counter`, which was `str(temp_counter) = str(2 * n + k)`. Therefore, after the execution of the code, `examples[i]` will reflect the old value of `temp_counter` as a string, while `temp_counter` will have the updated value.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is `2 * n + k + 1`, `examples[i]` is str(`2 * n + k`)**
