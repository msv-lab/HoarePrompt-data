The variable `file` is assigned the value from `regular` at the index `i`, where `i` is equal to `len(examples) + 3`. The `script` is updated by appending a new string formatted as `f'move {file} {i}'`. Therefore, the current state of `script` will now include this new command.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the output state reflects the updated value of `script` and the unchanged state of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` contains at least one tuple with the second element equal to 1, `examples` is a list containing the first elements of those tuples, `regular` must contain at least `len(examples) + 3` elements, `i` is equal to `len(examples) + 3`, `file` is the element from regular corresponding to the new index, `script` now includes the string `f'move {file} {i}'` appended.**
