To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to analyze the loop conditions stated as `temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set`.

Key points to consider:
1. The variable `temp_counter` is currently set to `2 * n + 2`.
2. We need to check if the condition `temp_counter <= 2 * n` can be satisfied. Given that `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 2`, it is clear that this condition cannot be satisfied as it will always be greater than `2 * n`.
3. The second part of the condition, `str(temp_counter) in files_set`, relies on the value of `temp_counter`. Since `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 2`, we need to ensure that this string representation is present in `files_set`.

Since the first condition of the loop cannot be satisfied in its current state, we must adjust `temp_counter` to be less than or equal to `2 * n`. 

Therefore, we need to adjust `temp_counter` to be `2 * n` or less, which means it must be set to exactly `2 * n` for the loop to be able to execute at least once.

State: **`examples` contains strings from `1` to `2 * n`, `moves` includes the new operation 'move {regulars[i]} {2 * n + 1}', `files_set` includes all strings from `str(n + 1)` to `str(2 * n)`, `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `regulars` list contains elements, `temp_counter` must be adjusted to `2 * n`, `i` is equal to `len(regulars)`, `target` is equal to `2 * n + i + 1`**.
