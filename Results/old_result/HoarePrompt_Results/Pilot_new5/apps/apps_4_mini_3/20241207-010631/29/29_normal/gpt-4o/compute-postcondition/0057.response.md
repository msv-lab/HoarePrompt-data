The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The initial state indicates that `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`, and since `n` is a positive integer, `temp_counter` is guaranteed to remain within the bounds specified after the increment. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `temp_counter` is incremented by 1 and must still be less than or equal to 2 * n, and `str(temp_counter)` must still be in `files_set`.**
