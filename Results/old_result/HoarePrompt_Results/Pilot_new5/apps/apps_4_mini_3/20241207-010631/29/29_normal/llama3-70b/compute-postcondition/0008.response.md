According to the code, the loop will continue executing as long as the iteration count (represented by the underscore `_`) is less than `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer and can range from 1 to 100000, we need to consider the current iteration count.

At the end of the last iteration, the loop has executed once, thus the iteration count is now 1. For the loop to execute again, it must execute a total of `n` times. After the last iteration, we can deduce that if the loop has executed once, the next iteration would indicate that the count has increased by 1.

To summarize, if the loop has already executed one time, for it to execute one more time, we need to ensure that there are still iterations remaining (i.e., the loop must go through `n` iterations). Therefore, the state needs to reflect that the loop has executed once and is now ready to execute again.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000) and must be greater than 1 for another iteration, `files` contains one additional tuple `(name, int(type_))`**
