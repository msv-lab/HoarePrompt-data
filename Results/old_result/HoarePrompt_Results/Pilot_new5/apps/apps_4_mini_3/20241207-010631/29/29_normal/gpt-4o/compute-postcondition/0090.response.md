To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions under which the loop operates, specifically focusing on `temp_counter`, `n`, and `files_set`.

Given:
- `temp_counter` is currently set to `2 * n + 1`.
- The loop will continue executing as long as `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` is present in `files_set`.

Now, let's check the conditions:
1. The condition `temp_counter <= 2 * n` is currently false because `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 1`, which is greater than `2 * n`.
2. Since the first condition for continuing the loop is not satisfied, the loop cannot execute again without modification.

To allow the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust `temp_counter` to be less than or equal to `2 * n`. The smallest it can be to allow for one more iteration is `temp_counter` equal to `2 * n`. 

Thus, we need to change `temp_counter` from `2 * n + 1` to `2 * n` so that the loop can execute once more under the condition that `str(temp_counter)` must also exist in `files_set`. 

There are no changes required for `n`, `files_set`, or `regulars` since they do not affect this specific condition.

State: **`temp_counter` must be adjusted to `2 * n`**
