The value of `examples[i]` is assigned the string representation of `temp_counter`. The initial state indicates that `temp_counter` is calculated as `2 * n + k`, where `k` is the number of successful increments. Therefore, `examples[i]` now holds the string value of this expression. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`temp_counter` is `2 * n + k`, `examples[i]` is str(`temp_counter`)**
