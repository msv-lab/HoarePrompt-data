The value of `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 1`, and the current value of `regulars[i]` is not equal to `str(target)` where `target` is also `2 * n + 1`. The line of code adds a move operation to the `moves` list with the format `f'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}'`.

After the execution of the code:
- The `moves` list is updated to include the new operation which is a string formatted with the current value of `regulars[i]` and `temp_counter`.
- The values of `temp_counter`, `examples`, `files_set`, `n`, `regulars`, `i`, and `target` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is `2 * n + 1`, `examples` contains strings from `1` to `2 * n`, `moves` includes the new operation `move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}`, `files_set` includes all strings from `str(n + 1)` to `str(2 * n)`, `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `regulars` is a non-empty iterable, `i` is still 0, `target` is equal to `2 * n + 1`, and the current value of `regulars[i]` is not equal to `str(target)`**.
