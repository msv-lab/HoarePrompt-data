The line of code `moves.append(f'move {regulars[i]} {target}')` appends a formatted string to the `moves` list. The string incorporates the current value of `regulars[i]` and the current value of `target`. 

Given the precondition that `target` is equal to `2 * n + 1`, the output of the formatted string will be 'move {regulars[i]} {2*n + 1}'.

Since `regulars[i]` is not equal to `str(target)` (which is `str(2 * n + 1)`), this indicates that `regulars[i]` will change to `str(2 * n + 1)` based on the code context given before.

The state of `temp_counter` is also affected and set to `2 * n + 2`.

Thus, after executing the code, the updated variables are:
- `regulars[i]` is updated to `str(2 * n + 1)`
- `temp_counter` is updated to `2 * n + 2`
- `moves` now includes the new entry 'move {regulars[i]} {target}'.

Output State: **`examples` contains strings from `1` to `2 * n`, `moves` includes the new operation 'move {regulars[i]} {2 * n + 1}', `files_set` includes all strings from `str(n + 1)` to `str(2 * n)`, `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `regulars` is a non-empty iterable, `i` is still 0, `target` is equal to `2 * n + 1`, `regulars[i]` is updated to `str(2 * n + 1)`, and `temp_counter` is set to `2 * n + 2`.**
