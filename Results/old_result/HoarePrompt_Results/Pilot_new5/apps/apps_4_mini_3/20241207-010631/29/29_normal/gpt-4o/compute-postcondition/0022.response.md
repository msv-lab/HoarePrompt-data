In this case, the loop is dependent on the variable `examples`, which is a list containing the names of files where `type_` is '1'. The loop will execute if there is at least one element in the `examples` list. 

Given that `n` is a positive integer and represents the number of tuples in `files`, we need to ensure that at least one of those tuples has `type_` equal to '1' so that the `examples` list will have a non-empty value at the start.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` will be equal to the length of `examples` minus one, and during the first iteration, `i` will be 0 if `examples` is not empty.

To summarize:
1. Ensure that `examples` contains at least 1 file name (i.e., it is not empty).
2. Set `i` to 0 at the start of the first loop iteration.

Thus, the adjusted state should reflect that `examples` is not empty and that `i` starts from 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `files` is a list of tuples containing `n` tuples, `examples` is a non-empty list of file names where `type_` is '1', `regulars` contains the names of all files where `type_` is not '1', `moves` is an empty list, `temp_counter` is `n + 1`, `i` is 0**
