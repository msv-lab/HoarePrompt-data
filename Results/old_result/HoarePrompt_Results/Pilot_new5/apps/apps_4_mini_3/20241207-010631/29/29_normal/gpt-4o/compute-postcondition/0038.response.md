According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the length of the `examples` list. The loop will execute for each index `i` from `0` to `len(examples) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the current index, which means `i` is equal to the number of iterations completed. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 

Given that `examples[i]` is not equal to `str(i + 1)`, we know that the loop will continue until `i` reaches `len(examples)`. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be equal to the current value `i + 1`.

Additionally, the state of `n`, `examples[i]`, `files_set`, and `temp_counter` remains consistent with the conditions provided. Therefore, we adjust `i` to reflect the next iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `examples[i]` is updated to `str(2 * n + 1)`, `files_set` contains all strings from `str(n + 1)` to `str(2 * n)`, `temp_counter` is set to `2 * n + 2`, `moves` includes a new entry `move str(2 * n + 1) {i + 1}`, `i` is `i + 1`**
