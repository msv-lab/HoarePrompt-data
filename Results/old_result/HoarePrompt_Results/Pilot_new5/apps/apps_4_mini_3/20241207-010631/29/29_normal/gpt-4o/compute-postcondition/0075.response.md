The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Since it must be less than or equal to `2 * n`, after the increment, `temp_counter` will be within the range of `1` to `2 * n + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `examples` contains strings from `1` to `2 * n`; `moves` is a list of all move operations performed; `temp_counter` is now `temp_counter + 1` (which is ≤ `2 * n + 1`); `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`; `files_set` includes all strings from `str(n + 1)` to `str(2 * n)`; `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5); `regulars` is a non-empty iterable; `i` is still `0`; `target` is equal to `2 * n + 1`; the current value of `regulars[i]` is not equal to `str(target)`.
