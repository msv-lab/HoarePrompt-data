To determine what changes need to be made for the loop to execute one more time, we need to assess the conditions of the `while` loop based on the given state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop condition is:
```
while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
```

We know the following from the provided state:
- `temp_counter` is `n + 2`
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5)
- `files_set` must contain `str(temp_counter)`, which is `str(n + 2)`

Let's analyze the conditions:

1. **Condition 1: `temp_counter <= 2 * n`**
   - Currently, `temp_counter` is `n + 2`.
   - For the loop to run one more time, we need:
     \[
     n + 2 \leq 2n \implies 2 \leq n
     \]
   - Since `n` is a positive integer, this condition holds true for any `n` that is at least 2.

2. **Condition 2: `str(temp_counter) in files_set`**
   - Currently, `temp_counter` is `n + 2`, so we need to ensure that `str(n + 2)` is still in `files_set` for the loop to execute again. The state indicates that `str(n + 1)` is in `files_set`, but we need to guarantee that the next value `str(n + 2)` is also present.

Since for the loop to execute one more time `str(n + 2)` must be in `files_set`, we must adjust the state to ensure this. 

Based on this analysis, we need to modify the state to ensure that `str(n + 2)` is in `files_set`, but we do not need to alter any other variable states because they already satisfy the conditions.

Thus, the adjusted state will be:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files_set` must contain `str(n + 2)`**
