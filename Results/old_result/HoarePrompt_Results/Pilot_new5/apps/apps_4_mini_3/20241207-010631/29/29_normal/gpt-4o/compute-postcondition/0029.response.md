`temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Since `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`, its new value will be `temp_counter + 1`, which remains within the valid range since `temp_counter` started at a value less than or equal to `2 * n`. The states of other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files_set` must contain `str(temp_counter)`, `temp_counter` is updated to `temp_counter + 1` and must be less than or equal to `2 * n`.**
