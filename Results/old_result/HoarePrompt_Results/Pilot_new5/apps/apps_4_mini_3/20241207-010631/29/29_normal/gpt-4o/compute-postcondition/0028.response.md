According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `temp_counter`, `n`, and `files_set`. The loop will execute again if `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and if `str(temp_counter)` is present in `files_set`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `temp_counter` has been increased by 1, so it is now equal to its previous value plus 1. Therefore, we need to ensure that `temp_counter` is still less than or equal to `2 * n` after this increment. 

Since `n` is a positive integer, `2 * n` will also be a positive integer. To ensure the loop executes again, we need to confirm that `temp_counter` is at most `2 * n`. Additionally, for the loop to execute again, `files_set` must still contain `str(temp_counter)` after the increment.

Thus, we can express the necessary adjustments:
- Since `temp_counter` has increased by 1, we need to ensure `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, meaning it should be adjusted to be at most `2 * n`.
- The condition regarding `files_set` also needs to be met, which states that `files_set` must contain `str(temp_counter)`.

Given these conditions, the necessary adjustments can be summarized as follows:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files_set` must contain `str(temp_counter)` and `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`**
