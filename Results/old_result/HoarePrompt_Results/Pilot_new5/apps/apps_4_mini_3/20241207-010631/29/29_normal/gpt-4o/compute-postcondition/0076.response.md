To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while` loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze both the loop condition and the current state.

The loop condition is:
```
while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
```

### Current State Analysis:
1. **temp_counter:** Currently it is `temp_counter + 1` and must be less than or equal to `2 * n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `temp_counter` must be adjusted to ensure it stays within the limit. Since `temp_counter` is currently `temp_counter + 1`, it must be modified:
   - To allow another execution, `temp_counter` should be adjusted to at least `temp_counter + 1 <= 2 * n`, meaning it can remain at its current value (now `temp_counter + 1`) if this condition holds. We don't need to adjust `temp_counter` itself; rather, we need to ensure it remains less than or equal to `2 * n`.

2. **str(temp_counter) in files_set:** The condition `str(temp_counter) in files_set` checks if the string representation of `temp_counter` is in `files_set`. Given that `files_set` contains all strings from `str(n + 1)` to `str(2 * n)`, and `temp_counter` must also be in this range for the condition to hold true. Since it is stated that `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`, and considering it is currently `temp_counter + 1`, we need to ensure that this value falls within the specified range.

### Conclusion:
To ensure that the loop can execute one more time:
- `temp_counter` must still satisfy the condition of being less than or equal to `2 * n`.
- Also, `str(temp_counter)` needs to be checked to ensure it is included in `files_set`, which means `temp_counter` must be adjusted to be at least `n + 1` and at most `2 * n`.

Given the conditions outlined, the adjusted state must reflect these requirements. Hence, we can conclude:

State: **`temp_counter` is now â‰¤ `2 * n`, `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`, and `temp_counter` must be at least `n + 1`**
