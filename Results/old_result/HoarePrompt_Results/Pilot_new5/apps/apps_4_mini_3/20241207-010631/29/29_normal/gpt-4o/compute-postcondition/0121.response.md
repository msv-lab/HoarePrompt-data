Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of tuples `files`, where each tuple contains a filename and its type. It categorizes filenames into examples and regulars based on their type and generates a list of move operations to ensure that example filenames are renamed to the range `1` to `2*n` and that regular files are positioned accordingly. It returns the list of move operations performed. Edge cases include filenames already conforming to required names, in which case no moves will occur for those files, and filenames that may need to be moved beyond their initial range if collisions occur. **
