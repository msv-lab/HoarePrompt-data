Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `files` is a list of tuples that contains at least 1 tuple. If `type_` is '1', `examples` contains `name`, and `regulars` is an empty list. Otherwise, `examples` is an empty list and `regulars` contains `name`, with `type_` not equal to '1'.***
