Output State: **`examples` contains strings from `1` to `2 * n`, `moves` contains all the move operations performed, `files_set` contains strings from `str(n + 1)` to `str(2 * n)`, `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n + 1`, and all elements in `regulars` have been updated to the corresponding target values unless they were originally equal to `str(target)`.**
