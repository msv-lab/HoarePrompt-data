The value of `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` will accept an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is that `n` is now an input positive integer within the range of 1 to 100000.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000)**
