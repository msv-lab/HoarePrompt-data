Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and `examples` has been processed up to index `i`, if `examples[i]` is not equal to `str(i + 1)`, then `temp_counter` is between 2 and 2 * n + 2 inclusive, `examples[i]` is updated to `str(temp_counter)`, and `moves` includes the string `f'move {str(temp_counter)} {temp_counter}'`.***
