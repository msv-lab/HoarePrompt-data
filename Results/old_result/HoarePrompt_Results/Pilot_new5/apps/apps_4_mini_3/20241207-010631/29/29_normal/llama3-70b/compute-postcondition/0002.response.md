According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer, the loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 1. The variable `_` is used as a throwaway variable, indicating that its value is not needed within the loop body. 

Before the loop starts, the state of `files` is an empty list. However, this does not affect the loop's execution since the loop will run `n` times regardless of the contents of `files`.

Thus, to ensure that the loop can execute, we need to confirm that `n` is positive, which is already given, and note the initial state of `_` during the first iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is an empty list, `_` is 0 (for the first iteration)**
