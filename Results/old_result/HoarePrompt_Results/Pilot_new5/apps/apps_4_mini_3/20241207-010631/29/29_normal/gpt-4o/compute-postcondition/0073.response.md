Output State: **`examples` contains strings from `1` to `2 * n`; `moves` is a list of all move operations performed; `temp_counter` is increased by 1 and must be less than or equal to `2 * n + 1`; `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`; `files_set` includes all strings from `str(n + 1)` to `str(2 * n)`; `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5); `regulars` is a non-empty iterable; `i` is 0; `target` is equal to `2 * n + 1`; the current value of `regulars[i]` is not equal to `str(target)`.**
