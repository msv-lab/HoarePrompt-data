Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `m` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is a positive integer up to 10^18, `x` is between 0 and `n-1`, `y` is between 0 and `m-1`. If `row` is equal to `n`, then `row` is equal to `n`, `sergei_questions` has been increased by 1, `direction` is -1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, and `max_questions` has been increased by 1, with `row` equal to `n - 2` and `col` equal to `y`. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.***
