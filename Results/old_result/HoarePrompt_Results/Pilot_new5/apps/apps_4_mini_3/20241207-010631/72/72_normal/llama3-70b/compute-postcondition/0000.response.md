The code assigns values to `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` based on the input received. The values of these variables can now be any integers within the specified constraints. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` are now integers based on user input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 100), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18), `x` is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ n), `y` is an integer (1 ≤ y ≤ m)**
