The function `func` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y`. 

- `n` is an integer representing the number of rows. 
- `m` is an integer representing the number of pupils per row. 
- `k` is a positive integer representing the number of questions asked. 
- `x` is an integer (1-indexed) representing the row number of Sergei. 
- `y` is an integer (1-indexed) representing the position of Sergei in that row.

The output is determined based on these parameters, specifically focusing on Sergei's row and position in relation to the number of questions asked. 

Since the specific output conditions are not stated, we can summarize the functionality based on the given constraints and relationships.

Functionality: **The function accepts five parameters: integers `n`, `m`, `x`, and `y`, and a positive integer `k`, where `n` is the number of rows, `m` is the number of pupils per row, `k` is the number of questions asked, `x` is Sergei's row number (1-indexed), and `y` is Sergei's position in that row (1-indexed). The function's output depends on the values of these parameters.**
