Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `m` is between 2 and 100 inclusive, `k` is a positive integer up to 10^18, `x` is between 0 and `n-1`, `y` is between 0 and `m-1`, `col` is 2, `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `max_questions` has been incremented by 1. If `direction` equals 1 and `row` equals `n`, then `row` is decreased by 2 and `max_questions` is incremented by 2. Otherwise, if `row` is -1, then `row` is increased by 2, while `max_questions` is first incremented by 1 and then decremented by 1.***
