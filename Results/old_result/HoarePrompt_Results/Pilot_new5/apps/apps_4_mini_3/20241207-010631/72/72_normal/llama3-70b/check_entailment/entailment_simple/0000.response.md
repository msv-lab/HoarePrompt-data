To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the function `func()` step by step.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. The teacher asks pupils in a zigzag pattern across the rows.
2. The total number of questions asked is `k`.
3. The number of rows is `n`, and each row has `m` pupils.
4. We need to compute:
   - The maximum number of questions a pupil can be asked.
   - The minimum number of questions a pupil can be asked.
   - The number of times Sergei (in row `x`, position `y`) is asked.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Maximum Questions Asked (`max_asked`)**:
   - The formula `(k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)` calculates how many complete cycles of asking the full set of pupils have occurred, adjusting for partial cycles. Each full cycle represents asking all pupils in both directions (up and down).
   - This calculation seems to work for the maximum questions asked by any pupil, as it considers the total number of questions divided by the total pupils asked in a full cycle.

2. **Minimum Questions Asked (`min_asked`)**:
   - The calculation `max(1, max_asked - (n - 1))` attempts to determine the minimum number of times any pupil has been asked, factoring in that in the case of fewer questions than full cycles, some pupils may have been asked only once. However, this logic seems ambiguous because it does not adequately ensure that the minimum is properly calculated for all pupils across potential scenarios. 

3. **Questions Asked of Sergei (`sergei_asked`)**:
   - The logic `(k + x - 1) // (2 * n)` counts how many complete cycles include Sergei by adjusting for his row position.
   - The logic `((k + x - 1) % (2 * n) >= n - x + 1)` checks if there's any additional question asked to Sergei in the remaining part of the cycle after counting full cycles.
   - This appears correct since it accurately counts the number of questions for Sergei based on his position.

### Potential Issue:
While the logic for `max_asked` and `sergei_asked` seems reasonable, the way `min_asked` is calculated raises concerns. Specifically:
- The formula does not guarantee the correct minimum across all pupils, particularly in edge cases where the number of questions is less than the number of pupils, or when the number of complete cycles is low relative to `n`.

For example:
- If `k` is very small compared to `n * m`, the calculation for `min_asked` may not accurately reflect that some pupils were never asked. 

### Conclusion:
Given the concern about the calculation of `min_asked`, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description in all cases. Specifically, it can misrepresent the minimum number of questions asked to pupils. Thus, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**
