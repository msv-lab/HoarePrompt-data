The value of `max_questions` is incremented by 1, but since we do not know its previous value, we can only state that it has increased. The states of the other variables remain unchanged, therefore the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `m` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is a positive integer up to 10^18, `x` is between 0 and `n-1`, `y` is between 0 and `m-1`, `col` is 1, `direction` is -1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `max_questions` has been incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `m` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is a positive integer up to 10^18, `x` is between 0 and `n-1`, `y` is between 0 and `m-1`, `col` is 1, `direction` is -1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `max_questions` has been incremented by 1.**
