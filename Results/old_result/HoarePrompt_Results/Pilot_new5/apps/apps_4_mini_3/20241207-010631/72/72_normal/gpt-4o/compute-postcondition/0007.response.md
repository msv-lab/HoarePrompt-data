Initial State: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is a positive integer up to 10^18, `x` is between 0 and `n-1`, `y` is between 0 and `m-1`, `full_cycle_length` is either (2 * n - 2) * m if n > 1 or m if n = 1, `full_cycles` is equal to `k // full_cycle_length`, `remaining_questions` is equal to `k % full_cycle_length`, and `min_questions` is equal to `full_cycles`.

```
max_questions = full_cycles
```

Now, please think step by step: The variable `max_questions` is assigned the value of `full_cycles`, which is already defined as `k // full_cycle_length`. The other variables retain their values; thus, the output state after the code execution reflects the updated value of `max_questions`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is a positive integer up to 10^18, `x` is between 0 and `n-1`, `y` is between 0 and `m-1`, `full_cycle_length` is either (2 * n - 2) * m if n > 1 or m if n = 1, `full_cycles` is equal to `k // full_cycle_length`, `remaining_questions` is equal to `k % full_cycle_length`, `min_questions` is equal to `full_cycles`, and `max_questions` is equal to `full_cycles`.**
