To determine the output state after executing the provided code, let's analyze the code step by step:

1. The variable `max_asked` is calculated as `(k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)`. 
2. The variable `min_asked` is assigned the value `max(1, max_asked - (n - 1))`.

Now, we need to understand the impact of the code on the pre-existing variables.

- `max_asked` is based on `k` and `n`, which are already defined in the initial state. After the calculation, `max_asked` will be an integer.
- The value of `min_asked` will be determined by taking the maximum of 1 and `max_asked - (n - 1)`. 
  - If `max_asked` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `min_asked` will be at least 1.
  - If `max_asked - (n - 1)` is less than 1, then `min_asked` will be 1.

Since we know the ranges for `n`, `m`, and `k`, we can summarize the relationships derived from the operations performed. However, we will not know the exact numerical values of `min_asked` without specific values for `n` and `k`.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the calculated variable `min_asked` relative to `max_asked`, along with the maintained values of the other variables that have not changed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 100), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18), `x` is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ n), `y` is an integer (1 ≤ y ≤ m), `max_asked` is equal to `(k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)`, and `min_asked` is equal to `max(1, (k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n) - (n - 1))`.**
