The variable `max_questions` is incremented by 1. The initial state does not provide the specific value for `max_questions`, but it indicates that the increment occurs regardless of its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `max_questions` has been increased by 1 while retaining the initial conditions of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `m` is between 1 and 101 inclusive, `k` is a positive integer up to 10^18, `x` is between 0 and `n-1`, `y` is between 0 and `m-1`, `col` is equal to `m`, `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `max_questions` is increased by 1.**
