The variable `min_questions` is assigned the value of `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)`. The previous value of `full_cycles` is calculated as `k // full_cycle_length`, and since `full_cycle_length` is equal to `(2 * n - 2) * m`, we can see that `min_questions` will now hold a value that is derived from these calculations. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is a positive integer up to 10^18, `x` is between 0 and `n-1`, `y` is between 0 and `m-1`, `full_cycle_length` is equal to (2 * n - 2) * m, `full_cycles` is equal to `k // full_cycle_length`, `remaining_questions` is equal to `k % full_cycle_length`, `min_questions` is equal to `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)`, `max_questions` is equal to `full_cycles`.**
