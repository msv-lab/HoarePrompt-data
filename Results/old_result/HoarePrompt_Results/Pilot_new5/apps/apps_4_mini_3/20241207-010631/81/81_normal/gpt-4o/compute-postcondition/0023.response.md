Postcondition: ***`l`, `r`, `x`, `y` are integers within their specified ranges. If `a` is equal to `b`, then `count` is increased by 3, with `z` still being at least 4, `i` being 2, `a` being equal to `2 * x`, and `b` being equal to `z // 2 * x`. Otherwise, `count` is increased by 2, with `z` remaining at least 4, `i` being 2, `a` being equal to `2 * x`, and `b` being equal to `z // 2 * x.`***
