The code snippet `a, b = b, a % b` performs a swap of values between `a` and `b`, with `a` being updated to the remainder of `a` divided by `b`. Given the initial conditions:

1. `a` is greater than 0.
2. `b` must be greater than 0.
3. `a` is equal to the previous value of `b`.

When executing the code:
- The new value of `a` will be `b`, which is the original value of `b`.
- The new value of `b` will be `a % b`, where `a` (which was originally equal to the previous value of `b`) is greater than 0, and `b` is also greater than 0.

Since `a` is equal to the previous value of `b`, we can express the new values in terms of their relationships:
- `a` becomes the value of the previous `b`.
- `b` becomes `previous_b % previous_b`, which is `0`.

The Output State will reflect these new values while maintaining the valid relationships of the variables.

Output State: **`a` is equal to the previous value of `b`; `b` is 0.**
