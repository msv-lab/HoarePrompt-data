The initial state indicates that `a` is greater than 0, `b` is greater than 0, `a` is equal to the previous value of `b`, and `b` is equal to the previous value of `a % b`, which is less than `b`. 

The code snippet `a, b = b, a % b` will swap the values of `a` and `b`, assigning the previous value of `b` to `a`, and the result of `a % b` to `b`.

Given that `a` is equal to the previous value of `b`, we can denote:
- Previous value of `b` = `a`
- Previous value of `a % b` = `a % (previous value of b)` which is `a % a` = 0 (since `a` is not zero and `a % a = 0`).

Thus, after the execution:
- `a` takes the previous value of `b`, which is `a`.
- `b` takes the value of `0`.

The precondition that remains valid is that `a` is still greater than 0.

Output State: **`a` is greater than 0; `b` is 0; `a` is equal to the previous value of `b`.**
