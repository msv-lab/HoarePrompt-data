To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze both the requirements and the implementation step-by-step.

### Problem Requirements:
1. We need to find pairs of integers \( (a, b) \) such that:
   - GCD(a, b) = \( x \)
   - LCM(a, b) = \( y \)
   - \( l \leq a, b \leq r \)

2. The output should be the number of good pairs \( (a, b) \).

### Implementation Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads four integers \( l, r, x, y \).

2. **Loop Structure**:
   - It iterates over all pairs \( (a, b) \) where \( a \) ranges from \( l \) to \( r \) and \( b \) ranges from \( a \) to \( r \). This ensures that pairs are counted distinctly, as pairs \( (a, b) \) and \( (b, a) \) will be considered separately.

3. **GCD and LCM Calculation**:
   - `func_1(a, b)` correctly computes the GCD of \( a \) and \( b \).
   - `func_2(a, b)` correctly computes the LCM of \( a \) and \( b \) using the formula:
     \[
     \text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\text{GCD}(a, b)}
     \]
   - Thus, both functions are implemented correctly.

4. **Count Logic**:
   - The program checks if the GCD and LCM of each pair \( (a, b) \) match \( x \) and \( y \) respectively. If they do, it increments the count.

5. **Output**:
   - Finally, it prints the count.

### Potential Issues:
- The program does not check if \( y \) is divisible by \( x \). For \( (a, b) \) to have a GCD of \( x \) and LCM of \( y \), it is necessary that \( y \) is a multiple of \( x \). If \( y \% x \neq 0 \), there cannot exist any such integers \( a \) and \( b \) that satisfy the conditions.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to handle the condition that \( y \) must be divisible by \( x \). This can lead to incorrect results since there could be cases where the conditions do not yield any valid pairs, yet the check still runs, potentially giving incorrect counts.

Therefore, the program does **not** correctly follow the problem description because it lacks the necessary check for \( y \mod x = 0 \).

Correctness: **False**
