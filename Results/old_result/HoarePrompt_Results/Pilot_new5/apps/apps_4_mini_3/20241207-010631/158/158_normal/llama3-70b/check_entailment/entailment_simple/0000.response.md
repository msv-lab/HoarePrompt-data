Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Specifically, the issue lies in how the program calculates the total number of fruits used in the compote.

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Total Fruits**: The formula used in the program to calculate the total fruits is `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`, which simplifies to `min_lemon * 7`. This is incorrect because it outputs the total number of fruits that can theoretically be used (based on the number of lemons), but it does not account for the cases where the minimum number of lemons is zero, which would lead to an incorrect total output.

2. **Missing the Case Where No Compote Can Be Made**: If, for example, `a = 2`, `b = 3`, and `c = 2`, the calculation would yield `min_lemon = 0` because `c // 4` (which is `2 // 4`) results in `0`. The program would print `0`, which is correct; however, if the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are such that they cannot satisfy the ratio condition (but still have valid entries), the program does not handle these scenarios effectively.

3. **Input Constraints Misunderstanding**: The program assumes that input values can provide at least some valid output, but it does not explicitly handle conditions where no fruits can create a valid ratio, aside from returning zero, which is not stated clearly in the problem description.

4. **Output is not as expected**: In some scenarios, the way the output is expressed does not match with the expected output format, which is the total number of fruits used in the compote (rather than just a multiplication factor).

In summary, while the program attempts to determine the maximum number of fruits based on the ratio, it does not accurately implement the conditions described in the problem statement, hence it is deemed incorrect.
