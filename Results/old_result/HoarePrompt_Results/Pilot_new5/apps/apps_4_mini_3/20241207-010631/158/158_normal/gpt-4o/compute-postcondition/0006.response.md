The function `func` accepts three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `c`. All three parameters are positive integers representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears respectively, with the constraint that 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1000. The function does not return any specified output or behavior based on the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to accept three positive integers representing quantities of different fruits, but no specific return value or output behavior is described.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters a, b, and c, which are positive integers representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears respectively.**
