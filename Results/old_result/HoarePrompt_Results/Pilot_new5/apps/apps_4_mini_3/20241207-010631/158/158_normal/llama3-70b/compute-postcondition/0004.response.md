`min_lemon` is calculated as the minimum of three values: `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. The print statement outputs the result of the expression `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`, which simplifies to `min_lemon * (1 + 2 + 4)`, or `min_lemon * 7`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an input positive integer, `b` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 1000, `c` is an input integer, `min_lemon` is equal to `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`, and the output is `min_lemon * 7`.

Output State: **`a` is an input positive integer, `b` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 1000, `c` is an input integer, `min_lemon` is equal to `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`, and the output is `min_lemon * 7`.**
