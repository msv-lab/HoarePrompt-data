Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly calculates the maximum total number of fruits (lemons, apples, and pears) that can be used to make the compote in the specified ratio of 1:2:4. 

Here's the reasoning:

1. The program reads the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`) from input.
2. It calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used by finding the minimum of:
   - The number of lemons available (`a`)
   - The number of apples available divided by 2 (`b // 2`), since for each lemon, 2 apples are required
   - The number of pears available divided by 4 (`c // 4`), since for each lemon, 4 pears are required
3. It then calculates the total number of fruits used in the compote by multiplying the number of lemons used (`min_lemon`) by the respective ratios (1 for lemons, 2 for apples, and 4 for pears) and sums them up.
4. The output correctly reflects the maximum number of fruits that can be combined according to the recipe.

All provided test cases from the problem description are handled correctly by this implementation. Thus, the program is correct and fulfills the requirements.
