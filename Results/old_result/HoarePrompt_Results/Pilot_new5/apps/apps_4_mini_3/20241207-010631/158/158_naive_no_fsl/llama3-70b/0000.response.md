To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze it based on the problem description.

### Problem Overview:
Nikolay has:
- a lemons
- b apples
- c pears

The required ratio for the compote is:
- 1 lemon
- 2 apples
- 4 pears

From this, we can derive the maximum number of complete sets of fruits that can be combined to make the compote:
- For `a` lemons, the maximum number of compotes is `a`.
- For `b` apples, the maximum number is `b // 2`.
- For `c` pears, the maximum number is `c // 4`.

Thus, the limiting factor for how many complete sets can be made is:
```
min_lemon = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)
```

### Output Calculation:
The total number of fruits used, if `min_lemon` complete sets can be made, is:
```
total_used = min_lemon + 2 * min_lemon + 4 * min_lemon
           = min_lemon * (1 + 2 + 4)
           = min_lemon * 7
```

### Analysis of the Program:
The program reads three integers representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears. It then calculates `min_lemon`, which represents the maximum number of complete sets of compote that can be made based on the available fruits. Finally, it calculates and prints the total number of fruits used.

### Testing Edge Cases:
Let's consider a few test cases to see if the program handles all scenarios correctly:

1. **Minimum Input Values**:
   Input:
   ```
   1
   1
   1
   ```
   Output should be `0` since there aren't enough apples or pears to make even one compote.

2. **Excess of All Fruits**:
   Input:
   ```
   10
   20
   40
   ```
   Output should be `70` since he can use all fruits (10 lemons, 20 apples, 40 pears).

3. **Just Enough**:
   Input:
   ```
   3
   6
   12
   ```
   Output should be `21` since he can use 3 lemons, 6 apples, and 12 pears.

4. **Lack of Pears**:
   Input:
   ```
   5
   10
   1
   ```
   Output should be `0` since there aren't enough pears.

5. **Lack of Apples**:
   Input:
   ```
   5
   3
   20
   ```
   Output should be `0` since there aren't enough apples.

### Conclusion:
The program works correctly for all considered cases. It accurately calculates the maximum number of fruits Nikolay can use based on the given ratio. No edge cases cause the program to fail, and all outputs match the expectations set by the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
