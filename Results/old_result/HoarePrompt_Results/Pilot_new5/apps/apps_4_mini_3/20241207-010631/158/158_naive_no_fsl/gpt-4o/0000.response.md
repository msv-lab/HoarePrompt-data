Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It calculates the maximum number of lemons, apples, and pears that can be used in the compote based on the specified ratio of 1:2:4. 

Here's how the program works:
1. It reads the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`) from the input.
2. It computes `max_lemons` as the minimum of:
   - the number of lemons available (`a`),
   - half the number of apples available (`b // 2`), since each lemon requires 2 apples,
   - one-quarter the number of pears available (`c // 4`), since each lemon requires 4 pears.
3. Then, it calculates the total number of fruits used in the compote, which is `max_lemons * 1 (lemons) + max_lemons * 2 (apples) + max_lemons * 4 (pears)`.
4. Finally, it prints the total number of fruits.

The program handles the edge cases correctly, including:
- If any of the fruits are insufficient to meet the ratio requirement, it calculates the total as zero, as shown in the last example.
- The constraints on the number of fruits (between 1 and 1000) ensure that the input will always be valid positive integers.

Since the program functions correctly across all possible input scenarios as described, it is deemed correct.
