To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the given problem description, let's analyze the annotated program step by step:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Nikolay has `a` lemons, `b` apples, and `c` pears.
   - To create the compote, the ratio of fruits needed is 1:2:4 (lemons:apples:pears).
   - For every lemon, 2 apples and 4 pears are required.
   - We need to find the maximum total number of fruits (lemons + apples + pears) that can be used based on the available fruits.

2. **Input and Output**:
   - The program reads three integers (a, b, c) from input.
   - It calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used (`min_lemon`), based on the available fruits and their required ratios:
     - `min_lemon = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`
   - The total fruits used is calculated as:
     - `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4 = min_lemon * (1 + 2 + 4) = min_lemon * 7`

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The calculation `min_lemon` correctly determines the maximum number of lemons that can be used without exceeding the available quantities of apples and pears.
   - The output of the program is the total number of fruits used in the compote, which is given by `min_lemon * 7`, aligning with the problem's requirement to report the total number of fruits.
   - The case when `min_lemon` is 0 (not enough fruits to meet the ratio) results in an output of 0, which is also correct as per the problem description.

4. **Example Verification**:
   - For inputs `2, 5, 7`: 
     - `min_lemon = min(2, 5 // 2, 7 // 4) = min(2, 2, 1) = 1`
     - Output: `1 * 7 = 7` (correct).
   - For inputs `4, 7, 13`:
     - `min_lemon = min(4, 7 // 2, 13 // 4) = min(4, 3, 3) = 3`
     - Output: `3 * 7 = 21` (correct).
   - For inputs `2, 3, 2`:
     - `min_lemon = min(2, 3 // 2, 2 // 4) = min(2, 1, 0) = 0`
     - Output: `0 * 7 = 0` (correct).

Conclusively, the program adheres to the problem requirements for all cases.

Correctness: **True**
