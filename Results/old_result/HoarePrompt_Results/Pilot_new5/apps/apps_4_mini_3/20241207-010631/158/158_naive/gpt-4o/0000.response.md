Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly computes the maximum total number of fruits (lemons, apples, and pears) that can be used to cook the compote based on the given ratio of 1:2:4. 

The program does the following:
1. It reads the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`).
2. It calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used in the compote, ensuring that there are enough apples and pears to satisfy the ratio requirements: 
   - For every lemon, 2 apples and 4 pears are needed. 
   - This is achieved by using `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`, which correctly determines the limiting factor based on the available fruits.
3. It calculates the total number of fruits used based on the maximum number of lemons calculated and prints the result.

The program also correctly handles the case where there are not enough fruits to make the compote, as it will result in `max_lemons` being 0, leading to a total fruit count of 0 being printed.

All the provided example cases are handled correctly:
- For input `2, 5, 7`, the output is `7` (1 lemon, 2 apples, 4 pears).
- For input `4, 7, 13`, the output is `21` (3 lemons, 6 apples, 12 pears).
- For input `2, 3, 2`, the output is `0` (not enough pears).

Since the program meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases, it is correct.
