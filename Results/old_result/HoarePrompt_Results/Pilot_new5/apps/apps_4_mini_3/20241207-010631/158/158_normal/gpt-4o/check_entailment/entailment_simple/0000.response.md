Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description. Hereâ€™s an explanation of how it adheres to the specifications:

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads three positive integers from the input (`a`, `b`, and `c`), which represent the number of lemons, apples, and pears Nikolay has, respectively. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Ratio Calculation**: The program calculates the maximum number of lemons (`max_lemons`) that can be used in the compote based on the given fruit ratio of 1:2:4:
   - For each lemon, 2 apples and 4 pears are required. 
   - Thus, it computes `max_lemons` as the minimum of:
     - `a` (the number of lemons available),
     - `b // 2` (how many pairs of apples can be made from the available apples),
     - `c // 4` (how many sets of pears can be made from the available pears).

3. **Total Fruits Calculation**: The program computes the total number of fruits used in the compote as follows:
   - The total fruits are calculated with the formula: `max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4`, which simplifies to `max_lemons * 7`. This means that for every set of fruits used according to the ratio, the total count is correctly summed.

4. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the total number of fruits used, which is the required output as per the problem description.

By ensuring that the number of lemons, apples, and pears used in the compote adheres strictly to the specified ratio and by calculating the maximum possible fruits that can be used without breaking the ratio rules, the program meets the problem requirements accurately.

Thus, the overall logic and calculations of the program are correct, and it will yield the expected output for all valid inputs within the specified constraints.
