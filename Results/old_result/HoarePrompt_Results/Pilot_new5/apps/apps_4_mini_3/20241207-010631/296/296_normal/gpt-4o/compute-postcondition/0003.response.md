The variable `divisors` is initialized as an empty list. The variable `n` remains unchanged, retaining its condition as a positive integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^9 \) and \( n > 2 \). Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^9 \) and \( n > 2 \; and \; divisors = []`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9 and `n` > 2; `divisors` = []**
