According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(n))`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know:
- `n` is at least 4, which means `int(math.sqrt(n))` is at least 2.
- The loop starts at `i = 2`.

Since `i` starts at 2 and increments by 1 in each iteration, we need to determine the current value of `i` after the last iteration. 

If `i` reaches `int(math.sqrt(n))` after the last iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `int(math.sqrt(n))`.

Thus, if the last value of `i` was `int(math.sqrt(n))`, the next value will be `i + 1`. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer that is at least 4, `i` is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`**.
