The code snippet `divisors.append(n // i)` appends the value of `n // i` to the list `divisors`. Given that `n` is a positive integer that is at least 4, and `i` is the integer value of the square root of `n`, we can determine the value that will be appended to `divisors`.

Since `i` is `int(math.sqrt(n))`, the value of `i` can be expressed as `i = int(math.sqrt(n))`. The operation `n // i` represents integer division of `n` by `i`.

Now, since `n` is at least 4, the value of `i` will be at least 2. Thus, `n // i` will be calculated based on the specific value of `n`.

The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the addition of the new value to `divisors`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer that is at least 4, `i` is `int(math.sqrt(n))`, and `divisors` now includes the value of `n // i`.**
