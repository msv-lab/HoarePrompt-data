The program aims to generate a sequence of fractions such that the fractions meet specific conditions outlined in the problem description. Letâ€™s evaluate its correctness based on the requirements:

1. **Condition Checking:**
   - The program checks if `n` is less than or equal to 2 and returns 'NO'. This is correct since the problem states that `n` is at least 2. However, for `n = 2`, the only divisor is itself, which does not satisfy the condition `1 < b_i < n`. Thus, returning 'NO' for `n = 2` is valid.

2. **Finding Divisors:**
   - The program calculates the divisors of `n` from 2 to `sqrt(n)`. It correctly adds both `i` and `n // i` as potential divisors. However, it does not ensure that the added divisors are strictly less than `n` and greater than 1. The check is implicit since it only considers divisors that are less than `sqrt(n)`, but it is necessary to ensure that the conditions `b_i < n` and `b_i > 1` are satisfied.

3. **Constructing Fractions:**
   - The program then constructs fractions `(1, d)` for each divisor `d`. This is valid since it ensures that `1 < b_i`, provided that `d` is a valid divisor and `d` is not equal to `n`. However, the sum of these fractions must equal `1 - 1/n`, which is not checked in the program. The program simply outputs the fractions without verifying if they sum to the required total.

**Key Issue:**
The major flaw in the implementation is that it does not ensure that the sum of the fractions equates to `1 - 1/n`. The fractions being generated can be valid, but they may not achieve the desired sum. For example, if `n` has divisors that do not contribute to the required sum, the program would still return a sequence that is not valid according to the problem requirements.

**Conclusion:**
Since it is possible for the program to produce a sequence of fractions that do not satisfy the summation condition specified in the problem description, the program does not meet all the requirements. 

Correctness: **False**
