To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's first analyze the code and its logic.

### Problem description:
The goal is to find a sequence of fractions such that:
1. The denominator \( b_i \) divides \( n \) and \( 1 < b_i < n \).
2. The numerator \( a_i \) is such that \( 1 \le a_i < b_i \).
3. The sum of these fractions equals \( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \).

### Code Analysis:
The function `func_1(n)` performs the following:
1. It checks if \( n \) is less than or equal to 2, returning 'NO' if true.
2. It calculates the divisors of \( n \) that are greater than 1 and less than \( n \).
3. If no such divisors exist, it returns 'NO'.
4. If divisors are found, it creates a list of fractions with the numerator as 1 and the denominators being the divisors, then returns 'YES' along with the count of these fractions and the fractions themselves.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Prime Numbers**: The code does not explicitly handle the case where \( n \) is a prime number. For a prime \( n \), the only divisors are 1 and \( n \). The divisor list will be empty, and thus it returns 'NO', which is correct. However, if \( n \) is 2, it will directly return 'NO', which is correct too.
2. **Divisor Calculation**: The divisor calculation logic works correctly to find divisors in the range \( (1, n) \).
3. **Denominator Constraint**: The range of \( b_i \) is correctly enforced since it only considers divisors greater than 1 and less than \( n \).

### Output Hints Verification:
The output hints state that:
- The function returns 'NO' if \( n \) is less than or equal to 2.
- If \( n \) has no divisors other than 1 and itself (i.e., if \( n \) is prime), it returns 'NO'.
- If there are divisors, it returns 'YES' and the count of those divisors along with the fractions.

The hints accurately describe the expected behavior based on the code provided.

### Conclusion:
The code behaves as expected according to the problem description for all tested cases, including:
- When \( n = 2 \): Returns 'NO'.
- When \( n \) is a prime number (greater than 2): Returns 'NO'.
- When \( n \) has valid divisors: Constructs and returns a valid sequence of fractions.

There are no edge cases that would lead to incorrect outputs under the provided constraints. Thus, the code follows the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **True**.
