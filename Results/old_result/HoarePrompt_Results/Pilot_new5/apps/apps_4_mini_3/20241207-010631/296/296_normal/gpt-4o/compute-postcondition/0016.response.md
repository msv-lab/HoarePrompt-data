To determine the adjusted states for the loop to execute one more time, we start by analyzing the given information.

1. **Understanding the loop**: The loop is set to iterate over `i` from 2 to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`. This means that the last value of `i` that the loop can take is when `i` is equal to `int(math.sqrt(n))`, and the next value after that will be `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`, which will cause the loop to terminate.

2. **Current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the states are:
   - `n` is a positive integer that is at least 4.
   - `i` is equal to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.

3. **What needs to change for the loop to execute again**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(n))`. Since `i` is currently `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`, we need to decrease `i` by 1 to make it equal to `int(math.sqrt(n))`.

4. **Next required value of `i`**: The next value of `i` that allows the loop to execute one more time should be equal to `int(math.sqrt(n))`.

5. **Condition for `n`**: Since `n` is still required to be a positive integer at least 4, it remains unchanged.

Now combining these points, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:

State: **`n` is a positive integer that is at least 4, `i` is `int(math.sqrt(n))`**
