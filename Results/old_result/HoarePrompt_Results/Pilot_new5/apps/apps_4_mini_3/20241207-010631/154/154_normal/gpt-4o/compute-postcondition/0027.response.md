The value of `subtasks_solved` is assigned the minimum of its current value or the product of `(n - complete_tasks)` and `k`. Since `subtasks_solved` is initially 0, it will remain 0 as the minimum value will be 0 regardless of the other variables, provided that `n` is at least 1 and `complete_tasks` is at least 0.

Thus, after executing the code, the state of `subtasks_solved` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `k` is within 1 and 45, `M` is a non-negative integer within 0 and 2Â·10^9, `t` is a list of `k` integers where each integer is between 1 and 1000000, `total_time_per_task` is equal to `sum(t)`, `max_points` is 0, `complete_tasks` is 0, `time_used` is greater than `M`, `points` is 0, `remaining_time` is a negative value equal to `M - time_used`, `subtasks_solved` is 0.**
