The loop iterates over each `subtask_time` in the list `t`, processing each one in relation to the `remaining_time`. If `remaining_time` is sufficient, it calculates how many subtasks can be solved based on the time required for each subtask.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, the following conditions and states apply:

1. **`remaining_time`** will be the leftover time after trying to solve as many subtasks as possible given the constraints of the subtasks' time requirements.
2. **`subtasks_solved`** will be the total number of subtasks solved across all tasks, which will be the sum of all `max_subtasks_for_this_task` values calculated during each iteration of the loop, provided that `remaining_time` was sufficient for the corresponding `subtask_time`.
3. **The variables `n`, `k`, `M`, `points`, `total_time_per_task`, `max_points`, and `complete_tasks`** will remain unchanged from their initial state.

Additionally, for the loop to execute fully, at least `k` must be greater than or equal to the number of elements that were successfully processed in the loop.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `k` is at least 1, `M` is a non-negative integer within 0 and 2Â·10^9, `t` is a list of `k` integers where each integer is between 1 and 1000000, `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `remaining_time` is the remaining time after all possible subtasks have been solved, `total_time_per_task` remains as stated, `max_points` remains as stated, `complete_tasks` remains as stated, `subtasks_solved` is the total number of subtasks solved across all tasks.**
