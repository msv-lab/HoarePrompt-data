The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 1, `k` is within 1 and 45, `M` is a non-negative integer within 0 and 2·10^9, `t` is a list of `k` integers where each integer is between 1 and 1000000, `total_time_per_task` is equal to `sum(t)`, `max_points` is either `max(max_points, points + subtasks_solved)`, `complete_tasks` is 1, `time_used` is equal to `sum(t)`, `points` is 0, `remaining_time` is a negative value equal to `M - time_used`, `subtasks_solved` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
