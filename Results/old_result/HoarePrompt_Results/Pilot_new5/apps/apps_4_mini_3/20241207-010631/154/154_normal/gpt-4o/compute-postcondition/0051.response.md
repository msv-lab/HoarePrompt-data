Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `k` is at least 1, `M` is a non-negative integer within 0 and 2Â·10^9, `t` is a list of `k` integers that must have at least 3 integers between 1 and 1000000, `total_time_per_task` is equal to `sum(t)`, `max_points` is either `max(max_points, points + 0)`, `complete_tasks` is 2, `time_used` is equal to `sum(t)`, `points` is equal to `k + 1`, `remaining_time` is a negative value equal to `M - sum(t)`, `subtasks_solved` is 0, `subtask_time` is the third element of `t`, and if `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`, then `max_subtasks_for_this_task` remains 0.***
