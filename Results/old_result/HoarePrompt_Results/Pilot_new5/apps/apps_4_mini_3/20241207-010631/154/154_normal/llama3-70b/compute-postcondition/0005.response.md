According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `M`. Since the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `M + 1`, the loop will execute if `M` is at least 1. The current state indicates that `M` can be between 0 and 2Â·10^9. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `M` needs to be adjusted to be at least 1. 

At the end of the last iteration of the loop, `j` would be equal to `M` (if `M` is greater than or equal to 1). 

Thus, to ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state to indicate that `M` is at least 1 and that `j` starts at 1.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 45, `k` is between 1 and 45, `M` must be at least 1, `t` is a sorted list of integers, `dp` is a list of lists with dimensions (k + 1) by (M + 1) initialized with 0s, `i` is 1, `j` is 1**
