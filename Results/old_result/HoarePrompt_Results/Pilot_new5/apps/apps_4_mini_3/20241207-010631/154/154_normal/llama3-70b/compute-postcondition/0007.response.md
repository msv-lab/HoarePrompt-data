Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 45, `k` is between 1 and 45, `M` is at least 1, `t` is a sorted list of integers, `dp` is a list of lists with dimensions (k + 1) by (M + 1) initialized with 0s, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and `dp[1][1]` is now equal to `dp[1][0]`. The current value of `j` is greater than or equal to the value of `t[i - 1]`.***
