Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `k` is within 1 and 45, `M` is a non-negative integer within 0 and 2·10^9, `t` is a list of `k` integers where each integer is between 1 and 1000000, `total_time_per_task` is equal to `sum(t)`, `max_points` is 0, `complete_tasks` is 0, and `time_used` is greater than `M`, leading to a break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
