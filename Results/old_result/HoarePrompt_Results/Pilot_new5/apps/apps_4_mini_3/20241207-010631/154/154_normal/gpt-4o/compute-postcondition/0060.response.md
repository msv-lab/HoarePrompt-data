The variable `remaining_time` is assigned the value of `M - time_used`. The initial state indicates that `M` is a non-negative integer within 0 and 2·10^9, and since `time_used` is not defined in the initial state, it is assumed to be a specific value that could potentially alter the value of `remaining_time`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `k` is at least 1, `M` is a non-negative integer within 0 and 2·10^9, `t` is a list of `k` integers where each integer is between 1 and 1000000, `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `remaining_time` is equal to `M - time_used`, and the values of `total_time_per_task`, `max_points`, `complete_tasks`, and `subtasks_solved` remain as stated in the precondition.**
