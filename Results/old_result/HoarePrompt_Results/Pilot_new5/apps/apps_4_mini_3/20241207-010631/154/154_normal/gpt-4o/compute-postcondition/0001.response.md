The variable `max_points` is assigned the value of 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45; `M` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `M` ≤ 2·10^9; `t` is a list of `k` integers where each integer `t[j]` (1 ≤ `t[j]` ≤ 1000000); `total_time_per_task` is equal to `sum(t)`; `max_points` is 0.**
