Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 45, `k` is between 1 and 45, `M` is at least 1, `t` is a sorted list of integers, and `dp[i][j]` contains the maximum number of items that can be selected from the first `i` items with a total weight not exceeding `j` for all `j` from 1 to `M`. If `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`, then `dp[k + 1][1]` is updated to the maximum value between its previous value and `dp[k][1 - t[k]] + 1` if `1` is greater than or equal to `t[k]`. Otherwise, the value of `dp[k + 1][1]` remains unchanged.***
