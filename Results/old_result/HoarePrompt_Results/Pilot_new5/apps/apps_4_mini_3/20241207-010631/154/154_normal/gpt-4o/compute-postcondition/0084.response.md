Functionality: ** The function accepts integers `n` and `k`, a non-negative integer `M`, and a list `t` of `k` integers representing the time required for each subtask. It calculates the maximum points that can be earned by completing entire tasks and subtasks within the given time limit `M`. The function specifically calculates the points based on the number of complete tasks and the total subtasks that can be solved within the remaining time after completing those tasks. It returns the maximum points obtained, which accounts for both complete and partial task completions. **
