The function `func` accepts the following parameters: 
- `n`: an integer between 1 and 45 inclusive.
- `k`: an integer between 1 and 45 inclusive.
- `M`: a non-negative integer such that 0 <= M <= 2·10^9.
- `t`: a list of `k` integers where each integer `t[j]` is between 1 and 1,000,000 inclusive.

The functionality of the function `func` processes these parameters to produce an output based on certain criteria derived from the values of `n`, `k`, `M`, and the list `t`. However, the specific output is not detailed in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (integer between 1 and 45), k (integer between 1 and 45), M (non-negative integer between 0 and 2·10^9), and t (list of k integers between 1 and 1,000,000). The output depends on the processing of these parameters.**
