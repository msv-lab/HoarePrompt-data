The statement `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]` implies that the value at `dp[i][j]` is being set to the value of the previous index in the second dimension, which is `dp[i][j - 1]`. 

Since `j` is initialized to `M`, after executing the line of code, `dp[i][M]` will be updated to the value of `dp[i][M - 1]`. The values of `n`, `k`, `M`, `t`, and the rest of the `dp` list remain unchanged except for the specific value that is now assigned to `dp[i][M]`.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 45, `k` is between 1 and 45, `M` is at least 1, `t` is a sorted list of integers, `dp[i][j]` is now equal to `dp[i][M - 1]`, and `j` is M.**
