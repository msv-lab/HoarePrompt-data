n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45) representing the number of tasks, k is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45) representing the number of subtasks per task, M is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9) representing the total available minutes, and t is a list of k integers (1 ≤ t[j] ≤ 1000000) representing the time in minutes required to solve each subtask.
