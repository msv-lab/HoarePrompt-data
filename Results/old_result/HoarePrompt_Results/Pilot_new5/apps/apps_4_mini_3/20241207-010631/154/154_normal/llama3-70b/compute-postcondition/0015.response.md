The assignment statement `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]` copies the value from the `dp` list at position `[i][j - 1]` to position `[i][j]`. The variables `n`, `k`, `M`, `t`, and `j` themselves remain unchanged as they are not directly modified, but `j` can be represented in relation to `M`. Since `j` is set to `M + 1`, this relationship holds.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 45, `k` is between 1 and 45, `M` is at least 1, `t` is a sorted list of integers, `j` is equal to `M + 1`, and `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`.**
