The variable `points` is assigned the value of `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`. Given that `k` is at least 1, the expression `k + 1` will be at least `2`. Therefore, the value of `points` will depend on the current value of `complete_tasks`. 

The updated state of `points` will reflect this calculation, while the other variables remain unchanged. The initial conditions concerning `n`, `k`, `M`, `t`, `total_time_per_task`, `max_points`, `remaining_time`, and `subtasks_solved` still hold true without any updates.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `k` is at least 1, `M` is a non-negative integer within 0 and 2Â·10^9, `t` is a list of `k` integers where each integer is between 1 and 1000000, `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, and the values of `total_time_per_task`, `max_points`, `complete_tasks`, `remaining_time`, and `subtasks_solved` remain as stated in the precondition.**
