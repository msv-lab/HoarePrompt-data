According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `M`. The loop iterates through values of `j` from 1 to `M`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is less than or equal to `M`. Since the loop starts with `j = 1`, the next value of `j` will be `j + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `M`. 

If `j` is currently `M`, the loop will not execute again. However, if `j` is less than `M`, it increments to `j + 1`, allowing another iteration. Assuming the last value of `j` was `M`, the next state must reflect that `j` is now `M + 1`.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 45, `k` is between 1 and 45, `M` is at least 1, `t` is a sorted list of integers, `j` is M + 1**
