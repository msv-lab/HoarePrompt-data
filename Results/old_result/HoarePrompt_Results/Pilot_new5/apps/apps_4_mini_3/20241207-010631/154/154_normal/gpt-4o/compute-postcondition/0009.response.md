The variable `subtasks_solved` is initialized to 0. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `M`, `t`, `total_time_per_task`, `max_points`, `complete_tasks`, `time_used`, `points`, and `remaining_time`) remain unchanged because they are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State summarizes the unchanged values and updates the value of `subtasks_solved`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `k` is within 1 and 45, `M` is a non-negative integer within 0 and 2Â·10^9, `t` is a list of `k` integers where each integer is between 1 and 1000000, `total_time_per_task` is equal to `sum(t)`, `max_points` is 0, `complete_tasks` is 0, `time_used` is greater than `M`, `points` is 0, `remaining_time` is a negative value equal to `M - time_used`, `subtasks_solved` is 0.**
