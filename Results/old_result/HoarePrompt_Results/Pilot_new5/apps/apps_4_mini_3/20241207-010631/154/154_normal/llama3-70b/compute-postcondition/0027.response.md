The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i][j]` based on the maximum of its current value and the value of `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`. 

1. The variable `dp[i][j]` is impacted by taking the maximum of its current value and the expression `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`.
2. The condition depends on the values of `dp`, `t`, and the indices `i` and `j` based on the initial state.
3. Since `t` is a sorted list of integers, the value `t[i - 1]` is valid if `i` is within the bounds of the list.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 45, `k` is between 1 and 45, `M` is at least 1, `t` is a sorted list of integers, `j` is M + 1, and `dp[i][j]` is updated to max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1)**.
