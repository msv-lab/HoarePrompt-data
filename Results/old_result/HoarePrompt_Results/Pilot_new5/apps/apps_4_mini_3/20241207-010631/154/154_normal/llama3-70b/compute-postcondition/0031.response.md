The code assigns to `dp[i][j]` the maximum value between its current value and the value calculated from `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`. Given that `dp[i][j]` is initially equal to `dp[i][0]`, we can conclude that the new value of `dp[i][j]` will depend on the indices involved and the value at `t[i - 1]`. 

Since `n` and `k` are both between 1 and 45, and `t` is a sorted list of integers, `t[i - 1]` will be a valid index reflecting the current context of `dp`. The value of `dp[i][j]` could increase by 1 if `j - t[i - 1]` is a valid index of `dp[i - 1]`. 

However, since `j` is equal to 1, and `t[i - 1]` will be a value from the list `t`, it is possible that `j - t[i - 1]` could be less than 0, leading to the situation where the second term may not be considered.

The overall impact on the output state depends on the values of `dp[i][j]` and `dp[i-1][j - t[i - 1]]`. 

Thus, we can conclude:
- `dp[i][j]` is updated to be the maximum of itself and the value from the previous row minus the value from `t`.

However, without specific values for `dp` and `t`, we cannot determine exact numbers. Therefore, we state:

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 45, `k` is between 1 and 45, `M` is at least 1, `t` is a sorted list of integers, `j` is 1, and `dp[i][j]` is now the maximum of its previous value and `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`.**
