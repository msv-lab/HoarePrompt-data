The statement `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]` assigns the value of `dp[i][j - 1]` to `dp[i][j]`. The variables `n`, `k`, `M`, `t`, and `j` are not directly changed by this assignment, but `j` is involved in the operation. Since `j` is equal to `M + 1`, it indicates that `j` is at least 2. The state of `dp[i][j]` is updated, but without further context on the previous state of `dp`, we cannot determine the exact numeric value it holds now. 

Therefore, the output state reflects that `dp[i][j]` is now equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, while maintaining the values of other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 45, `k` is between 1 and 45, `M` is at least 1, `t` is a sorted list of integers, `j` is M + 1, and `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`**.
