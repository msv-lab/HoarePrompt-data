According to the code, the loop can execute if `complete_tasks` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `complete_tasks` is 1 and `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `complete_tasks` must be incremented by 1, making it 2. Therefore, for the loop to proceed, `n` must be at least 2.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `k` is at least 1, `M` is a non-negative integer within 0 and 2Â·10^9, `t` is a list of `k` integers where each integer is between 1 and 1000000, `total_time_per_task` is equal to `sum(t)`, `max_points` is either `max(max_points, k + 1)`, `complete_tasks` is 2, `time_used` is equal to `sum(t)`, `points` is equal to `k + 1`, `remaining_time` is a negative value equal to `M - sum(t)`, `subtasks_solved` is 0**.
