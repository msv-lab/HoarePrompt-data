The variable `total_time_per_task` is assigned the value of `sum(t)`, which calculates the total time required to solve all the subtasks represented by the list `t`. The initial state does not provide the specific values of `t`, but it does indicate that `t` is a list of integers where each integer can range from 1 to 1,000,000.

Therefore, `total_time_per_task` will be some non-negative integer that is the sum of the integers in the list `t`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45; `M` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `M` ≤ 2·10^9; `t` is a list of `k` integers where each integer `t[j]` (1 ≤ `t[j]` ≤ 1000000); `total_time_per_task` is equal to `sum(t)`.**
