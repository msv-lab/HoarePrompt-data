The variable `remaining_time` is assigned the value of `M - time_used`. Given that `time_used` is greater than `M`, the result of this operation will be a negative value. 

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 1, `k` is within 1 and 45, `M` is a non-negative integer within 0 and 2·10^9, `t` is a list of `k` integers where each integer is between 1 and 1000000, `total_time_per_task` is equal to `sum(t)`, `max_points` is 0, `complete_tasks` is 0, `time_used` is greater than `M`, `points` is 0, and `remaining_time` is a negative value equal to `M - time_used`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `k` is within 1 and 45, `M` is a non-negative integer within 0 and 2·10^9, `t` is a list of `k` integers where each integer is between 1 and 1000000, `total_time_per_task` is equal to `sum(t)`, `max_points` is 0, `complete_tasks` is 0, `time_used` is greater than `M`, `points` is 0, `remaining_time` is a negative value equal to `M - time_used`.**
