The code provided is an attempt to solve the problem of calculating the maximum points Polycarp can earn in a given amount of time \( M \), based on several tasks, each with specific subtasks that require different amounts of time. Let's analyze the code and the problem description step by step.

### Initial Assessment of the Code
1. **Understanding the problem:** Polycarp can solve subtasks of tasks in any order and earns points based on the number of subtasks solved and an extra point for completely solving a task. The total points can be calculated based on the subtasks completed within the time limit \( M \).
  
2. **Dynamic Programming Approach:** The code uses a dynamic programming (DP) array to compute the maximum number of subtasks that can be completed within \( M \) minutes. The DP table `dp[i][j]` is filled to represent the maximum number of subtasks that can be completed considering the first `i` subtasks with a time limit of `j`.

3. **Point Calculation:** At the end, the points are calculated by summing the maximum subtasks completed and determining how many complete tasks (subtasks solved fully) can be achieved within the time limit.

### Edge Cases Not Handled
- The code does not explicitly handle the case where \( M \) is smaller than the smallest time in the list \( t \). If \( M \) is less than the minimum time required for any subtask, Polycarp cannot earn any points, but the code will still output a result based on the uninitialized DP array, which can lead to incorrect values.
- If \( M = 0 \), Polycarp cannot complete any subtasks, yet the code may not return the expected output of 0 points.

### Output Hints Analysis
The output hints suggest that the function calculates the maximum items that can be selected such that their total weight does not exceed \( M \) and prints the sum of these items along with the count of configurations where the total weight equals \( M \). This aligns with the DP logic in the code but does not clarify that the subtasks must also be fully considered when counting points.

### Conclusion
While the code implements a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem, it does not handle all edge cases, particularly when the provided time \( M \) is insufficient for completing any subtask. This inconsistency with the problem description renders the program incorrect in certain situations.

Therefore, the final assessment is:
Correctness: **False**. 

The function does not account for cases where \( M \) is smaller than the smallest item in \( t \) or when \( M = 0 \), potentially leading to incorrect outputs.
