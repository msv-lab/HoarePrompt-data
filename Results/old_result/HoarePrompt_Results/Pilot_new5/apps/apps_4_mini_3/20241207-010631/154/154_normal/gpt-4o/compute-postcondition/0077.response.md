Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `k` is at least 2, `M` is a non-negative integer within 0 and 2Â·10^9, `t` is a list of `k` integers where each integer is between 1 and 1000000, `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `total_time_per_task` remains as stated, `max_points` remains as stated, `complete_tasks` remains as stated. If `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`, `subtasks_solved` is increased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`, which is equal to `remaining_time // subtask_time`, and `remaining_time` is reduced to `remaining_time - (remaining_time // subtask_time) * subtask_time`. Otherwise, `remaining_time` remains unchanged.***
