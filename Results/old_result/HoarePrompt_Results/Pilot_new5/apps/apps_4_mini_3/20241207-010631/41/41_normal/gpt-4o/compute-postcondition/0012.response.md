The code `ratings.append((a, b))` adds a tuple `(a, b)` to the existing list `ratings`. It is stated that if `a` is not equal to `b`, `ratings` will be updated to include the tuple, and `is_rated` will be set to True. The variable `k` is also adjusted to `k + 1`, which must be less than `n`.

Given that `ratings` gets updated with the tuple `(a, b)`, assuming `a` is not equal to `b`, the impact of this code is that the list `ratings` now contains one additional tuple, while the other variables remain unchanged.

The output state would therefore reflect the inclusion of the new tuple in `ratings` and the increment of `k`. As the specific values of `a`, `b`, and `k` are not provided, they will be referred to generally.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `ratings` includes the tuple `(a, b)`; `is_rated` is set to True; `k` is adjusted to `k + 1` (and `k < n`).**
