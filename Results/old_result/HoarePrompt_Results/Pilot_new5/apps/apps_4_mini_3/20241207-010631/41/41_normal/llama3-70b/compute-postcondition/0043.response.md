According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop is defined to iterate from `i + 1` to `n`, which is from 2 to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, meaning the next value of `j` should be 2. Since `n` is between 2 and 1000, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be increased to 3, and `n` must be at least 3 to allow the loop to continue executing.

State: **`n` is between 3 and 1000, `i` is 1, `j` is 3**
