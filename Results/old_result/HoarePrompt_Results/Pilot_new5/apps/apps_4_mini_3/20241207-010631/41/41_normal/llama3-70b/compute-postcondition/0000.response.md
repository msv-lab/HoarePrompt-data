The code assigns the value of `n` to the integer input provided by the user. The variable `n` is initially stated to be an integer between 2 and 1000. The value of `n` will now take on this input value, which is still within the specified range. Other variables (`a_i` and `b_i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State will reflect this change.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `n` is an input integer**
