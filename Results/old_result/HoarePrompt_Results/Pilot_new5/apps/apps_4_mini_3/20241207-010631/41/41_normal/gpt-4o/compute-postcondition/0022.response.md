According to the code, the for loop will execute if the range specified (`range(1, n)`) has at least one value. Since `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, the smallest value for `n` is 2, which means the loop will execute with `i` taking the values 1 and then 2 for the iterations. 

Before the loop starts, `i` must be initialized to 1, which is the first value in the range. The states do not need to be adjusted concerning `ratings`, `is_rated`, and `is_unrated` for the loop to execute since they do not affect the loop's execution directly.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `i` is 1**
