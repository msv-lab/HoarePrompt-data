Postcondition: ***`unrated` is a boolean indicating if there are differences between `ratings_before` and `ratings_after`. If `unrated` is True, then `i` is either equal to `n - 1` if all ratings are the same or some value less than `n - 1` if a difference was found, while `n` is between 2 and 1000, and `rated` is False, leading to an output of 'unrated'. If `unrated` is False, then `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `n` remains between 2 and 1000, `rated` is False, and 'maybe' has been printed.***
