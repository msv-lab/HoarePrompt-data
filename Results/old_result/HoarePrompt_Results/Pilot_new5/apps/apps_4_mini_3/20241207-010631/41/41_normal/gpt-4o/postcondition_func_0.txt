The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of participants, and for each participant, it processes their ratings before (`a_i`) and after (`b_i`) a round. The function checks if any participant's rating has changed (`is_rated`). If at least one rating has changed, it outputs 'rated'. If no ratings have changed and at least one rating before the round is less than a subsequent rating, it outputs 'unrated'. If there are no changes and ratings are non-increasing, it outputs 'maybe'. The function handles cases where `n` can range from 2 to 1000 and ratings are integers between 1 and 4126.
