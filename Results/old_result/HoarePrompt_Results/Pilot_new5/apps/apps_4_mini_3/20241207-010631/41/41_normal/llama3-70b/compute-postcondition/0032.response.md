Postcondition: ***`n` is between 2 and 1000, `i` is 0, `j` is 3. If `ratings_before[i]` is less than `ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i]` is greater than `ratings_after[j]`, then `unrated` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without any change to the state.***
