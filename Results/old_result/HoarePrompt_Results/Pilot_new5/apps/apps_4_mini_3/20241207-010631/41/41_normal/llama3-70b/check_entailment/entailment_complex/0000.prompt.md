You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Is it rated?

Here it is. The Ultimate Question of Competitive Programming, Codeforces, and Everything. And you are here to answer it.

Another Codeforces round has been conducted. No two participants have the same number of points. For each participant, from the top to the bottom of the standings, their rating before and after the round is known.

It's known that if at least one participant's rating has changed, then the round was rated for sure.

It's also known that if the round was rated and a participant with lower rating took a better place in the standings than a participant with higher rating, then at least one round participant's rating has changed.

In this problem, you should not make any other assumptions about the rating system.

Determine if the current round is rated, unrated, or it's impossible to determine whether it is rated of not.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of round participants.

Each of the next n lines contains two integers a_{i} and b_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i}, b_{i} ≤ 4126) — the rating of the i-th participant before and after the round, respectively. The participants are listed in order from the top to the bottom of the standings.


-----Output-----

If the round is rated for sure, print "rated". If the round is unrated for sure, print "unrated". If it's impossible to determine whether the round is rated or not, print "maybe".


-----Examples-----

3060 3060
2194 2194
2876 2903
2624 2624
3007 2991
2884 2884

Output
rated

Input

1500 1500
1300 1300
1200 1200
1400 1400

Output
unrated

Input
5
3123 3123
2777 2777
2246 2246
2246 2246
1699 1699

Output
maybe



-----Note-----

In the first example, the ratings of the participants in the third and fifth places have changed, therefore, the round was rated.

In the second example, no one's rating has changed, but the participant in the second place has lower rating than the participant in the fourth place. Therefore, if the round was rated, someone's rating would've changed for sure.

In the third example, no one's rating has changed, and the participants took places in non-increasing order of their rating. Therefore, it's impossible to determine whether the round is rated or not.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer between 2 and 1000, and for each participant, a_i and b_i are integers between 1 and 4126 representing the rating before and after the round, respectively.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ratings_before = []
    ratings_after = []
    for _ in range(n):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        ratings_before.append(a)
        
        ratings_after.append(b)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `ratings_before` contains `n` integers representing the values of `a` inputted during each iteration, `ratings_after` contains `n` integers representing the values of `b` inputted during each iteration.
    rated = False
    unrated = True
    maybe = True
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j] and ratings_after[i
                ] > ratings_after[j]:
                unrated = False
                break
        
        if not unrated:
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `unrated` is either True or False depending on whether any inconsistencies were found between the ratings_before and ratings_after, with `n` remaining between 2 and 1000.
    for i in range(n):
        if ratings_before[i] != ratings_after[i]:
            rated = True
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `unrated` is True if any ratings_before differ from ratings_after, otherwise it is False; `i` is equal to n - 1 if all ratings are the same, or some value less than n - 1 if a difference was found before the last index; `n` is between 2 and 1000.
    if rated :
        print('rated')
    else :
        if unrated :
            print('unrated')
        else :
            print('maybe')
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`unrated` is a boolean indicating if there are differences between `ratings_before` and `ratings_after`. If `unrated` is True, then `i` is either equal to `n - 1` if all ratings are the same or some value less than `n - 1` if a difference was found, while `n` is between 2 and 1000, and `rated` is False, leading to an output of 'unrated'. If `unrated` is False, then `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `n` remains between 2 and 1000, `rated` is False, and 'maybe' has been printed.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`unrated` is a boolean indicating if there are differences between `ratings_before` and `ratings_after`. If `rated` is True, then `unrated` indicates if any ratings differ, `i` can be `n - 1` if all ratings are the same, or some value less than `n - 1` if a difference was found, and `n` is between 2 and 1000. If `rated` is False, then `unrated` reflects whether there are differences; if `unrated` is True, `i` is less than `n - 1`, while if `unrated` is False, `i` equals `n - 1`, and `n` remains in the range of 2 to 1000, leading to different outputs based on the conditions met.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` (between 2 and 1000) representing the number of participants, and then reads two ratings for each participant: `ratings_before` and `ratings_after`, both of which are integers between 1 and 4126. It determines if the results are 'rated' (if any `ratings_before` differ from the corresponding `ratings_after`), 'unrated' (if there are inconsistencies where a lower `ratings_before` corresponds to a higher `ratings_after`), or 'maybe' (if none of the ratings differ, but inconsistencies were found). The outputs are determined based on the conditions of these comparisons.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
