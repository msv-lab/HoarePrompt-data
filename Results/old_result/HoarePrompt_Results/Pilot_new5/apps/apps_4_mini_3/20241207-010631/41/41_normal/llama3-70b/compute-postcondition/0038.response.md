According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `i + 1` is less than `n`. Given that `i` is 1 and `n` is between 2 and 1000, `i + 1` equals 2, which is less than `n` (since the minimum value of `n` is 2). Therefore, the loop can execute.

At the start of the loop, `j` is initialized to `i + 1`, which is 2. Since `j` will start at 2 and increment until it reaches `n - 1`, the values of `j` will range from 2 to `n - 1` during the loop's execution.

Thus, for the loop to be executed, we confirm the following states:
- `n` is between 2 and 1000.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is set to 2 at the start of the loop.

State: **`n` is between 2 and 1000, `i` is 1, `j` is 2**
