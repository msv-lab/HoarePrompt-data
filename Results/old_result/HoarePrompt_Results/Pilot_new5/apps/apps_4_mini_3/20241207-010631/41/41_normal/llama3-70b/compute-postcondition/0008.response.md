The variables `a` and `b` are assigned values from the input, which are integers. Since `ratings_before` now includes the value of `a` appended to it and `ratings_after` includes the value of `b` appended to it, we can update these lists accordingly. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the assignment. The variable `_` is also unchanged as it is assigned the same value as `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `_` is `n`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `ratings_before` includes the value of `a`, `ratings_after` includes the value of `b`.**
