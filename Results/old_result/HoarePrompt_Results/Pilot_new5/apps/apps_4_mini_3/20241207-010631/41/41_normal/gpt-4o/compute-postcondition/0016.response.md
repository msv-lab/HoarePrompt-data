The values of `a` and `b` are assigned the values obtained from `input().split()`, which are then converted to integers. The previous values of `a` and `b` are unknown but are now replaced by the input values. The `ratings` tuple will also be updated since it includes `a` and `b`. The states of the other variables, such as `n`, `is_rated`, and `k`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `ratings` includes the tuple `(a, b)`; `is_rated` is True; `k` is adjusted to `k + 2` (and `k + 1 < n)`**
