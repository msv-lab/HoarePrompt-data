The code `ratings_after.append(b)` adds the value of `b` to the list `ratings_after`. Since `ratings_after` initially includes the value of `b` twice, after executing the code, it will include the value of `b` three times. The values of `n`, `_`, `a`, and `ratings_before` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `_` is `n + 1`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `ratings_before` includes the value of `a` three times, `ratings_after` includes the value of `b` three times.**
