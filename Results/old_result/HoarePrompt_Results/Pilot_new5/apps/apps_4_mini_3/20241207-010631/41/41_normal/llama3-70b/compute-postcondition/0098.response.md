Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (between 2 and 1000) representing the number of participants, and then reads two ratings for each participant: `ratings_before` and `ratings_after`, both of which are integers between 1 and 4126. It determines if the results are 'rated' (if any `ratings_before` differ from the corresponding `ratings_after`), 'unrated' (if there are inconsistencies where a lower `ratings_before` corresponds to a higher `ratings_after`), or 'maybe' (if none of the ratings differ, but inconsistencies were found). The outputs are determined based on the conditions of these comparisons. **
