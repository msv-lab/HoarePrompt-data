The variable `maybe` is assigned the value `True`. The values of the other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State remains focused on the change introduced by the code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `ratings_before` contains `n` integers representing the values of `a` inputted during each iteration, `ratings_after` contains `n` integers representing the values of `b` inputted during each iteration, `rated` is False, `unrated` is True, `maybe` is True**.
