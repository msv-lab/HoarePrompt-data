Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 1000, `i` is 0, `j` is equal to `n - 1`. If there exists any `j` such that `ratings_before[i]` is less than `ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i]` is greater than `ratings_after[j]`, then `unrated` is False. If no such `j` exists during the loop iterations, then `unrated` remains True.**
