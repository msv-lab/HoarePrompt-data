The code appends the tuple `(a, b)` to the list `ratings`. The initial state indicates that `ratings` already contains the tuple `(a, b)`, and it is being added again. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 â‰¤ `n` â‰¤ 1000; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `ratings` includes the tuple `(a, b)` twice; `is_rated` is True; `k` is adjusted to `k + 2` (and `k + 1 < n)**
