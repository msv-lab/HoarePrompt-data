The variable `is_rated` is assigned the value `True`, but it was already set to `True` in the initial state. Therefore, there are no changes to the values of the variables affected by the code, and the preconditions remain valid as they were.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `ratings` includes the tuple `(a, b)`; `is_rated` is True; `k` is adjusted to `k + 1` (and `k < n`).**
