The code appends a tuple `(a, b)` to the list `ratings`. The values of `a` and `b` are input integers, and we do not modify any other variables in the initial state. The variable `ratings` must exist as a list prior to this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `ratings` is updated to include the tuple `(a, b)`.**
