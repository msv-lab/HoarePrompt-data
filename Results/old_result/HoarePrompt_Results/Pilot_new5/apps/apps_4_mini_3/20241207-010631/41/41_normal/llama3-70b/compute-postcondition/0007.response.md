According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the variable `_` is less than `n`. Since `_` takes values from 0 to `n-1`, it can execute a total of `n` times. At the end of the last iteration, `_` will be `n-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented to `n`, which is the stopping condition for the loop. 

Thus, the state at the beginning of the next iteration should reflect that `_` has increased by 1. Since `n` is still an integer between 2 and 1000, no adjustments are needed for `n`, `a`, or `b`.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `_` is n, `a` and `b` are input integers, `ratings_before` now includes the value of `a` appended to it, `ratings_after` now includes the value of `b` appended to it.**
