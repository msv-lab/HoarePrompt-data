According to the code, the loop is set to execute from `i + 1` to `n - 1`. Given that `i` is 0, the loop will execute from 1 to `n - 1`. This means the loop can execute as long as `n` is greater than 1. 

Since `n` is between 2 and 1000, this condition is satisfied and the loop will execute. At the start of the loop, `j` will be 1 in the first iteration. 

Thus, the necessary adjustments to the state are that `j` starts at 1. 

State: **`n` is between 2 and 1000, `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
