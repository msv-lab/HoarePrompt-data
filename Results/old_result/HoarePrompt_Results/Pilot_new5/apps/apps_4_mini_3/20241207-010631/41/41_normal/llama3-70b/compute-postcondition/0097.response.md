The function `func` accepts no parameters. It operates on a set of integers `a_i` and `b_i` for each participant, where `a_i` represents the rating before the round and `b_i` represents the rating after the round. The function is designed to handle `n`, which is an integer between 2 and 1000, that indicates the number of participants. The ratings `a_i` and `b_i` must be integers between 1 and 4126. 

Based on the expected outputs and the input constraints, the functionality of the function is to compute and return results based on the ratings of the participants before and after the round, while ensuring that input conditions regarding `n`, `a_i`, and `b_i` are satisfied.

Functionality: **The function accepts ratings of participants before and after a round, where the number of participants `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, and each rating `a_i` and `b_i` is an integer between 1 and 4126. The function processes these ratings and returns results based on the computations.**
