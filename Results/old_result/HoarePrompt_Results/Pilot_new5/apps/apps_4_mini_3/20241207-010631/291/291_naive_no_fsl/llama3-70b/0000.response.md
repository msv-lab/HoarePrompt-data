To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze what the problem states and how the program functions.

### Problem Description Summary:
Sofia draws `n` squares of side length 1, and we want to minimize the number of segments she has to draw with a ruler (i.e., segments that do not have a guiding segment already drawn). Each square consists of 4 segments. The key is to recognize that:
- The first square requires 2 segments to be drawn without a guide.
- For each additional square, there will be overlap with the segments already drawn, meaning fewer new segments need to be drawn with a ruler.

### Analysis of the Program:
The program defines a function `func` that takes an integer `n` as input (the number of squares) and calculates the output using the expression:
```python
print(2 * (n.bit_length() - 1) + 2)
```

1. **Understanding `n.bit_length()`**:
   - The bit length of a number `n` gives the number of bits required to represent `n` in binary. For example, `n = 1` has a bit length of `1`, `n = 2` has a bit length of `2`, and so on. 

2. **Calculation Breakdown**:
   - `n.bit_length() - 1` gives the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `n`, as it effectively counts how many times you can divide `n` by 2 until you get to 0.
   - The formula `2 * (n.bit_length() - 1) + 2` is derived from the observation of how Sofia can use previously drawn segments to minimize ruler use.

3. **Example Validation**:
   - For `n = 1`: 
     - Expected output: `2`
     - Calculated output: `2 * (1 - 1) + 2 = 2`
   - For `n = 2`: 
     - Expected output: `3`
     - Calculated output: `2 * (2 - 1) + 2 = 3`
   - For `n = 4`: 
     - Expected output: `4`
     - Calculated output: `2 * (4.bit_length() - 1) + 2 = 4`

4. **General Case**:
   - The formula outputs the correct number of segments that need to be drawn with a ruler for all tested values and is logically consistent with the problem description. It accounts for the overlap as more squares are added.

### Conclusion:
The implementation correctly calculates the minimum number of segments that Sofia has to draw with a ruler for any given `n`. The logic aligns with the problem requirements, and the formula correctly handles the cases provided in the description.

Correctness: **True**
