To determine the correctness of the annotated program in relation to the problem description, we need to assess whether the logic within the function `func_1(n)` accurately calculates the minimum number of segments Sofia must draw with a ruler when drawing `n` squares.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. Each square consists of 4 segments.
2. If Sofia can use a previously drawn segment as a guide, she minimizes the number of segments she has to draw with a ruler.
3. The goal is to calculate the minimum number of segments that require a ruler based on the relationship between the number of rows and columns that can be formed by the segments.

### Program Logic:
- The function iterates over all integer values `a` from `1` to `sqrt(n)`:
  - `a` represents the number of rows of squares Sofia can draw.
  - `b` is computed as the ceiling of `n/a`, representing the number of columns needed for `n` squares given `a` rows.
  - Each configuration of `a` (rows) and `b` (columns) yields `segments_needed = 2 * (a + b)`, which accounts for the segments needed to outline the rows and the columns.
- The program seeks the minimum number of segments needed over all configurations of `a`.

### Mathematical Explanation:
- The expression for `segments_needed` is `2 * (a + ceil(n/a))`, which captures the total segments needed when arranging the squares into `a` rows and `b` columns.
- By iterating through all possible numbers of rows (up to `sqrt(n)`), the program ensures that it checks all reasonable configurations, as beyond a certain point (if rows exceed `sqrt(n)`), the number of columns would have to be very small, leading to an inefficient arrangement of segments.

### Verification Against Problem Description:
The logic and calculations implemented in `func_1(n)` align with the problem description:
- It correctly identifies how many segments Sofia needs to draw based on the arrangement of squares, minimizing the total drawn without a guide by considering both rows and columns simultaneously.
- The use of mathematical operations and the iterating up to `sqrt(n)` ensures that all configurations are considered thoroughly.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the required logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, it fulfills the requirements outlined in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
