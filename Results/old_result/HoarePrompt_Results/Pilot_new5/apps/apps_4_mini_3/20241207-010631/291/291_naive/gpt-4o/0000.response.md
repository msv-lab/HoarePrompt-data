To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze how the function computes the minimum number of segments that Sofia will have to draw with a ruler without a guide.

The problem states that Sofia will draw `n` squares, which requires drawing `2n` segments in total (2 segments for each square). However, the ability to reuse segments from previously drawn squares allows for some segments to be drawn without needing a ruler.

The logic in the provided program works as follows:
1. It iterates through possible values of `a`, which can be thought of as the height of a rectangle that can contain the `n` squares (with the other dimension being `b`).
2. For each value of `a`, it calculates `b` such that `a * b >= n` (the area must be at least `n`).
3. It calculates the number of segments needed to draw the rectangle formed by these dimensions, which is `2 * (a + b)`.
4. It tracks the minimum number of segments needed across all possible dimensions.

However, let's analyze the case when `n` is a perfect square. For instance, when `n = 4`, the minimum segments required should actually be `4`, as Sofia can draw the segments in such a way that all squares are connected without needing any additional ruler segments.

The program correctly computes the minimum number of segments for larger values of `n` that are not perfect squares, but it can produce incorrect results for cases where `n` is a perfect square.

**Test case to consider:**
- For `n = 4`, the expected output is `4`. However, according to the program's logic, it computes `min_segments_needed = 6`, which is incorrect.

Thus, since the program fails for this case, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**.
