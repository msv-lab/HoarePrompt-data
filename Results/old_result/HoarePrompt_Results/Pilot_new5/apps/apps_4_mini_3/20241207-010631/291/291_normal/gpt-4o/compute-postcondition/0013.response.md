Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9; `min_segments_needed` is the minimum value of `segments_needed` for all values of `a` in the range [1, sqrt(n)], where `segments_needed` is calculated as `2 * (a + (n + a - 1) // a)`; `a` is the maximum integer value in the range [1, sqrt(n)] that the loop has executed, and `b` is the corresponding value calculated as `(n + a - 1) // a`.**
