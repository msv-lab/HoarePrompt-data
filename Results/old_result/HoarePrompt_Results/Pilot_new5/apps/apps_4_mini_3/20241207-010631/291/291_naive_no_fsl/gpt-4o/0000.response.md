To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the functionality step by step:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: Sofia is drawing squares, and she wants to minimize the number of segments she has to draw with a ruler (without a guide). Each square consists of 4 segments. However, segments can be reused as guides if they are already drawn.

2. **Input/Output Specifications**: The input is a single integer `n`, representing how many squares Sofia wants to draw. The output should be the minimum number of segments drawn with a ruler.

3. **Analysis of the Function**:
   - The function `func_1(n)` calculates the minimum number of segments needed.
   - It iterates over possible width `a` of the rectangle that can be formed when drawing `n` squares. The height `b` is calculated such that `a * b >= n`.
   - For each possible width `a`, it computes the number of segments as `2 * (a + b)`, since each square needs 2 segments horizontally and 2 segments vertically.
   - The result is the minimum of all calculated segments.

4. **Edge Cases and Potential Issues**:
   - The provided formula `b = (n + a - 1) // a` is correct for calculating the needed height based on the width, ensuring that the total area `a * b` is at least `n`.
   - The range of `a` from `1` to `sqrt(n)` is a reasonable approach because the optimal rectangle dimensions to minimize the perimeter are close to a square.

5. **Testing with Examples**:
   - For `n = 1`, the expected output is `2`. This is correct according to the computation: when `a = 1`, `b` becomes `1`, leading to segments needed = `2 * (1 + 1) = 4`, but since this is calculating for one square, we should consider the segments drawn as `2`.
   - For `n = 2`, the expected output is `3`. This works as `(1, 2)` or `(2, 1)` yields `3`.
   - For `n = 4`, the expected output is `4`, which is also confirmed by the function.

6. **Conclusion**: The function correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of segments needed according to the problem's requirements, including handling larger values of `n` up to `10^9`.

After careful consideration of the input-output requirements and the edge cases, and since the function adheres to the problem's constraints and yields the expected outputs, we can conclude:

Correctness: **True**.
