According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop iterates through `j`, which ranges from 0 up to but not including `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `i` is greater than 0. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be greater than 1 since `j` will take on the next value of 1. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows: `j` will increase to 1, and `cakes` and `volumes` remain unchanged since they are not affected by the loop's execution.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `cakes` is a list of tuples containing dimensions for at least `n` cakes, and `volumes` is a list of calculated volumes for each cake corresponding to `cakes`.**
