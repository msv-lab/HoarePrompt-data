The code initializes an empty list called `cakes`. The variable `n` remains unchanged and continues to represent a positive integer, while the list `cakes` is now defined and empty. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000); `cakes` is an empty list.**
