According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `i`. The loop executes as long as `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `i` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will become 1.

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, the condition for `j` is that it must be less than `i`, which means `i` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `cakes` is a list of tuples containing dimensions for at least `n` cakes, `volumes` is a list containing at least `i + 1` calculated volumes, and if `volumes[j]` is less than `volumes[i]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + volumes[i]`.**
