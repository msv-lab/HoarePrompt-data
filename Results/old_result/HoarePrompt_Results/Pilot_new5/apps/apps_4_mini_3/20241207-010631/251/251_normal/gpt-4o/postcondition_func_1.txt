The function accepts a positive integer `n` representing the number of cakes, and a list of tuples `cakes` where each tuple contains two integers indicating the radius and height of each cake. It processes input to gather these values and calls another function `func_1` with them, printing the result formatted to six decimal places. However, it lacks error handling for invalid inputs, such as non-integer values or wrong list lengths, which may lead to runtime errors.
