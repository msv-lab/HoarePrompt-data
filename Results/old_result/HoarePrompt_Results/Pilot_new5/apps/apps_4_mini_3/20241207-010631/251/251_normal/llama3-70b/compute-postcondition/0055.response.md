The code snippet `print(dp[-1])` outputs the last element of the list `dp`, which is `dp[n-1]`, where `n` is the number of cakes in the list. The value of `dp[-1]` is retained, and the other variables remain unaffected. The output does not modify any variables but simply prints the value of `dp[-1]`.

Output State: **`dp` contains the maximum sum of cake values for each cake based on the dimension conditions, with `dp[0]` equal to `cakes[0][0]`, and the last value printed is `dp[-1]`.**
