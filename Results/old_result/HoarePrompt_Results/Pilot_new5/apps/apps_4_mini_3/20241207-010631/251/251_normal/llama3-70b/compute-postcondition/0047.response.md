According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute for each value of `j` starting from 0 up to `i-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, and `j` is 0. This means that the loop has executed for `j` values 0, 1, 2, and 3 in previous iterations. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the next value for `j` will be 1 (after considering the current value of 0). The loop will continue until `j` reaches 3, which means it must have at least 4 iterations in total. 

State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 4, `j` is 1**
