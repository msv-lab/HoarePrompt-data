The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it processes a collection of cakes defined by their radius `r_i` and height `h_i`, where `i` ranges from 1 to `n`, with `n` being a positive integer between 1 and 100,000. Each radius `r_i` and height `h_i` is also an integer with values between 1 and 10,000. The function will return a value based on the properties of these cakes, but the specific return value is not provided in the output. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process data related to cakes defined by their radius and height, without accepting any parameters.

Functionality: **The function processes a collection of cakes defined by their radius and height, without accepting any parameters.**
