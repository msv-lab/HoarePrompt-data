Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is greater than 3, `cakes` is a list of tuples containing dimensions for at least `n` cakes, `volumes` is a list containing at least `i + 1` calculated volumes, and `j` is 3. If `volumes[j]` is less than `volumes[i]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of `dp[i]` and `dp[3]` plus `volumes[i]`.***
