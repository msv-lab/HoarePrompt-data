The value of `n` is assigned using `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since it is specified that `n` is an even integer in the range [2, 100], after the execution, `n` will hold the value of the input integer, which will still be an even integer within that range. The states of the other variables (the subsequent n integers) are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer in the range [2, 100]**
