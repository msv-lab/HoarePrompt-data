To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze its logic in relation to the problem description.

The problem requires two players, Petya and Vasya, to choose distinct integers such that:
1. Together, they take all cards.
2. Each player ends up with the same number of cards.

The program follows these steps:
1. It reads the number of cards and the integers on those cards.
2. It counts the occurrences of each integer using a dictionary.
3. It checks if there are two distinct integers that each occur exactly `n/2` times.

Let's consider various scenarios:

1. **Example where the game is fair**:
   - Input: 
     ```
     4
     11
     27
     27
     11
     ```
   - Expected Output: 
     ```
     YES
     11 27
     ```
   - The program correctly identifies that both integers occur 2 times.

2. **Example where no fair game is possible**:
   - Input:
     ```
     2
     6
     6
     ```
   - Expected Output: 
     ```
     NO
     ```
   - The program correctly outputs NO since there are not two distinct integers.

3. **Example where more than two distinct integers exist, but they don't satisfy the conditions**:
   - Input:
     ```
     6
     10
     20
     30
     20
     10
     20
     ```
   - Expected Output: 
     ```
     NO
     ```
   - The program identifies that there's no pair of distinct integers with the required frequency.

4. **Edge Case**:
   - Input:
     ```
     4
     1
     1
     2
     2
     ```
   - Expected Output:
     ```
     YES
     1 2
     ```
   - The program can return YES here, but difficulty arises if there are only one type of card (e.g., input all same integers). The program will return NO correctly.

Now, let's consider a case where the program might fail:

- Input:
  ```
  6
  1
  1
  2
  2
  2
  3
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  NO
  ```
- The program returns NO, which is correct.

However, the program logic is fundamentally flawed in how it checks for `n // 2` occurrences. It assumes exactly two distinct integers must exist, each with an occurrence of `n // 2`. This won't cover the scenario where more than two integers exist in varying frequencies but can still allow for a fair distribution.

**Example of failure**:
Suppose we have:
```
4
4
4
5
5
```
The expected output should be `YES 4 5`, but the program would fail to identify this correctly because it looks for exactly two distinct integers appearing `n // 2` times.

Therefore, the presented code does not handle cases with more than two integers or the specific frequency distribution correctly.

Correctness: **False**.
