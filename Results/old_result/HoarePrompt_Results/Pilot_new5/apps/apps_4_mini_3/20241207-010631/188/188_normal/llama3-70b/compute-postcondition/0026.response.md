The variables `a1` and `a2` are both assigned the value of `-1`. There are no conditions or calculations affecting the other variables. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated values of `a1` and `a2`, while `n`, `d`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `d` is a dictionary containing each unique integer from the list as keys and their corresponding counts as values, `c` is 0, `a1` is -1, `a2` is -1**
