`a1` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `i` is the first key in the dictionary `d`, and since `d` has at least one entry, `i` is defined. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `d` has at least 1 entry, `i` is the first key in the dictionary `d`, `d[i]` is equal to `n // 2`, `c` is 0, and `a1` is equal to `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `d` has at least 1 entry, `i` is the first key in the dictionary `d`, `d[i]` is equal to `n // 2`, `c` is 0, `a1` is equal to `i`.**
