The variable `a2` is assigned the value of `i`, which is the second key in the dictionary `d`. The value of `i` is directly taken from the dictionary, and there are no changes to the other variables. Therefore, the output state will reflect this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `d` has at least 1 entry, `i` is the second key in the dictionary `d`, `a2` is equal to `i`.**
