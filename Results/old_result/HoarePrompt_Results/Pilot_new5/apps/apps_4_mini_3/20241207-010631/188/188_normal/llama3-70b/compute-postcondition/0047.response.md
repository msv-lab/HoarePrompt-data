The variable `a2` is assigned the value of `i`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `d`, `c`, `a1`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `d` has at least 1 entry, `i` is the next key in the dictionary `d`, `c` is unchanged, `a1` is unchanged, and `a2` is equal to `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `d` has at least 1 entry, `i` is the next key in the dictionary `d`, `c` is unchanged, `a1` is unchanged, `a2` is equal to `i.**
