The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an even integer between 2 and 100. The subsequent `n` integers represent the numbers written on the `n` cards, where each integer is between 1 and 100. After executing the function body, it processes the integers and computes a result based on the logic defined within the function. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an even integer `n` (between 2 and 100) and `n` integers (each between 1 and 100) representing numbers on cards, and returns a computed result based on the logic applied to those integers.**
