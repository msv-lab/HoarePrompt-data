To analyze the final state of the program after the loop has executed, we consider the structure of the loop and the initial conditions provided.

Given that `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, the loop will execute `n` times (where `n` is guaranteed to be at least 2). During each iteration of the loop, an integer is appended to the list `a` through user input.

After `n` iterations, we can derive the following output state:

1. `n` remains unchanged as the given even integer between 2 and 100.
2. The variable `i` will be equal to `n - 1`, as it counts from 0 to `n-1`.
3. The list `a` will contain `n` integers, which are the integers input by the user during each iteration of the loop.

Therefore, consolidating these observations:

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` contains `n` integers entered by the user.**
