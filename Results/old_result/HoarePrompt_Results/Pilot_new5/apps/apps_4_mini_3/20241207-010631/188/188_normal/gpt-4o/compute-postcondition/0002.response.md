The `Counter` function is applied to the list `cards`, which counts the occurrences of each integer in that list. The initial state indicates that `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, and `cards` is a list containing `n` integers based on user input. The value of `count` will be a dictionary-like object that maps each unique integer in `cards` to its frequency.

The state of `n` remains unchanged, and the specific values in `cards` influence the content of `count`, which will reflect how many times each integer appears in the list.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer in the range [2, 100]; `cards` is a list of `n` integers based on user input; `count` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in `cards`.**
