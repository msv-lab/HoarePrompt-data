Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `d` has at least 1 entry, `i` is the next key in the dictionary `d`, if `c` is 0, then `c` is incremented by 1 and `a1` is equal to `i`, while `a2` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `c` remains unchanged, `a1` remains unchanged, and `a2` is equal to `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
