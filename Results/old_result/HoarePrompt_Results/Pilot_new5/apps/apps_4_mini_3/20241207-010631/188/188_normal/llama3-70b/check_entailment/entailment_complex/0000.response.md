Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description for determining whether Petya and Vasya can fairly choose their integers. Here are the main issues:

1. **Counting Frequencies**: The program counts the occurrences of each integer and then only checks for two distinct integers that both appear exactly `n / 2` times. However, a valid solution can exist with different frequencies. For example, if there are integers `x` appearing `n/2` times and `y` appearing `n/2` times, the program correctly identifies them. But if there were other combinations (like appearing `n/2` and `n/2 + 1`), the game could still potentially be fair, but the program would incorrectly output "NO".

2. **No Handling for Other Combinations**: The program strictly requires that there be exactly two integers with equal counts of `n / 2`. This is too restrictive, as it ignores the possibility of having multiple integers where the total still sums to `n` but does not split into two groups of `n / 2`.

For example, an input like:
```
4
1
1
2
2
```
would return "YES" (since both 1 and 2 appear 2 times). But an input like:
```
4
1
1
2
3
```
would return "NO," which is not correct since it is also possible to distribute cards between the players evenly.

Thus, the program fails to cover all potential cases outlined in the problem description, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
