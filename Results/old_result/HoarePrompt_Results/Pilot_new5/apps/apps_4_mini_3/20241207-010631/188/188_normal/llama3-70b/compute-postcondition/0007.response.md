The code appends an integer input to the list `a`. The previous state indicates that `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 2, and `a` contains previous integers plus one additional integer from input. The value of `a` will change to include this new integer, but `n` and `i` will remain unchanged as they are unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 2, `a` contains previous integers plus one additional integer from input.**
