The function accepts an even integer `n` (in the range [2, 100]) and reads `n` integers from user input (each in the range [1, 100]). It counts the frequency of each integer and checks for two most frequent unique numbers. If there are fewer than two unique numbers, it prints 'NO'. If the two most frequent numbers each appear exactly `n // 2` times, it prints 'YES' along with those numbers; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. It does not handle cases where the input might be outside the expected ranges or where the input cannot be converted to integers.
