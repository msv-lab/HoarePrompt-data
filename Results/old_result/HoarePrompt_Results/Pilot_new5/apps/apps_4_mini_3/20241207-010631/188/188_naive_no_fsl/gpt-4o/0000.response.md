Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic needed to determine if a fair game is possible. Specifically, the program only checks if the two most frequent numbers appear exactly `n // 2` times each. However, this is not sufficient to determine a fair game, as it is possible for there to be more than two unique numbers while still meeting the conditions described.

For example, consider the case where the input is:
```
6
1
1
1
2
2
2
```
In this case, we have three `1`s and three `2`s. The program would incorrectly output "NO" because it does not have exactly two distinct integers appearing `n // 2` times each.

Thus, the program fails on this input case and does not cover all potential scenarios where a fair game could be achieved.
