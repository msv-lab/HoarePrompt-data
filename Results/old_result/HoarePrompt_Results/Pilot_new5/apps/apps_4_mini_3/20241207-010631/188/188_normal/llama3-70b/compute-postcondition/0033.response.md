The code assigns the value of `i` to `a2`. Since `i` is the first key in the dictionary `d`, the value of `a2` will be equal to that key `i`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `d` has at least 1 entry, `i` is the first key in the dictionary `d`, and the value of `d[i]` is equal to `n // 2`, `c` is not equal to 0, `a2` is equal to `i`.**
