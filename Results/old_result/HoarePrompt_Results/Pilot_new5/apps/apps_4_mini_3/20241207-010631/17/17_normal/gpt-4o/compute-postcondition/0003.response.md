The variable `cnt_4` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` will take an input from the user and `int` will convert it to an integer. The other variables (`cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, and `cnt_3`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `cnt_1` is a non-negative integer, `cnt_2` is an input integer, `cnt_3` is an input integer, `cnt_4` is an input integer.

Output State: **`cnt_1` is a non-negative integer, `cnt_2` is an input integer, `cnt_3` is an input integer, `cnt_4` is an input integer**
