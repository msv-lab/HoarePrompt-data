The function `func` accepts four parameters: `cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4`. Each of these parameters is a non-negative integer, and they satisfy the constraint that 0 <= cnt_i <= 10^9 for i in {1, 2, 3, 4}. The function does not have a specified return value in the provided output, thus it is unclear what the exact output or result of the function is. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept four non-negative integer parameters while having unspecified return behavior.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters cnt_1, cnt_2, cnt_3, and cnt_4, which are non-negative integers within the range of 0 to 10^9. The return behavior of the function is unspecified.**
