The function accepts four non-negative integers as input (cnt1, cnt2, cnt3, cnt4), checks if the sum of cnt1 and cnt2 equals the sum of cnt3 and cnt4, and whether cnt2 is greater than or equal to cnt3. It prints 1 if both conditions are met; otherwise, it prints 0. The function does not return any values.
