The function accepts four non-negative integers `cnt1`, `cnt2`, `cnt3`, and `cnt4` via user input. It checks if `cnt3` is greater than `cnt1` and prints `0` if it is; otherwise, it prints `1`. The function does not return any value but only prints output based on the condition. The functionality does not handle any potential errors related to input types or invalid inputs.
