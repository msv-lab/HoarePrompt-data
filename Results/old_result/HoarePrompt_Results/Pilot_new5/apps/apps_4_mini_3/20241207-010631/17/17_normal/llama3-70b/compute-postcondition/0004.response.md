The code snippet provided executes a `print` statement, which outputs a value but does not change any of the variables. The initial state indicates that `cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4` are non-negative integers, and `cnt1`, `cnt2`, `cnt3`, `cnt4` are assigned values from user input converted to integers. It also specifies that the value of `cnt3` is less than or equal to `cnt1`. Since the `print` statement does not affect any variable values, the output state will include all the information from the precondition without any changes.

Output State: **`cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4` are non-negative integers; `cnt1`, `cnt2`, `cnt3`, `cnt4` are assigned values from user input converted to integers; `cnt3` is less than or equal to `cnt1`; printed value is 1.**
