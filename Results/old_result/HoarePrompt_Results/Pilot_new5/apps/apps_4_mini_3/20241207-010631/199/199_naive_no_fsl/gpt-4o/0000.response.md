To determine the correctness of the provided code based on the problem description, we need to understand the requirements for forming a rectangle and the constraints of the cuts. 

Hereâ€™s the breakdown of the provided code:

1. The function `func_1(n)` is designed to count the ways to split a stick of length `n` into four parts, two of one length (let's call it `a`) and two of another length (let's call it `b`), such that they can form a rectangle but not a square. 
2. The code checks if `n` is less than 6, in which case it returns 0, because to have four positive integer lengths that sum to `n`, the minimum length of `n` must be 6 (i.e., 1 + 1 + 1 + 1).
3. The loop runs through potential lengths for `a`, starting from 1 up to `n // 4`. For each `a`, it assigns `b` (which is also `a`), and calculates the remaining length (`rem`). 
4. It then checks if `rem` can be split into two equal parts (i.e., `rem` must be even), and ensures that the part length formed from `rem` is different from `a` to avoid forming a square.

Now, we need to check if there are any valid cases where the program fails. 

Let's consider an example:

- **Test case with `n = 10`:**  
  - The possible splits are {1, 1, 4, 4}, {2, 2, 3, 3}. 
  - Both of these configurations can form rectangles, and neither can form squares. Therefore, the expected output should be 2. 
  - However, according to the provided code, when we run `func_1(10)`, it only allows for configurations that have equal pairs `a` and `b` derived from the same loop. It misses potential valid combinations like {2, 2, 3, 3} because it checks for `a` and `rem // 2` being the same. Thus, it incorrectly counts configurations.

From this reasoning, we conclude that the code does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. 

Correctness: **False** 

The code does not account for all valid combinations to form a rectangle that are not squares, thus failing to fulfill the problem's requirements.
