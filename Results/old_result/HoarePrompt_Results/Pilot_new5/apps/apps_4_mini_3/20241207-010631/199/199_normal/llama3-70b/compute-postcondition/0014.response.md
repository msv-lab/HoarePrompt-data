According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b` and the range defined for it. The loop is set to iterate from `a` to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`. With `a` being 2, the starting point for `b` will be 2. 

For the loop to execute at least once, the ending point `(n - a) // 2 + 1` must be greater than or equal to `a`. This means:

1. The condition `(n - a) // 2 + 1 >= a` should hold true.
2. With `a` being 2, this translates to `(n - 2) // 2 + 1 >= 2`.
3. Simplifying this gives `(n - 2) // 2 >= 1`, which leads to `n - 2 >= 2`, hence `n >= 4`. 

Since it is already provided that `n` must be at least 4, this condition is satisfied.

At the start of the loop, `b` will start from `a`, which is 2. Therefore, we can conclude the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute:

State: **`n` must be at least 4, `ways` is the number of valid pairs (1, b) found where `b` varies from 1 to (n - 1) // 2, `a` is 2, `b` is 2**
