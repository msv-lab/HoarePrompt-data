According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `a` is less than or equal to `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 5 (because `n // 2` must be at least 3 for `a` to go to 3). 

Since `n` is at least 4, to execute the loop one more time, `n` needs to be at least 5, and `a` will increment to 3.

State: **`n` must be at least 5, `ways` is the number of valid pairs (3, b) such that `2 * (3 + b) == n` for valid `b`, `a` is 3.**
