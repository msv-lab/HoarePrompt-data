To analyze the given code snippet, we can break it down step by step.

1. The initial state provides the following variables:
   - `count` is 1
   - `rem` is equal to `n - 4 * (previous_value_of_a + 2)`
   - `a` is `previous_value_of_a + 2`
   - `b` is equal to `previous_value_of_a + 2`

2. The code snippet updates the variable `rem`:
   ```
   rem = n - 2 * (a + b)
   ```

3. We can substitute the values of `a` and `b` into the equation:
   - Since `a = previous_value_of_a + 2` and `b = previous_value_of_a + 2`, we have:
     - `a + b = (previous_value_of_a + 2) + (previous_value_of_a + 2) = 2 * previous_value_of_a + 4`

4. Now we can replace `a + b` in the `rem` equation:
   ```
   rem = n - 2 * (2 * previous_value_of_a + 4)
   rem = n - 4 * previous_value_of_a - 8
   ```

5. The value of `rem` now is `n - 4 * previous_value_of_a - 8`. This means that the previous expression for `rem` (`n - 4 * (previous_value_of_a + 2)`) has been replaced by this new expression. 

6. Other variables `count`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Putting together all of this information, we conclude with the updated output state.

Output State: **`count` is 1, `rem` is equal to `n - 4 * previous_value_of_a - 8`, `a` is `previous_value_of_a + 2`, `b` is `previous_value_of_a + 2`**
