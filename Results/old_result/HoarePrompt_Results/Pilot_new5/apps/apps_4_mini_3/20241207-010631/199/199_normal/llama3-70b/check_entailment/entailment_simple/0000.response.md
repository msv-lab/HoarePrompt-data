To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze whether the program fulfills the requirement of counting the distinct ways to split a stick of length `n` into four parts such that they can form a rectangle but not a square.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Rectangle Formation**: For four parts to form a rectangle, they must consist of two pairs of equal lengths. This means the lengths can be represented as `{a, a, b, b}` where `a` and `b` are positive integers.
2. **Square Formation**: The configuration `{x, x, x, x}` is a square formation and should be excluded from the count.
3. **Sum of Parts**: The total length of the parts must equal `n`, i.e., `2 * (a + b) = n`.

### Program Analysis:
- The program defines a function `func_1(n)` that attempts to find valid pairs `(a, b)` such that:
  - `a` and `b` are distinct,
  - They satisfy the equation `2 * (a + b) = n`.

- The outer loop iterates `a` from `1` to `n // 2`.
- The inner loop iterates `b` from `a` to `(n - a) // 2`.

### Validity Check:
1. **Distinct Pairs**: The check `a != b` ensures pairs are distinct.
2. **Equation Satisfaction**: The check `2 * (a + b) == n` ensures the total length condition is met.
3. **Returning the Count**: The variable `ways` counts the valid pairs found.

### Boundary Conditions:
- For `n < 4`, it is impossible to form four positive integer parts. The program would correctly return `0`.
- The program effectively counts valid configurations that can form rectangles but ensures they don't count squares since `a` and `b` must be distinct.

### Limitations:
- The program does not explicitly check for the case where both `a` and `b` could be the same (i.e., both being `x` for a square). However, by design, since it checks for distinctness (`a != b`), it inherently prevents the count of square configurations.

### Conclusion:
Therefore, the program correctly implements the logic needed to count the distinct partitioning of the stick into four parts to satisfy the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
