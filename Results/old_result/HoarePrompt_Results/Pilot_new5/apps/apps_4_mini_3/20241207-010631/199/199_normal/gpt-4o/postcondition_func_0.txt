The function accepts a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9) and returns 0 if `n` is less than 6. If `n` is 6 or greater, it calculates and returns the total number of valid pairs `(a, b)` such that the remainder `rem = n - 2 * (a + b)` is positive and even for all iterations of `a` from 1 to `n // 4`, while ensuring `a` is not equal to `rem // 2`. The function does not handle cases where `n` is less than 1 or greater than 2·10^9 directly, assuming input is always valid as per the precondition.
