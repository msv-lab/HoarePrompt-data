According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b` and the range defined by the loop. The loop will execute as long as `b` is less than or equal to `(n - a) // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 4, which means `n - a` is at least 4 - `a`.

Assuming `b` was at the end of the last iteration, the next value of `b` will be increased by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `b` must be less than or equal to `(n - a) // 2`.

If `b` was `k` at the end of the last iteration, then for the loop to execute again, `k + 1` must be less than or equal to `(n - a) // 2`. This implies that `n - a` must be at least `2 * (k + 1)`.

State: **`n` is at least 4, `ways` is the number of valid pairs (1, b) found plus 1 if `a` is not equal to `b` and `2 * (a + b)` equals `n`, b is `k + 1`, and `n - a` must be at least `2 * (k + 1)`**
