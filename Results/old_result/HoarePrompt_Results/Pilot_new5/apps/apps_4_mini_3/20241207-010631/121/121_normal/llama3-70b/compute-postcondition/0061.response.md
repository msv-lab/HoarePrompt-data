Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255; `s` is a string of length `n`; `c` is the second character of the string `s`; `res` is updated as `res + 'T'; count['C']` is decremented by 1 if `count['C']` is greater than 0; `nc` is 'T'; and `count['T']` is decremented by 1. The execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
