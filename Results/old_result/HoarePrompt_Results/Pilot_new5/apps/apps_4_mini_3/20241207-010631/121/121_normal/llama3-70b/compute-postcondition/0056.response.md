Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255, `s` is a string of length `n`, `c` is the second character of the string `s`, `res` is updated as `res + 'C'`, and `count['C']` is decremented by 1 if `count['C']` is greater than 0. If `count['C']` is not greater than 0, the state remains unchanged.***
