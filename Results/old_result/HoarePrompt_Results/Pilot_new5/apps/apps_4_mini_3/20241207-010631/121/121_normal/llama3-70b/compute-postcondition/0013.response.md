Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', `count` is updated such that it contains the counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' in the string `s`, with `count['A']`, `count['C']`, `count['G']`, and `count['T']` representing the total occurrences of each respective character, while `count['?']` remains 0 as '?' characters do not affect the counts.**
