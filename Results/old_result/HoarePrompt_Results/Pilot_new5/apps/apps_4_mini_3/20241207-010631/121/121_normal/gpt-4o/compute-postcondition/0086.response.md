Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `i + 2`, `i` is at `i + 2`, `counts` is a non-empty iterable, and `char` is the next character in `counts`. If `counts[char]` is less than `target_count`, then `result[i]` is equal to `char`, `counts[char]` has been incremented by 1, and execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
