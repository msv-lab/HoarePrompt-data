The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than `i + 2`, `i` is at `i + 2`, `counts` is a non-empty iterable, `char` is the next character in `counts`, `result[i]` is now equal to `char`, and `counts[char]` has been incremented by 1.
