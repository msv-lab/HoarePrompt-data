Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is at `i + 1`, `counts` is a non-empty iterable, and `char` is the first character in `counts`. If the current value of `counts[char]` is less than `target_count`, then `counts[char]` is incremented by 1, `result[i]` is assigned the value of `char`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
