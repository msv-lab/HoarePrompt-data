Postcondition: ***`n` is equal to the integer value of `data[0]`, `s` is a non-empty string of length greater than 1, `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`, `counts` is {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}. If `char`, which is the character at index 1 of `s`, is found in `counts`, then `counts[char]` is incremented by 1.***
