The code `break` does not change any variable values but interrupts the execution flow by breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. The other variables retain their values as described in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255, `s` is a string of length `n`, `avg` is `n // 4`, `count[nc]` is greater than 0 (now `count[nc]` is decreased by 1), `c` is '?', and `res` is increased by `nc`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
