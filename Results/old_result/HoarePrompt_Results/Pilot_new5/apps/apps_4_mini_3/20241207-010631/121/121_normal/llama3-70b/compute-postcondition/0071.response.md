The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255, `s` is a string of length `n`, `c` is the last character of the string `s`, `count` is updated at index `nc` by decrementing its value by 1, `nc` iterates over 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', `res` remains unchanged and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
