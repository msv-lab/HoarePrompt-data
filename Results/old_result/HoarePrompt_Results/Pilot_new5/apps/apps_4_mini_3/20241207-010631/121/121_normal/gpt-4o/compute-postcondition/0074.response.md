Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `result` contains characters from `counts`. If `result[i]` is '?', then `result` is updated with characters from `counts` that are less than `target_count`, and `i` reflects the number of characters successfully added. If no characters are added, `result` remains unchanged and `counts` retains its original state.***
