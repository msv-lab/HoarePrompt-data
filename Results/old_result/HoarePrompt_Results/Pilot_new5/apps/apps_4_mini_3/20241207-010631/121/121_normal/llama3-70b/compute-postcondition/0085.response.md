The variable `res` is incremented by the value of `c`, which is the last character of the string `s`. The previous state indicates that `c` is not equal to '?', so we can confidently update `res`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255; `s` is a string of length `n`; `c` is the last character of the string `s`; `count` remains unchanged; `res` is updated to include the last character `c`.**
