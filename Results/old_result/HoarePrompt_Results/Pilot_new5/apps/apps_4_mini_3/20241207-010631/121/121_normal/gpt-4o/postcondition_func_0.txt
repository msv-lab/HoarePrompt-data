The function accepts an integer `n` (between 4 and 255) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'. It verifies if `n` is divisible by 4; if not, it prints '===' and returns None. If `n` is divisible by 4, it counts the occurrences of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' in `s` and ensures that none of these characters exceed `n // 4` in count. It then replaces any '?' in `s` with the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T' as needed to meet the count requirement, and finally prints the modified string. The function does not return any value but will print '===' if any character exceeds the allowed count or if `n` is not divisible by 4.
