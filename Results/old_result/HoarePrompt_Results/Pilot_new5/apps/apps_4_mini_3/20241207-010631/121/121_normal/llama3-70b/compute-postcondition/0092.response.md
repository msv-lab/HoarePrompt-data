Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255; `s` is a string of length `n`; if any characters from 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T' are needed to balance the '?' characters, then those characters remain unassigned in `res`. Otherwise, if all character counts are zero, indicating all '?' characters have been appropriately replaced, `res` is printed with no remaining unassigned characters.***
