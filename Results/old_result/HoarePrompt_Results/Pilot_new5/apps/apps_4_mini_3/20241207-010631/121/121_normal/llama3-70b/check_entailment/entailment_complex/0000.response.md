Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description.

### Explanation:

1. **Input Handling**: The program begins by reading the integer `n`, which represents the length of the genome string `s`. It correctly restricts `n` to the range [4, 255] as specified.

2. **Counting Nucleotides**: The program initializes a dictionary `count` to track the occurrences of the nucleotides 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'. It iterates through the string `s`, updating the counts for these nucleotides accordingly while ignoring the '?' characters.

3. **Calculating Required Counts**: The variable `avg` is calculated as `n // 4`, representing the target number of each nucleotide we need to achieve in the final string. The program then adjusts the `count` dictionary to reflect how many more of each nucleotide are needed by subtracting the currently counted nucleotides from `avg`.

4. **Replacing Question Marks**: The program constructs the result string `res` by iterating through the original string `s`. Whenever it encounters a '?', it replaces it with a nucleotide from 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T' as long as there are still counts remaining for that nucleotide. This ensures that the characters are used appropriately to achieve balance among the four nucleotides.

5. **Final Check**: After constructing `res`, the program checks if there are any counts remaining in the `count` dictionary. If any of the counts are greater than zero, it prints '===' indicating that it's not possible to balance the nucleotides according to the problem statement. If all counts are zero, it prints the constructed string `res`.

### Edge Cases:
- The program handles cases where there are more '?' than needed or not enough '?'. It ensures that if the total number of nucleotides can't be evenly distributed (i.e., if `n` is not divisible by 4 or if the existing counts exceed `avg` in any nucleotide type), it returns '==='.
- It also successfully maintains the integrity of the string by preserving the order of non-'?' characters.

Overall, every step of the program aligns with the conditions outlined in the problem description, ensuring that the genome can be correctly decoded or signaling impossibility when needed. Thus, the program is correct.
