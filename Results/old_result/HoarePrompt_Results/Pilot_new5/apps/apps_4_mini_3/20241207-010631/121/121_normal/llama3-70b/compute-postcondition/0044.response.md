Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255, `s` is a string of length `n`. If `c` is '?', then `count[c]` is set to 0 for each character 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', and `res` contains the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' added according to their counts, indicating that the loop has completed. Otherwise, `count[c]` for each character 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' is updated to `n // 4 - count[c]`, `c` is the first character of the string `s`, and `res` is updated to `res + c`.***
