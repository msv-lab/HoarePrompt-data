Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and reads an integer `n` (4 ≤ n ≤ 255) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'. It counts the occurrences of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' in the string and calculates the average number of each character needed (n // 4). The function then attempts to replace all '?' characters in `s` with 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T' to achieve a balanced count of each character. If there are any characters ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') that are still needed after replacement, it prints '==='; otherwise, it prints the modified string `res`. If the string has more '?' than can be replaced while maintaining the balance, the output will not be valid. **
