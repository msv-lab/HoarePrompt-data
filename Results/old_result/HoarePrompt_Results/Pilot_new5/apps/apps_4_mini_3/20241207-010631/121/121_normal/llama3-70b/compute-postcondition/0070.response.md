The operation `count[nc] -= 1` decrements the value at the index `nc` of the `count` array by 1. The variable `count` is affected, and since `nc` will iterate over 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', the specific value of `nc` will determine which index in `count` is decreased. The initial state of `n`, `s`, `c`, and `res` remains unchanged as they are not directly affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State will reflect the unchanged variables and specify the decrement of the count corresponding to the nucleotide represented by `nc`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255, `s` is a string of length `n`, `c` is the last character of the string `s`, `count` is updated at index `nc` by decrementing its value by 1, `nc` iterates over 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', `res` remains unchanged.**
