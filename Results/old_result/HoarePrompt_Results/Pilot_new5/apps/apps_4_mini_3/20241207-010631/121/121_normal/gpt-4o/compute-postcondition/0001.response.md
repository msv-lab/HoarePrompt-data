The `data` variable is assigned the value of `input().split()`, where `input` reads all the data from standard input and splits it into a list based on whitespace. This means that `data` will contain a list of strings that were inputted. The value of `n` (an integer between 4 and 255) and `s` (a string consisting of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?') remain unchanged in this operation. The actual contents of `data` will depend on the input provided, but it will be a list of strings.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 255, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'; `data` is a list of strings obtained from input split by whitespace.**
