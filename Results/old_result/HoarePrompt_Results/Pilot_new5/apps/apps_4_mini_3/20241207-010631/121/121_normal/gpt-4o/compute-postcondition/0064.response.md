In this case, `result[i]` is being assigned the value of `char`. Since the initial state specifies that `result` must have at least `i + 2` characters, it ensures that the index `i` is valid for the assignment. Additionally, `n` must be greater than `i + 2`, which guarantees that `n` is sufficiently large relative to `i`. The value of `result` at index `i` is updated to `char`, but the preconditions on `n`, `i`, and `counts` remain valid.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 2`, `i` is `i + 2`, `result` is updated at index `i` to `char`, and `counts` must not be empty**.
