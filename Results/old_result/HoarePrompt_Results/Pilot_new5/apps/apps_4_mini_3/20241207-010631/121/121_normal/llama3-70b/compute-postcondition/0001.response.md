The variable `s` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts a string input of length `n`. The value of `n` remains the same as it was assigned from an input integer, which is still within the range of 4 to 255. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `s` without changing `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'**
