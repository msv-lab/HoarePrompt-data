The function accepts a positive integer `n` and two lists `p` and `b`, where `p` is a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`, and `b` consists of zeros and ones. It counts the number of indices `i` where `p[i]` does not equal `i + 1` and adds to this count the number of indices where `b[i]` is 0, returning their sum as the output.
