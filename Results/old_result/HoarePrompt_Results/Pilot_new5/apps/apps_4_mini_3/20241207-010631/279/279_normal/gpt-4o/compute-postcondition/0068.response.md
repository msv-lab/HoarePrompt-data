Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer; `p` is a list of integers; `b` is a list of integers; `visited` is a list of length `n` with all values set to `True`; `cycles` contains cycles found in `p`; `no_reverse_components` is the count of cycles in `cycles` where all corresponding values in `b` are 0. If there is exactly one cycle in `cycles`, 0 has been printed. Otherwise, if the length of `cycles` is not equal to 1, the output is `no_reverse_components` if it is greater than 0; otherwise, the output is 1.***
