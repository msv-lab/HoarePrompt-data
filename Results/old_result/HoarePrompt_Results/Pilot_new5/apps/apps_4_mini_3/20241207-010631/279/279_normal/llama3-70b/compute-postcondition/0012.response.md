The variable `ans` is incremented by 1. The values of `n`, `p`, and `b` remain unchanged. The state of `ans` will depend on its previous value, which is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, `ans` is now either its previous value plus 1, or if it was previously 1, it updates to 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `p` is a list of integers with length `n`; `b` is a list of integers (0s and 1s) with length `n`; `ans` is either its previous value plus 1 or updated to 2 (if it was previously 1)**.
