The variable `ans` is initialized to `0`. The values of `n`, `p`, and `b` are unchanged, as the code does not affect them. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is the input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `p` is a list of integers obtained from input; `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones with the same length as `p`, and `ans` is `0`.

Output State: **`n` is the input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `p` is a list of integers obtained from input; `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones with the same length as `p`; `ans` is 0.**
