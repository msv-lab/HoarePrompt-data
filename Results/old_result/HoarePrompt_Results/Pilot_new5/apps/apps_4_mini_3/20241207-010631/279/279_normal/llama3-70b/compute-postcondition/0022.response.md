The code prints the value of `ans`, which is the count of indices `i` where `p[i]` is not equal to `i + 1` plus the count of indices `i` where `b[i]` is 0. The values of `n`, `p`, and `b` remain unchanged, but the output of `ans` is produced. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `p` is a list of integers with length `n`; `b` is a list of integers (0s and 1s) with length `n`; `ans` is equal to the count of indices `i` where `p[i]` is not equal to `i + 1` plus the count of indices `i` where `b[i]` is 0, and the value of `ans` is printed.**
