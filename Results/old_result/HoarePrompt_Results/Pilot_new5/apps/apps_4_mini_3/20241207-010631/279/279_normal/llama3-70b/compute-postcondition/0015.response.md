Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `p` is a list of integers with length `n`; `b` is a list of integers (0s and 1s) with length `n`; if `b[i]` is 0, then `ans` is either updated to be its previous value plus 1 or set to 2 (if it was previously 1), and `ans` is increased by 1.***
