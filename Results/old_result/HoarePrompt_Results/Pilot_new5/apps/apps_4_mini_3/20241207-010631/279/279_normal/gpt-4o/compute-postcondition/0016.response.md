The variable `x` is defined as `p[0] - 1`, and since `p[0]` must be greater than 1, we know that `x` is a non-negative integer. The statement `visited[x] = True` sets the value at index `x` of the `visited` list to `True`. Given that `visited` initially has its first value set to `True` and the rest set to `False`, after this operation, the index `x` will also be set to `True`.

Thus, the updated state of `visited` will reflect that the index corresponding to `x` is now `True`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `p` is a list of integers created from `data[1]` to `data[n]`, `b` is a list of integers created from `data[n + 1:2 * n + 1]`, `visited` has value `True` at index `x`, `visited[0]` is `True`, `cycles` is an empty list, `cycle` is a list containing the value `0`, `x` is equal to `p[0] - 1`**.
