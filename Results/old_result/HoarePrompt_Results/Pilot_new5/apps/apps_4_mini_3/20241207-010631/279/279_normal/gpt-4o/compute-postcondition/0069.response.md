The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `p`, and `b`. 

- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200000\). 
- `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`. 
- `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones with length `n`.

The function does not have any explicit return details provided. Therefore, based on the information given, we cannot specify what the function returns. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a permutation list `p` of integers from 1 to `n`, and a list `b` of zeros and ones with length `n`.**
