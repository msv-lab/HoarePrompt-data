The variable `visited[x]` is assigned the value `True`, changing its previous state from `False`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `visited[x]` is `True`, and `visited[x]` must have been `False` before the assignment.

Output State: **`visited[x]` is True, `visited[x]` must have been False**
