`p` is assigned the value of a list created from the input, which is split and converted to integers. The variable `n` remains unchanged, and the list `b` is not affected by this operation. The output state reflects that `p` is now a list of integers based on the input provided.

Output State: **`n` is the input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `p` is a list of integers obtained from input; `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones, with the same length as `p`.**
