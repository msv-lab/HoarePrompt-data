Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `p` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `visited` has all indices of the values in `cycle` set to `True`, and `cycles` contains `cycle`. If `visited[i]` is `False`, then `x` is equal to the last accessed index in `p` minus 1, and `x` is no longer less than the length of `p` or has been visited.***
