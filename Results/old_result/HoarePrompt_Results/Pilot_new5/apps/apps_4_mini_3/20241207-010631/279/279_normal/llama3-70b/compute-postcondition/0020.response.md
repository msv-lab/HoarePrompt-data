Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `p` is a list of integers with length `n`; `b` is a list of integers (0s and 1s) with length `n`; `i` is the incremented value (i + 1) such that `i + 1` is less than `n`. If `b[i]` is equal to 0, then `ans` is increased by 1. If `b[i]` is not equal to 0, then `ans` remains unchanged.***
