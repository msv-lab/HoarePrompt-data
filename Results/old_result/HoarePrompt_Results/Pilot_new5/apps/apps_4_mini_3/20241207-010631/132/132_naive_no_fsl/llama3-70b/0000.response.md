Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. The criteria for determining if the notes can be consistent involve the possibility of stones being taken away or moved between piles, rather than simply checking if the total number of stones is the same or if the sorted lists are equal.

For example, consider the following input:

```
5
3 3 3 3 3
2 2 2 2 2
```

In this case, the total number of stones in the first visit is 15, and in the second visit, it is 10. The sum condition is not satisfied, and the program would incorrectly return "No". However, it could have been possible that 5 stones were taken away by the jury members, making the records consistent with the problem description.

Thus, the program fails to account for scenarios where stones can be taken away, leading to the conclusion that it does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description.
