The initial state indicates that `y` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50, and `x` is a list of integers derived from the input. The code provided assigns a new list of integers to `y` based on an input provided by the user.

When executing the line:
```python
y = list(map(int, input().split()))
```
This line takes an input string, splits it into substrings, converts each substring to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to `y`. The values in `y` can vary based on user input, but they remain non-negative integers, as specified in the initial state.

After this line is executed, `n` would equal the length of the new list `y`, which is determined by the number of integers the user inputs. Therefore, `n` would now also need to be updated to reflect the new length of `y`.

Output State: **`y` is a list of n non-negative integers where each integer is between 0 and 1000, `n` is the length of `y` after the input, `x` is a list of integers derived from the input.**
