Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer; `x` is a list of integers from input; `y` is a sorted list of non-negative integers derived from input (where each y[i] satisfies 0 <= y[i] <= 1000). If the sum of the elements in `x` is not equal to the sum of the elements in `y`, the program prints 'No'. Otherwise, if the sums are equal, the program checks if `x` is equal to `y`: if they are equal, it prints 'Yes'; if they are not equal, it prints 'No'.***
