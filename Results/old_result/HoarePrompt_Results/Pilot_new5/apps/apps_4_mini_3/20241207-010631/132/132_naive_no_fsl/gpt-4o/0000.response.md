Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical error. The program only checks whether the total number of stones in the second visit (`total_y`) is greater than the total number of stones in the first visit (`total_x`). If `total_y` is greater, it outputs "No", which is correct. However, if it is less than or equal, it outputs "Yes" without considering the distribution of the stones between the piles.

An example where the program fails is:
- Input:
```
5
5 5 5 5 5
3 3 3 3 15
```
In this case:
- The total stones in the first visit is 25.
- The total stones in the second visit is also 25, so `total_y <= total_x`, and the program would output "Yes".
However, it's impossible to reach the second configuration (3, 3, 3, 3, 15) from the first (5, 5, 5, 5, 5) using only the allowed operations since the last pile has more stones than were available. Thus, this output is incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description in all cases.
