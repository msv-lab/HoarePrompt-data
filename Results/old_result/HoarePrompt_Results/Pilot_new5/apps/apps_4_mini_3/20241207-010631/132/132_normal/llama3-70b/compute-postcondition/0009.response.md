The code executes a print statement, which outputs the string 'Yes' to the console. There are no variable assignments or changes in the values of the variables `n`, `x`, or `y`. The current state of `x` and `y` remains unchanged as they are equal.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer; `x` is a sorted list of integers from input; `y` is a sorted list of integers derived from input with each integer being a non-negative integer where each y[i] (0 <= y[i] <= 1000). The sum of the elements in `x` is equal to the sum of the elements in `y`. The current values of `x` and `y` are equal and 'Yes' has been printed.**
