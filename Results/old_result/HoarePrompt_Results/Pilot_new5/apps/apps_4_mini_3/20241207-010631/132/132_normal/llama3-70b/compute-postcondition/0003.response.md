Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer; `x` is a list of integers taken from input; `y` is a list of integers derived from input with each integer being a non-negative integer where each y[i] (0 <= y[i] <= 1000). The current sum of the elements in `x` is not equal to the current sum of the elements in `y`.***
