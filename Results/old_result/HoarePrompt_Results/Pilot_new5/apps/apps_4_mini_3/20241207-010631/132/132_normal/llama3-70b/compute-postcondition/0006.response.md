`x.sort()` will sort the list of integers `x` in ascending order. The values of `n`, `y`, and the relationship between the sums of `x` and `y` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `x` is now sorted.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer; `x` is a sorted list of integers from input; `y` is a list of integers derived from input with each integer being a non-negative integer where each y[i] (0 <= y[i] <= 1000). The sum of the elements in `x` is equal to the sum of the elements in `y`.**
