Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer; `x` is a sorted list of integers from input; `y` is a sorted list of integers derived from input with each integer being a non-negative integer where each y[i] (0 <= y[i] <= 1000). The sum of the elements in `x` is equal to the sum of the elements in `y`, and `x` is not equal to `y`.***
