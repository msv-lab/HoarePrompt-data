The variable `y` is assigned the result of `list(map(int, input().split()))`, which takes input from the user, splits it into separate values, converts each value to an integer, and creates a list from those integers. The value of `n` determines how many integers can be input into `y`. The initial state indicates that each integer in `y` is a non-negative integer in the range from 0 to 1000.

Since `y` is being replaced by a new list, the previous contents of `y` are lost and will be replaced by the input values.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer; `x` is a list of integers taken from input; `y` is a list of integers derived from input with each integer being a non-negative integer where each y[i] (0 <= y[i] <= 1000)**.
