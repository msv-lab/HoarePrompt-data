Postcondition: ***`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `directions` must have at least 2 elements; the current index in `directions` is 1; if `new_row` is between 0 and 1 (inclusive) and `new_col` is between 0 and 1 (inclusive), then `new_pos` is equal to `new_row * 2 + new_col`; `new_state` has had the values at indices `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped; `new_state_str` is the concatenation of the elements in `new_state`; if `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, then `visited` now includes `new_state_str` and `queue` includes `new_state_str`. If the condition is not satisfied, no changes are made.***
