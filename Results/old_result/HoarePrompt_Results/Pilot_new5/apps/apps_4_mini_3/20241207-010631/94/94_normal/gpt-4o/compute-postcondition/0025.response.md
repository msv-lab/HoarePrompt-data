The code snippet `visited.add(new_state_str)` adds the value of `new_state_str` to the set `visited`. `new_state_str` is a string formed by joining the characters in `new_state`, which consists of four characters ('A', 'B', 'C', 'X') in some order.

Since `visited` is a set, the addition operation will include `new_state_str` into the set if it is not already present. The other variables remain unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three characters ('A', 'B', 'C') and one character ('X'); `new_state` is a list of four characters ('A', 'B', 'C', 'X') in some order; `new_state_str` is a string formed by joining those characters; `visited` now includes `new_state_str`.**
