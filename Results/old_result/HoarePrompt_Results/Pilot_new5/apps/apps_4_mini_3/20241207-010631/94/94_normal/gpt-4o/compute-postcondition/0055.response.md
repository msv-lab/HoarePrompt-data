Postcondition: ***`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `visited` includes all unique permutations of `start` and contains `new_state_str`; `queue` is not empty and contains `new_state_str`; `current` is assigned to the first element from `queue`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`; `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`; `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`; `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is equal to `new_row * 2 + new_col`; `directions` is not empty; `new_state` is the list resulting from swapping its elements at indices `empty_pos` and `new_pos`; `new_state_str` is the string resulting from the joining of the elements of `new_state` if the indices for the new position are valid (0 <= new_row < 2 and 0 <= new_col < 2).***
