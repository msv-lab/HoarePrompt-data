The code `new_row, new_col = empty_row + dr, empty_col + dc` assigns new values to `new_row` and `new_col` based on the current values of `empty_row`, `empty_col`, and the values `dr` and `dc` which represent direction changes in the row and column respectively. The values of `empty_row` and `empty_col` were calculated based on the index of 'X' in `current`. The other variables are unaffected.

Given that `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2` and `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, we can express `new_row` and `new_col` in terms of `empty_pos`, `dr`, and `dc`.

Therefore, the output state will reflect these new assignments while keeping track of all other unchanged variables.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `visited` includes all unique permutations of `start`; `queue` is not empty; `current` is assigned the first element from `queue`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current'; `empty_row` is empty_pos // 2; `empty_col` is empty_pos % 2; `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`; `directions` is not empty.**
