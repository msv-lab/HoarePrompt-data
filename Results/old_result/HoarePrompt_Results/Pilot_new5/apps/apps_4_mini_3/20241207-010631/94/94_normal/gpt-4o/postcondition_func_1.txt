The function accepts a string `start` representing a 2 Ã— 2 sliding puzzle configuration, where 'X' denotes the empty space. It returns a set of all unique configurations (permutations) of the puzzle that can be reached from the initial configuration by making valid moves of the empty space. The function explores all reachable states and may include configurations that do not utilize the empty space effectively, as it exhaustively searches all possible valid moves.
