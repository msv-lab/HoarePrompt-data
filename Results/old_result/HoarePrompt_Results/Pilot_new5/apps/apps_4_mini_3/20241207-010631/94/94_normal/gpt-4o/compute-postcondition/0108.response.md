The variable `new_state_str` is assigned the value of `''.join(new_state)`, which concatenates the elements of the `new_state` list into a single string. The initial conditions regarding `start`, `directions`, `current index`, `new_row`, `new_col`, `new_pos`, and the state of `new_state` remain valid. However, the value of `new_state_str` is now defined.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `directions` must have at least 2 elements; the current index in directions is 1; `new_row`, `new_col`, are assigned based on `empty_row`, `dr`, `empty_col`, and `dc`; `new_pos` is equal to `new_row * 2 + new_col`; `new_state` has had the values at indices `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped; `new_state_str` is the concatenation of the elements in `new_state`.**
