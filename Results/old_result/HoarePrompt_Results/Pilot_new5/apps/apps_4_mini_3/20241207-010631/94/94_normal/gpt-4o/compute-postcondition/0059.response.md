The variable `new_state` is assigned the value of `list(current)`, which creates a new list containing the characters of the string `current`. The states of all other variables remain the same. The specific value of `current` is not provided, but `new_state` will be a list representation of it. Therefore, the Output State is: `start` is a string of length 4 consisting of characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `visited` includes all unique permutations of `start`; `queue` is not empty and contains `new_state_str`; `current` is the first element from `queue`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`; `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`; `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`; `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is equal to `new_row * 2 + new_col`; `new_state` is a list representation of `current`.
