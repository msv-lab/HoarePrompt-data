Output State: **`puzzle1` and `puzzle2` are 2D lists (or tuples) containing one 'A', one 'B', one 'C', and one 'X'. `x1` is the index of 'X' in `puzzle1`, and `x2` is the index of 'X' in `puzzle2` after all iterations of the loop have completed. If either 'X' is not present in the respective lists, the corresponding index will remain undefined.**
