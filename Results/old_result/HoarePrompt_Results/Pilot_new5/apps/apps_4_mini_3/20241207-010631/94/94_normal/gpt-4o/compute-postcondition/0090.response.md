The `queue` has a state that contains at least one state before the execution of the code. The code appends `new_state_str` to the existing `queue`. The other variables are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state should reflect the updated `queue` with the new string added, while keeping all other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `visited` includes all unique permutations of `start` plus `new_state_str`; `queue` now includes the previous states plus `new_state_str`; `current` is a state from `queue`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`; `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`; `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`; `directions` must not be empty; `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is equal to `new_row * 2 + new_col`; `new_state` is a list containing the characters of `current` with the characters at indices `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped; `new_state_str` is added to `visited`.**
