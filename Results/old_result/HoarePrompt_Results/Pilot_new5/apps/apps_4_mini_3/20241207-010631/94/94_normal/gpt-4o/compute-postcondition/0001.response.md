The variable `visited` is assigned a new set containing `start`. The value of `start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three characters ('A', 'B', 'C') and one character ('X'). Therefore, `visited` will now contain that specific string as its only element. The state of the other variables is not affected.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three characters ('A', 'B', 'C') and one character ('X'); `queue` is a deque containing `start`; `visited` is a set containing `start`.**
