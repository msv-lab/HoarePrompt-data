The code `visited.add(new_state_str)` adds the string `new_state_str` to the set `visited`. The variable `new_state_str` is formed by joining `new_state`, which consists of elements at positions `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped. The initial values of `start`, `current`, and `new_state_str` remain unchanged, but the `visited` set is updated to include `new_state_str`. 

Since `new_state_str` is derived from a combination of other variables, we do not have a specific value for it without knowing the values of `new_state`, `empty_pos`, and `new_pos`. However, we know that `visited` will now include the new entry.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `current` is unchanged; `new_state_str` is the string formed by joining `new_state` with elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped; `visited` now includes `new_state_str`.**
