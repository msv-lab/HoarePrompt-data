The code assigns new values to `new_row` and `new_col` based on the current values of `empty_row`, `empty_col`, and the direction pairs `dr` and `dc`. The values of `empty_row` and `empty_col` are not provided, but they are used in the calculation along with `dr` and `dc`. Therefore, the resulting values of `new_row` and `new_col` will be dependent on the specific values of `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `dr`, and `dc`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `visited` includes all unique permutations of `start` plus `new_state_str`; `queue` includes the previous states plus `new_state_str`; `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`.**
