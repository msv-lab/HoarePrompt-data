The line of code swaps the elements in `new_state` at the positions `empty_pos` and `new_pos`. The initial state indicates that `new_state` is a list representation of `current`, which remains unchanged. The other variables, `start` and `current`, are not affected by this operation.

Since `new_state` is directly modified by this operation but we do not know the specific values of `empty_pos` and `new_pos`, we cannot determine the exact content of `new_state` after the swap. However, we can state that the elements at those two positions have been exchanged.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `current` is unchanged; `new_state` has the elements at positions `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped.**
