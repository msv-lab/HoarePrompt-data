The code appends `new_state_str` to the `queue`. The current values of `start`, `current`, and `visited` remain unchanged, but `visited` will now include `new_state_str`.

The output state will be updated to reflect the new value of `visited`. Since `new_state_str` is formed by joining `new_state` with elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped, the specific value of `new_state_str` is not provided, but it will be included in the updated `visited`.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `current` is unchanged; `new_state_str` is the string formed by joining `new_state` with elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped; `visited` now includes `new_state_str` and `queue` has `new_state_str` appended.**
