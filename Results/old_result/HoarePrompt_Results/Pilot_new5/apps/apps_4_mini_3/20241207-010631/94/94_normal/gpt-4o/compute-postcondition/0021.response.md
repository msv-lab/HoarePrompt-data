The variable `new_pos` is assigned the value of `new_row * 2 + new_col`. The values of `new_row` and `new_col` are derived from `empty_row` and `empty_col` respectively, but their specific values are not given in the initial state. Therefore, `new_pos` will be determined by those assignments but cannot be explicitly stated as a specific number. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three characters ('A', 'B', 'C') and one character ('X'), `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`, `queue` contains 'ABCX', `visited` includes both `start` and 'ABCX', `directions` must have more pairs of values to continue iteration, `new_pos` is equal to `new_row * 2 + new_col`.**
