Postcondition: ***`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; if `new_row` is between 0 and 1 inclusive and `new_col` is between 0 and 1 inclusive, then `visited` is updated to include `new_state_str` if it was not already visited, and `queue` includes the previous states plus `new_state_str`.***
