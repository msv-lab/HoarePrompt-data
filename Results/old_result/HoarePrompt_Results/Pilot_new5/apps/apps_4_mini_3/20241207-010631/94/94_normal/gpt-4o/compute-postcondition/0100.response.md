The `queue` is updated to include `new_state_str` by appending it to the existing `queue`. The other variables remain unchanged. Thus, `visited` still includes all unique permutations of `start` plus `new_state_str`, and `queue` now includes the previous states plus the newly appended `new_state_str`.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `visited` includes all unique permutations of `start` plus `new_state_str`; `queue` includes the previous states plus `new_state_str`, and `visited` is updated to include `new_state_str`.**
