To determine the necessary state adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the components involved in the `for` loop.

1. The loop iterates over `directions`, which means `directions` must be a defined iterable. It cannot be empty for the loop to execute at least once.

2. The variable `current` is the first element removed from `queue`. For the loop to execute, `queue` must contain at least one state (i.e., it should not be empty).

3. The variable `empty_pos` is derived from the `current` state, which indicates the position of 'X'. As `current` is derived from `queue`, it must also be ensured that `current` is valid and correctly reflects the state before the loop begins.

4. The states related to the positions of 'X' (`empty_row` and `empty_col`) depend on `empty_pos`. If `current` is correctly set, both `empty_row` and `empty_col` will be calculated correctly.

Thus, the necessary conditions for the loop to execute are:

- `directions` must not be empty.
- `queue` must contain at least one state so that `current` can be derived from it.

Given these considerations, we can summarize the adjusted states as follows:

State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `visited` includes all unique permutations of `start` that can be formed by valid moves of the empty space; `queue` must contain at least 1 state; `current` is the first element removed from `queue`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current'; `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2; `directions` must not be empty**
