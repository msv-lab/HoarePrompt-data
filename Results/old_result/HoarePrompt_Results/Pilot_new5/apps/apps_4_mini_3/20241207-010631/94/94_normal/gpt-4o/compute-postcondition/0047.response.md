The variable `new_pos` is assigned the value calculated from `new_row` and `new_col`, specifically using the formula `new_row * 2 + new_col`. Since `new_row` and `new_col` have been defined as being within the bounds of the grid, their values will determine the value of `new_pos`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `visited` includes all unique permutations of `start`; `queue` is not empty; `current` is assigned the first element from `queue`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current'; `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`; `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`; `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is equal to `new_row * 2 + new_col`; `directions` is not empty.**
