The variable `new_state_str` is assigned the value of `new_state` joined into a string. The variable `new_state` is a list created by swapping the elements at positions `empty_pos` and `new_pos`. The value of `start` remains unchanged as it is a string of length 4 consisting of characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'. The variable `current` is also unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `current` is unchanged; `new_state_str` is the string formed by joining `new_state`, which contains the elements at positions `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped.**
