Postcondition: ***`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three characters ('A', 'B', 'C') and one character ('X'); if `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, `queue` now contains 'ABCX', `visited` is a set containing `start` and 'ABCX', `current` remains equal to `start`, and `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `new_row`, `new_col`, `directions`, and `new_pos` retain their respective values. Otherwise, there is no change to the state of `queue`, `visited`, `current`, or the other variables.***
