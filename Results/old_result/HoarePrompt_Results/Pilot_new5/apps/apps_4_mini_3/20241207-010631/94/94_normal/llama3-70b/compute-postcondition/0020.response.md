The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `puzzle1` and `puzzle2`. Both `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` are 2D lists (or tuples) representing 2 Ã— 2 grids, where each grid contains exactly one 'A', one 'B', one 'C', and one 'X' (the empty cell). After executing the function body, it returns `True` if both `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` contain the same characters when sorted. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two 2D grids (`puzzle1` and `puzzle2`) and return `True` if they contain the same characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `puzzle1` and `puzzle2`, and returns `True` if both grids contain the same characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'.**
