The variable `new_state` is assigned the value of `list(current)`, which creates a new list from the `current` string. The `current` variable itself is unchanged, but `new_state` will now be a list representation of that string. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `current` is unchanged; `new_state` is a list representation of `current`.**
