Postcondition: ***`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `visited` includes all unique permutations of `start`; `queue` is not empty; `current` is assigned the first element from `queue`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current'; `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`; `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`; `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`. The values of `new_row` and `new_col` are within the bounds of the grid: 0 <= `new_row` < 2 and 0 <= `new_col` < 2. `directions` is not empty.***
