#State of the program right berfore the function call: puzzle is a list of two strings, each containing exactly 2 characters representing the tiles ('A', 'B', 'C', 'X') in a 2x2 grid configuration.
def func_1(puzzle):
    return puzzle[0] + puzzle[1]
    #The program returns the concatenation of the two strings in the list 'puzzle', which contains exactly 2 characters each representing the tiles in a 2x2 grid configuration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `puzzle` containing exactly two strings, each consisting of exactly two characters. It returns the concatenation of these two strings. The function assumes that the input is valid and does not handle any potential edge cases such as ensuring that the input list contains exactly two strings or that each string has exactly two characters.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: start is a string of length 4 consisting of three characters ('A', 'B', 'C') and one character ('X'), representing the tiles and the empty position in a 2 × 2 sliding puzzle grid.

    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `queue` is empty, `visited` includes all unique permutations of `start` that can be formed by valid moves of the empty space, `current` is the last state processed before the queue became empty, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, and `directions` has been fully explored with all possible moves from `start` evaluated.
    return visited
    #The program returns all unique permutations of 'start' that can be formed by valid moves of the empty space, as included in the 'visited' variable.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `start` representing a 2 × 2 sliding puzzle configuration, where 'X' denotes the empty space. It returns a set of all unique configurations (permutations) of the puzzle that can be reached from the initial configuration by making valid moves of the empty space. The function explores all reachable states and may include configurations that do not utilize the empty space effectively, as it exhaustively searches all possible valid moves.
