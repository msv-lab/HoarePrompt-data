The variable `new_state_str` is assigned the value of the string formed by joining the elements of the list `new_state`. The previous state of `new_state` is `['A', 'B', 'C', 'X']`, but since `empty_pos` and `new_pos` have been swapped, the specific arrangement of characters will depend on which positions were swapped. However, the statement doesn't provide the specific values of `empty_pos` and `new_pos`, so we can only say that `new_state` will remain a list of characters ('A', 'B', 'C', 'X') in some order. As a result, `new_state_str` will be a string of length 4 consisting of those characters in their new order. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three characters ('A', 'B', 'C') and one character ('X'); `new_state` is a list of four characters ('A', 'B', 'C', 'X') in some order; `new_state_str` is a string formed by joining those characters.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three characters ('A', 'B', 'C') and one character ('X'); `new_state` is a list of four characters ('A', 'B', 'C', 'X') in some order; `new_state_str` is a string formed by joining those characters.**
