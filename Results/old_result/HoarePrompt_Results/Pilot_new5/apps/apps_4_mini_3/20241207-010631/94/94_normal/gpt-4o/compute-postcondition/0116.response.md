The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `start`. `start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three characters ('A', 'B', 'C') and one character ('X'), representing the tiles and the empty position in a 2 × 2 sliding puzzle grid. The function returns all unique permutations of the string `start` that can be formed by valid moves of the empty space. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_2 is to accept a string `start` representing a sliding puzzle configuration and return all unique arrangements of that configuration reachable through valid sliding moves. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter start, representing a 2 × 2 sliding puzzle configuration, and returns all unique permutations of start that can be formed by valid moves of the empty space.**
