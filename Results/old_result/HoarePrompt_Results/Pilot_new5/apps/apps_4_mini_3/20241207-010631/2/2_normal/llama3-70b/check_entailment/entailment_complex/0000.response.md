Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here are the key points of concern:

1. **Inefficiency**: The program iterates over every integer from 1 to x (inclusive) to calculate the digit sum and determine the maximum sum. For large values of x (up to 10^18), this approach is not feasible because it would require iterating through an enormous number of integers (up to 10^18 iterations), which is computationally impractical.

2. **Incorrect Output in Cases of Tie**: The problem states that if there are several integers with the maximum digit sum, the largest integer should be returned. The program's logic does not handle ties properly. If two numbers have the same digit sum but different values, it will always print the first one it encounters due to the way it updates `max_num`. This means that if `99` and `100` both have the same digit sum (9 in this case), the program would return `100`, even though `99` is the largest positive integer not exceeding `100` with the same digit sum.

3. **Algorithm Logic**: The program does not consider the possibility of forming numbers close to x that may yield higher digit sums. For instance, it could generate a number like `499` from `521`, but the loop will not reach that number unless it checks every number up to `521`. It ignores patterns where reducing a single digit can lead to higher sums in the subsequent digits.

In summary, the approach taken in the program does not efficiently address the problem, and it may yield incorrect results in certain scenarios, particularly in edge cases where the maximum digit sum is tied between two numbers. Therefore, the program fails to satisfy the problem description.
