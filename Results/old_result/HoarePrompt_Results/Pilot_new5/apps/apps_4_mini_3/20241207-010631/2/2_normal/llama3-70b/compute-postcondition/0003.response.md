According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `x`. Since `x` is guaranteed to be an integer in the range of 1 to 10^18 (inclusive), the loop will execute at least once because `range(1, x + 1)` will create a sequence starting from 1 up to `x`. At the start of the loop, `i` will be set to 1 during the first iteration.

Given that `max_sum` and `max_num` are initialized to 0, they do not affect the execution of the loop itself. Therefore, the only states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are the initialization of `i` and ensuring `x` is in the specified range.

State: **`x` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, `max_sum` is 0, `max_num` is 0, `i` is 1**
