The variable `max_num` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 3. This means that `max_num` will now also be 3. The other variables remain unchanged, so the output state will reflect the new value for `max_num`. 

Output State: **`x` is an input integer such that 3 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, `max_sum` is 3, `max_num` is 3, `i` is 3, and `digit_sum` is 3.**
