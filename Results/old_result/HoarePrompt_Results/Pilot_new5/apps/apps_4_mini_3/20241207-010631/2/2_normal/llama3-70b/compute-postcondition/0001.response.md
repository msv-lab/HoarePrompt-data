The variable `max_sum` is initialized to `0`, but the previous value of `x` remains unchanged. The value of `max_sum` does not depend on `x` since it is being set for the first time. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`x` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18; `max_sum` is 0.**
