According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the input integer `x`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `x` can be any integer from 1 to \(10^{18}\). 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 2. Additionally, since `x` is at least 1, it must be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`x` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, `max_sum` is 1, `max_num` is 1, `i` is 2, `digit_sum` is 1**
