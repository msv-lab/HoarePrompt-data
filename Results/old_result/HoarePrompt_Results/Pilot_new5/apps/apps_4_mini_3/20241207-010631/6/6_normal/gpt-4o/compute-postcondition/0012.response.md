To calculate `close_both_sides`, we first evaluate the components involved in the expression. Given the initial state:

- `n` is an integer between 1 and 100.
- `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`.
- `l` is an integer between 1 and `r`.
- `r` is an integer between `l` and `n`.
- `l` is not equal to 1.
- `r` is not equal to `n`.
- `r` is less than `n`.
- `move_to_l` is equal to `abs(pos - l)`.
- `move_to_r` is equal to `abs(pos - r)`.

Now we compute `close_both_sides`:

- `move_to_l + (r - l + 2)` represents the total distance to `l` from `pos` plus the distance between `r` and `l` plus a constant of 2.
- `move_to_r + (r - l + 2)` similarly represents the distance to `r` plus the same distance between `r` and `l` plus 2.

The final value of `close_both_sides` is determined by the minimum of these two calculated values.

Hence, the output state includes:
- `close_both_sides` is equal to `min(move_to_l + (r - l + 2), move_to_r + (r - l + 2))`.

The values of `n`, `pos`, `l`, `r`, `move_to_l`, and `move_to_r` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `l` is an integer between 1 and `r`, `r` is an integer between `l` and `n`, `l` is not equal to 1, `r` is not equal to `n`, `r` is less than `n`, `move_to_l` is equal to `abs(pos - l)`, `move_to_r` is equal to `abs(pos - r)`, `close_both_sides` is equal to `min(move_to_l + (r - l + 2), move_to_r + (r - l + 2))`.**
