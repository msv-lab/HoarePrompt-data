The code snippet prints the value of `close_both_sides`. The values of `n`, `pos`, `l`, `r`, `move_to_l`, `move_to_r`, and `close_both_sides` do not change after executing the print statement, so all the initial conditions remain valid.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `l` is an integer between 1 and `r`, `r` is an integer between `l` and `n`, `l` is not equal to 1, `r` is not equal to `n`, `r` is less than `n`, `move_to_l` is equal to `abs(pos - l)`, `move_to_r` is equal to `abs(pos - r)`, `close_both_sides` is equal to `min(move_to_l + (r - l + 2), move_to_r + (r - l + 2)) and the value of `close_both_sides` has been printed.**
