To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we will analyze the program's logic in relation to the requirements outlined.

### Problem Breakdown
Luba wants to close all tabs outside of a specified range `[l, r]`. The number of seconds it takes to achieve this includes:
- Moving the cursor to the leftmost tab `l` or rightmost tab `r` (if required).
- Closing all tabs to the left of `l` or to the right of `r`.

### Analyzing the Program
1. **Checking If All Tabs Are Opened**:
   - If `l == 1` and `r == n`, then all tabs are already open, and the function correctly outputs `0`.
  
2. **Closing Tabs When l is 1**:
   - If `l == 1`, Luba only needs to close tabs to the right of `r`, thus requiring movement to `r` and one action to close. The output is correctly calculated as `abs(pos - r) + 1`.
  
3. **Closing Tabs When r is n**:
   - If `r == n`, Luba only needs to close tabs to the left of `l`, moving to `l` and taking one action to close. The program outputs `abs(pos - l) + 1`, which is correct.
  
4. **General Case**:
   - If both `l` and `r` are not at the extremes (i.e., `l > 1` and `r < n`), the program calculates:
     - The distance to `l` and the distance to `r`.
     - It evaluates the time needed to close tabs on both sides, considering the additional time to move and close.
     - The formula used, `min(move_to_l + (r - l + 2), move_to_r + (r - l + 2))`, correctly computes the minimum time needed considering the possible movements.

### Edge Cases
- The program correctly handles situations where the cursor starts at various positions and correctly computes the necessary time to close tabs based on the current cursor position and desired range.

### Conclusion
The program logically follows the constraints and requirements set forth in the problem description. It effectively checks for conditions where no action is needed and correctly computes the time required for each necessary movement and action.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is confirmed.

Correctness: **True**
