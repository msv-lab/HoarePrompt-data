The code snippet calculates the absolute difference between `pos` and `r`, then adds 1 to that value. The values of `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged after execution. The value of the expression `abs(pos - r) + 1` is computed, but not assigned to a variable or stored. Therefore, it does not change the state of the program.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `l` is an integer between 1 and `r`, `r` is an integer between `l` and `n`, neither `l` is equal to 1 nor `r` is equal to `n`, and the output is `abs(pos - r) + 1`**.
