In the given code, the values of `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` are updated by taking input as integers split by whitespace. The new values will replace the previous values of these variables.

Since `n` is between 1 and 100, `pos` is between 1 and `n`, `l` is between 1 and `n`, and `r` is between `l` and `n`, the nature of the constraints for each variable remains valid, but their specific values will change based on the input provided.

Therefore, the updated output state summarizes the updated values of `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` after the code execution:

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`; `l` is an integer between 1 and `n`; `r` is an integer between `l` and `n`.**
