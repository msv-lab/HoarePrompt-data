Postcondition: ***`n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` are integers with `n` between 1 and 100, `pos` between 1 and `n`, `l` between 1 and `r`, `r` between `l` and `n`, `l` not equal to 1, and `r` not equal to `n`. If `r` is equal to `n`, the computed value is `abs(pos - l) + 1`. If `r` is less than `n`, `move_to_l` is equal to `abs(pos - l)`, `move_to_r` is equal to `abs(pos - r)`, and `close_both_sides` is equal to `min(move_to_l + (r - l + 2), move_to_r + (r - l + 2))`, which has been printed.***
