The variable `move_to_l` is assigned the value of the absolute difference between `pos` and `l`. Since `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`, and `l` is an integer between 1 and `r`, the result of `abs(pos - l)` will also be a non-negative integer. Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `l` is an integer between 1 and `r`, `r` is an integer between `l` and `n`, `l` is not equal to 1, `r` is not equal to `n`, `r` is less than `n`, and `move_to_l` is equal to `abs(pos - l)`.**
