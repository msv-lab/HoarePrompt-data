The value of `ans` is updated by adding `l - pos` to it. Since it is given that the current value of `pos` is less than `l`, `l - pos` will be a positive integer. The states of the other variables remain unchanged since they are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`; `l` is an integer between 1 and `n`; `r` is an integer between `l` and `n`; `ans` is a positive integer equal to the previous value of `ans` plus `l - pos`.**
