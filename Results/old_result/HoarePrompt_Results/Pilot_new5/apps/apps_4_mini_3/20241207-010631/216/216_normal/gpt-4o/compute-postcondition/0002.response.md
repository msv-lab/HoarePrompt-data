The variable `max_count` is initialized to 0. The previous state of the other variables is unaffected, and since no other operations are performed on `n` or `s`, they retain their initial values. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) representing the length of string `s`; `s` is an input string consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters; `max_count` is 0**
