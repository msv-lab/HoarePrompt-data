`current_count` is incremented by 1. The values of `n`, `s`, `char`, `current_set`, and `max_count` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `s` is a non-empty string of length `n`, `char` is the second character of `s`, `current_set` now includes `char`, `current_count` is increased by 1, `max_count` remains unchanged.
