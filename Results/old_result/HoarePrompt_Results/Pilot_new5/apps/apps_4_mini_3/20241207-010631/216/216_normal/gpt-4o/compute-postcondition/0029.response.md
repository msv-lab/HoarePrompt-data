The command `current_set.clear()` empties the `current_set`, removing all of its elements. Since the command only affects `current_set`, and the other variables remain unchanged, the output state reflects this change.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `s` is a non-empty string of length `n`, `char` is the third character of `s`, `max_count` is the maximum of its previous value and `current_count`, and `current_set` is now empty.**
