Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `s` is a non-empty string of length `n`, and `char` is the second character of `s`. If `char` is a lowercase letter, and if `char` is not in `current_set`, it is added to `current_set`, increasing `current_count` by 1 while `max_count` remains unchanged. If `char` is already in `current_set`, no changes are made to `current_set`, `current_count`, or `max_count`. If `char` is not a lowercase letter, then `current_set` is empty, `current_count` is 0, and `max_count` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `current_count`.***
