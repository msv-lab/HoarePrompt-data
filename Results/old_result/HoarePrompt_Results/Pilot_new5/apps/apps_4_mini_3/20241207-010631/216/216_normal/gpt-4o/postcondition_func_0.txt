The function accepts a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of both lowercase and uppercase Latin letters. It calculates the maximum number of unique lowercase letters found in contiguous segments of the string, resetting the count whenever an uppercase letter is encountered, and prints this maximum count. If the string consists entirely of uppercase letters or contains no lowercase letters, the function will return 0.
