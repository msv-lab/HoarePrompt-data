Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` are integers where 1 <= `K` <= `N` <= 10^18 and 1 <= `M`, `L` <= 10^18. If `M` is greater than or equal to `N - K + 1` and also greater than or equal to `L`, then the function executes normally. Otherwise, if `M` is less than `N - K + 1` or `M` is less than `L`, the function returns -1.***
