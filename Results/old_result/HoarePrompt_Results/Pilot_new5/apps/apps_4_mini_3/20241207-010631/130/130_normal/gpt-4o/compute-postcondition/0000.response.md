The code `input = sys.stdin.read` does not have any direct impact on the values of N, M, K, and L. It simply assigns the method for reading input from standard input to the variable `input`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged, as no calculations or assignments based on the input have occurred yet.

Output State: **N, M, K, and L are integers such that 1 <= K <= N <= 10^18 and 1 <= M, L <= 10^18. `input` is the method for reading input from standard input.**
