The code executes a print statement that outputs 'NO', but it does not change any variables. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `area` remain unchanged. Since `area` is previously defined as 0, it continues to hold that value. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers assigned from user input; `area` is equal to `n * m / k`, and `area` remains 0.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers assigned from user input; `area` is equal to `n * m / k`, and `area` remains 0.**
