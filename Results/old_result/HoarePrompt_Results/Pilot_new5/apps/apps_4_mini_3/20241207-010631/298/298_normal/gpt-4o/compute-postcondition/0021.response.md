Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers; `area` is equal to `n * m / k` as an integer and is not equal to 0; the string 'YES' has been printed; '0 0' has been printed; it is true that `2 * area` is greater than `n`. If `m` is greater than or equal to `2 * area`, the output is '1 0'. Otherwise, if `2 * area` is greater than `m`, the printed values are `0` and `m // 2`.***
