To determine the correctness of the provided Python code, we need to analyze it in conjunction with the problem description. The main objective is to find three integer points \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\) such that the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to \(\frac{nm}{k}\).

### Key Points to Consider:

1. **Area Calculation**: The area of a triangle formed by points \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), \((x_3, y_3)\) can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \right|
   \]
   For the triangle's area to equal \(\frac{nm}{k}\), we need \(nm\) to be divisible by \(k\).

2. **Initial Check**: The code starts by checking if \(n \times m \% k\) equals zero. If not, it prints "NO" and exits, which is in accordance with the requirement since having a non-integer area means no valid triangle can be formed.

3. **Function `func_3`**: This function uses `func_2` to find coefficients \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(x \cdot a + y \cdot b\) yields a specific value. The purpose of this function is to help find integer solutions to a linear combination of the inputs, which indirectly aids in determining the points for the triangle.

4. **Final Check**: After obtaining \(n1\), \(m1\), and \(g\) from `func_3`, the code checks if \(abs(n1 \cdot m) \geq g\) before printing the triangle coordinates. This check ensures that the computed points are valid based on the area requirement.

### Potential Cases for Failure:

- The main flaw in the logic is that the resulting points formed as \( (0, 0) \), \( (0, n1 \cdot m // g) \), and \( (m1 \cdot m // g, 0) \) need to fall within the valid ranges of \(0 \leq x_i \leq n\) and \(0 \leq y_i \leq m\).
- If \(g\) is much larger than \(n\) or \(m\), the coordinates generated may fall outside the specified bounds, leading to an invalid output.

### Conclusion:

After a thorough analysis, we can see that the program does not handle all edge cases where the computed triangle points may exceed the bounds of \(n\) and \(m\). 

**Example of failure case**:
For input \(n = 1\), \(m = 1\), \(k = 3\):
- The logic would yield points that could potentially go out-of-bounds, as the area calculated might not allow for valid integers within the bounds.

Thus, the final answer regarding the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False** 

The program does not ensure that all generated points stay within the specified bounds based on all possible cases, leading to potential incorrect outputs.
