The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from user input, where `input()` accepts values and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The specific values of `n`, `m`, and `k` after the execution will depend on the input provided by the user. Other variables are not affected, so the output state will reflect the new values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers assigned from user input.**
