The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are integers, with the constraint that `b` is a non-negative integer. 

- In Case_1, if certain conditions are met, the function returns the values 1 and 0.
- In Case_2, if other conditions are met, the function returns two values: `y` and `x - a // b * y`, where `y` and `x` are variables that take on values returned by a recursive call to `func_2(b, a % b)`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two integers `a` and `b`, and based on the conditions, it either returns the values 1 and 0 or computes and returns values based on a recursive calculation involving `a` and `b`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, where `a` is an integer and `b` is a non-negative integer. It returns the values 1 and 0 or computes and returns values based on a recursive call to itself with modified parameters.**
