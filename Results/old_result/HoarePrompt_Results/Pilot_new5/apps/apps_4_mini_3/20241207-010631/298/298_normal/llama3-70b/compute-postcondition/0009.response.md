Functionality: ** The function accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, and calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of these two numbers. If `b` is initially 0, the function returns `a` unchanged. The function handles cases where both `a` and `b` are zero, in which case it returns 0 as the GCD of two zeros. **
