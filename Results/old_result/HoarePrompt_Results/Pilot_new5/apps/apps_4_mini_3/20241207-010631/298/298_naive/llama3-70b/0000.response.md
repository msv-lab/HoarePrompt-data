To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the code step by step.

### Problem Description:
The problem requires finding three integer points \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\) such that:
- \(0 \leq x_1, x_2, x_3 \leq n\)
- \(0 \leq y_1, y_2, y_3 \leq m\)
- The area of the triangle formed by these points should be equal to \(\frac{nm}{k}\).

### Code Analysis:
1. **Area Calculation**:
   - The code first checks if \(n \cdot m \mod k\) is non-zero, in which case it prints 'NO'. This checks if the area can be an integer.
   
2. **Finding Integer Points**:
   - The program defines a function `func_3` to calculate coefficients related to the integers \(n\) and \(m\). It uses the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find integers satisfying the linear combination.
   - The condition `if abs(n1 * m) >= g:` is checked, which seems to determine if valid points can be formed based on the calculated values from `func_3`.

3. **Output**:
   - If the condition is satisfied, it prints three points that are supposed to give the required area.
   - If the condition is not satisfied, it prints 'NO'.

### Potential Flaws:
- The main flaw arises in the conditions under which the points are generated. The specific output points are derived but not guaranteed to lie within the bounds of \(0 \leq x_i \leq n\) and \(0 \leq y_i \leq m\). For example, the points generated could potentially be negative or exceed the limits based on the input values of \(n\) and \(m\).

**Counterexample**:
- Consider inputs \(n = 1\), \(m = 1\), \(k = 2\). Here, the area required would be \( \frac{1 \cdot 1}{2} = 0.5\), which is not possible. The program might return invalid points or miscalculate the integer points, leading to output that fails the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The logic of generating valid points does not guarantee that they will always satisfy the constraints given in the problem description for all possible inputs. As a result, there can exist cases where the output does not meet the conditions required.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**.
