To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description and output hints, we first analyze the code and then see if the output hints align with our understanding.

### Code Analysis
The program first reads three integers, `n`, `m`, and `k`. It calculates the area of the triangle as `area = n * m / k`. The program checks if `area` is a non-zero integer. If it is not, it prints "NO". If it is a valid positive integer, it prints "YES" and defines three points based on the value of `2 * area` in relation to `n` and `m`.

#### Edge Cases:
1. **Non-Integer Areas**: The program correctly checks if `n * m / k` is an integer. If not, it returns "NO".
2. **Zero Area**: If the calculated area is zero, it also returns "NO". This case isn't likely given the input constraints, but it is accounted for.
3. **Point Coordinates**: The program uses conditions to determine the coordinates of the points based on `2 * area`. However, it may not guarantee that all the printed points are within the bounds specified in the problem (i.e., `0 <= x_i <= n` and `0 <= y_i <= m`).

The key concern arises from the conditions used to generate the points. The code generates points based on `2 * area` without considering whether the resulting coordinates could fall outside the specified bounds.

### Output Hints
The output hints summarize the function's behavior, stating that the program checks for valid input and returns "NO" if the area is not a positive integer. They also mention the coordinates printed based on the conditions.

### Validity Check
Now, we need to see if the output hints and the code align perfectly:

1. **When `k` is greater than `nm`**: The area becomes less than `1`, which is impossible to form a triangle with valid integer coordinates. The code should output "NO," which is correct.
2. **When `2 * area` is larger than both `n` and `m`**: The coordinates generated might exceed the limits set in the problem. For example, if `n = 3`, `m = 3`, and `k = 2`, the area would be `4.5`, leading to `2 * area = 9`, which cannot be used to define points as coordinates must remain within bounds [0, n] and [0, m]. 

### Conclusion
The program does not guarantee that the generated points will always be within the specified bounds, particularly if `2 * area` exceeds either `n` or `m`. Therefore, it is possible to encounter cases where the program prints invalid points.

Correctness: **False**. 

### Example of Failure
For `n = 3`, `m = 3`, and `k = 2`, the area is `4.5` leading to `2 * area = 9`, which results in a point definition that exceeds the bounds of both `n` and `m`. Thus, the program could output invalid coordinates.
