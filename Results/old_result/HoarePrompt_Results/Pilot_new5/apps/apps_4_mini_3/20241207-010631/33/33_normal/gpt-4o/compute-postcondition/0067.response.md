The code snippet executes a print statement, which displays the text 'NO'. This action does not modify any variables; thus, the values of the existing variables remain unchanged. The variable `valid` will still indicate that at least one movement was invalid, and the values of `n` and `position` also remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `valid` is False; `position` remains within the range [0, 20000].

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `valid` is False; `position` remains within the range [0, 20000**.
