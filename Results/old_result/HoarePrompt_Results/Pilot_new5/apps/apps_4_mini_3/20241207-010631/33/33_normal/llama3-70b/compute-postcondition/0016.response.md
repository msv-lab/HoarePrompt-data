The `exit()` function terminates the program immediately, so there are no changes to the variable states and no further execution of code after `exit()`. The program ends without affecting any variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `dir` is either 'North', 'South', or neither; `curr_lat` is either less than -90 or greater than 90; 'NO' is printed; and the program has exited.**
