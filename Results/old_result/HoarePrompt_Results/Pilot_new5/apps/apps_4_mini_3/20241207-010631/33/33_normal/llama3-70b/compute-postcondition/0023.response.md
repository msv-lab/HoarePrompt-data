The code snippet `print('NO')` is executed, which results in the output 'NO' being printed to the console. The preconditions regarding the values of `n`, `curr_lat`, and `dir` do not change as the code only prints a value. The preconditions remain valid after execution: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `curr_lat` is 90, and `dir` is not 'South'. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `curr_lat` is 90, `dir` is not 'South', and 'NO' is printed.**
