Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `dir` is a string; if `curr_lat` is less than -90 or greater than 90, `curr_lat` is updated based on `dir` and `t` (if applicable), and 'NO' was printed, indicating that the program has exited; otherwise, the program continues without changes to `curr_lat`.***
