Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and processes `n` pairs of integer `t_i` (1 ≤ t_i ≤ 10^6) and direction strings `dir_i` ("North" or "South"). It updates the variable `curr_lat` to represent the current latitude based on the directions. If the latitude exceeds the bounds of -90 to 90 or if it conditions on reaching the poles are not satisfied, it will print 'NO' and terminate the function. After processing all inputs, it prints 'YES' if the final latitude is exactly 90; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function ignores any directions that are "West" or "East".**
