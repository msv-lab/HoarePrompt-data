The value of `curr_lat` is updated by subtracting `t / 111.195` from its previous value, which is 90. The variable `t` can take any integer value, but it is still unknown in this context. Since `curr_lat` is being adjusted based on the division of `t`, the specific new value of `curr_lat` will depend on the current value of `t`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `curr_lat` is 90 - (t / 111.195), `t` is an integer, `dir` is not equal to 'North', and `dir` is equal to 'South'.**
