Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50. If `valid` is True, then `position` is within the range [0, 20000], and the output printed is 'YES', indicating that all movements were valid. If `valid` is False, `position` remains within the range [0, 20000], indicating that at least one movement was invalid.***
