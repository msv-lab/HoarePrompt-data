The variables `t` and `dir` are assigned the values resulting from the `input().split()` method. This method takes a string input from the user, splits it into parts using whitespace as the delimiter, and assigns the first part to `t` and the second part to `dir`. The initial state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `position` is within the valid range, `valid` is True, `t` is the first part of the user input, `dir` is the second part of the user input**.
