The code snippet provided directly prints 'NO'. The initial state specifies a condition where if `curr_lat` is equal to -90 and `dir` is not 'North', 'NO' is printed, and the program exits. Since the code executes a print statement without changing the values of any variables, we conclude that the output state reflects the print action but retains the original conditions of the variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 49; `t` is an integer; `dir` is a string; `curr_lat` is equal to -90 and `dir` is not 'North'; 'NO' is printed.**
