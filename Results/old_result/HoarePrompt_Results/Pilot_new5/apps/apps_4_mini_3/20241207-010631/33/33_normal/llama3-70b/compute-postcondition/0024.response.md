The code `exit()` terminates the execution of the program immediately. The values of the variables do not change because the program does not continue past this point. Therefore, the output reflects the state of the program just before it exits, without any updates to the variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `curr_lat` is 90, `dir` is not 'South', and 'NO' is printed.**
