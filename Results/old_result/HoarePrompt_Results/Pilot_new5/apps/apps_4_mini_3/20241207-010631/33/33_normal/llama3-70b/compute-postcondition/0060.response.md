The loop modifies the value of `curr_lat` based on the input direction and distance. The loop can execute a maximum of `n` times, where `n` is constrained between 1 and 50. 

After all iterations of the loop, several conditions must hold:
- `curr_lat` must remain within the bounds of -90 and 90, inclusive.
- The updates to `curr_lat` depend on the directions provided ('North' increases latitude, while 'South' decreases it).
- If at any point `curr_lat` hits -90 or 90, specific conditions regarding the directions must be satisfied to avoid printing 'NO' and exiting.

Thus, if we consider the final state after the loop has executed all `n` times successfully:

Output State: **`curr_lat` is between -90 and 90, inclusive; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; all directions are valid strings corresponding to 'North' or 'South'.**
