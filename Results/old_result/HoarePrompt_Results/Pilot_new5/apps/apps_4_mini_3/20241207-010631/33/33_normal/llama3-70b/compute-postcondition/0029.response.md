The value of `curr_lat` is updated by adding `t / 111.195` to it. The current value of `curr_lat` is 90, and `t` is an integer input value. The final value of `curr_lat` will depend on the value of `t`, but since it is only being modified and no other variables are affected, we keep the other information intact.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `curr_lat` is 90 + (t / 111.195), `t` is the integer value of the input, `dir` is an input value and `dir` is not 'South'**
