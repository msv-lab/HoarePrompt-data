Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50. If `dir` is 'North', then if `position - t` < 0, `position` remains unchanged; otherwise, `position` is updated to `position - t`. If `dir` is 'South', `position` is updated to `position + t`, but if this exceeds 20000, then `valid` remains False. If `dir` is either 'West' or 'East' and `position` is 0 or 20000, then `valid` remains False. Otherwise, `position` remains either less than 0 or greater than 20000, and `valid` is set to False.***
