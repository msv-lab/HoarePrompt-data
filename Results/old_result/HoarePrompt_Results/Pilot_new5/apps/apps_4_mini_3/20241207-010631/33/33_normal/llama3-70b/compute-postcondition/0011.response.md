The statement `continue` is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified or values changed by this statement, the current state of the program remains the same. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `curr_lat` is 90, `t` is an integer, `dir` is not equal to 'North', and `dir` is not equal to 'South' and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
