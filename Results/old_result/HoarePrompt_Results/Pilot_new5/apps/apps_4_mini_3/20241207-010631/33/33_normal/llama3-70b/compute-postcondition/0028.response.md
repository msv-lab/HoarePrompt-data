The variable `t` is assigned the value of `int(t)`, which converts the input value `t` to an integer. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `curr_lat` is 90, `t` is the integer value of the input, `dir` is an input value and `dir` is not 'South'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `curr_lat` is 90, `t` is the integer value of the input, `dir` is an input value and `dir` is not 'South'**.
