The code snippet provided simply prints 'NO'. It does not modify any variables or change their values. The execution of the code does not affect the state of any variables, and it only results in an output of the string 'NO'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `dir` is a string; if `curr_lat` equals -90 and `dir` is not 'North', then `curr_lat` is not updated and the program has exited; the output is 'NO'.**
