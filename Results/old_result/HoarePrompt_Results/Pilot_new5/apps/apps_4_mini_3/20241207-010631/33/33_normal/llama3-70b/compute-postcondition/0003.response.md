The code snippet takes input and splits it into two variables, `t` and `dir`. The initial state does not change any existing variables, but introduces new ones based on user input. The values of `t` and `dir` are not specified in the initial state, so they will depend on what is provided as input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `curr_lat` is 90, `t` is an input value, `dir` is an input value**.
