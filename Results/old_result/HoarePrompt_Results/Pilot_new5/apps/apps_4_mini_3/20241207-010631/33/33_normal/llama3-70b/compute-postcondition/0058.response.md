The code `exit()` terminates the program execution. As a result, no variables are modified, and no further statements are executed. The values of `n`, `t`, `dir`, and `curr_lat` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the existing variables and their values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 49; `t` is an integer; `dir` is a string; `curr_lat` is equal to -90 and `dir` is not 'North'; 'NO' is printed.**
