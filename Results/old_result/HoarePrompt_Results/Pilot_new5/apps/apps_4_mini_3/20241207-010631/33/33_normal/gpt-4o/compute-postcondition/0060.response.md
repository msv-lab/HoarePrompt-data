Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50. `position` is within the range [0, 20000] after all iterations, and `valid` indicates whether all movements were valid according to the conditions specified in the loop. If any movement caused `position` to go out of bounds or violated any conditions, `valid` will be False; otherwise, it will remain True.**
