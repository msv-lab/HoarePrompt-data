Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is greater than 1; `i` is `n - 3`. If `s[i]` is ']', then `f` is True. If `s[i]` is ':', and `f` is True, then `bind` is set to `n - 3`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
