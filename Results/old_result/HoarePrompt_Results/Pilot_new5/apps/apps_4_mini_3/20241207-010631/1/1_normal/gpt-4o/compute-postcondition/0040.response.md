Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length greater than 0, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of '[' in `s`, `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of ']' in `s`, `ind + 1` is less than `bind`, `i` is `ind + 1`, and if the character at index `i` of `s` is ':', then `start_colon` is set to `ind + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the character at index `i` is not ':', then the state remains unchanged.***
