Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length greater than 0, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of '[', `bind` is greater than `ind + 1`, `i` is equal to `start_colon + 2`, `start_colon` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `bind`, `end_colon` is greater than `start_colon + 1`. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is '|', then `pipe_count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `pipe_count` remains 0.***
