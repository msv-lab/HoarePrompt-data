Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is the length of `s`; `f` is True if at least one ']' has been encountered in `s` while scanning from the end; `bind` is the index of the last ':' found after the first ']', or -1 if no such ':' exists; `ind` is not -1, meaning at least one ':' is found after the last '['; and `bind` is not -1, indicating that at least one ':' has been found after the first ']'. If `ind` is greater than or equal to `bind`, then -1 has been printed. Otherwise, `f` is True, `bind` is greater than `ind`, `ind` is not -1, `ans` is 4 plus the number of '|' characters found between `ind + 1` and `bind - 1`, and the value of `ans` is printed.***
