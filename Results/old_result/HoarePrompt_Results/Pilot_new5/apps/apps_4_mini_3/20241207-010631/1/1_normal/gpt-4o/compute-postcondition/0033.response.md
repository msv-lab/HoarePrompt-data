The code snippet `print(-1)` does not change any variables; it simply outputs `-1`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length greater than 0; `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of '[' in `s`, or -1; `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of ']' in `s`, or -1 if ']' is not present; `i` is -1 when the loop finishes executing; and -1 has been printed.**
