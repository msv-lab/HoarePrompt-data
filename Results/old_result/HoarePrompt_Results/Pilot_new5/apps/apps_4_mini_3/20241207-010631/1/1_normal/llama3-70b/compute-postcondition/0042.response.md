Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `n - 1`. If `s[i]` is ']', then `f` is set to True. If `s[i]` is not ']', and if `s[i]` is ':', and `f` is True, then `bind` is set to `i` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
