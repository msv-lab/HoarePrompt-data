Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length greater than 0, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of '[', `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of ']', `ind + 2` is less than `bind`, and `i` is `ind + 2`. If `s[i]` is equal to ':', then `start_colon` is set to `ind + 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
