The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of length greater than 0, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of '[' in `s`, or -1; `bind` is `n - 1`, `i` is `n - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
