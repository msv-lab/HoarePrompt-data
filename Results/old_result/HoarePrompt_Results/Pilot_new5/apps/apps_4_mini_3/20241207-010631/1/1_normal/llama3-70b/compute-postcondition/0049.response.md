Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is greater than 1; `i` is `n - 2`. If `s[i]` is ']', then `f` is True. Otherwise, if `s[i]` is ':', then if `s[i]` is ']', `bind` is set to `n - 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
