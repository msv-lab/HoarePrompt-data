The variable `ind` is assigned the value of `-1`. The variable `s` remains unchanged as it is an input string, and `n`, which is the length of `s`, also remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect this assignment and retain the previous values of `s` and `n`.

Output State: **`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |, with a length between 1 and 500000 inclusive; `n` is the length of `s`; `ind` is -1**
