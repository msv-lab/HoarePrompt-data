Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; the first character of `s` is not '['. If the current character at index `i` of `s` is ':', then if `f` is true, `ind` is set to 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
