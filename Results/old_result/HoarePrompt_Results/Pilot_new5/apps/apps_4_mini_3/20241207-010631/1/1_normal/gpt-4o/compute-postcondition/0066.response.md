The code `print(-1)` outputs the value `-1` to the console, but it does not change any of the variable states or their values. Therefore, the values of `s`, `ind`, `bind`, `i`, `start_colon`, and `end_colon` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`s` is a string of length greater than 0, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of '[', `bind` is greater than `ind + 1`, `i` is less than or equal to `ind`, `start_colon` is the index of the first occurrence of ':' between `ind + 1` and `bind - 1` or remains -1 if no ':' is found in that range, `end_colon` is the index of the last occurrence of ':' found during the iterations, or remains -1 if no ':' is found in that range. Either `start_colon` is -1, or `end_colon` is -1, or `start_colon` is greater than or equal to `end_colon`.**
