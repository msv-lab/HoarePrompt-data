You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: An accordion is a string (yes, in the real world accordions are musical instruments, but let's forget about it for a while) which can be represented as a concatenation of: an opening bracket (ASCII code $091$), a colon (ASCII code $058$), some (possibly zero) vertical line characters (ASCII code $124$), another colon, and a closing bracket (ASCII code $093$). The length of the accordion is the number of characters in it.

For example, [::], [:||:] and [:|||:] are accordions having length $4$, $6$ and $7$. (:|:), {:||:}, [:], ]:||:[ are not accordions. 

You are given a string $s$. You want to transform it into an accordion by removing some (possibly zero) characters from it. Note that you may not insert new characters or reorder existing ones. Is it possible to obtain an accordion by removing characters from $s$, and if so, what is the maximum possible length of the result?


-----Input-----

The only line contains one string $s$ ($1 \le |s| \le 500000$). It consists of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], : and |.


-----Output-----

If it is not possible to obtain an accordion by removing some characters from $s$, print $-1$. Otherwise print maximum possible length of the resulting accordion.


-----Examples-----
Input
|[a:b:|]

Output
4

Input
|]:[|:]

Output
-1
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |, with a length between 1 and 500,000.
def func():
    s = input()
    n = len(s)
    ind = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '[':

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |, with length `n` greater than 0; `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of '[' in `s`, or -1 if '[' is not present.
    bind = -1
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if s[i] == ']':
            bind = i
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string of length greater than 0, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of '[' in `s`, or -1; `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of ']' in `s`, or -1 if ']' is not present; `i` is -1 when the loop finishes executing.
    if (ind == -1 or bind == -1 or ind >= bind) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        start_colon = -1
        for i in range(ind + 1, bind):
            if s[i] == ':':

        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string of length greater than 0, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of '[', `bind` is greater than `ind + 1`, `i` is less than or equal to `ind`, `start_colon` is the index of the first occurrence of ':' between `ind + 1` and `bind - 1` or remains -1 if no ':' is found in that range, `end_colon` is the index of the last occurrence of ':' found during the iterations, or remains -1 if no ':' is found in that range.
        if (start_colon == -1 or end_colon == -1 or start_colon >= end_colon) :
            print(-1)
        else :
            pipe_count = 0

            result = 4 + pipe_count
            print(result)

If either `start_colon` or `end_colon` is -1, or `start_colon` is greater than or equal to `end_colon`, the program identifies that the colons are not properly positioned. Otherwise, `start_colon` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `bind`, `end_colon` is greater than `start_colon + 1`, `pipe_count` is the count of the '|' characters found between `start_colon + 1` and `end_colon - 1`, and `result`, which is equal to `4 + pipe_count`, has been printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |, and performs the following checks: it finds the index of the first '[' and the last ']', and verifies that the indexes indicate a valid structure. If valid, it locates the first ':' after the '[' and the last ':' before the ']', counting the number of '|' characters between them. The function returns the count of '|' characters plus 4. If any of the conditions for a valid structure are not met (e.g., no brackets or colons in the correct positions), it returns -1.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
