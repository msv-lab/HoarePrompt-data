Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 1. If `s[i]` is equal to ':', then if `f` is true, `ind` is set to 1 and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[i]` is not equal to ':', no action is taken.***
