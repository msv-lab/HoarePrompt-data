Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `n - 1`; the character at index `i` of `s` is not ']'; if the character at index `i` is ':', then if the condition `f` is true, `bind` is set to `i` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
