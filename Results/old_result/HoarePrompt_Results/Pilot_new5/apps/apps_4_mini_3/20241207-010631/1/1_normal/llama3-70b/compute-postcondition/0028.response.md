Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is greater than 2; `i` is 2. If `s[i]` is equal to '[', then `f` is True. Otherwise, if `s[i]` is equal to ':', and if `f` is true, `ind` is set to 2 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
