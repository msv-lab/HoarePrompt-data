To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the conditions for the loop's range and the state of the variables involved.

1. The loop runs from `ind + 1` to `bind`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, we need:
   - `ind + 1` must be less than `bind`, meaning `ind` must be at least 0 and `bind` must be greater than `ind + 1`.

2. We know that `ind` is not -1, so it is at least 0. 

3. The condition `ind < bind` must hold true:
   - Since `bind` is not -1, it must hold that `bind` > `ind`.

4. The initial state indicates:
   - `ind` is not -1 (ensuring the presence of at least one `:` after the last `[`)
   - `bind` is not -1 (indicating at least one `:` was found after the first `]`)
   - However, we must ensure that `bind` is strictly greater than `ind` for the loop to execute.

Given these observations, the necessary adjustments to the state are as follows:

State: **`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is the length of `s`; `f` is True; `bind` is greater than `ind`, `ind` is not -1, and `ans` is 4.**
