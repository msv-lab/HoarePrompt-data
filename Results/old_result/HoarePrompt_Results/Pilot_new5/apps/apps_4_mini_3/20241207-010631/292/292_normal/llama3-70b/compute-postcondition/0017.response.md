Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `a` and `b`, representing the weights of Limak and Bob, respectively, where 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10. It calculates and outputs the number of years it takes for Limak's weight (growing threefold each year) to exceed Bob's weight (growing twofold each year). The function does not return any value; it simply prints the number of years. **
