The function accepts two integers `a` and `b` representing the weights of Limak and Bob, respectively. It calculates how many years it will take for Limak's weight to exceed Bob's, given that Limak's weight triples and Bob's weight doubles each year. The function then prints the total number of years required for Limak's weight to surpass Bob's weight.
