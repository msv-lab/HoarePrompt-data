The value of `years` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `years` is 0, so after the increment, the new value of `years` will be 1. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`years` is 1, `a` is equal to `orig_a * 3`, and `b` is now equal to `b * 2` (where \(2 \leq b \leq 20\)).**
