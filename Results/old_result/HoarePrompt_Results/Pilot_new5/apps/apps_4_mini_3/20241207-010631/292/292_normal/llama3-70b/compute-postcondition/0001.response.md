The variable `years` is initialized to 0. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged since they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an integer from input, `b` is an integer from input such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ `b` ≤ 10, and `years` is 0.

Output State: **`a` is an integer from input, `b` is an integer from input such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ `b` ≤ 10, and `years` is 0**.
