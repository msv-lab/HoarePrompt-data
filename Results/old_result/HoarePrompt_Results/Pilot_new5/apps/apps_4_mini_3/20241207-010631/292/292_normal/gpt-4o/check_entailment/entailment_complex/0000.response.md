The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here’s the reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input, where `a` is Limak's weight and `b` is Bob's weight. It correctly adheres to the constraint `1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10`, ensuring that Limak's weight is less than or equal to Bob's weight.

2. **Weight Calculation**: Inside the `while` loop, the program checks if Limak's weight `a` is less than or equal to Bob's weight `b`. If so, it calculates the new weights for the next year: Limak's weight is tripled (`a *= 3`) and Bob's weight is doubled (`b *= 2`). This matches the problem statement where Limak's weight increases by a factor of 3, and Bob's weight increases by a factor of 2 each year.

3. **Year Counter**: The variable `years` is incremented with each iteration of the loop, counting how many years it takes for Limak's weight to surpass Bob's weight. This is the required output.

4. **Termination Condition**: The loop continues until Limak's weight is strictly greater than Bob's weight. The program correctly implements the requirement that Limak must be strictly heavier than Bob, not just equal.

5. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the number of years it took for Limak to become heavier than Bob, which is the expected output.

### Conclusion
The function correctly implements the logic required by the problem statement for every potential case provided in the constraints. Therefore, the program meets all the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
