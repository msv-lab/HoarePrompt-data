To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program step-by-step.

**Problem Description Review:**
- Limak's weight (`a`) is guaranteed to be less than or equal to Bob's weight (`b`).
- Limak's weight triples every year, while Bob's weight doubles.
- We need to find out how many full years it will take for Limak's weight to become strictly greater than Bob's weight.

**Program Review:**
```
def func():
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    years = 0
    while a <= b:
        a *= 3
        b *= 2
        years += 1
    print(years)
```
The program reads two integers (`a` and `b`), initializes a counter `years` to zero, and then enters a loop that continues as long as Limak's weight (`a`) is less than or equal to Bob's weight (`b`). Inside the loop:
- Limak's weight is tripled.
- Bob's weight is doubled.
- The year counter is incremented.
Finally, it prints the number of years.

**Testing Potential Cases:**
1. **Case 1: Input (1, 1)**  
   - Year 0: a = 1, b = 1
   - Year 1: a = 3, b = 2 (Limak becomes greater than Bob)
   - Expected Output: 1  
   - Program Output: 1 (correct)

2. **Case 2: Input (4, 7)**  
   - Year 0: a = 4, b = 7
   - Year 1: a = 12, b = 14
   - Year 2: a = 36, b = 28 (Limak becomes greater than Bob)
   - Expected Output: 2  
   - Program Output: 2 (correct)

3. **Case 3: Input (4, 9)**  
   - Year 0: a = 4, b = 9
   - Year 1: a = 12, b = 18
   - Year 2: a = 36, b = 36
   - Year 3: a = 108, b = 72 (Limak becomes greater than Bob)
   - Expected Output: 3  
   - Program Output: 3 (correct)

Each of these cases adheres to the description provided, and the program successfully calculates the year Limak's weight exceeds Bob's.

**Edge Cases:**
- Limak's weight (`a`) being 1 and Bob's weight (`b`) being 10: 
   - Year 0: a = 1, b = 10
   - Year 1: a = 3, b = 20
   - Year 2: a = 9, b = 40
   - Year 3: a = 27, b = 80 (Limak > Bob)
   - Expected Output: 3 (correct)
 
- Limak's weight (`a`) being 10 and Bob's weight being 10: 
   - Year 0: a = 10, b = 10
   - Year 1: a = 30, b = 20 (Limak > Bob)
   - Expected Output: 1 (correct)

**Conclusion:**
After evaluating multiple potential cases and edge cases, the program consistently provides the correct output as described. It checks all conditions accurately and does not miss any edge cases.

Correctness: **True**.
