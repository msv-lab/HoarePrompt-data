According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `a` and `b`. The loop will execute as long as `a` is less than or equal to `b`. 

Right before the loop, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10, `b` is an integer between `a` and 10, and `years` is 0. Given that `1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10`, it guarantees that `a` is less than or equal to `b`, allowing the loop to execute at least one time. 

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute one more time, since the current conditions already satisfy the loop's requirement.

State: **`a` is an integer from input, `b` is an integer from input such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ `b` ≤ 10, and `years` is 0**
