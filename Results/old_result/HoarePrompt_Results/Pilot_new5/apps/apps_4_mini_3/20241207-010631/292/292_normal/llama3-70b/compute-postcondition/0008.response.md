The value of `b` is doubled after executing `b *= 2`. Since `b` was previously equal to `b * 2`, after the operation, its new value becomes `b * 4`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged, and the condition about `orig_a` is still valid.

Output State: **`years` is 1, `a` is equal to `orig_a * 9`, `b` is now equal to `b * 4`, and `orig_a` must be less than or equal to \(\frac{b \times 2}{3}\)**
