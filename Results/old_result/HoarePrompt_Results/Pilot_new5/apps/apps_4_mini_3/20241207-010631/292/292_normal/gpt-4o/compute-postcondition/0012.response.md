The variable `b` is multiplied by 2. However, the value of `b` is invalid, so multiplying it will still result in an invalid value. The variable `years` is noted to have increased by 1, but it does not affect the operation on `b`. The variable `a` remains an integer between 27 and 120.

Output State: **`a` is an integer between 27 and 120; `b` remains invalid; `years` is increased by 1.**
