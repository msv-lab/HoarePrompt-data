The variables `a` and `b` are both assigned new integer values from the user input, specifically through the `map(int, input().split())` function. This will take two space-separated integers from the input and convert them into integers for `a` and `b`. The preconditions state that `1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10`. After executing the code, the values of `a` and `b` will be updated based on the input received while maintaining the initial constraints.

Output State: **`a` is an integer from input, `b` is an integer from input such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ `b` ≤ 10**
