The value of `a` is updated with the operation `a *= 3`, which means `a` is now equal to its previous value multiplied by 3. Since `a` was previously equal to `orig_a * 9`, after this operation, `a` will be `orig_a * 9 * 3`, which simplifies to `orig_a * 27`. The value of `b` remains unchanged, but it must still be greater than or equal to `orig_a * 9`.

Output State: **`years` is now 2, `a` is equal to `orig_a * 27`, `b` must be greater than or equal to `orig_a * 9**.
