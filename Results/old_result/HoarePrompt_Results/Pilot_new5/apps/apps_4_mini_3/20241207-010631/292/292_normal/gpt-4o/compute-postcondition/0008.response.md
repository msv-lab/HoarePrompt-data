The value of `b` is multiplied by 2. Given the initial state, we know `a` is between 9 and 90. If `a` is greater than 10, then `b` is invalid, but if `a` is less than or equal to 10, then `b` must also be at least `a` and within the bounds of `2a` and 20. Since the only case where `b` is valid according to the initial state is when `a` is less than or equal to 10, we can conclude that after multiplying `b` by 2, `b` must be between `2a` (which can range from 18 to 20 based on `a` being 9 or 10) and `40`, since `b` cannot exceed 20.

Thus, the output state would reflect that `a` remains as an integer between 9 and 90, and `b` is now adjusted to be at least `2a` and cannot exceed `40` if `a` remains in the defined bounds.

Output State: **`a` is an integer between 9 and 90; `b` is at least `2a` and up to `40`.**
