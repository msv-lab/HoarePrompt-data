Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic specified in the problem description. Here's how it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the two integers `a` and `b`, which represent the weights of Limak and Bob, respectively. It ensures that the input adheres to the constraints \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10\).

2. **Weight Growth Calculation**: The program correctly simulates the growth of Limak's and Bob's weights over the years:
   - Limak's weight triples each year: `a *= 3`
   - Bob's weight doubles each year: `b *= 2`

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as Limak's weight `a` is less than or equal to Bob's weight `b`. This correctly reflects the requirement to find out when Limak's weight exceeds Bob's weight.

4. **Counting Years**: The variable `years` is incremented in each iteration of the loop, effectively counting the number of years until Limak's weight surpasses Bob's weight.

5. **Output**: The program prints the number of years it takes for Limak to become strictly heavier than Bob, which is the desired output format as specified in the problem description.

All possible cases within the given constraints (with weights ranging from 1 to 10) have been accounted for, and the logic used in the program will always yield a correct result based on the defined weight growth rates. Therefore, the program is correct as it fulfills the requirements set out in the problem description.
