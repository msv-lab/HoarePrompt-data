The value of `a` is multiplied by 3. Since `a` is originally an integer between 1 and 10, after this operation, `a` will now be between 3 and 30. The values of `b` and `years` remain unchanged, so the output state reflects that.

Output State: **`a` is an integer between 3 and 30, `b` is an integer between `a` and 10, inclusive, `years` is 0**
