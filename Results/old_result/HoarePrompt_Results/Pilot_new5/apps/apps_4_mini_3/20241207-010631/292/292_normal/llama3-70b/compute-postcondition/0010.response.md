According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `a` and `b`. If `a` is less than or equal to `b`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is equal to `orig_a * 9`, and `b` is now equal to `b * 4`. Given that `orig_a` must be less than or equal to \(\frac{b \times 2}{3}\), we need to ensure that `a` can still be less than or equal to `b` for the next iteration.

Since `a` is currently `orig_a * 9`, and `b` is significantly larger (as it has been multiplied by 4), we should check the conditions:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must still be less than or equal to `b`. Therefore, `orig_a * 9` must be less than or equal to `b`.
- Considering `orig_a` must be less than or equal to \(\frac{b \times 2}{3}\), we can deduce that `b` must be greater than or equal to `orig_a * 9` for the loop to execute again.

Hence, we do not need to change the other states but need to ensure that `b` is sufficiently large.

State: **`years` is now 2, `a` is equal to `orig_a * 9`, `b` must be greater than or equal to `orig_a * 9`**
