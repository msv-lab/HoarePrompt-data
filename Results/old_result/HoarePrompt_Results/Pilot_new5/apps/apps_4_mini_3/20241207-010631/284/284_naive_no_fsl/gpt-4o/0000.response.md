To evaluate the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, we need to analyze if it correctly finds a positive integer \( m \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number for any given \( n \).

### Breakdown of the Program:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer \( n \) from standard input.

2. **Looping Through Potential m Values**: 
   - It iterates over \( m \) from 1 to 1000.
   - For each \( m \), it calculates \( n \cdot m + 1 \).

3. **Prime Check**:
   - It checks if \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number using the `func_1` function.
   - If it finds an \( m \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not prime, it prints \( m \) and breaks the loop.

4. **Prime Checking Function**: The `func_1` function implements standard prime-checking logic:
   - It returns `False` for numbers less than or equal to 1 (not prime).
   - It correctly identifies the primality of numbers greater than 1.

### Analysis of Correctness:

The problem guarantees that for any input \( n \) (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000), there exists at least one \( m \) (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number.

Let's consider the following reasoning:

- For any integer \( n \), if we try \( m = n \), we compute \( n \cdot n + 1 = n^2 + 1 \). This number is greater than 1 and will often not be prime (for example, if \( n = 2 \), then \( 2 \cdot 2 + 1 = 5 \), which is prime, but for \( n = 3 \), \( 3 \cdot 3 + 1 = 10 \), which is not prime).
- Since the loop runs over a sufficient range (1 to 1000), it will eventually find a non-prime output for \( n \cdot m + 1 \) for any \( n \).

### Identifying Potential Issues:

1. **Prime Checking**: The prime-checking logic seems comprehensive and takes care of most edge cases.
2. **Limits**: The program respects the input limits and ensures the output conditions are met.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the potential edge cases and understanding the logic, the program appears to correctly find an \( m \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not prime.

Thus, based on the problem description and the analysis, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
