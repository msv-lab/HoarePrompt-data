According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the condition set by `num`. The loop starts with `i` at 2 and continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(num ** 0.5)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and because `num` is an odd number greater than or equal to 2, `int(num ** 0.5)` will also be greater than or equal to 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented. After the last iteration where `i` is 2, it will be incremented to 3 for the next iteration. The condition for the loop to execute again requires that `i` (which is now 3) is less than or equal to `int(num ** 0.5)`. Thus, `num` must satisfy the condition that `int(num ** 0.5)` is greater than or equal to 3. 

In summary, the adjustments needed are:
- `i` changes from 2 to 3.
- `num` must be such that `int(num ** 0.5)` is at least 3, which implies `num` must be at least 9 (since 3^2 = 9).

State: **`num` is an odd positive integer such that 9 ≤ num ≤ 1000, `i` is 3**
