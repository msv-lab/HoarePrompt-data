The value of `i` is incremented by 6, but the previous value of `i` is unknown. The other variables, `n` and `x`, remain unchanged and are still subject to their initial conditions. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000; `x` is greater than or equal to 121, `x` is neither divisible by 2 nor divisible by 3, and `x` is not divisible by 5 or 7. The value of `i` is increased by 6.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000; `x` is greater than or equal to 121, `x` is neither divisible by 2 nor divisible by 3, and `x` is not divisible by 5 or 7; value of `i` is increased by 6.**
