#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ num ≤ 1000.
def func_1(num):
    if (num < 2) :
        return False
        #The program returns False because the current value of 'num' is less than 2, which is inconsistent with it being a positive integer in the range 1 ≤ 'num' ≤ 1000
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *num is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ num ≤ 1000, and num is greater than or equal to 2.
    for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `num` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `num` ≤ 1000, and `num` is prime if the loop executes without returning, otherwise `num` is not prime if the loop returns False due to divisibility by an `i`.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that the positive integer 'num' is prime as no divisibility was found within the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `num` within the range 1 to 1000. It returns False if `num` is less than 2. If `num` is greater than or equal to 2, the function checks for factors from 2 to the square root of `num`. If any factor divides `num` evenly, it returns False, indicating that `num` is not a prime number. If no factors are found, it returns True, indicating that `num` is a prime number. The function does not handle cases where `num` is less than 1 as specified in the annotations.
