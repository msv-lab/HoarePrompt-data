The variable `current_node` is assigned the value `2 * current_node + 2`. The previous value of `current_node` is 0. Therefore, the new value of `current_node` becomes `2 * 0 + 2`, which is 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`h` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50; `n` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2^`h`; `total_leaves` is equal to 2^`h`; `visited_count` is 1; `path` is a binary string of length `h` that must have at least 1 character; `current_level` is 0; `current_node` is 2; the value of `direction` is not equal to '0'.**
