The value of `ans` is incremented by `n // 2`, where `//` denotes integer division. The variable `n` is known to be greater than or equal to 4, so `n // 2` will yield a value of at least 2. The exact value of `ans` will depend on its previous value which is not specified. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 50; `n` is greater than or equal to 4; `ans` is updated by adding `n // 2`.**
