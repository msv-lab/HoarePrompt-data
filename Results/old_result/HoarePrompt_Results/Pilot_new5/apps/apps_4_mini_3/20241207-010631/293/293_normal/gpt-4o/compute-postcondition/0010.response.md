The value of `current_node` is updated using the expression `2 * current_node + 1`. Initially, `current_node` is 0, so after the execution, `current_node` becomes `2 * 0 + 1`, which is 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`h` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50; `n` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2^`h`; `total_leaves` is equal to 2^`h`; `visited_count` is 1; `path` is a binary string of length `h` that must have at least 1 character; `current_level` is 0; `current_node` is 1; the current value of `direction` is '0'.**
