The value of `visited_count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `visited_count` is 4, so the new value becomes 5. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`h` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50; `n` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2^`h`; `total_leaves` is equal to 2^`h`; `visited_count` is 5; `path` is a binary string of length `h` that must have at least 4 characters; `current_level` is 1; `direction` is the fourth character in `path`; if `direction` is '0', then `current_node` is either 3 or 5; otherwise, if `direction` is not '0', then `current_node` is either 4 or 6.**
