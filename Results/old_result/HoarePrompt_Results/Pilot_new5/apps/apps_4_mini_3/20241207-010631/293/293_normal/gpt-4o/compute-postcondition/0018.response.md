Postcondition: ***`h` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50; `n` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2^`h`; `total_leaves` is equal to 2^`h`; `visited_count` is 3; `path` is a binary string of length `h` that must have at least 2 characters; `current_level` is 0; if `direction` is '0', then `current_node` is either 3 or 5; otherwise, if `direction` is not '0', then `current_node` is either 4 or 6.***
