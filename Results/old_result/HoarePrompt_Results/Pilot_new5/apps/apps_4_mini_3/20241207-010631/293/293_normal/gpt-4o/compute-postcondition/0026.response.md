The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. Based on the provided constraints, `h` is an integer that satisfies `1 ≤ h ≤ 50`, and `n` is an integer that satisfies `1 ≤ n ≤ 2^h`. However, since there are no parameters being passed into the function, we cannot determine specific behavior related to `h` and `n` from the given information.

As there is no output or return value detailed in the provided information, we cannot ascertain what the function returns. Therefore, the functionality of the function is not clearly defined.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and does not have a defined output based on the provided information.**
