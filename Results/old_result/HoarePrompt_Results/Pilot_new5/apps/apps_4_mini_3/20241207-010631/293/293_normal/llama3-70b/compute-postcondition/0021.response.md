The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates based on the constraints that `h` is an integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 50, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^h. However, the specific output and behavior based on these constraints have not been provided. Therefore, without additional information on what the function returns or how `h` and `n` influence its output, I cannot describe the functionality accurately.

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters and its output is not specified based on the given information.**
