The code `new_marks.add(mark + y)` adds the value of `mark + y` to the `new_marks` set. The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation. 

Since `mark` is part of the precondition, we know it is a positive integer. The value of `y` is also a positive integer. Therefore, `mark + y` is guaranteed to be a positive integer as well.

The variables `x_found` and `y_found` remain unchanged. The variable `new_marks` is updated to include the new element `mark + y`.

Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers; `marks` contains at least 2 elements; `marks_set` is a set of unique integers derived from `marks`; `mark` is the next element in `marks`; `x_found` is False; `y_found` is False; `new_marks` contains the element `mark + y`.**
