Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `marks` is a list containing at least 1 element, and `i` is the first element of `marks`. If `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and `i + j` is not in `marks`, then `additional_marks` now contains at least one more element which is `i + j`.***
