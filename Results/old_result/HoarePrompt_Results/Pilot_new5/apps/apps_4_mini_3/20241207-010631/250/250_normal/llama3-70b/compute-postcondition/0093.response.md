To determine the necessary state adjustments for the loop to execute, let's analyze the provided state and the for loop.

1. The variable `j` will iterate over the elements of `additional_marks`. For the loop to execute, `additional_marks` must not be empty; otherwise, the loop body won't be executed.

2. Although `n` is a positive integer, it does not affect the execution of the loop directly. The key factor here is the content of `additional_marks`.

3. The state indicates that `marks` is a list containing at least 3 elements, which means the third element (referred to as `i`) is valid.

4. Since `i` is assigned the third element of `marks` and there are no other relevant states influencing the loop execution, the state adjustments primarily focus on `additional_marks`.

To summarize, we need to ensure that `additional_marks` is not empty.

State: **`n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `marks` is a list containing at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element of `marks, additional_marks must have at least 1 element, j is the first element in additional_marks**
