To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we start with the initial state provided and analyze what happens during the loop's execution:

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `i` is 1, `j` is equal to `n-1`, `need_x` is True if there exists an index `j` such that `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `x`, and `need_y` is True if there exists an index `j` such that `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `y`.

The loop iterates `j` from `i` to `n-1`, checking for each `j` if the difference `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `x` or `y`. 

After the loop executes for all possible values of `j` (from `1` to `n-1`), the final output state will reflect:

- The values of `need_x` and `need_y` based on whether any difference matches `x` or `y` during any iteration of the loop.
- The final value of `j` will be `n`, as the loop will have completed all iterations.

Hence, the output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `i` is 1, `j` is equal to `n`, `need_x` is True if there exists an index `j` such that `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `x`, `need_y` is True if there exists an index `j` such that `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `y`, and `marks` is an array with at least `n` elements.**
