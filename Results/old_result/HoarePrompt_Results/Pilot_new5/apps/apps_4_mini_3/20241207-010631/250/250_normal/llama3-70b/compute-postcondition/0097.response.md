According to the code, the loop execution depends on the contents of `additional_marks`. Since `j` is the first element of `additional_marks`, for the loop to execute one more time, `additional_marks` must contain at least one more element after the current value of `j` is processed. 

At the end of the last iteration, we have `i` as the third element of `marks` and `j` as the first element in `additional_marks`. For the next iteration, `j` will take the value of the second element in `additional_marks`, if it exists. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `additional_marks` must contain at least 2 elements.

State: **`n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `marks` is a list containing at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element of `marks`, `additional_marks` must have at least 2 elements, `j` is the second element in `additional_marks`.**
