Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers, `marks` contains at least 1 element, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers derived from `marks`, `a` is a strictly increasing list of `n` integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`, `x_found` is False, `y_found` is False, and `y_found` is still False. The expressions `mark + y + x`, `mark + y - x`, and `mark - y + x` do not exist in `marks_set`. `new_marks` is either empty or does not include `mark + x` or `mark - x + y` or `mark - x - y`. The current value of the variable `mark - y + x` or `mark - y - x` is now present in `marks_set`.***
