The variable `result` is initialized as an empty list. This does not affect any of the other variables, as they maintain their original conditions. Therefore, the output state remains as follows:

Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers; `marks` contains at least `n` elements; `marks_set` is a set of unique integers derived from `marks`; if `y_found` is False, `new_marks` is empty; if `y_found` is True, `new_marks` remains unchanged and contains elements only from previous iterations if any were added; `result` is an empty list.**
