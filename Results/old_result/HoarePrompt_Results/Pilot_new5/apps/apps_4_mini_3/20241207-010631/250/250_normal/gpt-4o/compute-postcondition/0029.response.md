Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers; `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`; `a` is a strictly increasing list of `n` integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`; `x_found` is True if there exists at least one `mark` such that either `mark + x` or `mark - x` is in `marks_set`; `y_found` is True if there exists at least one `mark` such that either `mark + y` or `mark - y` is in `marks_set`. The loop continues until both `x_found` and `y_found` are True or all elements in `marks` have been processed. If no elements in `marks` satisfy the conditions for either `x_found` or `y_found`, then both remain False.**
