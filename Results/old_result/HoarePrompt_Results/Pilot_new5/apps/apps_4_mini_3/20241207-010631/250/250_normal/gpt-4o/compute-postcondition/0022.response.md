According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `marks` iterable. If `marks` contains at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, it is stated that `marks` contains at least 2 elements. Since the loop iterates over each element in `marks`, we need to consider that one iteration has already been completed, which means there is now at least one less element in `marks` than there was at the start. 

Thus, for the loop to be executed one more time, the `marks` must contain at least 2 elements (prior to the last iteration) and at least 1 more element after this iteration. Given that a mark was processed, we can assume that the number of remaining marks in the collection must be greater than 1.

State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers; `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`; `a` is a strictly increasing list of `n` integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`; marks contains at least 1 more element; `x_found` and `y_found` remain unchanged.**
