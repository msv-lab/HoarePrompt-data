Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `need_x` is False, indicating there does not exist at least one pair of indices (i, j) such that `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `x`, `need_y` is True if there exists at least one pair of indices (i, j) such that `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `y`, `marks` is a set of integers with at least `n` elements, and `additional_marks` is an empty list.***
