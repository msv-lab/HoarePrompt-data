According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and since `n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `n` must be at least 2. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 2. The loop will still be able to execute because `i` (2) is less than `n` (which is at least 2). 

Therefore, the necessary adjustments to the states are as follows: `i` will be 2, and `j` is still equal to `n`. The conditions for `need_x` and `need_y` depend on the state of the array `marks`, which we do not alter, so they remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `i` is 2, `j` is equal to `n`, `need_x` is True if there exists an index `j` such that `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `x`, `need_y` is True if there exists an index `j` such that `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `y`, and `marks` is an array with at least `n` elements.**
