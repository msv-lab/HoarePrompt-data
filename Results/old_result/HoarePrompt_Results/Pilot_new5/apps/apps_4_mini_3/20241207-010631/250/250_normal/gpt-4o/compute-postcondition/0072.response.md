Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers; `marks` contains at least 3 elements; `marks_set` is a set of unique integers derived from `marks`; `mark` is the next element in `marks`. If `y_found` is False and either `mark - y + x` or `mark - y - x` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` contains `mark - y`. If `y_found` is True, `new_marks` remains unchanged.***
