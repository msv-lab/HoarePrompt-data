The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers; `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`; `a` is a strictly increasing list of `n` integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`; `marks` contains at least 1 more element; `x_found` is set to True and `y_found` is also set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
