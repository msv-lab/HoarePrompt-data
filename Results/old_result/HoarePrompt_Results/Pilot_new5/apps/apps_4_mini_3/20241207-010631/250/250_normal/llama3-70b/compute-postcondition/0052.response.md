The value of `need_y` is assigned `True`, but it was already `True` in the initial state, so there is no change in value. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 4, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `need_x` is True, and `need_y` is True.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 4, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `need_x` is True, and `need_y` is True**.
