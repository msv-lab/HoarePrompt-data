To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we analyze the code provided and the conditions under which the loop operates.

The loop iterates over `additional_marks` and checks if the sum of `i` and each element `j` from `additional_marks` is less than or equal to `l` and not already present in `marks`. If these conditions are satisfied, `i + j` is appended to `additional_marks`.

1. **Initial Variables:**
   - `n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5).
   - `marks` is a list containing at least 1 element.
   - `i` is the first element of `marks`.
   - `additional_marks` starts with at least 1 element.

2. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop can execute as long as there are elements in `additional_marks` to iterate over.
   - Each execution of the loop can add new elements to `additional_marks` based on the aforementioned conditions.

3. **Final State Analysis:**
   - If the loop executes, `additional_marks` may contain new values derived from the sums `i + j` that meet the conditions.
   - If the loop does not execute, `additional_marks` remains unchanged from its initial state.

Considering the loop's operations and possible scenarios, the output state after all iterations of the loop has finished can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `marks` is a list containing at least 1 element, `i` is the first element of `marks`, `additional_marks` contains all valid elements formed by `i + j` where `j` is from the previous elements of `additional_marks`, and each of these sums is less than or equal to `l` and not in `marks`. If the loop did not execute, `additional_marks` retains its original state.**
