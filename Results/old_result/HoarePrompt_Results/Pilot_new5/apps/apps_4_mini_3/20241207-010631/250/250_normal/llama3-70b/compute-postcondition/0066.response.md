The variable `additional_marks` is updated to include the value of `y`. Since `need_y` is currently False, the addition of `y` to `additional_marks` does not affect `need_y` directly, but it may influence future evaluations or calculations regarding `need_y`. The initial conditions regarding `n`, `need_x`, and `need_y` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `need_x` is False, `need_y` is True if there exists at least one pair of indices (i, j) such that `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `y`, and `additional_marks` now includes the value `y`.**
