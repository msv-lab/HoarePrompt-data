According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j`, `i`, and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` starts at `i` and is less than `n`. Given that `i` is 0 and `n` is a positive integer in the specified range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), the loop will execute because the range will be from 0 to n-1 (inclusive). 

At the start of the loop:
- `j` will take the value of `i`, which is 0, and since `n` is at least 2, the loop will definitely execute at least once (for `j = 0`).

Therefore, the state before the loop can be described as:

State: **`n` is a positive integer in range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `i` is 0, `j` is 0**
