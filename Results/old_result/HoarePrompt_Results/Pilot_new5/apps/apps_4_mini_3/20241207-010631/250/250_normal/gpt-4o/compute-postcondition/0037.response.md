The code `new_marks.add(mark + x)` adds the value `mark + x` to the set `new_marks`. The initial state indicates that `new_marks` is an empty set. The value of `mark` is not specified, but it is part of a condition that ensures at least one form of `mark + x + y`, `mark + x - y`, or `mark - x + y` is in `marks_set`. 

Since `new_marks` is empty initially, after the execution of this code, it will contain the value `mark + x`. The rest of the variables are not affected by this code. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers, `marks` contains at least 1 element, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers derived from `marks`, `a` is a strictly increasing list of `n` integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`, `x_found` is False, `y_found` is False, `new_marks` is a set containing `mark + x` (where `mark` is an integer that satisfies the given conditions).

Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers, `marks` contains at least 1 element, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers derived from `marks`, `a` is a strictly increasing list of `n` integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`, `x_found` is False, `y_found` is False, `new_marks` is a set containing `mark + x`.**
