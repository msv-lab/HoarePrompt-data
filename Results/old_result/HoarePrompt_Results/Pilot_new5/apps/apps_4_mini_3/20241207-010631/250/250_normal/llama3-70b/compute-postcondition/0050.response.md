The value of `need_x` is assigned to `True`, but it was already `True` before the code execution, so there is no change in the variable's value. The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `j`, `need_y`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 4, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `need_x` is True, and `need_y` is True.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 4, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `need_x` is True, `need_y` is True**.
