According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from `i` to `n`, specifically from `0` to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `j` is 1. The loop will continue iterating as long as `j` is less than `n`.

Since `j` is currently 1, and `n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will become 2 for the next iteration. 

Thus, the updated states at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be: `i` remains 0, `j` will be 2, and `n` remains unchanged. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `i` is 0, `j` is 2**
