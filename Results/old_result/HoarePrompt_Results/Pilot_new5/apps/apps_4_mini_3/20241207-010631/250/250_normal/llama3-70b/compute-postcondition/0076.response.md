According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `additional_marks` list. The loop will execute for each element in `additional_marks`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is the current element of `additional_marks`. Since `additional_marks` contains at least 3 elements, the loop can execute one more time as long as there is another element in the list after the current `j`.

Given that `additional_marks` has at least 3 elements, the next value of `j` will be the subsequent element in the `additional_marks` list. To meet the conditions outlined, `i` is still the first element of `marks`, and the new `j` must be the next element in the list.

State: **`n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `marks` is a list containing at least 1 element, `i` is the first element of `marks`, `j` is the next element of `additional_marks`, and `additional_marks` contains at least 3 elements with the last element being equal to `i + j`.**
