The code appends the value of `i + j` to the `additional_marks` list. The variable `i` is the third element of `marks`, and `j` is the second element of `additional_marks`. Since both `i` and `j` are defined, we can express the new value being appended.

- `additional_marks` will now have an additional element, which is the sum of `i` (third element of `marks`) and `j` (second element of `additional_marks`).

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `marks` is a list containing at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element of `marks`, `additional_marks` now contains at least 3 elements including the new value `i + j`, `j` is the second element in `additional_marks`.**
