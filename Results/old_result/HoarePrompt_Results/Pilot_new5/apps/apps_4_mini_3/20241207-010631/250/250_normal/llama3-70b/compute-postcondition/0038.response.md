`need_y` is assigned the value `True`, and the states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `marks` is an array with at least `n` elements, and `need_y` is True.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `marks` is an array with at least `n` elements, `need_y` is True.**
