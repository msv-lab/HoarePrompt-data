The variable `new_marks` will have an additional value added to it, specifically `mark - y`. The previous conditions regarding `y_found` and the calculations involving `marks_set` do not affect the output in this case since the code directly adds to `new_marks`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers; `marks` contains at least 3 elements; `marks_set` is a set of unique integers derived from `marks`; `mark` is the next element in `marks`; `y_found` is False; `new_marks` contains `mark - y`**.
