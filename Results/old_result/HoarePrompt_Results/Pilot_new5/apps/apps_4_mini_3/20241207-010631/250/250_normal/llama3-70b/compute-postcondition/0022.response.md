According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `j` is equal to `n-1`. Since `n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1. Therefore, after the next iteration, `i` will be 1.

The values of `need_x` and `need_y` will remain unchanged unless modified during the loop's execution. However, since we are focusing on the state at the start of the next iteration, we can keep `need_x` and `need_y` as they are.

State: **`n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `i` is 1, `j` is equal to `n-1`, `need_x` is True if there exists an index `j` such that `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `x`, and `need_y` is True if there exists an index `j` such that `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `y`.**
