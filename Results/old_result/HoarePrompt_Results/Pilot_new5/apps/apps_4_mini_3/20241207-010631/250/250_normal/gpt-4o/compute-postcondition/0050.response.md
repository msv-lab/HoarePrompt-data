Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers, `marks` contains at least 1 element, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers derived from `marks`, `a` is a strictly increasing list of `n` integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`, `x_found` is False, `y_found` is False, and `new_marks` is updated to include `mark - y` if either `mark - y + x` or `mark - y - x` exists in `marks_set`. The expressions `mark + y + x`, `mark + y - x`, and `mark - y + x` do not exist in `marks_set` and `new_marks` remains unchanged otherwise.***
