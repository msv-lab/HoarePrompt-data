To determine the necessary adjustments to the state before the for loop executes, we need to consider how the loop interacts with the variable `marks`. 

In this context, the loop iterates over the elements of `marks`, so the key points to address are:

1. **The state of `marks`:** For the loop to execute, `marks` must be a collection (like a list or an array) that contains elements. The provided state does not specify the contents of `marks`, only that it is related to `n`, which is a positive integer. Therefore, `marks` must be a list with at least one element for the loop to run.

2. **The values of `i`:** As the loop iterates over `marks`, the variable `i` will take on each element of `marks` in turn. 

Based on this understanding, the adjustments to the initial state can be stated as follows:

- The collection `marks` must not be empty; it must contain at least one element. 
- The variable `i` will begin with the first element of `marks` during the first iteration of the loop.

Thus, the necessary state adjustments can be summarized as follows:

State: **`n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `marks` is a list containing at least 1 element, `i` is the first element of `marks`**
