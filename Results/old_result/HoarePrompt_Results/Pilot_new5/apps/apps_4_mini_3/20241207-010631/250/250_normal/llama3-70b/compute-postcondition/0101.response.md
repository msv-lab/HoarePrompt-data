The code appends the value `i + j` to the list `additional_marks`. Given the initial state:

- `n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5).
- `marks` is a list containing at least 3 elements.
- `i` is the third element of `marks`.
- `additional_marks` has at least 3 elements.
- `j` is the next element in `additional_marks` that has not yet been processed.
- `i + j` must be less than or equal to `l` and not already in `marks`.

After the execution of the code, the value `i + j` is calculated and then appended to `additional_marks`. The other variables retain their previous states.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `marks` is a list containing at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element of `marks`, `additional_marks` now includes the value `i + j`, and `j` is the next element in `additional_marks` that has not yet been processed, `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and not already in `marks`.**
