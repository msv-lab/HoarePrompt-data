The variable `need_x` is assigned the value `True`. This does not affect the other variables (`n`, `i`, `j`, or `marks`). Therefore, the Output State remains focused on the changes made to `need_x`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `marks` is an array with at least `n` elements, `need_x` is True**
