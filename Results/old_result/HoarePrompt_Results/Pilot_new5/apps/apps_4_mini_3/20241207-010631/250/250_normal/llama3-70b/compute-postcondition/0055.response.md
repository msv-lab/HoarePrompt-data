The variable `need_x` is assigned the value `True`, which remains the same as it already was. The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `j`, and `need_y`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 5, `i` is 2, `j` is 5, `need_x` is True, and `need_y` is True.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 5, `i` is 2, `j` is 5, `need_x` is True, and `need_y` is True.**
