The execution of the `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but terminates the most immediate loop or conditional structure in which it resides. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged, and the state reflects that the execution has exited a loop or condition.

Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers; `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`; `a` is a strictly increasing list of `n` integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`; `marks` contains at least 2 elements; the most internal loop or if statement has been exited.**
