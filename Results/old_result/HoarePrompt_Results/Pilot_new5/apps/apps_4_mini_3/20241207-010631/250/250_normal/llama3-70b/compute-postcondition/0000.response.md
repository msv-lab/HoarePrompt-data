The values of `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are assigned from the input, which consists of four integers. The specific values of these integers will depend on the input provided during the execution. However, all the other variables such as `a` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are now the input integers.

Output State: **`n` is the input positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l` is the input positive integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is the input positive integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is the input positive integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), and `a` is a list of n integers (0 = a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] = l).**
