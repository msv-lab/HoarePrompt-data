Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers; `marks` contains at least `n` elements; `marks_set` is a set of unique integers derived from `marks`; if `y_found` is False, `new_marks` is empty, and `result` contains the value of `x` plus `y`, while the current value of `x_found` remains set to False.***
