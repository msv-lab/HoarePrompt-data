Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and `marks` is an array with at least `n` elements. The difference between the elements at indices `j` and `i` in the `marks` array is equal to `y`. The current value of `marks[j] - marks[i]` is equal to `y`, and `need_x` is set to True.***
