According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and `n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). Since `j` is currently 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, resulting in `j` becoming 3. Therefore, `j` must be less than `n`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer in the range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `i` is 1, `j` is 3, and `marks` is an array with at least `n` elements.**
