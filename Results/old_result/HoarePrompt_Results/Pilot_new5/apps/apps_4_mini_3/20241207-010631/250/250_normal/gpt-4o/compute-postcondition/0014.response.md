Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `a` is a strictly increasing list of `n` integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`, `marks` contains at least 1 element, and if both `x_found` and `y_found` are True, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, leaving all other states unchanged.***
