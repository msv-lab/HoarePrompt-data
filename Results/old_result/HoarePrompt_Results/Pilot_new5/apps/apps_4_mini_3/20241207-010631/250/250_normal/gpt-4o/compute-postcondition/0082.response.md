The code `result.append(x)` adds the current value of `x` to the list `result`. Since `result` was initially an empty list, it will now contain the value of `x`. The other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers; `marks` contains at least `n` elements; `marks_set` is a set of unique integers derived from `marks`; if `y_found` is False, `new_marks` is empty; if `y_found` is True, `new_marks` remains unchanged and contains elements only from previous iterations if any were added; `result` contains the value of `x`; the current value of `x_found` is False.**
