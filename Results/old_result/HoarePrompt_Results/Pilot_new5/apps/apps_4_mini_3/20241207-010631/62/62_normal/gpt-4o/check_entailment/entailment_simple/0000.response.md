Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the first line to obtain `n` (the number of digits) and `base_x` (the base of number X). It subsequently reads the digits of X. It does the same for the number Y, reading `m` and `base_y`, followed by the digits of Y.

2. **Base Conversion**: The function `func_1` is designed to convert a number from a given base to decimal. It iterates through the list of digits and constructs the decimal value by multiplying the current value of `decimal_value` by the base and adding the current digit. This is the correct method for converting a number from a given base to its decimal representation.

3. **Comparison Logic**: After converting both numbers X and Y to their decimal representations (`decimal_x` and `decimal_y`), the program compares these values. Depending on the comparison, it prints '<', '>', or '=' as required by the problem description.

4. **Range Validations**: The program correctly respects the constraints given, such as ensuring that the bases are within the specified limits (2 to 40), and that the digits fall within the valid range for their respective bases (0 to base - 1).

5. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program does not assume any leading zeros as per the problem description. It also correctly handles the case where X and Y have different numbers of digits, as the conversion to decimal will handle these differences appropriately.

Overall, the implementation adheres to the problem requirements and accurately performs the necessary operations to determine the relationship between the numbers X and Y based on their respective bases. Thus, the program is deemed correct.
