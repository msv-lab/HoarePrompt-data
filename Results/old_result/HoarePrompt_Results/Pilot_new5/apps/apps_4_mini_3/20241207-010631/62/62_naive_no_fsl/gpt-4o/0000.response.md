Correctness: **False**

The program has a significant flaw when it comes to handling bases greater than 10. Specifically, the function `func_1` assumes that the digits provided can be treated as integers without validating their range against the specified base. For example, in base 16, valid digits are 0-15, and in base 36, valid digits are 0-35. If the input contains a digit that is equal to or greater than the base, the program will incorrectly attempt to process it without throwing an error, leading to invalid conversions.

Example case where the program fails:
If we provide the following input:
```
3 16
15 16 0
3 10
2 0 9
```
In this case, the second digit of X (16) is invalid in base 16, but the program will not handle this and will produce an incorrect result since it does not check that each digit is less than the base. Thus, the behavior of the program is undefined for invalid digit inputs, demonstrating its incorrectness.
