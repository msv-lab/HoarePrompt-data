Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the possibility of invalid digits for the given bases as specified in the problem description. According to the problem, each digit `x_i` for number X must be in the range `[0, b_x)` and each digit `y_i` for number Y must be in the range `[0, b_y)`. 

The provided function `func_1` computes the integer value represented by the digits in the given base, but it does not check if any digits are out of the valid range for their respective bases. If there are any invalid digits (e.g., a digit that is equal to or greater than the base), the function would still compute a result, which would lead to incorrect comparisons between the two numbers.

For instance, if `b_x = 5` and the input for X contains a digit `5`, the program will not raise any error, but this is invalid because digits should be less than the base. Similarly, if `b_y = 10` and the input for Y contains a digit `10`, it would also be invalid.

Consequently, since the program can yield incorrect results when invalid digit values are provided, it does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description for all possible inputs. Thus, the program is incorrect.
