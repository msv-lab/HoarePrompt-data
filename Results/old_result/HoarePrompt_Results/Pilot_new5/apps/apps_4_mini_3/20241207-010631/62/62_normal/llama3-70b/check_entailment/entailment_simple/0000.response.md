Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements from the problem description. Here's an explanation of why it meets the specifications:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input correctly as specified. It captures the number of digits and the base for both numbers X and Y, along with their respective digits as lists of integers.

2. **Conversion Function**: The function `func_1` takes a list of digits and a base as inputs and correctly converts the number from its base representation to a decimal (base 10) integer. It iteratively computes the decimal value by multiplying the accumulated result by the base and adding the current digit.

3. **Comparison Logic**: After converting both numbers X and Y to their decimal representations, the program compares them using standard comparison operators. It outputs '<', '>', or '=' based on whether X is less than, greater than, or equal to Y.

4. **Constraints Handling**: The program adheres to the constraints provided in the problem description, such as the range of bases (2 ≤ base ≤ 40) and the digit boundaries (0 ≤ digit < base). The use of a loop to process digits ensures that leading zeroes are handled appropriately since there are no leading zeroes according to the problem statement.

5. **Output Format**: The output format matches the requirements, printing a single character as specified.

In summary, the program correctly implements the logic needed to compare two numbers represented in different bases according to the described problem, ensuring that all specified conditions and constraints are satisfied. Therefore, it is a correct implementation.
