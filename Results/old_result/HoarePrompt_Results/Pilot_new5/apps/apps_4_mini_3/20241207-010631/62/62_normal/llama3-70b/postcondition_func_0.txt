The function accepts a list of integers `digits`, representing the digits of a number in a specified base, and an integer `base` (where 2 ≤ base ≤ 40). It computes and returns the integer value represented by the `digits` in the given base. The function does not handle cases where any digit is outside the valid range for the specified base, which could lead to incorrect results if such digits are present.
