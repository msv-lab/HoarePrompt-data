The code `exit()` is called, which terminates the program execution. The values of the variables `n`, `a`, `b`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged because the exit command does not modify any variable states. Therefore, the output state reflects the same values as before the command execution.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is between 1 and 10,000,000, `x` is `n // a + 1`, `y` is `(n - (n // a + 1) * a) // b`**
