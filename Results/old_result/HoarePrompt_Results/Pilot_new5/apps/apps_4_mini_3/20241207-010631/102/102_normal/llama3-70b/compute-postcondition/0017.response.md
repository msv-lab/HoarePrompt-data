The value of `x` is computed as `n // a + 1`. Using this value for `x`, the code computes `y` as `(n - x * a) // b`. 

Since `n` is a non-negative integer and `a` is a positive integer, `x` will always be at least 1. Therefore, `n - x * a` is non-negative because `x * a` is at most `n` when `n` is sufficiently larger than `a`. 

The value of `b` being between 1 and 10,000,000 ensures that the division by `b` yields an integer result.

After executing the code, the updated states of the variables will be as follows:
- `x` remains unchanged in the output state as it was calculated earlier, so `x` is still `n // a + 1`.
- `y` is now defined as `(n - (n // a + 1) * a) // b`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is between 1 and 10,000,000, `x` is `n // a + 1`, `y` is `(n - (n // a + 1) * a) // b`.**
