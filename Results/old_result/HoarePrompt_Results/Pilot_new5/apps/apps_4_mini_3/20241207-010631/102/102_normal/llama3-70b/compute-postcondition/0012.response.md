The code snippet only contains a print statement, which does not affect any variables. The existing values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the initial conditions with no modifications.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is between 1 and 10,000,000, `x` is equal to `n // a + 1`, `y` is equal to `(n - (n // a + 1) * a) // b`**
