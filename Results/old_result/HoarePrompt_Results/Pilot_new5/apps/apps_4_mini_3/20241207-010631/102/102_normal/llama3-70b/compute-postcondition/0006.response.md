The code executes a `print` statement, which outputs the string `'YES'`. The values of the variables `n`, `a`, `b`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged because the code does not modify any of them. Therefore, the Output State retains the original conditions of the variables.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is between 1 and 10,000,000, and `y` is calculated as (n - x * a) // b. The statement 'YES' has been printed.**
