To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the implementation.

### Problem Description Recap:
Vasya has `n` burles, and he wants to find two non-negative integers `x` (bottles of Ber-Cola) and `y` (Bars bars) such that:
- \( x \cdot a + y \cdot b = n \)
If such a combination exists, the program should print "YES" followed by the values of `x` and `y`. If not, it should print "NO".

### Program Analysis:
The function `func()` reads inputs `n`, `a`, and `b`, then iterates over possible values of `x` (from 0 up to \( n // a \)). For each `x`, it calculates `y` using the formula:
\[ y = \frac{(n - x \cdot a)}{b} \]

The logic checks if the total \( x \cdot a + y \cdot b \) equals `n`. If a valid pair `(x, y)` is found, it prints "YES" and the values; if no pair is found after all iterations, it prints "NO".

### Potential Issue:
1. **Integer Division**: The program uses integer division to calculate `y`, but it doesn't check if `y` is a non-negative integer. Specifically, if \( n - x \cdot a \) is negative, the program will not handle that correctly, as it would yield negative `y` values.
2. **Looping Condition**: The loop only considers values of `x` up to \( n // a \), which is correct but doesn't ensure a proper check for all combinations of non-negative integers `x` and `y` that satisfy the equation.

### Test Case:
Consider the case:
- Input: 
```
3
5
2
```
- Here, \( n = 3 \), \( a = 5 \), and \( b = 2 \).
- The program will iterate through `x` values:
    - For `x = 0`: \( y = (3 - 0 \cdot 5) // 2 = 1 \), which works as \( 0 \cdot 5 + 1 \cdot 2 = 2 \) (but should equal 3).
    - For `x = 1`: \( y = (3 - 1 \cdot 5) // 2 = -1 \), which is not valid.

In this case, the code incorrectly suggests that it's impossible to spend exactly `3` burles when, in fact, Vasya cannot buy any combinations that work.

### Conclusion:
The program does not account for all potential combinations of `x` and `y` correctly. Therefore, it can result in incorrect outputs for cases where the required conditions are not met due to the failure to handle certain edge cases.

Correctness: **False**.
