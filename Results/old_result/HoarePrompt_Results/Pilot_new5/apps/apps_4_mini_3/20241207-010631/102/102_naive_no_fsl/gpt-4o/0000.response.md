Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Vasya can spend exactly `n` burles on bottles of Ber-Cola and Bars bars. It checks for all possible non-negative integer values of `x` (the number of Ber-Cola bottles) within the constraint that `x` should not exceed `n // a`. For each chosen `x`, it calculates the remaining money after purchasing `x` bottles and checks if that can be equally divided by the cost of a Bars bar `b`. 

If a valid pair `(x, y)` is found, it prints "YES" followed by the values of `x` and `y`. If no such pairs are found after checking all possibilities, it prints "NO".

The program correctly handles:
- The case when no Bars bars can be bought (e.g., if `n` is exactly a multiple of `a`).
- The case when all money can be spent on Bars bars (e.g., if `n` is exactly a multiple of `b`).
- The case when it is impossible to reach exactly `n` with the given costs.

Given the constraints on `n`, `a`, and `b`, the loop iterates a manageable number of times, at most `n // a + 1`, which will not exceed the limits of the program, making it efficient and effective.

Thus, the program works correctly for all potential cases outlined in the problem description.
