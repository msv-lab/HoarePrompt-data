The code `print(x, y)` outputs the current values of `x` and `y` without modifying them. The previous values of the affected variables are as follows:

- `x` is equal to `n // a + 1`
- `y` is equal to `(n - (n // a + 1) * a) // b`

The output state will reflect the unchanged variables and include the values of `x` and `y` based on their definitions.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is between 1 and 10,000,000, `x` is equal to `n // a + 1`, `y` is equal to `(n - (n // a + 1) * a) // b`**.
