The code `print(x, y)` outputs the current values of the variables `x` and `y`. 

From the initial state, we know:
- `x` is 0
- `y` is equal to `n // b` where `n` is a non-negative integer and `b` is not defined in the initial state.

Since the values of `x` and `y` do not change through the execution of this code snippet, and `y` depends on the value of `n // b`, we cannot specify an exact value for `y` without knowing `b`. Therefore, the output will reflect the known values of `x` and the dependency of `y` on the variables.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 10,000,000, `x` is 0, and `y` is equal to `n // b; print outputs (0, y).**
