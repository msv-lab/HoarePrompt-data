The `print('YES')` statement outputs the string 'YES' to the console. This action does not modify any of the existing variables, and all the previous conditions regarding the variables remain valid. Therefore, the output state reflects that the output has occurred but does not change any variable values.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 10,000,000, `x` is 1, `y` is equal to `(n - a) // b`, and 'YES' is printed to the console.**
