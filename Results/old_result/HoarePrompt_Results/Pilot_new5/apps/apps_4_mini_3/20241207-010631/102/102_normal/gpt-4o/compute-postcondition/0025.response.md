Functionality: ** The function accepts three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`, and checks if it is possible to express `n` as a sum of multiples of `a` and `b`. If such a combination exists, it prints 'YES' followed by the respective counts of `a` and `b` (denoted as `x` and `y`). If no valid combination is found after checking all possibilities, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any values. **
