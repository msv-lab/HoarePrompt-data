Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description. Hereâ€™s why it meets the criteria:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`, which represent the total money Vasya has and the costs of the Ber-Cola and Bars bar, respectively. This aligns with the problem description where `n`, `a`, and `b` are expected as input.

2. **Logic for Finding Combinations**: The program uses a loop to iterate through all possible counts of Ber-Cola bottles (`x`). For each `x`, it checks if the remaining money (after spending on `x` bottles) can be exactly spent on Bars bars (`y`). This is done by checking the condition `(n - x * a) % b == 0`, which ensures that the remaining amount can be divided evenly by the price of a Bars bar. Thus, for each valid `x`, it computes a corresponding `y`, which is non-negative due to the construction of the loop.

3. **Output**: If a valid combination `(x, y)` is found, it prints "YES" followed by the values of `x` and `y`. If the loop completes without finding a valid combination, it prints "NO", indicating that it is impossible to spend exactly `n` burles on the items. This matches the requirement of the problem description.

4. **Range of Values**: The loop iterates from `0` to `n // a`, ensuring that `x` will always be within the bounds, as stated in the problem.

5. **All Cases Covered**: The program handles all cases, including when both `x` and `y` can be zero or when multiple valid combinations exist, since it outputs any valid pair.

Overall, the implementation correctly follows the logic needed to solve the problem as outlined in the description and handles all required conditions efficiently.
