The code prints the values of `x` and `y`. The value of `x` is known to be 2. However, since `y` cannot be computed without a defined value for `b`, its state remains undefined. The print statement does not alter the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state retains all previous information, reflecting the unchanged status of `n`, `a`, and `y`, while providing the value of `x`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 10,000,000, `x` is 2, `y` cannot be computed without a defined value for `b`, and 'YES' is printed; printed values are 2 and undefined for `y`.**
