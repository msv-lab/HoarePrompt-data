Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting of '0' and '1' characters and returns the sum of \( q^i \) for all indices `i` where the corresponding character in `s` is '1', with \( q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \). The function correctly calculates the sum based on the positions of '1's but does not handle cases where the string contains invalid characters or is empty, as it assumes that `s` is always valid and non-empty. **
