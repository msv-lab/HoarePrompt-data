#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters, and the length of s does not exceed 100,000.
def func_1(s):
    q = (math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2
    decimal = 0
    for (i, c) in enumerate(reversed(s)):
        decimal += int(c) * q ** i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters, `q` is equal to (math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2, `decimal` is equal to the sum of `q^i` for all indices `i` where the corresponding character in `s` is '1'.
    return decimal
    #The program returns the sum of q^i for all indices i where the corresponding character in s is '1', where q is equal to (math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting of '0' and '1' characters and returns the sum of \( q^i \) for all indices `i` where the corresponding character in `s` is '1', with \( q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \). The function correctly calculates the sum based on the positions of '1's but does not handle cases where the string contains invalid characters or is empty, as it assumes that `s` is always valid and non-empty.
