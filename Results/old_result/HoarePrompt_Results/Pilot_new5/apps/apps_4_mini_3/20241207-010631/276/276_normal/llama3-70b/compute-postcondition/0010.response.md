The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters, and the length of `s` does not exceed 100,000. After executing the function body, it returns the sum of \( q^i \) for all indices \( i \) where the corresponding character in `s` is '1', with \( q \) being equal to \( \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-empty string `s` of '0's and '1's and return the calculated sum of powers of \( q \) for the indices where `s` contains '1'.
