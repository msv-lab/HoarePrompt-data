Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case of leading zeros correctly. In the golden system, the input strings can have leading zeros, which do not affect the value of the number. However, the function `func_1` does not account for this and will treat leading zeros as significant digits. For example, consider the input:

```
00001
1
```

In the golden system, both inputs represent the same decimal value, which should result in an output of "=". However, the program will treat `00001` as a valid number and compute its value, which will yield a different result compared to `1`, leading to an incorrect comparison. Thus, the program is incorrect and does not satisfy the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
