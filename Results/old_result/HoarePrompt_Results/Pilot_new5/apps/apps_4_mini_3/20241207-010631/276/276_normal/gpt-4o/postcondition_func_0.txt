The function accepts a tuple `s` containing two non-empty binary strings. It calculates a weighted sum of the digits in the first string using the golden ratio (approximately 1.618) raised to the power of the position of each '1' in the string, counting from the right (with the rightmost position being 0). The function returns this computed value. Note that while `s` is expected to be a tuple containing two strings, only the first string is used in the calculation, and the function does not handle edge cases if the strings contain characters other than '0' and '1'.
