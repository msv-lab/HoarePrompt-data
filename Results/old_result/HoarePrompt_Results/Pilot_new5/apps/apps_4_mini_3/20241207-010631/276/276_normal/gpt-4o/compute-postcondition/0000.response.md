The variable `q` is assigned the value of the expression `(5 ** 0.5 + 1) / 2`. This calculation involves computing the square root of `5`, adding `1` to it, and then dividing by `2`. The variable `s` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. 

The calculation results in a specific numerical value for `q`. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged state of `s` and the updated value of `q`.

Output State: **`s` is a tuple containing two non-empty strings, each consisting of '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string does not exceed 100000; `q` is approximately 1.618033988749895**.
