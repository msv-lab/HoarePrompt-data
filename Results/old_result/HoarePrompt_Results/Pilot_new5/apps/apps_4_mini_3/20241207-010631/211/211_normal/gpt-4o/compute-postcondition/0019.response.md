The code executes a print statement that outputs the string '1' followed by the value of `i + 1`. Here, `i` is initialized to 1, so `i + 1` equals 2. The print statement does not modify any variables; it only outputs the specified values. The previous values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) that must be greater than 1, `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is equal to 0, `i` is 1, "YES" has been printed, and '2' has been printed; the output is '1 2'.**
