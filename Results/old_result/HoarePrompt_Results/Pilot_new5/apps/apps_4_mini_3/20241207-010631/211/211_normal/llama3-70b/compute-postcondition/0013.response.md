The code executes a print statement, which outputs 'YES' to the console. The values of the variables are not changed in this case, and the only effect is the output of text. Therefore, the output state remains the same regarding the variables.

Output State: **`prefix_sum` is equal to a list where `prefix_sum[i]` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `A`, for `i` from 0 to `n`, `A` is a list of `n` integers, `n` is between 1 and 100. The sum of all elements in `A` is not equal to 0, and 'YES' is printed.**
