The code snippet `print('1', i + 1)` prints the value '1' followed by the result of `i + 1`. The value of `i` is currently 2, so `i + 1` evaluates to 3. The printed output does not change any variables, but it does produce output. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) that must be greater than 2, `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is equal to 0, `i` is 2, the value 2 has been printed, and '1 3' has been printed as output.**
