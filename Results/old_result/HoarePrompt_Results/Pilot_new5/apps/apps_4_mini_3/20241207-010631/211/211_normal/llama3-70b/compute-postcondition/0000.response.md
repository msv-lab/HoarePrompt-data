The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` must still satisfy the condition 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 after this assignment. The list `A` remains unchanged since no operations are performed on it in this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `A` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range of -1000 to 1000, and `n` is an input integer.**
