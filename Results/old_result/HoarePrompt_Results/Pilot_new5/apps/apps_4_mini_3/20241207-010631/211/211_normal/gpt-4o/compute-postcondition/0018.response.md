The code snippet `print('2')` outputs the string '2' but does not modify any variable values. The state of all the variables remains unchanged, and "YES" has already been printed prior to this code. The output from the print statement does not affect the values of `n`, `A`, `total_sum`, or `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) that must be greater than 1, `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is equal to 0, `i` is 1, "YES" has been printed, and '2' has been printed.**
