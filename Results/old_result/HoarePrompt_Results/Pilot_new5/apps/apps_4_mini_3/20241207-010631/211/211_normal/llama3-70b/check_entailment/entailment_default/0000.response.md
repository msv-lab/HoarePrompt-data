To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, we first need to analyze the problem description and the program's implementation.

**Problem Description:**
The task is to split an array \( A \) into multiple subarrays such that the sum of elements in each subarray is not zero. If it's impossible to do so, we should output "NO". Otherwise, we should output "YES" along with the details of how the array can be split.

**Program Analysis:**
1. The program reads an integer \( n \) (the size of the array) and the array \( A \).
2. It computes the prefix sum of the array.
3. If the total sum of the array (the last value in prefix sum) is zero, it prints "NO" because it cannot be split into non-zero sum subarrays.
4. If the total sum is non-zero, it prints "YES" and attempts to identify non-zero sum subarrays by checking the prefix sums. It prints the ranges of the split subarrays.

**Edge Cases to Consider:**
- If the array consists of only zeros (e.g., input: `1\n0`), the output should be "NO", which the program handles correctly.
- If the total sum of the array is non-zero but the entire array could still be split into segments whose sums are zero (e.g., multiple zeros or a situation where the prefix sums can lead to segments that sum up to zero), the current implementation does not adequately check for this scenario.

**Output Hints Analysis:**
- The output hints state that the function checks the prefix sums and ensures that identified segments do not sum to zero.
- The hint indicates that the code only considers splits where prefix sums are not zero and not equal to the total sum.

**Conclusion:**
The program correctly handles the primary case of checking if the total sum is zero, but it fails to correctly identify and manage cases where multiple segments can sum to zero despite the total being non-zero. Therefore, the logic for creating valid subarrays is flawed as it might incorrectly identify segments that result in zero sums.

Correctness: **False**.

**Example of Failure:**
For an array like `[1, -1, 2, -2]`, the total sum is `0`, but the individual segments can be adjusted to result in non-zero sums. The program would incorrectly determine that it cannot split when, in fact, it can form valid segments.
