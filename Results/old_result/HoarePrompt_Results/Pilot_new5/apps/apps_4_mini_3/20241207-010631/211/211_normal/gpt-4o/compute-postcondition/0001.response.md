The variable `A` is assigned the value obtained from `list(map(int, input().split()))`, which takes an input of `n` integers and converts them into a list of integers. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is defined as an input integer in the range (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). Therefore, the list `A` will contain exactly `n` integers, each satisfying the condition -10^3 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^3.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `A` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies -10^3 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^3**.
