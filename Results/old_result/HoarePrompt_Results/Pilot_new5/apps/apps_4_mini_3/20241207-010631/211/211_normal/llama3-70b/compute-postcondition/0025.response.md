The variable `l` is assigned the value of `r`, which is 2. The other variables remain unchanged in their previous state. Thus, the output state is updated accordingly.

Output State: **`prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[i]` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `A` for `i` from 0 to `n`, `A` is a list of `n` integers, where `n` is between 1 and 100, the sum of all elements in `A` is not equal to 0, `k` is 3, `l` is 2, `r` is 2; the values 2, 1, and 2 have been printed.**
