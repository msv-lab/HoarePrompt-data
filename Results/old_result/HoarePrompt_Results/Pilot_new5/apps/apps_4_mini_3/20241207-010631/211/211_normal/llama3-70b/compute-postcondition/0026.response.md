Postcondition: ***`prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[i]` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `A` for `i` from 0 to `n`, `A` is a list of `n` integers where `n` is between 1 and 100, and the sum of all elements in `A` is not equal to 0. If `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to 0 and `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, then `k` is updated to 3, `l` is updated to 2, and `r` remains 2; the values 2, 1, and 2 have been printed.***
