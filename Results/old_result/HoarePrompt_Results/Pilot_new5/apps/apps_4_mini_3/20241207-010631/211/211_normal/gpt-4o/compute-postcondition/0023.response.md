According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. To execute the loop one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 2, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) that must be greater than 2, `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is equal to 0, and `i` is 2**
