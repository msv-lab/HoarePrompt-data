Output State: **`prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[i]` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `A` for `i` from 0 to `n`, `A` is a list of `n` integers where `n` is between 1 and 100, and the sum of all elements in `A` is not equal to 0. If `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to 0 and is not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, then `k` is equal to the number of valid `r` values that satisfy the condition, `l` is equal to the last valid `r`, and `r` will be equal to `n` after the loop finishes executing. If no `r` satisfies the condition, `k` remains 1, `l` remains 1, and `r` will be `n`.**
