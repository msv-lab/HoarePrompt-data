The code snippet `print('2')` outputs the string '2' but does not modify any variables. Therefore, the values of the affected variables remain unchanged, while the state of the program acknowledges that 'YES' has been printed earlier in the execution. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is equal to 0, `i` is 0, the first element of `A` (A[0]) is not 0, and 'YES' has been printed.**
