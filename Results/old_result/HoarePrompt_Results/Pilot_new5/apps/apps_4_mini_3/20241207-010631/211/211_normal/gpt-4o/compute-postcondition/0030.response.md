Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is equal to 0. If at least one element of `A` is not 0, then 'YES' has been printed, followed by '2', '1', and the index of the non-zero element plus one, along with the range from the next index to `n`. If all elements of `A` are 0, then 'NO' has been printed.**
