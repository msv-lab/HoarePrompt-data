The code snippet simply prints 'YES' to the output, which does not affect the values of any variables. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) that must be greater than 2, `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is equal to 0, and `i` is 2.**
