The value of `n` is reassigned to the value of `int(input())`, which means it will take an input that is converted to an integer. The previous condition that `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) still holds, but now it will depend on the input provided during execution. The output state reflects that `n` will now be an input integer.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), A is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies -10^3 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^3.**
