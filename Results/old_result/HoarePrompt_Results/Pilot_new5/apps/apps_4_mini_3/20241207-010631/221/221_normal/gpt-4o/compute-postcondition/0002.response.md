The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the constraints provided, the function seems to assume two external inputs: `s` and `x`. 

- `s` is a positive integer constrained to the range 2 ≤ s ≤ 10^12. 
- `x` is a non-negative integer constrained to the range 0 ≤ x ≤ 10^12.

Since the output behavior is not specified in the prompt, we focus on the input parameters. 

Functionality: **The function assumes two external parameters: `s`, a positive integer between 2 and 10^12, and `x`, a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^12.**
