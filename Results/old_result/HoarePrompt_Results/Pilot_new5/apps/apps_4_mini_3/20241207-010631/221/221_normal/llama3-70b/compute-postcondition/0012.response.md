The value of `b` is reassigned to `s - a`. The previous value of `b` was equal to `s - 2`, and now it becomes `s - 3`. Since `s` is a positive integer between 2 and \(10^{12}\), the new value of `b` will remain a positive integer in the range of 0 to \(10^{12}\). Therefore, the output state updates the value of `b` while keeping other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a positive integer between 2 and \(10^{12}\), `x` is a non-negative integer between 0 and \(10^{12}\), `a` is 3, `b` is equal to `s - 3` which is a positive integer between -1 and \(10^{12}\)**.
