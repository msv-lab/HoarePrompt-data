The function accepts two integers, `s` (a positive integer between 2 and 10^12) and `x` (a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^12), and counts the number of pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 <= a < s`, `b = s - a`, and `a XOR b = x`. It then prints the count of such pairs. If `s` is less than or equal to 1, the count remains 0 since the loop does not execute.
