Postcondition: ***`s` is a positive integer between 2 and \(10^{12}\), `x` is a non-negative integer between 0 and \(10^{12}\), `a` is 2, and `b` is equal to `s - 2` which is a positive integer between 0 and \(10^{12}\). If `2 ^ (s - 2) == x`, then `count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `count` remains unchanged.***
