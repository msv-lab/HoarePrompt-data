To verify the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze both the logic of the program and how it adheres to the problem's requirements.

### Problem Requirements:

1. We are given a matrix A filled with integers in a specific order.
2. We must determine if we can find values for x (number of rows) and y (number of columns) such that traversal through a sequence of visited cells (given as a list) is valid.
3. Valid movements are only to adjacent cells.
4. If the conditions are met, we need to output "YES" and the values of x and y, otherwise "NO".

### Program Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers which represent the visited cells.
   
2. **Matrix Size Search**:
   - It searches for possible values of `x` and `y` in a nested loop within the range from 1 to 1,000,000.
   - It checks if `x * y` exceeds the maximum value in `a`, which is a necessary condition.

3. **Coordinate Calculation**:
   - The program calls `func_1(x, y)`, which checks if the Manhattan distance condition is met for each consecutive integer in `a`.
   - The coordinates `nx` and `ny` are calculated based on the current integer `v` from the array.

4. **Movement Validation**:
   - The function verifies that the current position differs from the previous position by exactly 1 in the Manhattan distance, ensuring that the moves are valid.

5. **Output**:
   - If a valid configuration is found, it prints "YES" with the values; otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Correctness Check:

The function should correctly validate the path by ensuring the following:

- Each number in `a` corresponds to a valid cell in the matrix with dimensions `x` and `y`.
- The program checks all potential configurations of `x` and `y` to find a valid match.
- The movement conditions are strictly adhered to, ensuring all movements are adjacent.

### Potential Issues:

- The range for `x` and `y` might be limited to 1,000,000, but this is fine since it covers a significant portion within the constraints provided by the problem.
- The function `func_1` directly accesses the list `a` without it being a parameter. While this might seem like a design flaw, it still functions correctly given the context.

### Conclusion:

The annotated program looks to be correctly implementing the logic required by the problem description. It efficiently checks for valid configurations of matrix dimensions and verifies that the path respects the adjacency rules.

Thus, we conclude that the program meets the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
