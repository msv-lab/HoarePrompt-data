Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly verify the possibility of constructing a matrix that allows the given moves in all cases. A key issue lies in the method used to determine the dimensions \(x\) and \(y\) of the matrix. 

Specifically, the current logic iterates through pairs of \(x\) and \(y\) values while checking if the maximum value in the path is less than or equal to \(x \times y\). However, this does not guarantee that the moves defined by the path can actually be executed in the constructed matrix. 

For example, the input:
```
4
1 2 3 6
```
This input should output "NO", as there is no valid matrix configuration that allows movement from 1 to 2, 2 to 3, and then to 6 without breaking the adjacency rule. However, the current implementation may incorrectly state "YES" and provide dimensions based on the multiplication condition alone.

Moreover, the function `func_1` checks the movement logic after determining possible dimensions, but there's a flaw in determining \(nx\) and \(ny\) when calculating the next position. If \(y\) is too small to accommodate certain sequences of moves, the checks will not sufficiently capture the valid configurations based on the path.

Thus, the program fails to account for all potential cases, leading to incorrect results.
