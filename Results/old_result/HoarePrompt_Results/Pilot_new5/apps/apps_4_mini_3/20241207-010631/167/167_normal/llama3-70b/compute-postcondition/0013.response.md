To analyze the code snippet, let's break it down step by step based on the given initial state.

Initial State:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000 and must be at least 3.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers containing at least 3 elements.
- `v` is the third element of the list `a`, meaning `v = a[2]`.
- `px` is assigned the value of `nx`.
- `py` is assigned the value of `ny`.

Now, the code to execute:
```
nx, ny = (v - 1) // y, (v - 1) % y
```

### Step-by-step Impact:
1. The values of `nx` and `ny` are computed using `v`.
2. `v` is already defined as the third element of the list `a`.
3. The calculations for `nx` and `ny` depend on the variable `y`.
   - `nx` is calculated as `(v - 1) // y`, which will be some integer division result.
   - `ny` is calculated as `(v - 1) % y`, which will be the remainder of the division.
4. The values of `px` and `py` remain unchanged as they are not modified by this line of code.

### Final Output State:
Since `nx` and `ny` are newly computed values based on `v` and `y`, we need to specify their relationship to `v`. However, we do not have the initial value of `y`, which affects the exact numeric values of `nx` and `ny`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000 and must be at least 3, `a` is a list of `n` integers containing at least 3 elements, `v` is the third element of the list `a`, `px` is assigned the value of `nx`, `py` is assigned the value of `ny`, `nx` is calculated as `(v - 1) // y`, `ny` is calculated as `(v - 1) % y`**.
