The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `s`. 

- `n` is a positive integer that represents the number of balloons.
- `k` is a positive integer that represents the number of friends, with the constraint that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 100.
- `s` is a string of length `n` composed of lowercase letters from the Latin alphabet, representing the colors of the balloons.

The output of the function is determined by the following cases:

- Case_1: If the number of unique colors of balloons in `s` is less than or equal to `k`, the function returns the number of unique colors.
- Case_2: If the number of unique colors in `s` exceeds `k`, the function returns `k`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept the parameters `n` (number of balloons), `k` (number of friends), and `s` (string of balloon colors), and return the number of unique colors of balloons limited by the number of friends.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (a positive integer representing the number of balloons), k (a positive integer representing the number of friends), and s (a string of balloon colors). It returns the number of unique colors of balloons, capped at k.**
