To determine the correctness of the provided program with respect to the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step and see if it meets the requirements specified.

### Problem Requirements:
1. The function must take two integers, `n` (number of kegs) and `s` (liters of kvass to pour).
2. It must take a list of integers representing the volume of kvass in each keg.
3. If it's impossible to pour `s` liters (i.e., the total kvass in all kegs is less than `s`), it should return `-1`.
4. If it is possible to pour `s` liters, it should calculate how much kvass can remain in the least filled keg and return that value.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads `n` and `s`, as well as the list of keg volumes.
   
2. **Total Volume Check**:
   - The program calculates the total volume of kvass using `sum(volumes)`. If this total is less than `s`, it prints `-1`, which is correct.

3. **Finding the Minimum Keg Volume**:
   - The program sorts the volumes and initializes `min_keg_volume` to the volume of the least filled keg.
   - It uses a loop to iterate through the volumes and attempts to take kvass from each keg while ensuring it does not reduce the `min_keg_volume` below its current value.

4. **Adjusting the Minimum Keg Volume**:
   - The program checks if there's any remaining kvass needed after attempting to take from the kegs. If thereâ€™s remaining kvass (`remaining_kvass > 0`), it reduces `min_keg_volume` based on how much kvass could potentially be taken away from the remaining kegs uniformly.

5. **Final Output**:
   - Finally, it prints the adjusted `min_keg_volume`.

### Correctness Evaluation:
- The program correctly identifies when it's not possible to pour `s` liters and returns `-1`.
- It correctly calculates the amount of kvass that can remain in the least filled keg after pouring `s` liters, ensuring it doesn't go below that level while pouring from other kegs.
- The use of `(remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n` effectively distributes the remaining kvass uniformly across the `n` kegs, which is appropriate for determining how low the `min_keg_volume` can go.

### Conclusion:
The program adheres to all the requirements set forth in the problem statement. For every potential case defined by the problem description, it operates correctly.

Thus, we conclude:

Correctness: **True**
