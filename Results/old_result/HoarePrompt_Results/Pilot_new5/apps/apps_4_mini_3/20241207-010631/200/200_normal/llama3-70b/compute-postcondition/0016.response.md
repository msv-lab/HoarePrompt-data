The value of `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. The previous value of `mid` is `(high + 1) // 2`, and since `high` is at least 2, the value of `mid` would be at least 2 as well. Thus, the updated value of `high` will be less than the previous value of `mid`. The states of the other variables (`v`, `s`, `low`, `total`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`v` is a sorted list of `n` integers greater than 0, `s` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ s ≤ 10^12), `low` is 0, `high` is `mid - 1`, `mid` is (high + 1) // 2, `total` is the sum of min(mid, x) for each x in v.**
