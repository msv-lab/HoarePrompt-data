Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer in the range [1, 1000]; `s` is a positive integer in the range [1, 10^12]; `v` is a list of integers representing the keg volumes; `volumes` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order; `total_volume` is the sum of `volumes` and is greater than or equal to `s`; `min_keg_volume` is equal to `volumes[0]`; `i` is equal to `n`. If `volumes[i]` is less than or equal to `min_keg_volume`, the loop continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, `possible_to_take` is equal to min(`volumes[n] - volumes[0]`, `remaining_kvass`), and `remaining_kvass` is updated to `remaining_kvass - possible_to_take`.***
