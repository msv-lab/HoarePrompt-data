The `total_volume` variable is assigned the value of the sum of the elements in the `volumes` list. The values of `n`, `s`, and `volumes` remain unchanged, but `total_volume` is now defined. The `volumes` list is already sorted as stated in the initial conditions.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer equal to the input value in the range [1, 1000]; `s` is a positive integer equal to the input value in the range [1, 10^12]; `v` is now a list of integers equal to the input values representing the volumes of the kegs; `volumes` is now a sorted list of integers in ascending order; `total_volume` is the sum of the elements in `volumes`.**
