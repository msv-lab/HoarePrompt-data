To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires that we determine how much kvass can remain in the least keg after pouring `s` liters from `n` kegs. If pouring `s` liters isn't possible (i.e., the total volume of kvass in all kegs is less than `s`), we should output `-1`.

### Code Analysis
1. **Input Reading**: The program reads `n` (number of kegs) and `s` (liters to pour), followed by the volumes in each keg.
2. **Total Volume Check**: It calculates the total volume of kvass. If the total is less than `s`, it correctly prints `-1`.
3. **Finding Minimum Keg Volume After Pouring**:
   - It sorts the keg volumes.
   - It attempts to pour from each keg, taking care not to lower the minimum keg volume too much.
   - It calculates how much kvass can be taken from each keg while trying to keep the lowest keg as full as possible.

### Potential Issues
Now, let's identify any potential issues or edge cases that the current implementation may not handle correctly:

1. **Case with Equal Volumes**: If all kegs have the same volume and `s` is a multiple of `n`, the way remaining kvass is calculated might lead to incorrect results. For instance:
    - **Example**: 
        - Input: `3 3` 
        - Volumes: `3 3 3` 
        - Expected Output: `3`
        - Actual Output: `3` (correct)
    - But if `s` was `6`:
        - Input: `3 6` 
        - Volumes: `3 3 3` 
        - Expected Output: `0` (since pouring 6 liters from three kegs of 3 should leave them empty)
        - Actual Output: The program would incorrectly compute the minimum keg volume since it attempts to calculate it based on remaining kvass spread across kegs that can't actually reach zero.

2. **Large `s` Value**: If `s` is a very large number relative to keg volumes, the output may be affected since it might wrongly decrement minimum keg volume assuming some kvass can still be taken when it cannot.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis above, the program does not correctly handle scenarios where the minimum keg volume becomes zero after pouring or when `s` is larger than the sum of the kegs. 

Thus, there exist cases where the program's logic fails to produce the correct output.

Correctness: **False**
