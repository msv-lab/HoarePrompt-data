Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer in the range [1, 1000]; `s` is a positive integer in the range [1, 10^12]; `v` is a list of integers representing the keg volumes; `volumes` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order; `total_volume` is the sum of `volumes` and is greater than or equal to `s`; `min_keg_volume` is equal to `volumes[0]`; `remaining_kvass` is equal to `s`. If `volumes[i]` is less than or equal to `min_keg_volume`, the loop proceeds to the next iteration. Otherwise, `remaining_kvass` is updated to `s - possible_to_take`, where `possible_to_take` is calculated as `min(volumes[i] - min_keg_volume, s)`.***
