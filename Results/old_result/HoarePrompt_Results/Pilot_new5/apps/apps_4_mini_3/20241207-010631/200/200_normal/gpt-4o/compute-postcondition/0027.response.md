The `continue` statement does not change any values of the variables in the current state; it simply skips the remaining code in the current iteration of a loop or construct and progresses to the next iteration of the loop. The values of all the variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer in the range [1, 1000]; `s` is a positive integer in the range [1, 10^12]; `v` is a list of integers representing the keg volumes; `volumes` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order; `total_volume` is the sum of `volumes` and is greater than or equal to `s`; `min_keg_volume` is equal to `volumes[0]`; `i` is equal to `n` and the loop continues to the next iteration.**
