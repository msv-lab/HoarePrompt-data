In the provided code, `n` and `s` are assigned new values from the input. The initial state indicates that `n` is a positive integer in the range from 1 to 1000, and `s` is a positive integer in the range from 1 to \(10^{12}\). The values of `n` and `s` will be updated based on the user input through the `map(int, input().split())` statement, which accepts two space-separated integers.

Since the specific values for `n` and `s` are determined by user input, they are now both represented as input integers. The list `v` remains unaffected, but the condition regarding its size (containing `n` integers) still holds.

Output State: **`v` is a list of `n` integers, `n` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000), `s` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ s ≤ 10^12)**.
