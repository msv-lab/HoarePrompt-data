To determine the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the program.

### Problem Overview
Nauuo wants to determine the outcome of her votes based on three parameters:
- `x`: number of upvotes
- `y`: number of downvotes
- `z`: uncertain votes

The outcomes can be:
- "+" if upvotes are strictly greater than downvotes
- "-" if downvotes are strictly greater than upvotes
- "0" if upvotes are equal to downvotes
- "?" if there are multiple potential outcomes due to uncertain votes.

### Provided Program Logic
```python
def func():
    (x, y, z) = map(int, input().split())
    if x > y + z:
        print('+')
    elif x < y:
        print('-')
    elif x == y:
        if z == 0:
            print('0')
        else:
            print('?')
    else:
        print('?')
```

### Logical Breakdown of the Program
1. **Condition `x > y + z`**:
   - This checks if the number of upvotes is strictly greater than the combination of downvotes and uncertain votes (meaning even if all uncertain votes were downvotes, upvotes would still outnumber them).

2. **Condition `x < y`**:
   - This checks if downvotes are strictly greater than upvotes.

3. **Condition `x == y`**:
   - This checks for equality between upvotes and downvotes.
   - If `z` is 0 at this point, it confirms a definite tie (output "0").
   - If `z` is greater than 0, it indicates uncertainty (output "?").

4. **Final else condition**:
   - This handles any remaining cases that result in uncertainty (it outputs "?").

### Analysis of Edge Cases
We will investigate the behavior of the program for the following edge cases:
1. **When x = 0, y = 0, z = 0**:
   - Expected output: "0" (since there are no votes).
   - Actual output: The program would print "0" correctly.

2. **When x = 0, y = 0, z = 1**:
   - Expected output: "?" (since there is one uncertain vote which could be either).
   - Actual output: The program would print "?" correctly.

3. **When x = 1, y = 1, z = 1**:
   - Expected output: "?" (could be either +1 or 0).
   - Actual output: The program would print "?" correctly.

4. **When x = 1, y = 1, z = 0**:
   - Expected output: "0" (since there is a tie).
   - Actual output: The program would print "0" correctly.

5. **When x = 3, y = 7, z = 0**:
   - Expected output: "-" (since downvotes are greater).
   - Actual output: The program would print "-" correctly.

6. **When x = 2, y = 0, z = 1**:
   - Expected output: "+" (since upvotes outnumber downvotes regardless of the uncertain vote).
   - Actual output: The program would print "+" correctly.

7. **When x = 0, y = 0, z = 1**:
   - Expected output: "?" (due to one uncertain vote).
   - Actual output: The program would print "?" correctly.

### Conclusion
The program covers all possible edge cases and provides the correct output for all scenarios defined in the problem description. There are no instances where the program produces incorrect results based on the specified conditions.

Correctness: **True**.
