The code assigns values to `x`, `y`, and `z` using `map(int, input().split())`, which takes a single line of input, splits it into three parts, and converts them to integers. The initial state indicates that `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers within the range of 0 to 100, but their specific values are not known. After executing the code, `x`, `y`, and `z` will hold the three integer values provided in the input.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers equal to the three input values, such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100.**
