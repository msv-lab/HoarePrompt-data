To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program logic against the requirements.

1. **Understanding the Inputs and Outputs**:
   - The program takes three integers, `x` (upvotes), `y` (downvotes), and `z` (unknown votes).
   - It should output:
     - "+" if the total upvotes are strictly greater than total downvotes.
     - "-" if the total downvotes are strictly greater than total upvotes.
     - "0" if upvotes are equal to downvotes.
     - "?" if the outcome is uncertain due to the unknown votes.

2. **Analyzing the Program Logic**:
   - `min_upvotes` is initialized as `x`, and `max_upvotes` as `x + z`.
   - `min_downvotes` is initialized as `y`, and `max_downvotes` as `y + z`.
   - The conditional checks:
     - If `max_upvotes < min_downvotes`, it prints `'-'`, indicating downvotes are guaranteed to be greater.
     - If `max_downvotes < min_upvotes`, it prints `'+'`, indicating upvotes are guaranteed to be greater.
     - If neither condition is satisfied, it prints `'?'`, indicating uncertainty.

3. **Identifying Potential Edge Cases**:
   - Let's consider the case where `x = 0`, `y = 0`, and `z = 1`:
     - In this case:
       - `min_upvotes = 0`
       - `max_upvotes = 1`
       - `min_downvotes = 0`
       - `max_downvotes = 1`
     - Here, the result can either be `'+'` (if the unknown person upvotes) or `'-'` (if the unknown person downvotes). Therefore, the result should be uncertain (`'?'`).
   - The program correctly identifies this case as uncertain, as it prints `'?'`.

4. **Checking Other Cases in the Examples**:
   - For inputs such as (3, 7, 0), (2, 0, 1), (1, 1, 0), the program correctly produces the expected output of `'-'`, `'+'`, and `'0'`, respectively.

5. **Concluding Evaluation**:
   - After evaluating the provided code against various possible scenarios and edge cases, including those identified in the problem description, the program appears to handle all cases correctly.

Therefore, since the program behaves as expected in all cases specified in the problem description, the correctness is:

Correctness: **True**
