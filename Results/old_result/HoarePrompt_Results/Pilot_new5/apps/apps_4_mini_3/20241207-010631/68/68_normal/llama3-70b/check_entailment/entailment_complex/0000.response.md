The provided Python program implements the logic required to determine the result of votes based on the counts of upvotes (`x`), downvotes (`y`), and unknown votes (`z`). Let's analyze the requirements as per the problem description and see how the program addresses each case.

1. **More upvotes than downvotes**: The condition `if (x > y + z)` checks if the total potential upvotes (`x`) exceed the maximum possible downvotes (`y + z`). If true, it prints `'+'`.

2. **More downvotes than upvotes**: The condition `if (x < y)` checks if the upvotes are less than downvotes. If true, it prints `'-'`.

3. **Equal upvotes and downvotes**: The program checks if `x == y`. If they are equal, it further checks the value of `z`:
   - If `z == 0`, that means there are no unknown votes, so it prints `'0'` as the result is certain.
   - If `z > 0`, since there are unknown votes, the result could potentially be either `'+'` or `'-'` depending on how the unknown votes are cast. Thus, it prints `'?'` indicating uncertainty.

4. **Uncertainty**: The else condition at the end of the chain handles cases where `x` is neither greater than `y + z` nor less than `y`, nor equal to `y`. This leads directly to cases with uncertainty when `z > 0`.

Given the above logic implemented in the program, let's consider potential cases:

- Example 1 (`3 7 0`): `x` is less than `y`, so the output is `'-'`. Correct.
- Example 2 (`2 0 1`): Here, `x` is greater than `y + z`, so the output is `'+'`. Correct.
- Example 3 (`1 1 0`): `x` equals `y` and `z` is `0`, leading to the output `'0'`. Correct.
- Example 4 (`0 0 1`): `x` equals `y`, but since `z > 0`, the output is `'?'`, indicating uncertainty. Correct.

All test cases provided in the problem description work flawlessly with the program's logic, and it captures all edge cases correctly. 

Hence, the program meets all requirements specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
