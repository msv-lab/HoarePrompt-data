To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic implemented in the `func` function step by step.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The function reads three integers, `x`, `y`, and `z`, which represent the number of upvotes, downvotes, and uncertain votes, respectively.

2. **Conditional Logic**:
   - The first condition checks if `x > y + z`. If true, it prints `'+'` indicating that there will definitely be more upvotes than downvotes regardless of how the uncertain voters vote.
   - The second condition checks if `x < y`. If true, it prints `'-'` indicating more downvotes than upvotes.
   - The third condition checks if `x == y`. If this is true:
     - If `z == 0`, it prints `'0'` indicating that the votes are equal.
     - If `z > 0`, it prints `'?'`, meaning the result is uncertain since the uncertain voters could sway the result either way.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it defaults to print `'?'`. This condition would occur if `x < y + z` but `x` is not less than `y`, which means it is either equal to `y` (but with uncertain votes) or there are more upvotes than downvotes when considering uncertain votes.

### Potential Cases:
Now let's consider various input scenarios to validate the correctness of the implementation:

1. **Case (3, 7, 0)**:
   - Here, `x = 3`, `y = 7`, `z = 0`. The output will be `'-'`. This is correct as there are definitely more downvotes.

2. **Case (2, 0, 1)**:
   - Here, `x = 2`, `y = 0`, `z = 1`. The output will be `'+'`. This is correct since uncertain votes cannot lower the upvotes below downvotes.

3. **Case (1, 1, 0)**:
   - Here, `x = 1`, `y = 1`, `z = 0`. The output will be `'0'`. This is correct since they are equal.

4. **Case (0, 0, 1)**:
   - Here, `x = 0`, `y = 0`, `z = 1`. The output will be `'?'`. This is correct since the single uncertain vote could either lead to 1 upvote or 1 downvote.

5. **Case (0, 1, 1)**:
   - Here, `x = 0`, `y = 1`, `z = 1`. The output should be `'?'`. This is correct because the uncertain vote could lead to either 1 downvote or 0 downvotes, making the result uncertain.

### Edge Cases:
- For inputs like `(100, 100, 0)`, it should return `'0'`, which is correct.
- For input `(99, 100, 1)`, it should return `'?'`, which is handled correctly as well.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the implementation against various cases, we find that the logic handles all potential inputs correctly as described in the problem statement. Thus, there are no examples where the program fails to meet the requirements.

Correctness: **True**
