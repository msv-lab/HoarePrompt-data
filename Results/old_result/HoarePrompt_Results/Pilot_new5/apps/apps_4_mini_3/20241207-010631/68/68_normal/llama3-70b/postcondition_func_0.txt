The function reads three integer inputs, x, y, and z, all of which must be in the range of 0 to 100. It then compares these integers and prints one of the following outputs: '+' if x is greater than the sum of y and z; '-' if x is less than y; '0' if x equals y and z is 0; and '?' in all other cases when x equals y but z is greater than 0, or when x is greater than y but not greater than y + z.
