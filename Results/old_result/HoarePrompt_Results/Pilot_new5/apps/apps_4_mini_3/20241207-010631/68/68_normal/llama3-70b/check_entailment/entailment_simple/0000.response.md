To evaluate the correctness of the provided program according to the problem description, we need to analyze its logic and see whether it handles all possible cases correctly.

### Problem Overview:
1. We have three categories of votes:
   - `x` (upvotes)
   - `y` (downvotes)
   - `z` (unknown votes which can be either up or down)

2. Based on the values of `x`, `y`, and `z`, we need to determine:
   - If `x > y + z`, the result is "+".
   - If `x < y`, the result is "-".
   - If `x == y`, we have two sub-cases:
     - If `z == 0`, the result is "0".
     - If `z > 0`, there can be both "+" and "-" outcomes, so it's uncertain ("?").

### Program Logic:
The annotated program implements the above logic as follows:
- It first checks if `x > y + z`. If true, it prints "+".
- Then it checks if `x < y`. If true, it prints "-".
- If `x == y`, it further checks:
  - If `z == 0`, it prints "0".
  - If `z > 0`, it prints "?" indicating uncertainty.
- If none of the above conditions hold, it prints "?". 

### Correctness Analysis:
1. **Condition `x > y + z`:**
   - This correctly identifies that all unknown votes can’t turn the result into something favorable for downvotes.

2. **Condition `x < y`:**
   - This identifies that downvotes are more than upvotes.

3. **Condition `x == y`:**
   - For `z == 0`, the program correctly outputs "0" since there is no uncertainty.
   - For `z > 0`, it outputs "?" indicating the possibility of either outcome.

4. **Default to "?":**
   - The program’s structure allows it to correctly handle cases where none of the previous conditions apply, which is sound.

### Edge Cases:
- When `x`, `y`, and `z` are all zero, the output should be "?" since both outcomes "+" and "-" are possible depending on the unknown votes, which the program correctly identifies.
- When `x` and `y` are equal but `z > 0`, the output is correctly "?".
  
### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required by the problem statement and accounts for all edge cases. It will yield the correct outputs for all possible values of `x`, `y`, and `z`, given the constraints of the problem.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
