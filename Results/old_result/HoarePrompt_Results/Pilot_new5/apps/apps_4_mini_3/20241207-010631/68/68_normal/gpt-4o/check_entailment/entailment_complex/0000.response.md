Correctness: **True**

The program provided correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. The function takes three integers `x`, `y`, and `z` as input, representing the number of upvotes, downvotes, and unknown votes respectively, adhering to the constraint \(0 \leq x, y, z \leq 100\).

2. The program calculates:
   - `min_upvotes` as \(x\) (the minimum number of upvotes).
   - `max_upvotes` as \(x + z\) (the maximum number of upvotes, assuming all unknowns are upvotes).
   - `min_downvotes` as \(y\) (the minimum number of downvotes).
   - `max_downvotes` as \(y + z\) (the maximum number of downvotes, assuming all unknowns are downvotes).

3. The program then evaluates:
   - If the maximum possible upvotes (`max_upvotes`) are less than the minimum downvotes (`min_downvotes`), it accurately concludes that downvotes outnumber upvotes and prints `'-'`.
   - If the maximum possible downvotes (`max_downvotes`) are less than the minimum upvotes (`min_upvotes`), it concludes that upvotes outnumber downvotes and prints `'+'`.
   - If neither condition is met, it identifies that the outcome could be uncertain (because the unknown votes can swing the result either way), and correctly prints `'?'`.

4. All possible scenarios outlined in the problem description are accounted for in the logical structure of the program. The program checks for definitive outcomes first and only identifies uncertainty when both outcomes are possible due to the presence of unknown votes.

Thus, the program adheres strictly to the requirements outlined in the problem description, covering all cases to ensure accurate outputs based on the given inputs.
