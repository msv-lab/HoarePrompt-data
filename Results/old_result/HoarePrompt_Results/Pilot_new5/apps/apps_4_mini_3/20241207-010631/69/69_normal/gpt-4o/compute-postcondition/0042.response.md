The code snippet initializes `min_length` to positive infinity (`float('inf')`). This means that `min_length` is now set to an extremely large value, which is often used to represent an absence of a minimum length yet to be found. The values of other variables in the initial state remain unchanged, including `final_x`, `final_y`, `dx`, and `dy`.

Output State: **`final_x` is the net horizontal displacement based on 'L' and 'R' operations; `final_y` is the net vertical displacement based on 'U' and 'D' operations; `dx` is assigned the value `x - final_x`; `dy` is assigned the value `y - final_y`; `dx` is not equal to 0 or `dy` is not equal to 0; `min_length` is set to float('inf').**
