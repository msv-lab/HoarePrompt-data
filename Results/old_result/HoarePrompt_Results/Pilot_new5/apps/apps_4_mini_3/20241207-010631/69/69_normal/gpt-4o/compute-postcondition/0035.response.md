Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `operations` is a string of length `n`, `x` and `y` are integers within the range -10^9 to 10^9. If `op` is 'U', `final_y` is incremented by 1. If `op` is 'D', `final_y` is decreased by 1. If `op` is 'L', `final_x` is decremented by 1. If `op` is 'R', `final_x` is incremented by 1.***
