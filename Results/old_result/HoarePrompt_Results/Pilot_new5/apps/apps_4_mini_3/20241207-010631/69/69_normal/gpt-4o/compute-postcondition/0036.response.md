The loop processes a series of operations that modify the coordinates `final_x` and `final_y` based on the characters in the `operations` string. The total number of operations will determine how much `final_x` and `final_y` change from their initial state of 0.

1. If the loop does not execute (i.e., when `n` is 0), both `final_x` and `final_y` remain 0.
2. For each character in `operations`, `final_x` and `final_y` will be updated as follows:
   - 'U' increases `final_y` by 1.
   - 'D' decreases `final_y` by 1.
   - 'L' decreases `final_x` by 1.
   - 'R' increases `final_x` by 1.

After processing all operations in the string, `final_x` and `final_y` will be the net result of these operations.

Output State: **`final_x` is the net horizontal displacement based on 'L' and 'R' operations, `final_y` is the net vertical displacement based on 'U' and 'D' operations, `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of {'U', 'D', 'L', 'R'}. If `n` is 0, then `final_x` is 0 and `final_y` is 0.**
