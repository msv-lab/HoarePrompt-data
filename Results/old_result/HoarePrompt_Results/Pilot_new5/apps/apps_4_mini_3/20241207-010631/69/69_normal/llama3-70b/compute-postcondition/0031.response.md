The variable `uy` is decremented by 1. The initial state of `n` being a positive integer and `operations` being a string of length at least 3 remain unchanged. The specific value of `uy` is not provided, but it is impacted by the operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that `uy` has been decreased by 1 while retaining the conditions of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `operations` is a string of length at least 3, `uy` is decreased by 1.**
