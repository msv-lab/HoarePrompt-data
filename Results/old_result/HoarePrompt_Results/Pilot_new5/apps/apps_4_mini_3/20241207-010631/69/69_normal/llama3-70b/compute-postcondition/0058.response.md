Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000). If the first character of `operations` is 'L' and `dx` is less than 0, then `dx` is updated to `x - ux + 1`, `dy` remains `y - uy`, and `res` is 0. Otherwise, `dx` is `x - ux`, `dy` is `y - uy`, and `res` is set to 1, with the condition that either `op` is 'R' or `dx` is greater than or equal to 0.***
