The variable `uy` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `uy` is 0, so after the operation, `uy` becomes -1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `operations` is a string of length `n` containing at least 1 character, `op` is the first character in `operations`, which is 'D', `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `ux` is 0, `uy` is -1, `lx` is 0, and `ly` is 0.**
