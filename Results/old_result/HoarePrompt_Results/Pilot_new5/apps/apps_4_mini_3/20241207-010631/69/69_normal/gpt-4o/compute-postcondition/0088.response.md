Postcondition: ***`target_pos` is updated to (current_x + dx, current_y + dy) and `position_map[current_x, current_y]` is updated to `i`, where `i` is less than n - 1. If `operations[i]` is 'U', then `current_y` is incremented by 1. If `operations[i]` is 'D', then `current_y` is decremented by 1. If `operations[i]` is 'L', then `current_x` is decremented by 1. If `operations[i]` is 'R', then `current_x` is incremented by 1.***
