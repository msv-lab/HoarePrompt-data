In the provided code snippet, `dx` is assigned the value of `x - final_x`. The variable `final_x` represents the net horizontal displacement based on 'L' and 'R' operations, but its value is not specified here. The initial state suggests that if `n` is 0, then `final_x` is 0 and `final_y` is also 0. However, since `x` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact value of `dx` after the execution. 

Therefore, the output state indicates that `dx` is assigned a value based on the expression `x - final_x`, with the current states of `final_x` and any other relevant variables remaining unchanged.

Output State: **`final_x` is the net horizontal displacement based on 'L' and 'R' operations; `final_y` is the net vertical displacement based on 'U' and 'D' operations; `dx` is assigned the value `x - final_x`.**
