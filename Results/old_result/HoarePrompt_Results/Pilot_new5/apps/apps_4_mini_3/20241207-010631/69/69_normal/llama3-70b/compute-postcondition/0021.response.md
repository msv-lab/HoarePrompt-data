The value of `uy` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `uy` is unknown. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `operations` is a string of length at least 2, `op` is the second character of `operations`, and `uy` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `operations` is a string of length at least 2, `op` is the second character of `operations`, `uy` is increased by 1**
