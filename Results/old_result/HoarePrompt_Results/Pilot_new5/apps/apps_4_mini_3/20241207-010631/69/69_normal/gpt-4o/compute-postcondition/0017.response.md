Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of {'U', 'D', 'L', 'R'}, `x` is an integer such that -10^9 <= `x` <= 10^9, `y` is an integer such that -10^9 <= `y` <= 10^9. If the first character of `operations` is 'U', then `final_x` is 0 and `final_y` is 1. If the first character is 'D', then `final_x` is 0 and `final_y` is -1. If the first character is 'L', then `final_x` is -1 and `final_y` is 0. If the first character is 'R', then `final_x` is 1 and `final_y` is 0. In all cases, `op` is equal to 'U' in the first part, and in the else part, `op` is not equal to 'U' or 'D' when appropriate.***
