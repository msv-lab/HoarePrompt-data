Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `operations` is a string of length at least 1, `op` is the first character of `operations`, `x` is the initial value of `x`, `y` is the initial value of `y`, `ux` is the final value of `ux`, `uy` is the final value of `uy`, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, `dx` is `x - ux`, `dy` is `y - uy`, `dx` and `dy` are greater than or equal to 0, `res` is 0, either `op` is not 'U' or `dy` is equal to 0. The current value of `op` is 'D', and the current value of `dy` is less than 0.***
