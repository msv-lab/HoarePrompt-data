The value of `current_y` is incremented by 1. The previous state mentions that `target_pos` is updated to `(current_x + dx, current_y + dy)` and `position_map[current_x, current_y]` is updated to `i`, where `i` must be less than `n - 1`. After executing the code, the value of `current_y` changes but the others remain valid. 

Output State: **`target_pos` is updated to (current_x + dx, current_y + dy); `position_map[current_x, current_y]` is updated to `i`; `i` must be less than `n - 1; `current_y` is incremented by 1.**
