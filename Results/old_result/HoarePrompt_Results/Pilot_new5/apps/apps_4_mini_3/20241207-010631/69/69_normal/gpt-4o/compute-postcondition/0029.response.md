The variable `final_y` is decremented by 1. The values of `n`, `operations`, `x`, and `y` are not affected. Given that `final_y` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot ascertain its previous value. Therefore, we only note that `final_y` has decreased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than `n`, `operations` is a string of length `n`, `x` is an integer within the range -10^9 to 10^9, `y` is an integer within the same range, and `final_y` is decreased by 1.**
