`final_y` is assigned the value `0`. The value of `final_y` is explicitly set, while the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200000), `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters from the set {'U', 'D', 'L', 'R'}, `x` is an integer such that -10^9 <= x <= 10^9, `y` is an integer such that -10^9 <= y <= 10^9, and `final_x` is 0.
