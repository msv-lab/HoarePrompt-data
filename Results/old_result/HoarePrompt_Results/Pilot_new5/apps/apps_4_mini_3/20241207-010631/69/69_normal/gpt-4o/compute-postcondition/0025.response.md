Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a string of length `n`, `x` is an integer within the range -10^9 to 10^9, and `y` is an integer within the same range. If `op` is 'D', then `final_y` is decremented by 1. If `op` is 'L', then `final_x` is equal to its previous value minus 1. If `op` is 'R', then `final_x` is equal to its previous value plus 1. Otherwise, `final_x` remains unchanged.***
