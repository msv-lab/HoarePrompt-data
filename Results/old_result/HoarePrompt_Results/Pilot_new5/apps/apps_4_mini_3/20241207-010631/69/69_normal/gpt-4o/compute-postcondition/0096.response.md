Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a string `operations` consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R', and two integers `x` and `y`. It calculates the final position based on the operations and determines the required net displacement to return to the initial position. The function returns 0 if there is no net change in displacement; otherwise, it returns the minimum length of a subsequence in `operations` that allows reaching the net displacement, or -1 if no valid subsequence exists. **
