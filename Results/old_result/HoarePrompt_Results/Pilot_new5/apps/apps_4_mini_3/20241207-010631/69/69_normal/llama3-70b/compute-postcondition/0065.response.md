The variable `dx` is decremented by 1. Since `dx` is updated according to the last operation `op`, its new value will be `dx - 1`. The other variables (`n`, `op`, `dy`, `x`, `y`, `ux`, `uy`, `lx`, `ly`, and `res`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the updated value of `dx`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `op` is the next operation in ops, `dx` is updated to `dx - 1`, `dy` remains unchanged, and other variables `x`, `y`, `ux`, `uy`, `lx`, `ly`, and `res` remain unchanged.**
