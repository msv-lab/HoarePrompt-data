Postcondition: ***`final_x` is the net horizontal displacement based on 'L' and 'R' operations, and `final_y` is the net vertical displacement based on 'U' and 'D' operations. If `target_pos` is in `position_map`, then `dx` is assigned the value `x - final_x`, `dy` is assigned the value `y - final_y`, `min_length` is updated to the minimum of the current `min_length` and `i - position_map[target_pos]`, and `position_map` remains as {(0, 0): -1}. Additionally, `n` is greater than 0 and `target_pos` is equal to `current_x + (x - final_x), current_y + (y - final_y)`.***
