The value of `dx` is incremented by 1. The values of `n`, `op`, `dy`, `x`, `y`, `ux`, `uy`, `lx`, `ly`, and `res` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `op` is the next operation in ops, `dx` is increased by 1, `dy` is updated according to the last `op`, and other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `op` is the next operation in ops, `dx` is increased by 1, `dy` is updated according to the last `op`, and other variables `x`, `y`, `ux`, `uy`, `lx`, `ly`, and `res` remain unchanged.**
