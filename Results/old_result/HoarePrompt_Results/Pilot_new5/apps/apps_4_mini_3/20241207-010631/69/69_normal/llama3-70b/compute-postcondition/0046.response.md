The value of `dy` is decremented by 1. Since `dy` is greater than 0 initially, the new value of `dy` will be `dy - 1`, which is still non-negative. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `operations` is a string of length at least 1, `op` is 'U', `x` is the initial value of `x`, `y` is the initial value of `y`, `ux` is the final value of `ux`, `uy` is the final value of `uy`, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, `dx` is `x - ux`, `dy` is greater than or equal to 0 and is now decremented by 1, `res` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `operations` is a string of length at least 1, `op` is 'U', `x` is the initial value of `x`, `y` is the initial value of `y`, `ux` is the final value of `ux`, `uy` is the final value of `uy`, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, `dx` is `x - ux`, `dy` is greater than or equal to 0 and is now `dy - 1`, `res` is 0.**
