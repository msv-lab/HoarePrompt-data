The assignment `rec_stack[node] = False` sets the value of `rec_stack` at the index corresponding to `node` to `False`. This implies we are marking the current vertex (`node`) as no longer being part of the recursion stack. All other variables remain unaffected in their states. 

The output state retains all information from the initial conditions, but we must update `rec_stack[node]`.

Output State: **`node` is the current vertex after exploring all its neighbors, `graph[node]` represents a list of all neighbors for `node`, `visited` indicates whether each vertex has been visited, `rec_stack` indicates whether each vertex was part of the recursion stack during the exploration, `rec_stack[node]` is False.**
