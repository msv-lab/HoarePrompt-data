Output State: **`in_degree[v]` has at least one vertex where `in_degree[v] == 0`, `queue` contains all nodes with `in_degree[node] == 0`, `count` is now 2, `node` is the value obtained from `queue.popleft()`, and all neighbors of `node` have had their `in_degree` decremented by 1, with those whose `in_degree` is now 0 having been appended to `queue`.**
