According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `graph` dictionary. The loop iterates over the keys of `graph`, which contain vertices from 1 to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `u` is 1 and `graph[u]` must be a non-empty iterable. For the loop to execute one more time, `u` will be incremented to the next key in the `graph`. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `u` must be 2 (the next key) and `graph[u]` must also be a non-empty iterable.

State: **`in_degree[v]` is equal to the number of incoming edges to each vertex `v` in `graph`, `u` is 2, `graph` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to n, and `graph[u]` must be a non-empty iterable**.
