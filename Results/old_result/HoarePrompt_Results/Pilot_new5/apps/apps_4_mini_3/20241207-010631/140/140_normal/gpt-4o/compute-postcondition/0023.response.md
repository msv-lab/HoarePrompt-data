The variable `in_degree[v]` is incremented by 1. The previous state indicated that `in_degree[v]` was equal to its original value plus the number of elements in `graph[2]` plus 2. The state of other variables remains unaffected. Therefore, the output state is `in_degree[v]` is increased by 1, while `in_degree[v]` can still be expressed in terms of its original value, the number of elements in `graph[2]`, and the constant 2.

Output State: **`in_degree[v]` is its original value plus the number of elements in `graph[2]` plus 2, `in_degree[v]` is increased by 1; `u` is 3; `graph` contains key 3 with at least 3 elements; `v` is the third element in `graph[3]`.**
