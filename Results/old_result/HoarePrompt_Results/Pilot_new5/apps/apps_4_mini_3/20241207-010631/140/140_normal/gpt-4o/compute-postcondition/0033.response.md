Postcondition: ***`in_degree[v]` must have at least one vertex such that `in_degree[v] == 0`, `queue` contains at least one node where `in_degree[node] == 0`, `count` is 1, `node` is the value obtained from `queue.popleft()`, `in_degree[neighbor]` has been decreased by 1, and the current value of `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0.***
