According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `graph[node]`. The loop will iterate over the neighbors of the current `node`. At the end of the last iteration, `graph[node]` must contain at least 1 neighbor, which means there is at least one entry in the list corresponding to `node`. Since the loop processes each neighbor in `graph[node]`, the next neighbor to be processed will be the next neighbor in the list.

If `graph[node]` contains at least 1 neighbor, we can assume it has at least 2 neighbors for the loop to execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `in_degree[neighbor]` was 0, and the loop will proceed to the next neighbor in `graph[node]`, hence for the loop to execute one more time, `neighbor` will be the next neighbor in the list and the count will be incremented by 1.

State: **`in_degree[neighbor]` is decremented by 1, `queue` contains all nodes with `in_degree[node] == 0`, `count` is now 3, `node` is the value obtained from `queue.popleft()`, `graph[node]` must contain at least 2 neighbors, and `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0.**
