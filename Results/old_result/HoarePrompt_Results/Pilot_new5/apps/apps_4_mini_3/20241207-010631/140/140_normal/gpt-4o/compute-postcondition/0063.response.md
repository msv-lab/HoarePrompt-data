The variable `node` is assigned the value obtained from `queue.popleft()`, which removes and returns the first element of the `queue`. The values of the other variables (`in_degree`, `count`, and the neighbors' in_degrees) remain unchanged, but now `node` has the specific value that was at the front of the queue. Therefore, the Output State reflects this update.

Output State: **`in_degree[neighbor]` is decremented for all neighbors of `node`, `queue` contains all nodes with `in_degree[node] == 0`, `count` is the total number of vertices processed, `node` is the value obtained from `queue.popleft()`**.
