Output State: **`queue` is empty, `count` is equal to the total number of vertices in the graph that have been processed (i.e., those with their `in_degree` reduced to 0), `in_degree[v]` for all vertices `v` that were reachable from the initial vertices with `in_degree[v] == 0` is now 0, while those that were not reachable retain their original `in_degree` values. If `count` is equal to the number of vertices in the graph, then the graph has no cycles; otherwise, there are nodes in the graph that are part of a cycle.**
