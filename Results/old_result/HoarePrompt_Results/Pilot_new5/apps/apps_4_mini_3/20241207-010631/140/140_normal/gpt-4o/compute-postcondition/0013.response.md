The variable `in_degree[v]` is incremented by 1. The previous state indicates that `in_degree[v]` had some value, and now it will be that value plus 1. The variable `u` is fixed at 2, while `v` is defined as the second element in `graph[u]`. The state of the other variables is not affected. 

Thus, the output state reflects the change in `in_degree[v]` only.

Output State: **`in_degree[v]` is incremented by 1, `u` is 2, `v` is the second element in `graph[u]`**
