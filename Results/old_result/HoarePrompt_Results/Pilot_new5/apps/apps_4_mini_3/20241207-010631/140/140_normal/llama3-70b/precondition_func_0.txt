node is an integer representing the current vertex, graph is a list of lists representing the directed edges of the graph, visited is a list of booleans indicating whether each vertex has been visited, and rec_stack is a list of booleans indicating whether each vertex is in the current recursion stack. The number of vertices n is between 2 and 500, and the number of edges m is between 1 and min(n(n - 1), 100000). Each vertex is represented by integers from 1 to n.
