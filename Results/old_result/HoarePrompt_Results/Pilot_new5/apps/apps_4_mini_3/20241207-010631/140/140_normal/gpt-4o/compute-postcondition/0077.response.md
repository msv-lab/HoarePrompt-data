Postcondition: ***`in_degree[neighbor]` is decremented by 1, `queue` includes `neighbor`, `count` remains the same, and `node` is the value obtained from `queue.popleft()`. If `in_degree[neighbor]` equals 0, then `neighbor` is ready to be processed; otherwise, the program proceeds without making any changes to `in_degree[neighbor]` or `queue`.***
