Postcondition: ***`node` is the current vertex and `graph[node]` must have at least 1 neighbor. If the current value of `neighbor` has not been visited yet and the function `func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack)` returns false, then certain operations related to that neighbor take place. Otherwise, all neighbors of `node` have been visited, and none of the neighbors of `node` are currently in the recursion stack (`rec_stack[neighbor]` is false for all neighbors).***
