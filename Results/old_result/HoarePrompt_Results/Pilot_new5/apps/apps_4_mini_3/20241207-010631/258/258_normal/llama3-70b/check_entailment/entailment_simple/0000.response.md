Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Coordinate Range**: The problem states that the coordinates (X, Y) for the heat source can be any real numbers, while the program limits the x and y coordinate values to integers in the range of -1000 to 1000. This means that the program can miss the optimal placement of the heat source, as it is not exploring all possible real-number placements but only those that are integer values.

2. **Function Logic**: The `func_2` function takes coordinates `x` and `y` (which are integers) for the heat source and calculates the time for each piece of meat based on its distance from the heat source. The program then sorts these times and takes the K-th smallest time. However, the way the program iterates through `x` and `y` (only at integer values) means that it does not guarantee that it will find the minimum time required. The optimal placement may exist between these integer values.

3. **Minimization of Time**: The program relies on a brute-force search over a grid of integer coordinates, which can lead to suboptimal results because it does not consider the continuous nature of real-number coordinates. If the optimal position lies at a non-integer coordinate, the program will not find it, leading to incorrect answers.

Due to these issues, the program does not fulfill the problem's requirement to minimize the grilling time for K pieces of meat accurately. It does not explore the full possible range of placements for the heat source, resulting in potentially incorrect minimum time calculations.
