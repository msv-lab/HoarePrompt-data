To analyze the code snippet, we start with the initial state and the code provided. 

Initial State: `N` is an integer where 1 <= N <= 60; `K` is an integer where 1 <= K <= N; `x` is -998; `y` is -998; `times` is sorted; `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1] (updated)`

```
times = func_2(x, y, x, y)
```

1. The function `func_2(x, y, x, y)` is called with `x` and `y` both equal to -998. The output of this function will determine the new value of `times`.
2. The previous values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged as they are inputs to the function `func_2`.
3. The `ans` variable will later be updated based on the new value of `times`, specifically taking the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`.

Since we do not have the specific implementation of `func_2`, we cannot determine the exact contents of `times` or how `ans` will change. However, we know that:
- `times` will be updated with the output from `func_2`.
- The values of `N`, `K`, `x`, and `y` will remain unchanged.
- The state of `ans` may change based on the new value of `times[K - 1]`.

However, without the specific output of `func_2`, we can only note that `times` is now populated with some values, and `ans` will potentially change.

Output State: **`N` is an integer where 1 <= N <= 60; `K` is an integer where 1 <= K <= N; `x` is -998; `y` is -998; `times` is updated by `func_2(x, y, x, y); ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1] (updated).**
