You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Takahashi wants to grill N pieces of meat on a grilling net, which can be seen as a two-dimensional plane. The coordinates of the i-th piece of meat are \left(x_i, y_i\right), and its hardness is c_i.
Takahashi can use one heat source to grill the meat. If he puts the heat source at coordinates \left(X, Y\right), where X and Y are real numbers, the i-th piece of meat will be ready to eat in c_i \times \sqrt{\left(X - x_i\right)^2 + \left(Y-y_i\right)^2} seconds.
Takahashi wants to eat K pieces of meat. Find the time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready if he put the heat source to minimize this time.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq N \leq 60
 - 1 \leq K \leq N
 - -1000 \leq x_i , y_i \leq 1000
 - \left(x_i, y_i\right) \neq \left(x_j, y_j\right) \left(i \neq j \right)
 - 1 \leq c_i \leq 100

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
x_1 y_1 c_1
\vdots
x_N y_N c_N

-----Output-----
Print the answer.
It will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error from our answer is at most 10^{-6}.

-----Sample Input-----
4 3
-1 0 3
0 0 3
1 0 2
1 1 40

-----Sample Output-----
2.4

If we put the heat source at \left(-0.2, 0\right), the 1-st, 2-nd, and 3-rd pieces of meat will be ready to eat within 2.4 seconds. This is the optimal place to put the heat source.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import math

(N, K) = map(int, input().split())
meats = []
for _ in range(N):
    (x, y, c) = map(int, input().split())
    meats.append((x, y, c))
print(func_3())

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x, y, X, and Y are real numbers representing coordinates in a two-dimensional plane.
def func_1(x, y, X, Y):
    return math.sqrt((X - x) ** 2 + (Y - y) ** 2)
    #The program returns the Euclidean distance between the points (x, y) and (X, Y) in the two-dimensional plane

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are integers representing the coordinates of the heat source, X and Y are real numbers representing the coordinates where the heat source is placed.
def func_2(x, y, X, Y):
    return [(c * func_1(x, y, X, Y)) for x, y, c in meats]
    #The program returns a list of values obtained by multiplying each coefficient 'c' from 'meats' with the result of the function 'func_1' applied to the coordinates (x, y) and (X, Y)

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer where 1 <= N <= 60, K is an integer where 1 <= K <= N, x and y are integers within the range -1000 to 1000.
def func_3():
    ans = float('inf')
    for x in range(-1000, 1001):
        for y in range(-1000, 1001):
            times = func_2(x, y, x, y)
            times.sort()
            ans = min(ans, times[K - 1])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is an integer where 1 <= N <= 60; `K` is an integer where 1 <= K <= N; `x` is 1000; `y` is 1000; `ans` is equal to the minimum of the sorted values of `times` computed by `func_2(x, y, x, y)` across all combinations of `x` and `y` from -1000 to 1000; `times` contains the results of `func_2` for each combination of `x` and `y`.
    return ans
    #The program returns the minimum value of the sorted results stored in 'times', which are computed by 'func_2(x, y, x, y)' across all combinations of 'x' and 'y' from -1000 to 1000. The variable 'ans' holds this minimum value.


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
