Postcondition: ***`meats` is a list of tuples; `count` is the sum of weights `c` from `meats` where the distance from `(mx, my)` is less than or equal to `T`; `count` is greater than or equal to `K`; `j` is `i + 2`; `N` is greater than `i + 2`; `d` is equal to `c1 * T - c2 * T; if `d` is less than 0, the loop continues to the next iteration.***
