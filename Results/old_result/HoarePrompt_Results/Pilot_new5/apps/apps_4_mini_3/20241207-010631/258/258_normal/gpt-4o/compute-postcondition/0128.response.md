The variable `dx` is assigned the value of `(x1 - x2) / 2`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Thus, the Output State is: `meats` is a list of tuples; `count` is the sum of weights `c` from `meats` where the distance from `(mx, my)` is less than or equal to `T`; `count` is greater than or equal to `K`; `j` is `i + 2`; `N` is greater than `i + 2`; `d` is equal to `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`; `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`; `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`; `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`.
