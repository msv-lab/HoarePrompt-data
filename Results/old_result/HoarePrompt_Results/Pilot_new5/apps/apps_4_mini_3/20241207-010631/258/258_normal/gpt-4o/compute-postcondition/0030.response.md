Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples with N greater than `i + 1`; `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are now assigned the values of `x2`, `y2`, `c2` respectively; `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are now assigned the values of `x1`, `y1`, `c1` respectively; `d` is updated to `d / (c1 * c2)`; `cx` is equal to (x1 + x2) / 2; `cy` is equal to (y1 + y2) / 2; `dx` is equal to (x1 - x2) / 2; `dy` is equal to (y1 - y2) / 2; `d2` is equal to ((x1 - x2) / 2); `mx` is equal to `cx`; `my` is equal to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2; `count` is calculated as the sum of weights where the distance condition is met, and `count` is less than K; `j` is `i + 2`.**
