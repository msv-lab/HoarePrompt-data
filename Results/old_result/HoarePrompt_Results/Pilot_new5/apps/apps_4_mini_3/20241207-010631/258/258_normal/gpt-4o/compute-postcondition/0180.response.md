Postcondition: ***`meats` is a list of tuples, `count` is based on the valid weights from `meats` and is less than K, `j` is `i + 2`, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T / (c1 * c2)` and remains negative if `d < 0`, `cx` is equal to (x1 + x2) / 2, `cy` is equal to (y1 + y2) / 2, `dx` is equal to (x1 - x2) / 2, `dy` is equal to (y1 - y2) / 2, and `d2` is equal to `dx * dx + dy * dy`. If `d * d2 > d2`, the iteration of the loop continues to the next iteration without any further changes to the values.***
