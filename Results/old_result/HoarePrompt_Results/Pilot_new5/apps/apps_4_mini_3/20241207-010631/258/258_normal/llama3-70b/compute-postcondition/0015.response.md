According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from -1000 to 1000, which includes a total of 2001 values (from -1000 to 1000 inclusive). The variable `x` is currently -1000. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` will increment by 1 for the next iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, `x` is -1000, and it will become -999 for the next iteration. The loop can continue executing as long as `x` is less than or equal to 1000. Since `x` is currently -1000, it will become -999 next, which is still within the valid range for the loop.

Thus, the state needs to be updated to reflect the increment of `x`:

State: **`N` is an integer where 1 <= N <= 60; `K` is an integer where 1 <= K <= N; `x` is -999; `y` is 1000; `ans` is equal to the minimum of the sorted values of `times` computed across all iterations; `times` contains the result of `func_2(-1000, y, -1000, y)` for each `y` in the range from -1000 to 1000.**
