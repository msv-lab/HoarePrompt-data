Postcondition: ***`meats` is a list of tuples, `count` is less than `K`, and `d` is equal to `((c1 - c2) * T) / (c1 * c2)`. If `d * d2 > d2`, then `d`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, and `d2` remain as calculated: `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`, and `d2` is equal to `((x1 - x2) / 2) * ((x1 - x2) / 2) + ((y1 - y2) / 2) * ((y1 - y2) / 2)`; otherwise, no changes occur.***
