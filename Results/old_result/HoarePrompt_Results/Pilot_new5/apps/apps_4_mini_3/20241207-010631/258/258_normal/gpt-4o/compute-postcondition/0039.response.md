The code assigns the value of `(y1 - y2) / 2` to `dy`. Since `dy` is directly calculated from `y1` and `y2`, the values of `y1` and `y2` remain unchanged. The state of the other variables is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `meats` is a list of tuples with N greater than `i + 1`; `d` is equal to `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)` if `d` is not negative; `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`; `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`; `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`; `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples with N greater than `i + 1`; `d` is equal to `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)` if `d` is not negative; `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`; `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`; `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`; `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`.**
