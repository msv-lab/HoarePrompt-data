The variable `cy` is assigned the value of the average of `y1` and `y2`, which means `cy` becomes `(y1 + y2) / 2`. The states of the other variables (`meats`, `d`, `cx`) are not affected. 

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples with N greater than `i + 1`; `d` is equal to `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)` if `d` is not negative; `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`; `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`.**
