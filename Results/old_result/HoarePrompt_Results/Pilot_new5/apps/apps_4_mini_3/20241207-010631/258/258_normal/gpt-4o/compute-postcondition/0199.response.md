The value of `d2` is assigned the result of the expression `dx * dx + dy * dy`. The variables `dx` and `dy` have specific values based on their definitions, which depend on the previous states of `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, and `y2`. Therefore, `d2` will be equal to the sum of the squares of `dx` and `dy`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `d` is equal to (c1 - c2) * T / (c1 * c2) if d is less than 0, we skip to the next iteration of the loop; `cx` is equal to (x1 + x2) / 2; `cy` is equal to (y1 + y2) / 2; `dx` is equal to (x1 - x2) / 2; `dy` is equal to (y1 - y2) / 2; `d2` is equal to `dx * dx + dy * dy`.**
