Postcondition: ***`meats` is a list of tuples, `count` is less than `K`, `N` is greater than 1, `k + 1` is less than `N`, `j` is `k + 1`, and `d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T`, with the current value of `d` being less than 0. If the condition `c1 * T < c2 * T` does not hold true, then `d` remains unchanged.***
