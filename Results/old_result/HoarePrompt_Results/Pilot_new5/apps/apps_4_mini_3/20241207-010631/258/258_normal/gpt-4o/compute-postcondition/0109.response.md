In the provided code, `d2` is assigned the value of `dx * dx + dy * dy`. The variables `dx` and `dy` are defined as `(x1 - x2) / 2` and `(y1 - y2) / 2`, respectively. Therefore, the expression for `d2` can be explicitly stated as follows:

- `d2 = ((x1 - x2) / 2) * ((x1 - x2) / 2) + ((y1 - y2) / 2) * ((y1 - y2) / 2)`

Other variables in the initial state remain unchanged. The valid preconditions are still applicable.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `count` is less than `K`, `d` is less than 0, `d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T`, `d` is now `d / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is equal to `((x1 - x2) / 2) * ((x1 - x2) / 2) + ((y1 - y2) / 2) * ((y1 - y2) / 2)`**.
