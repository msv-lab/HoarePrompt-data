meats is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three values: x_i and y_i are integers representing the coordinates of the i-th piece of meat, and c_i is an integer representing the hardness of the i-th piece of meat (1 <= c_i <= 100). K is a positive integer such that 1 <= K <= len(meats). T is a real number representing the time threshold.
