The `times` list is sorted in ascending order. The other variables are unaffected by this operation, and their preconditions remain valid. The variable `times` is now sorted, but its specific values are unknown as it is the result of the `func_2` function with inputs that are also unspecified. The value of `ans` is influenced by `times[K - 1]`, but we do not have the context of `ans` before sorting, nor do we know the values of the elements in `times` after sorting. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `times` has been sorted while retaining all other variable states.

Output State: **`N` is an integer where 1 <= N <= 60, `K` is an integer where 1 <= K <= N, `x` is -999, `y` is -998, `times` is sorted, and `ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` and `times[K - 1]**
