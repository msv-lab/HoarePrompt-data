The code `continue` is a statement that causes the loop to skip the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. In this case, it does not change any variable values directly; it simply instructs the program to continue to the next loop cycle.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `count` is the sum of `c` for each tuple `(x, y, c)` and is less than `K`, `d` is less than 0, and `d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
