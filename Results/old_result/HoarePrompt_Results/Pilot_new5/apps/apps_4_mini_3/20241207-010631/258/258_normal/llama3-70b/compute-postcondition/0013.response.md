The variable `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `times[K - 1]`. The initial value of `ans` is equal to the sorted value of `times[K - 1]`, so the minimum will be that same value. Therefore, `ans` remains unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer where 1 <= N <= 60; `K` is an integer where 1 <= K <= N; `x` is -1000; `y` is -998; `times` is sorted; `ans` is equal to the sorted value of `times[K - 1]**
