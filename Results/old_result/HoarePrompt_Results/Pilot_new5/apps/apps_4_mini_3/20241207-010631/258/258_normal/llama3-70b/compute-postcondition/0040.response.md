The `times` array is sorted in ascending order. The previous value of `times` is updated by `func_2(x, y, x, y)`, where `x` and `y` are both -998. The value of `K` determines the specific index being referenced as `times[K - 1]`. Since `times` has been sorted, the order of elements has changed, but we do not have the previous values of `times` to specify the new order. However, we know that `ans` is the minimum between its previous value and `times[K - 1]` after `times` is sorted.

Since the specific content of `times` isn't provided before sorting, it cannot be determined exactly what `times[K - 1]` will be after the sort, but we can assert that `times` has been updated and sorted.

Output State: **`N` is an integer where 1 <= N <= 60; `K` is an integer where 1 <= K <= N; `x` is -998; `y` is -998; `times` is sorted; `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1] (updated).**
