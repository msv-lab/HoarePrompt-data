The variable `ans` is assigned the minimum value between its previous value and the value of `times[K - 1]`. Given that `K` is an integer within the range of 1 to `N`, `times[K - 1]` will access a valid index from the sorted list `times`. The specific value of `ans` changes based on its previous value and the value at `times[K - 1]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer where 1 <= N <= 60, `K` is an integer where 1 <= K <= N, `x` is -999, `y` is -999, `times` is sorted in ascending order, `ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` and `times[K - 1]**.
