The variable `ans` is assigned the minimum of its current value and the value of `times[K - 1]`. Since `ans` is already the sorted value of `times[K - 1]`, the operation will keep `ans` unchanged, as `min(ans, times[K - 1])` will always return `ans`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer where 1 <= N <= 60; `K` is an integer where 1 <= K <= N; `x` is -1000; `y` is -999; `times` is sorted; `ans` is equal to the sorted value of `times[K - 1]**
