To determine the output state after executing the provided Python code snippet, we will analyze the impact of the code step by step based on the initial state.

### Initial State:
- `meats` is a list of tuples with `N` greater than `i + 1`; 
- `d`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, and `d2` remain as defined (specific values are not provided in the initial state);
- `mx` is equal to `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`.

### Code Snippet:
```
my = cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2
```

### Impact of the Code:
- The variable `my` is assigned the value computed from the expression `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`.
- The variables `cy`, `dx`, `d2`, and `d` are used to compute the new value of `my`, but their states are not changed by this assignment.

### Calculation of the Result:
- The value of `my` will be calculated using the current values of `cy`, `dx`, `d2`, and `d`. 
- Since `d2` is a divisor in the expression, and `d` is involved in a square root calculation, it is necessary that `d2` is not zero and that the expression under the square root (`d2 * d - d * d`) is non-negative. The initial conditions specify that `meats` has a length greater than `i + 1`, but no specific values for `d`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, or `d2` are provided.

### Output State:
The initial conditions remain valid, with the only change being the introduction of the new value for `my`.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples with N greater than `i + 1`; `d`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, and `d2` remain as defined; `mx` is equal to `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2; `my` is equal to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2.**
