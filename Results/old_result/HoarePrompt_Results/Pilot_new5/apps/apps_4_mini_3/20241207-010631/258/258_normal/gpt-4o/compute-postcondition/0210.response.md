The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `meats`, `K`, and `T`. 

- `meats` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three values: two integers (`x_i` and `y_i`) representing the coordinates of the i-th piece of meat, and an integer (`c_i`) representing the hardness of the i-th piece of meat, with the condition that the hardness is between 1 and 100. 
- `K` is a positive integer such that it is at least 1 and at most equal to the length of the `meats` list.
- `T` is a real number representing the time threshold.

After executing the function body, the function has different return outcomes based on several conditions:

- Case_1 to Case_9: The function returns `True` indicating that various conditions have been met or successfully executed.
- Case_10: The function returns `False` when certain conditions are not satisfied, specifically if the loop did not execute and the variable `count` is less than `K`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of tuples `meats`, a positive integer `K`, and a real number `T`, and to return `True` or `False` based on the evaluation of internal conditions related to the values in `meats` and the parameters `K` and `T`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of tuples `meats`, a positive integer `K`, and a real number `T`, and returns `True` if various conditions are satisfied, or `False` if the loop did not execute and `count` is less than `K`.**
