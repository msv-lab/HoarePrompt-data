The variable `dy` is assigned the value of `(y1 - y2) / 2`. The values of `y1` and `y2` are not specified in the initial state, but they will affect the value of `dy`. The states of the other variables (`meats`, `d`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `d` is equal to (c1 - c2) * T / (c1 * c2) if d is less than 0, we skip to the next iteration of the loop; `cx` is equal to (x1 + x2) / 2; `cy` is equal to (y1 + y2) / 2; `dx` is equal to (x1 - x2) / 2; `dy` is equal to (y1 - y2) / 2.**
