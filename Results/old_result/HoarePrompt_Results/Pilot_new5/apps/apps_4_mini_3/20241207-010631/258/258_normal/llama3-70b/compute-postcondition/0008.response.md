The variable `times` is a list that is initialized with the result of the function `func_2(-1000, -999, -1000, -999)`. The code then sorts the `times` list in ascending order. The values of `N`, `K`, `x`, and `y` are not affected by the sorting operation.

Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `N`, `K`, `x`, and `y`, while updating the state of `times` to be sorted.

Output State: **`N` is an integer where 1 <= N <= 60; `K` is an integer where 1 <= K <= N; `x` is -1000; `y` is -999; `times` is sorted; `ans` is equal to the sorted value of `times[K - 1]**.
