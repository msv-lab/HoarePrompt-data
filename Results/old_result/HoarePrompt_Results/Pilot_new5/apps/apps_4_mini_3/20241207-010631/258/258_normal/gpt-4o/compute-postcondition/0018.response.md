The variable `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`. The value of `index` has been increased by 3 prior to this assignment, so it refers to a new position in the `data` list. The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` must be greater than 6, `K` is an integer assigned from `int(data[1])`, `meats` is a list containing the previous tuples plus the new tuple `(x, y, c)`, where `y` is `int(data[7])`, `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`, `c` is `int(data[index + 2])`, and `index` is now increased by 3.**
