The variable `cy` is assigned the value of (y1 + y2) / 2. The previous values of `y1` and `y2` are not provided, but they are still present and used in the calculation of `cy`. The values of other variables, including `meats`, `count`, `i`, `N`, `c1`, `c2`, `d`, and `cx`, remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `count` is the sum of weights `c` from `meats`, `i` is `k + 1`, `N` is greater than `k + 2`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are equal to `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, respectively, `c1 * T` is less than `c2 * T`, `d` is updated to `d / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to (x1 + x2) / 2; `cy` is equal to (y1 + y2) / 2.**
