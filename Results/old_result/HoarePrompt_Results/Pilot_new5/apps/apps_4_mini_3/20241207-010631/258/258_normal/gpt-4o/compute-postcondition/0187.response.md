The statement `x1, y1, c1 = meats[i]` assigns the elements of the tuple located at index `i` in the list `meats` to the variables `x1`, `y1`, and `c1`. This implies that `meats` contains tuples, and `i` is a valid index that satisfies the condition `i < N - 1`, which ensures that accessing `meats[i]` is valid.

The only variables that change as a result of this operation are `x1`, `y1`, and `c1`, which will take on the values of the corresponding elements from the tuple `meats[i]`.

The states of the other variables (`meats`, `count`, `i`, `j`, and `N`) are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `count` is the number of elements in `meats` satisfying the condition, `i` is less than `N - 1`, `j` is `i + 2`, `N` must be greater than `i + 2; x1, y1, c1 = meats[i]**
