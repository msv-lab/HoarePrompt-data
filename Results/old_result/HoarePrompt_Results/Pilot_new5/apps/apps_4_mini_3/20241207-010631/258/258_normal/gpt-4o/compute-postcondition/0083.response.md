The value of `cy` is assigned the result of the expression `(y1 + y2) / 2`, which calculates the average of `y1` and `y2`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `meats` is a list of tuples, `count` is less than `K`, `N` is greater than 1, `k + 1` is less than `N`, `j` is `k + 1`, `d` is updated to `d / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, and `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `count` is less than `K`, `N` is greater than 1, `k + 1` is less than `N`, `j` is `k + 1`, `d` is updated to `d / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`**.
