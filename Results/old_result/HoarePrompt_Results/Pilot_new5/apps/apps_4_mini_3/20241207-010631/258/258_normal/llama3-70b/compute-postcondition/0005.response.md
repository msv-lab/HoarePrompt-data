To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we need to analyze the effect of the line `ans = min(ans, times[K - 1])`. 

We know the following from the initial state:
- `N` is an integer where 1 <= N <= 60
- `K` is an integer where 1 <= K <= N
- `x` is -1000
- `y` is -1000
- `ans` is positive infinity
- `times` is equal to `func_2(-1000, -1000, -1000, -1000)`

The code executes the `min` function, which compares `ans` (currently positive infinity) with `times[K - 1]`. Since `ans` is positive infinity, the minimum value will be determined by `times[K - 1]`.

Assuming that `times` is defined and correctly populated by the function `func_2`, `times[K - 1]` will yield a certain integer value based on the function's implementation. However, we do not have the exact output of `func_2`, so we cannot specify the exact value for `times[K - 1]`. 

Since `ans` will now be updated to the value of `times[K - 1]`, the output state will reflect that `ans` is now equal to whatever value `times[K - 1]` holds.

Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`N` is an integer where 1 <= N <= 60; `K` is an integer where 1 <= K <= N; `x` is -1000; `y` is -1000; `ans` is equal to `times[K - 1]`; `times` is equal to `func_2(-1000, -1000, -1000, -1000`.**
