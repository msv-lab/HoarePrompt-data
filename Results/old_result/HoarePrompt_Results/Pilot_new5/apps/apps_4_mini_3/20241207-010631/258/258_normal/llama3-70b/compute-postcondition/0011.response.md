The variable `times` is assigned the result of the function `func_2(x, y, x, y)`, where `x` is -1000 and `y` is -998. The output value of `times` depends on the implementation of `func_2`, which is not provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `times`. 

After executing the code, the variable `ans` is assigned the sorted value of `times[K - 1]`, where `K` is an integer between 1 and `N`. 

Since `N` is between 1 and 60, and `K` is between 1 and `N`, the potential outcomes cannot be definitively stated without knowing how `func_2` operates. However, we know that `times` will hold some sorted list resulting from the function call.

The states of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer where 1 <= N <= 60; `K` is an integer where 1 <= K <= N; `x` is -1000; `y` is -998; `times` is the result of func_2(x, y, x, y); `ans` is equal to the sorted value of `times[K - 1]**
