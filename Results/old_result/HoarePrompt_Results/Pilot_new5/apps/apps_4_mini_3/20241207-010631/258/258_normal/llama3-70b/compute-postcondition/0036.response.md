The `times` list is sorted in ascending order. The values of `N`, `K`, `x`, `y`, and `ans` remain unchanged during this operation. The only variable that changes is `times`, which is now ordered. Since we do not have specific values for `times`, we can only state that it has been sorted.

Output State: **`N` is an integer where 1 <= N <= 60; `K` is an integer where 1 <= K <= N; `x` is -998; `y` is -999; `times` is now sorted; `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]**.
