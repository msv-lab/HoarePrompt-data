The variable `dy` is assigned the value `(y1 - y2) / 2`. The initial state includes the values of `y1` and `y2`, which were not specified but can be expressed in terms of their relationship. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `count` is less than `K`, `N` is greater than 1, `k + 1` is less than `N`, `j` is `k + 1`, `d` is updated to `d / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`.**
