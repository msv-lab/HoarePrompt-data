Initial State: `meats` is a list of tuples, `count` is the sum of `c` for each tuple `(x, y, c)` and is less than `K`, `d` is less than 0, `d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T`, and `d` is now `d / (c1 * c2)`

```
cx = (x1 + x2) / 2
```

Now, please think step by step: The value of `cx` is calculated as the average of `x1` and `x2`. The states of the other variables are not affected, and their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `meats` is a list of tuples, `count` is the sum of `c` for each tuple `(x, y, c)` and is less than `K`, `d` is less than 0, `d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T`, and `d` is now `d / (c1 * c2)`, and `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `count` is the sum of `c` for each tuple `(x, y, c)` and is less than `K`, `d` is less than 0, `d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T`, `d` is now `d / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`**
