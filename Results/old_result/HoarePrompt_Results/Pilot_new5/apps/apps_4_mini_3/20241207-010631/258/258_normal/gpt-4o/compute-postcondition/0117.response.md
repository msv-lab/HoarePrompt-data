According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `N`. If `j` starts at `i + 1` and needs to be less than `N` for the loop to execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` would have been `i + 1`, and for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` must become `i + 2`. Therefore, `j` must be less than `N` which implies that `N` must be greater than `i + 2`.

State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `count` is the sum of weights `c` from `meats` where the distance from `(mx, my)` is less than or equal to `T`, `count` is greater than or equal to `K`, j is `i + 2`, and `N` must be greater than `i + 2**
