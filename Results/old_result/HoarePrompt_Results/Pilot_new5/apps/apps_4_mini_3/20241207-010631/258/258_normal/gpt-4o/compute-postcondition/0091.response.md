Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `count` is less than `K`, `N` is greater than 1, `k + 1` is less than `N`, `j` is `k + 1`, `d` is updated to `d / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is equal to `(1/4) * ((x1 - x2) * (y1 - y2))`, `mx` is calculated as `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, and `my` is equal to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`.**
