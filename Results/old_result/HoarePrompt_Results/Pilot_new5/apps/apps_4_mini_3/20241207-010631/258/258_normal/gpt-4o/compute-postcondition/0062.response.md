Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `d` is now `d / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is now equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is now equal to `dx * dx + dy * dy`, `count` is the sum of values satisfying the condition based on `mx`, `my`, `T`, and the elements of `meats`, `j` is `i + 2`, `N` must be greater than `i + 2`, and the program continues execution.**
