The function accepts an integer `N` (ranging from 1 to 60), an integer `K` (ranging from 1 to `N`), and a list of tuples `meats` where each tuple contains three integers representing coordinates and hardness values of meat pieces. It performs a binary search to find a value `high` such that the difference between `high` and a lower bound `low` is less than or equal to 1e-07. The function returns `high`, which indicates a convergence to a precise value based on the conditions evaluated by the unspecified `func_1`. If `func_1` behaves unexpectedly or if `meats` is improperly formatted, the function may not perform as intended.
