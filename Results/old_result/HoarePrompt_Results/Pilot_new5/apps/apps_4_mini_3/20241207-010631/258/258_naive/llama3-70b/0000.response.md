The provided program attempts to solve the problem of finding the optimal placement of a heat source to minimize the time required to grill K pieces of meat based on their coordinates and hardness.

Examining the code, we notice the following:

1. **Coordinate Handling**: The program loops through all integer coordinates from -1000 to 1000 to test possible placements of the heat source. This is not optimal since the solution may not lie on integer coordinates. It should be able to handle real numbers for X and Y, not just integers.

2. **Temperature Calculation**: The function `func_2` computes the time required for each piece of meat based on the current X and Y. It returns a list of times which is sorted to find the K-th smallest time. This part seems correct, as it properly computes the time based on the formula provided.

3. **Sorting**: The sorting of times and finding the K-th element appears to be correct based on the requirement that K pieces of meat are to be grilled.

However, the critical flaw lies in the search space of potential heat source placements. By only checking integer values for X and Y, it fails to guarantee finding the optimal solution because the optimal placement of the heat source might not align with integer coordinates.

**Example of a case where it fails**:
- Suppose we have the following input:
```
3 2
0 0 1
1 1 1
0.5 0.5 1
```
The optimal heat source placement would likely be at (0.5, 0.5), but the program would not check this because it only iterates over integer values, potentially leading to a less optimal time result.

Therefore, since the program does not cover all necessary placements for the heat source, it can give incorrect results based on the problem specifications.

Correctness: **False**.
