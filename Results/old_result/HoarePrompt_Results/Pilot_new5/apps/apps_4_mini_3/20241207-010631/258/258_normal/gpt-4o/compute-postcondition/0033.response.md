The command `continue` is used within loops to skip the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration without executing the remaining code in the loop body. In this case, no variables are modified, and no calculations are performed. The values of `meats` and `d` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples with N greater than `i + 1`, `d` is equal to `c1 * T - c2 * T` and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
