According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `y`, which will take values from -1000 to 1000, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is at a position where it can take the next value. Given that the current value of `y` should be incremented by 1 for the next iteration, to execute the loop one more time, `y` will be -999. The loop will continue executing until `y` reaches 1000.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `y` should be -999. The other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop's execution.

State: **`N` is an integer where 1 <= N <= 60; `K` is an integer where 1 <= K <= N; `x` is -998; `y` is -999; `times` is sorted in ascending order; `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`**
