Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are assigned the values of `x2`, `y2`, `c2` respectively, and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are assigned the previous values of `x1`, `y1`, `c1`. `count` is less than `K`, `N` is greater than 1, `k + 1` is less than `N`, `j` is `k + 1`, and the current value of `c1 * T` is less than the current value of `c2 * T`.**
