The function accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y`, which represent the coordinates of a heat source, and two real number parameters `X` and `Y`, which are the coordinates where the heat source is placed. It returns a list of values, where each value is the product of a coefficient `c` from `meats` and the result of calling the function `func_1` with the arguments (x, y, X, Y). The behavior of the function depends on the definition of `func_1` and the contents of the `meats` variable. It assumes that `meats` is defined in the scope where this function is called and has a structure that allows for unpacking into `x`, `y`, and `c`. If `meats` is not defined or does not have the expected structure, it will raise an error during execution.
