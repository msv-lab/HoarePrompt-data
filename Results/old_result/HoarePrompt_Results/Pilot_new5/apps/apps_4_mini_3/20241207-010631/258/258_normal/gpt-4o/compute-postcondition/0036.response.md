The variable `cx` is assigned the value of the average of `x1` and `x2`, calculated as `(x1 + x2) / 2`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `meats` is a list of tuples with N greater than `i + 1`; `d` is equal to `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)` if `d` is not negative; `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`.
