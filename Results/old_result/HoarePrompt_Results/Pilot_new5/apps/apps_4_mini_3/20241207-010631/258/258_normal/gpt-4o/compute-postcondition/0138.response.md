Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `count` is the sum of weights `c` from `meats` where the distance from `(mx, my)` is less than or equal to `T`, and `count` is less than K if the loop executes less than two times, or `count` is greater than or equal to `K` if the loop executes two or more times; `i` has been incremented to `k + 1` and `N` is greater than 1.**
