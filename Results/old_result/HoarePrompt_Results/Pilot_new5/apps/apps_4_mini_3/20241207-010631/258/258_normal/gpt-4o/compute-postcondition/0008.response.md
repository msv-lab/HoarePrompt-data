The variable `c` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 2])`. The value of `index` is 2, so `index + 2` equals 4. Therefore, `c` is assigned the value of `int(data[4])`. The values of `N`, `K`, `meats`, `index`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` must be greater than or equal to 1, `K` is an integer assigned from `int(data[1])`, `meats` is an empty list, `index` is 2, `x` is assigned the value `int(data[2])`, `y` is assigned the value `int(data[3])`, `c` is assigned the value `int(data[4])`.**
