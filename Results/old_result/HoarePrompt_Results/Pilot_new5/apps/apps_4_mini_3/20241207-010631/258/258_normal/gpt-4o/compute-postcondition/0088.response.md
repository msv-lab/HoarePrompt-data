The statement `continue` is used within loops to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration. Therefore, while the values of the variables remain unchanged, we are now skipping the current iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `count` is less than `K`, `N` is greater than 1, `k + 1` is less than `N`, `j` is `k + 1`, `d` is updated to `d / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is equal to `(1/4) * ((x1 - x2) * (y1 - y2))`, and the current value of `d * d2` is greater than `d2`, and we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop.**
