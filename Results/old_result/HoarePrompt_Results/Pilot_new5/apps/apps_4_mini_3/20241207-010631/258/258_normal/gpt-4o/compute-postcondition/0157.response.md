Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `count` is the sum of weights `c` from `meats`, `i` is `k + 1`, `N` is greater than `k + 2`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are equal to `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, respectively, `c1 * T` is less than `c2 * T`, `d` is updated to `d / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to (x1 + x2) / 2, `cy` is equal to (y1 + y2) / 2, `dx` is 0, `dy` is (y1 - y2) / 2, `d2` is equal to ((y1 - y2) / 2), and the current value of `d * d2` is greater than `d2`.**
