Postcondition: ***`meats` is a list of tuples; `count` is the sum of weights `c` from `meats` where the distance from `(mx, my)` is less than or equal to `T`; `count` is greater than or equal to `K`; `j` is `i + 2`; `N` is greater than `i + 2`; if `c1 * T < c2 * T`, then `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are assigned the values of `meats[j]`, and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are assigned the values of `meats[i]`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
