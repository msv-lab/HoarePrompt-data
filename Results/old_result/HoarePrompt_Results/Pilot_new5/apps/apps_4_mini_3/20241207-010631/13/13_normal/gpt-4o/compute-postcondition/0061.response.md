According to the code, the for loop iterates through the `segments` list, starting from index 1. The variable `i` is currently 2, which means it has completed the iteration for index 1 and is about to execute for index 2. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `segments`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `segments` has at least 3 elements, allowing the loop to execute again for index 2. For the next iteration, `i` will be increased by 1, making it 3. For the loop to continue executing, `i` must be less than `len(segments)`, which currently we know must be at least 3.

Thus, we update the values accordingly for the next iteration:

State: **`i` is 3, `segments` has at least 4 elements, `prev_start` is `segments[2][0]`, `prev_end` is `segments[2][1]`, `curr_start` is `segments[3][0]`, `curr_end` is `segments[3][1]`**
