Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 2, and `j` is -1. If `s[j]` is 'G', then `beauty` can be either 3 or 4 depending on the character at index `j` in string `s`. Otherwise, if `s[j]` is not 'G', then `beauty` can be either 2 or 3 depending on the character at index `j` in string `s`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
