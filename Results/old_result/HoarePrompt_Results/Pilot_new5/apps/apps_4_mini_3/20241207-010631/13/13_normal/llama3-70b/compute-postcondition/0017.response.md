The value of `left` is incremented by 1. Since the initial value of `left` is 2, after the increment, `left` becomes 3. Other variables remain unaffected, and the conditions regarding `n`, `s`, `golden`, `max_beauty`, `curr_beauty`, and `right` remain valid.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list containing the indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty` is either 0 or `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is 3, `right` must be greater than 2, and `s[2]` must not be 'G'**
