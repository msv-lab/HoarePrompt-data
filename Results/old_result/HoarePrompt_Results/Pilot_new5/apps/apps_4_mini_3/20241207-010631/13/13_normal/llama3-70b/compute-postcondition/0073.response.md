To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we consider the information provided about the loop. The loop iterates backward from index `i - 1` down to `0`, checking each character in the string `s` to see if it equals 'G'. The variable `beauty` is incremented each time a 'G' is encountered.

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 0, the current value of `s[i]` is 'G', the current value of `s[i + 1]` is 'S', `beauty` is 1.

**Analysis of the Loop Executions:**

1. **Output State after the loop executes 1 time:** 
   - `beauty` is updated to 2 if `s[i - 1]` is 'G', otherwise, it remains 1.
   - `j` is 0 (the previous index).
   - The character at `s[j]` is checked, and if it equals 'G', `beauty` becomes 2. If not, it breaks and `beauty` remains 1.
   - *Conditions:* `s[i - 1]` must exist, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 1.

2. **Output State after the loop executes 2 times:**
   - `j` is now -1 after decrementing again, which means no further characters can be checked beyond index 0.
   - If `s[0]` is 'G', `beauty` will increase based on the checks performed in the first iteration.
   - The loop can continue only if `s[j]` equals 'G' for both iterations.
   - *Conditions:* `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 1, and `s[0]` must exist and is checked.

3. **Final Output State after the loop executes all possible times:**
   - The loop will evaluate the characters up to index 0, which includes checking `s[0]`.
   - If `s[0]` is 'G', `beauty` will be incremented based on the number of 'G's encountered from the starting position down to index 0.
   - If `s[j]` is not 'G' at any point, the loop will break and the final value of `beauty` will reflect the count of consecutive 'G's from `s[i - 1]` down to the last 'G'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 1, `beauty` is the count of 'G's found from `s[i-1]` down to `s[0]`.**
