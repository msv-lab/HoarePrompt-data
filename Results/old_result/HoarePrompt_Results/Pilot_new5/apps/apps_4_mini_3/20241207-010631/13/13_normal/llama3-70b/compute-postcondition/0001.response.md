In the given code snippet, `s` is assigned the value of `input()`. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer between 2 and 100,000, and that the second input (which is now assigned to `s`) is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'G' and 'S'. 

Since we don't know the specific value of the input string, we will state that `s` will be a string of length `n`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'G' and 'S'**
