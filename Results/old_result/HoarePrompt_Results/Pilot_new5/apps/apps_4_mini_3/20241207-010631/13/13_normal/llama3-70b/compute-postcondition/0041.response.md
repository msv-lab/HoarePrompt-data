The variable `curr_beauty` is assigned the value of `0`. This will override the previous value of `curr_beauty`, which was incremented by `1`. Therefore, the new value of `curr_beauty` will be `0`, and any references to its previous value will not hold. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S', `golden` contains the indices of 'G' in `s`, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is the index of the first 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty + 1`, `right` is 2.**
