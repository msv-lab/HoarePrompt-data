The value of `left` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The other variables remain unchanged, including `n`, `s`, `golden`, `max_beauty`, `curr_beauty`, and `right`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list containing the indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty + 1`, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is 1, `right` is 1, and `s[0]` must be 'S'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list containing the indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty + 1`, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is 1, `right` is 1, and `s[0]` must be 'S'**.
