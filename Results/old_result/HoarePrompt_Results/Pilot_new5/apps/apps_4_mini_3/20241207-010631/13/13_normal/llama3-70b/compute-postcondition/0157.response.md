The variable `max_beauty_one_swap` is now assigned the maximum value between its current value and the variable `beauty`. The initial state does not provide a specific value for `max_beauty_one_swap`, so we state it as an unknown value. The variable `beauty` is a defined value based on the substring conditions described. 

Since no other variables are affected by this code, the output state remains mostly the same, with the key change being the new value of `max_beauty_one_swap`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 3, `j` is at least 5, `beauty` is the count of consecutive 'G's found in the substring `s[i - 1]` down to `s[0]` plus the count of consecutive 'G's found from `s[5]` until a non-'G' character is encountered, `max_beauty_one_swap` is now max(`max_beauty_one_swap`, `beauty`).**
