Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `trophies` is a string of length `n`, `segments` contains the tuple (1, i - 1) if `i` is the index of the first character in `trophies` that is not 'G', and `trophies` remains unchanged. If `i` is 2 and the character at position `i` in `trophies` is 'S' and not 'G', `segments` remains an empty list.***
