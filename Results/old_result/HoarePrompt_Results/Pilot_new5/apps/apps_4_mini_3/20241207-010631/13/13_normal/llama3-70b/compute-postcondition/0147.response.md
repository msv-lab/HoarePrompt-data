Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 5, `i` is 3, `j` is 5. If the character at position `j` in string `s` is 'G', then `beauty` is incremented by 1 for the count of consecutive 'G's found in the substring `s[i - 1]` down to `s[0]`. If the character at position `j` in string `s` is not 'G', then `beauty` remains as the count of consecutive 'G's found in the substring `s[i - 1]` down to `s[0]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
