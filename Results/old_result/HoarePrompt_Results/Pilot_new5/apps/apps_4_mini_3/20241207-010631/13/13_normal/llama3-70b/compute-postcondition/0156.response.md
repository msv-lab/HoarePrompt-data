To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the behavior of the loop and the conditions required for its execution.

1. The loop starts at `j = i + 2`, which means it begins at index 5 (since `i` is 3).
2. The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `n`.
3. For each iteration, if `s[j]` is 'G', `beauty` is incremented by 1. If `s[j]` is not 'G', the loop breaks.

From the provided output states after 1, 2, and 3 iterations:
- After 1 iteration: `j` is 5, `n` must be at least 5.
- After 2 iterations: `j` is 6, `n` must be greater than 6.
- After 3 iterations: `j` is 7, `n` must be greater than 7.

This implies that the loop can keep executing as long as there are 'G's in the string starting from index 5 and potentially continues until index `n - 1` (or until it encounters a character that is not 'G').

Now, to summarize the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider:
- If the loop executes and counts consecutive 'G's from index 5 onward, `beauty` will reflect the total number of consecutive 'G's starting from `s[5]`.
- If there are no 'G's starting from `s[5]`, the loop will terminate before modifying `beauty`, keeping its original value which is the count of 'G's from `s[i - 1]` down to `s[0]`.

Therefore, the output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 3, `j` is at least 5, `beauty` is the count of consecutive 'G's found in the substring `s[i - 1]` down to `s[0]` plus the count of consecutive 'G's found from `s[5]` until a non-'G' character is encountered.**
