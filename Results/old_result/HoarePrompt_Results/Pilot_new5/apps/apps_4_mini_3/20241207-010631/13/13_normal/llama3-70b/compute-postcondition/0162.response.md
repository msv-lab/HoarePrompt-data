Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 <= n <= 100000) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'. It calculates the maximum number of consecutive 'G's found in the string and the maximum beauty obtainable by swapping one 'G' with one adjacent 'S'. The function then prints the greater of these two values. If there are no 'G's in the string, the maximum beauty will be calculated based on the available 'G's surrounding an 'S' for potential swapping. **
