Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n`, which specifies the length of the string `trophies`, and a string `trophies` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'. It returns 0 if there are no 'G' characters in the string. If there is exactly one segment of consecutive 'G' characters, it returns the length of that segment. If there are multiple segments of 'G' characters, it calculates the maximum length of these segments, and returns the minimum of (maximum length + 1) and `n`. It properly handles the cases of empty segments and adjacent segments of 'G' characters. **
