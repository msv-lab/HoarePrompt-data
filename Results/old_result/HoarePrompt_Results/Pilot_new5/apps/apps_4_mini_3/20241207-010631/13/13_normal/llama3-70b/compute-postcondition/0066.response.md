The value of `beauty` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `beauty` could either be 1 or 2 based on the value of `s[0]`. After the operation, if `beauty` was 1, it will now be 2; if it was 2, it will now be 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 1, `s[0]` must exist and be checked, `beauty` is either 2 or 3 based on its previous value, and `j` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 1, `s[0]` must exist and be checked, `beauty` is either 2 or 3, and `j` is 0.**
