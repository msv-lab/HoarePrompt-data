The value of `beauty` is incremented by 1. Given that `beauty` can only be 1, 2, or 3, the new value of `beauty` will be either 2, 3, or 4 respectively. The states of the other variables remain unchanged, so the output state reflects this change for `beauty`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `beauty` is either 2, 3, or 4, `j` is `i - 3`, `i` must be greater than or equal to 3**
