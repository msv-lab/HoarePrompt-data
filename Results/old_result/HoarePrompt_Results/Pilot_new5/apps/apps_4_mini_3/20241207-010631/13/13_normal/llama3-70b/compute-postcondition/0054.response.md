The value of `max_beauty` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`. The previous values of the affected variables are not specified, but `max_beauty` will definitely reflect the greater of its own previous value and the value of `curr_beauty`. The other variables remain unchanged; hence, we will retain their initial descriptions.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S', `golden` contains the indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty` is updated to max(`max_beauty`, `curr_beauty`), `curr_beauty` is unchanged, `left` is the index of the first 'G' in `s` or equal to `n` if there are no 'G's in `s`, and `right` is equal to `n - 1`.**
