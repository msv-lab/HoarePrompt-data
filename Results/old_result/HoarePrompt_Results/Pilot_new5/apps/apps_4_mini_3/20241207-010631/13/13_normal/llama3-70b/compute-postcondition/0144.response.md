The value of `beauty` is incremented by 1. Since `beauty` was already counting consecutive 'G's found in the substring from `s[i - 1]` down to `s[0]`, it now reflects one additional 'G' due to the current value of `s[j]`, which is also 'G'. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 5, `i` is 3, `j` is 5, `beauty` is the count of consecutive 'G's found in the substring `s[i - 1]` down to `s[0]` plus 1, and the current value of `s[j]` is 'G'.**
