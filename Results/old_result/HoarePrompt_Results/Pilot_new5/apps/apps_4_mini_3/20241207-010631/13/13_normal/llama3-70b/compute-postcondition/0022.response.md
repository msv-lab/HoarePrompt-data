Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list containing the indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty` is either 0 or the value of `curr_beauty`, if the character at index `right` in `s` is 'G', then `curr_beauty` is 1, and both `left` and `right` are 0. Otherwise, `left` is set to the index of the first 'G' in `s` or remains as `right` if there are no 'G's before `right`, `right` remains unchanged, and if `left` is less than `right`, `curr_beauty` is incremented by 1.***
