The code updates the variable `max_beauty_one_swap` by taking the maximum of its current value and the value of `beauty`. The previous values of the variables are not specified, but we know that `beauty` counts consecutive 'G's found in `s` from `s[i+2]` to the last 'G' before the first non-'G' character or until `n`. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is in the range 2 to 100000, `i` is 1, `j` is the index of the first non-'G' character after `i + 1` or `n`, `beauty` is the count of consecutive 'G's found in `s` from `s[i+2]` to the last 'G' before the first non-'G' character or until `n`, and `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of its previous value and `beauty`.**
