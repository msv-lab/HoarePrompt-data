The variable `left` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `left` was 1, so the new value of `left` becomes 2. The other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list containing the indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty` is either 0 or `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is 2, `right` must be greater than 1, and s[1] must not be 'G'.**
