The variable `beauty` is incremented by 1. The initial state does not provide a value for `beauty`, but since it is being incremented, we can state that its previous value is unknown. The other variables `n`, `i`, and `j` are unaffected. Therefore, the output state will reflect the increment of `beauty` along with the conditions of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 5, `i` is 1, `j` is 5, `beauty` is incremented by 1 (previous value is unknown).**
