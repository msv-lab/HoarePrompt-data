According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, so for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1, resulting in `i` being 2. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is still an integer between 2 and 100000.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 2**
