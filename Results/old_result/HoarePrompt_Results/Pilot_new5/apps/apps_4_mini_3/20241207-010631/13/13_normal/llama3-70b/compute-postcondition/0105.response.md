The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 2, `j` is -1, and `beauty` can be either 2 or 3 depending on the character at index `j` in string `s`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
