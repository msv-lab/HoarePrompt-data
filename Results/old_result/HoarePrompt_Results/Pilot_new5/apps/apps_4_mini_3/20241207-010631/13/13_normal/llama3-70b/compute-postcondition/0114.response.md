According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `j` can take on a new value that is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 4 and `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it 5. The only condition that must be satisfied for the loop to run one more time is that `n` must be greater than 5. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 2, `j` is 5**
