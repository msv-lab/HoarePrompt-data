The code `curr_beauty += 1` increments the value of `curr_beauty` by 1. Since `left` is 0 and `right` is 1, the condition of `left < right` is true, which means `curr_beauty` will increase. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given that `max_beauty` is either 0 or the value of `curr_beauty`, it is possible that `max_beauty` might also change depending on the context not provided here. However, without further information about the prior value of `curr_beauty`, we cannot definitively state if `max_beauty` changes or not.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list containing the indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty` is either 0 or the value of `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is incremented by 1, `left` is 0, `right` is 1**.
