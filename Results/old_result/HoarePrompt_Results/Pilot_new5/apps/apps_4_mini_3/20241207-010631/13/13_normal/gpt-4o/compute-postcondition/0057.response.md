The line of code assigns the values of `segments[i - 1]` to `prev_start` and `prev_end`. Given that `i` is 2, this means `i - 1` is 1. Therefore, `prev_start` will be assigned the value of `segments[1][0]`, and `prev_end` will be assigned the value of `segments[1][1]`. The values of `curr_start` and `curr_end` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `segments` has at least 3 elements, `prev_start` is `segments[1][0]`, `prev_end` is `segments[1][1]`, `curr_start` is `segments[2][0]`, `curr_end` is `segments[2][1]**.
