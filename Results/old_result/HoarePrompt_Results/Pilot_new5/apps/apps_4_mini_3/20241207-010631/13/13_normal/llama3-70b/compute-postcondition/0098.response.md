Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 2, and `j` is 1. If the character at index `j` in string `s` is 'G', then `beauty` is updated to 2. If the character at index `j` in string `s` is not 'G', then `beauty` remains 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
