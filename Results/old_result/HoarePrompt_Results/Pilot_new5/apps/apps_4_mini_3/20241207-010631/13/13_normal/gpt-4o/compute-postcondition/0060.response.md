Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `segments` has at least 3 elements, `prev_start` is `segments[1][0]`, `prev_end` is `segments[1][1]`, `curr_start` is `segments[2][0]`, `curr_end` is `segments[2][1]`. If the difference between `curr_start` and `prev_end` is 2, then `max_length` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and the sum of the lengths of the segments at indices 1 and 2 plus 1. Otherwise, `max_length` remains unchanged.***
