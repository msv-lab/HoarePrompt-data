The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be at least 4, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `beauty` is the count of 'G's found from `s[i-1]` down to `s[0]`, and the character at `s[3]` is not 'G', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
