The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `n` must be at least 5, `i` is 3, `j` is 5, `beauty` is the count of consecutive 'G's found in the substring `s[i - 1]` down to `s[0]`, and the character at position `j` in string `s` is not 'G', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
