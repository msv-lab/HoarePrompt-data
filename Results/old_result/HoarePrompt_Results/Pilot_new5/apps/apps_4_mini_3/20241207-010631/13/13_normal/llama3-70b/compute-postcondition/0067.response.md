The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 1, `s[0]` must exist and be checked, `beauty` is either 1 or 2 based on the value of `s[0]`, and `j` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
