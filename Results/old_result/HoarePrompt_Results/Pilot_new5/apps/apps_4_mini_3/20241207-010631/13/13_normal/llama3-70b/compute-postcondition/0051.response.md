Postcondition: ***`left` is equal to the index of the first 'G' in the string `s`, `right` is equal to the index of the first 'G' in the string `s` or greater, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S', `golden` contains the indices of 'G' in `s`, `curr_beauty` is now 1 (previous value + 1) and `max_beauty` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and the new value of `curr_beauty`, if `left` is less than `right`. If there are no 'G's in `s`, then `left` will equal `right`, resulting in the original values of `left` and `right` remaining unchanged, and `curr_beauty` and `max_beauty` will retain their previous values.***
