To verify the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to go through both the code and the output hints carefully.

### Problem Description Summary:
Lara starts at (1, 1) in a dungeon represented by an n x m matrix. She moves down to (n, 1), then in a snake-like pattern throughout the matrix until she has moved k times. The task is to determine her final position after k moves.

### Code Review:
```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().strip().split()
(n, m, k) = (int(data[0]), int(data[1]), int(data[2]))
func_1(n, m, k)

def func_1(n, m, k):
    if k < n - 1:
        print(k + 1, 1)
    else:
        k -= n - 1
        full_rows = k // (m - 1)
        remaining_steps = k % (m - 1)
        if full_rows % 2 == 0:
            row = n - full_rows
            col = 2 + remaining_steps
        else:
            row = n - full_rows
            col = m - remaining_steps
        print(row, col)
```

1. **Lara's movement**:
   - The first if statement handles the moves when k is less than the number of vertical moves (n - 1). This part seems correct as it directly returns her position in the first column.
  
2. **Handling snake-like movement**:
   - The else clause handles scenarios where k is greater than or equal to n - 1.
   - It calculates how many full horizontal rows Lara has crossed and how many steps remain in the current row.
   - Depending on whether the number of full rows is even or odd, it determines whether she is moving left or right in the last row.

### Edge Cases:
- **Minimum values**: For n = 2, m = 2, k = 0, the output should be (1, 1). It correctly returns (1, 1).
- **Maximum k without overflow**: For large values of n, m, and k (just under n * m), we need to ensure that the calculations for `full_rows` and `remaining_steps` still stay within valid bounds and map correctly to the grid.
- **Last move checks**: We need to ensure that the function accurately calculates her position when k takes values that result in her being at the edge of the dungeon, especially as m increases.

### Output Hints Review:
The output hints summarize the functionâ€™s expected behavior and validate the calculated positions based on the movement pattern. They indicate that the function determines the correct cell based on the number of moves k and switches the expected column based on the parity of full rows traveled.

### Final Assessment:
After examining the code and the output hints, it appears that the program correctly implements the logic needed to determine the final position in the matrix as described in the problem. There are no apparent edge cases where the code fails to account for the expected outcome.

Thus, based on the analysis, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**.
