To determine the output state after executing the given code snippet, we will analyze the expressions within the `print` statement based on the initial state of the variables.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an even integer in the range [2, 10^9].
- `m` is an even integer in the range [2, 10^9].
- `k` is updated to `k % (n * 2 - 2)` and is currently less than `n * 2 - 2`.
- `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`.

### Analyzing the Code:
1. **First Expression**: `n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1`
   - `k - n + 1` gives a value that will be used in the modulo operation.
   - The modulo operation `(k - n + 1) % (n - 1)` results in a value in the range `[0, n-2]` since `k` is less than `n * 2 - 2` and `k >= n - 1`.
   - Thus, the first expression results in some integer value derived from the calculation involving `n` and `k`.

2. **Second Expression**: `(k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1`
   - This computes how many full `(n - 1)` chunks are in `k - n + 1`, which is guaranteed to be non-negative since `k >= n - 1`.
   - This will return an integer value and adding 1 will increase the result by 1.

### Updating Variables:
- `n` remains unchanged as it is directly printed.
- `m` remains unchanged as it is not referenced in the code.
- `k` is not altered by the print statement, so it remains as is.

### Conclusion:
The output of the print statement will produce two integers based on the expressions calculated above, but since we do not have specific values for `n` and `k`, we will represent them in terms of their derived expressions.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer in the range [2, 10^9], `m` is an even integer in the range [2, 10^9], `k` is updated to `k % (n * 2 - 2)` and is less than `n * 2 - 2` and `k >= n - 1`; the output is (n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1, (k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1).**
