The variable `remaining_steps` is assigned the value of `k % (m - 1)`. Since `k` is a non-negative integer and `m` is an even integer greater than or equal to 2, the expression `(m - 1)` will also be a positive integer. Therefore, `remaining_steps` will be the remainder when `k` is divided by `(m - 1)`, which is guaranteed to be between `0` and `(m - 2)` (inclusive).

The states of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, and `full_rows`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an even integer greater than or equal to 2, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < n * m - (n - 1), `full_rows` is equal to `k // (m - 1)`, and `remaining_steps` is equal to `k % (m - 1)`**
