Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are even integers in the range [2, 10^9]. If `k` is less than `n * 2 - 2`, the output is (n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1, (k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1). Otherwise, if `k` is greater than or equal to `n * 2 - 2`, then `k` is still updated to `k % (n * 2 - 2)` and maintains its value that is greater than or equal to `n - 1`.***
