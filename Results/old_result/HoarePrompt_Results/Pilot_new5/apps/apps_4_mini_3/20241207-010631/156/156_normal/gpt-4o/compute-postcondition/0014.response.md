Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are even integers greater than or equal to 2. If `k` is a non-negative integer less than `n - 1`, then `k + 1` is printed and is greater than or equal to 1. Otherwise, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `k` < `n * m - (n - 1)`, where `full_rows` is equal to `k // (m - 1)`, `remaining_steps` is equal to `k % (m - 1)`, `row` is equal to either `n - full_rows` or an odd integer equal to `n - full_rows` depending on whether `full_rows` is even or odd, and `col` is equal to either `2 + remaining_steps` or `m - remaining_steps` depending on the parity of `full_rows`. The values of `row` and `col` have been printed.***
