The function accepts two even integers `n` and `m` (both greater than or equal to 2) and a non-negative integer `k` (such that 0 â‰¤ k < n * m). If `k` is less than `n - 1`, it prints `k + 1` and `1`. Otherwise, it calculates the number of full rows (`full_rows`) and remaining steps (`remaining_steps`) based on the value of `k`. It then determines the `row` and `col` positions to print, switching between two configurations based on whether `full_rows` is even or odd. The function prints these calculated `row` and `col` values. The function does not return any value; it only prints output.
