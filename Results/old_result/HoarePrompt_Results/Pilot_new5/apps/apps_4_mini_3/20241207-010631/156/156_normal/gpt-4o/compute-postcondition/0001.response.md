The code prints the values of `k + 1` and `1`. The variable `k` is specified to be less than `n - 1`, but its exact value is not provided. However, we can deduce that since `k` is a non-negative integer and less than `n - 1`, the result of `k + 1` will still be a non-negative integer and at least `1`. The other variables (`n`, `m`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are even integers greater than or equal to 2, `k` is a non-negative integer less than `n - 1`, `k + 1` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1, printed with 1.**
