To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the function `func_1` and ensure it accurately reflects the movement pattern described in the problem statement.

### Analysis of the Function

1. **Initial Movement Down:**
   - If `k < n - 1`, the program immediately outputs the coordinates `(k + 1, 1)`, which corresponds to Lara being in the first column moving vertically down. This is correct since for `k` values less than `n-1`, Lara has not yet moved beyond the first column.

2. **Movement Beyond the First Column:**
   - When `k >= n - 1`, Lara has reached the bottom of the first column and starts moving in a 'snake-like' fashion. After moving down `n-1` times, the program calculates the remaining steps:
     - `k -= n - 1` gives the number of horizontal moves Lara can still make.
     - `full_rows = k // (m - 1)` calculates how many full horizontal paths (from left to right or right to left) Lara has completed.
     - `remaining_steps = k % (m - 1)` calculates how far Lara has moved in the next row after completing the full horizontal movements.

3. **Determining the Position:**
   - The `if full_rows % 2 == 0` check establishes whether Lara is on an even-numbered row (starting from the bottom moving up). The calculations for `row` and `col` adjust based on this determination:
     - If she's on an even row, she moves right, starting from column 2.
     - If she's on an odd row, she moves left starting from column `m`.

### Potential Cases

Now we need to ensure that every case is handled correctly, especially edge cases:

- **Case of Maximum k:**
  Let's consider the maximum allowed value for `k`, which is `n * m - 1`. For the smallest matrix with `n=2` and `m=2`, `k` would be `3`. The function needs to handle this and return (2, 2) correctly.

- **Case when `k` equals `n - 1`:**
  This is when Lara has just finished moving down the first column. The function should return (n, 1) which is correct.

- **Boundary Conditions:**
  If `k = 0`, it should return (1, 1) which is valid.
  If `k = 1`, it should return (2, 1) which is also valid.
  If `k = 2`, it should return (1, 2) which is valid and so forth.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis above, each part of the journey through the dungeon is correctly handled by the function `func_1`, including the transitions and movements across the matrix. Therefore, I cannot find a specific case where the program fails to adhere to the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
