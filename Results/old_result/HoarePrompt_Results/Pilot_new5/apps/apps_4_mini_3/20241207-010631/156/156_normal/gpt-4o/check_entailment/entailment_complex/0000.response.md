To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the program step-by-step, especially focusing on how it calculates Lara's position based on the input parameters `n`, `m`, and `k`.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Input Parsing**: The input is read and split into three integers: `n`, `m`, and `k`. This is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Initial Condition**: 
   - If `k` is less than `n - 1`, the program simply outputs `(k + 1, 1)`. This corresponds to Lara moving down the first column from `(1, 1)` to `(n, 1)` where she will be at position `(k + 1, 1)`, which is correct.

3. **Condition for Moving to Other Columns**:
   - When `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, Lara has already moved down the first column and is now starting her snake-like motion.
   - The program calculates how many full rows Lara has completed in the snake-like manner using `full_rows = k // (m - 1)`. Each full row Lara completes is equivalent to moving right to the last column and then up one row (or down in the next iteration).
   - The remaining steps in the current row are calculated with `remaining_steps = k % (m - 1)`.

4. **Row and Column Calculation**:
   - The row number for Lara's position is determined by `row = n - full_rows`.
   - If `full_rows` is even, she is moving to the right in the current row and her column is calculated as `col = 2 + remaining_steps`.
   - If `full_rows` is odd, she is moving to the left in that row, so her column is `col = m - remaining_steps`.
   - This switching logic based on whether `full_rows` is even or odd is consistent with the snake-like pattern described. 

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic required to determine Lara's position after `k` moves in the dungeon represented by an `n x m` matrix. It handles both casesâ€”when `k` is small enough to be in the first column and when `k` requires calculation of the snake-like path across the subsequent columns.

### Final Verdict

After analyzing the provided program in relation to the problem description, we find that it consistently computes the correct cell coordinates for any valid inputs of `n`, `m`, and `k`. Therefore, the program meets all the requirements set forth in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
