Postcondition: ***`n` is between 2 and 100, `k` is between 1 and `n-1`, `s` is an input string, `g` is -1, `t` is 0, `i` is 0, and if the character at index `i` of the string `s` is 'T', then `t` is set to 0. If the character at index `i` of the string `s` is not 'T', the values of `n`, `k`, `s`, `g`, `t`, and `i` remain unchanged.***
