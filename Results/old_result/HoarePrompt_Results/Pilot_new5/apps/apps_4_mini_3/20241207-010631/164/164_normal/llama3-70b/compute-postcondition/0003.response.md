According to the code, the loop will execute for values of `i` starting from 0 up to `n-1`, which means the loop will execute exactly `n` times as long as `n` is at least 2. The current state indicates that `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), which ensures that the loop will execute. 

At the start of the loop, the variable `i` will take on the values starting from 0 to `n-1`. The initial state of `i` before the first iteration is 0. The states of `k`, `s`, `g`, and `t` do not impact the execution of the loop itself, but they may be relevant in the loop body which is omitted here. 

To summarize, the necessary adjustments to the state for the loop to execute are:

State: **`n` is between 2 and 100, `k` is between 1 and n-1, `s` is an input string, `g` is -1, `t` is -1, `i` is 0**
