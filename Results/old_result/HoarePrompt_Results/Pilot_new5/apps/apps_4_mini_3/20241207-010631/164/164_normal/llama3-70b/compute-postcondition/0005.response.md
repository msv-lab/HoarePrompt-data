The variable `g` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 0. The other variables remain unaffected. The updated value of `g` is now 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 2 and 100, `k` is between 1 and n-1, `s` is an input string, `g` is 0, `t` is -1, `i` is 0. The current character at index `i` of string `s` is 'G'.
