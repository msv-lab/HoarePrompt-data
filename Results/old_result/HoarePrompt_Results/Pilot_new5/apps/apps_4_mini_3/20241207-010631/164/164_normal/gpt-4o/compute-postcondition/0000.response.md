The code assigns values to the variables `n` and `k` by unpacking the result of `map(int, input().split())`. The `input()` function will take two space-separated integer inputs, which will be converted to integers by `map(int, ...)`. Since `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 and `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1`, the output state reflects that both `n` and `k` are now integers determined by user input, while the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is a user-defined integer between 2 and 100; `k` is a user-defined integer between 1 and `n-1`.**
