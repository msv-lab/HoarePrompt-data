The function accepts two integers `n` (between 2 and 100) and `k` (between 1 and `n-1`), along with a string of length `n` that contains exactly one 'G' (the grasshopper's starting position), one 'T' (the insect's position), empty cells represented by '.', and obstacles represented by '#'. It checks if the grasshopper can reach the insect by jumping `k` positions at a time without encountering any obstacles ('#'). If a path exists, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not handle cases where `G` and `T` are not present in the input string, as it assumes valid input based on the problem description.
