The statement `break` indicates that we are exiting the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. None of the variables `n`, `k`, `line`, `G_pos`, `T_pos`, `reachable`, and `pos` have their values changed by this statement, but the flow of control in the program is altered.

Therefore, the output state remains as it was, with the addition that we broke out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`n` is a user-defined integer between 2 and 100, `k` is a user-defined integer between 1 and `n-1`, `line` is a user-defined string input, `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos`, `reachable` is True, `pos` is `G_pos`, `pos` is equal to `T_pos`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
