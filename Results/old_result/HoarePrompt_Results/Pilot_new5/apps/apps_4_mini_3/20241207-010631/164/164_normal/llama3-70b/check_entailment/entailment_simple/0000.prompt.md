You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: On the way to Rio de Janeiro Ostap kills time playing with a grasshopper he took with him in a special box. Ostap builds a line of length n such that some cells of this line are empty and some contain obstacles. Then, he places his grasshopper to one of the empty cells and a small insect in another empty cell. The grasshopper wants to eat the insect.

Ostap knows that grasshopper is able to jump to any empty cell that is exactly k cells away from the current (to the left or to the right). Note that it doesn't matter whether intermediate cells are empty or not as the grasshopper makes a jump over them. For example, if k = 1 the grasshopper can jump to a neighboring cell only, and if k = 2 the grasshopper can jump over a single cell.

Your goal is to determine whether there is a sequence of jumps such that grasshopper will get from his initial position to the cell with an insect.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1) — the number of cells in the line and the length of one grasshopper's jump.

The second line contains a string of length n consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G' and 'T'. Character '.' means that the corresponding cell is empty, character '#' means that the corresponding cell contains an obstacle and grasshopper can't jump there. Character 'G' means that the grasshopper starts at this position and, finally, 'T' means that the target insect is located at this cell. It's guaranteed that characters 'G' and 'T' appear in this line exactly once.


-----Output-----

If there exists a sequence of jumps (each jump of length k), such that the grasshopper can get from his initial position to the cell with the insect, print "YES" (without quotes) in the only line of the input. Otherwise, print "NO" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
5 2
#G#T#

Output
YES

Input
6 1
T....G

Output
YES

Input
7 3
T..#..G

Output
NO

Input
6 2
..GT..

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first sample, the grasshopper can make one jump to the right in order to get from cell 2 to cell 4.

In the second sample, the grasshopper is only able to jump to neighboring cells but the way to the insect is free — he can get there by jumping left 5 times.

In the third sample, the grasshopper can't make a single jump.

In the fourth sample, the grasshopper can only jump to the cells with odd indices, thus he won't be able to reach the insect.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and n-1 (inclusive), and the input string of length n consists of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T' such that 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once.
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    g, t = -1, -1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'G':
            g = i
        elif s[i] == 'T':
            t = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is between 2 and 100, `k` is between 1 and `n-1`, `s` is an input string, `g` is the index of the last occurrence of 'G' in `s` or -1 if 'G' is not present, `t` is the index of the last occurrence of 'T' in `s` or -1 if 'T' is not present.
    if (g == -1 or t == -1) :
        print('NO')
    else :
        if (abs(t - g) % k == 0 and all(s[(g + i * k) % n] != '#' for i in range(abs(t -
    g) // k + 1))) :
            print('YES')
        else :
            print('NO')
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is between 2 and 100, `k` is between 1 and `n-1`, `s` is an input string, `g` is the index of the last occurrence of 'G' in `s`, which is not -1, and `t` is the index of the last occurrence of 'T' in `s`, which is not -1. If the absolute difference between `t` and `g` is divisible by `k` and all characters at indices `(g + i * k) % n` in `s` are not '#', then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if the absolute difference is not divisible by `k`, or there exists an integer `i` such that `s[(g + i * k) % n]` equals '#', then 'NO' is printed.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is between 2 and 100, `k` is between 1 and `n-1`, `s` is an input string. If either `g` (the index of the last occurrence of 'G' in `s`) or `t` (the index of the last occurrence of 'T' in `s`) is -1, the output is 'NO'. Otherwise, if `g` and `t` are not -1, and the absolute difference between `t` and `g` is divisible by `k`, and all characters at indices `(g + i * k) % n` in `s` are not '#', then 'YES' is printed. If either the absolute difference is not divisible by `k`, or there exists an integer `i` such that `s[(g + i * k) % n]` equals '#', then 'NO' is printed.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
