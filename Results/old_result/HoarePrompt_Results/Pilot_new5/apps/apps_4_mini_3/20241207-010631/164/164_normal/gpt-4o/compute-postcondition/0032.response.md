The code snippet executes a print statement, which does not alter any variables or states but outputs the string 'NO'. Since the preconditions remain valid and unchanged, the output will reflect the initial state along with the printed message.

Output State: **`n` is a user-defined integer between 2 and 100, `k` is a user-defined integer between 1 and `n-1`, `line` is a user-defined string input, `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos`, `reachable` is False, and `pos` is equal to `G_pos`; printed 'NO'**.
