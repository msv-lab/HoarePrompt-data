The code executes a `print` statement with the string 'NO'. This does not change any of the variable values, but it produces an output. The states of the variables remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 100, `k` is between 1 and `n-1`, `s` is an input string, `g` is the index of the last occurrence of 'G' in `s` or -1 if 'G' is not present, `t` is the index of the last occurrence of 'T' in `s` or -1 if 'T' is not present. The current value of `g` is -1 or `t` is -1. The output is 'NO'.**
