Postcondition: ***`n` is between 2 and 100, `k` is between 1 and `n-1`, `s` is an input string, `g` is the index of the last occurrence of 'G' in `s`, which is not -1, `t` is the index of the last occurrence of 'T' in `s`, which is not -1. The absolute difference between `t` and `g` is divisible by `k`, and for all integers `i` in the range from 0 to `abs(t - g) // k`, the character at the index `(g + i * k) % n` in `s` is not '#'.***
