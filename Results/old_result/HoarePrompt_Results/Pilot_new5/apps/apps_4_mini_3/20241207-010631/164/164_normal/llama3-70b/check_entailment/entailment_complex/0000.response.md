Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Here are the issues:

1. **Index Calculation**: The program tries to use `(g + i * k) % n` in a wrapping manner, which is unnecessary and incorrect in this context. The positions should not wrap around since the grasshopper can only jump within the bounds of the string and cannot go back to the beginning after reaching the end.

2. **Obstacle Check**: The condition `all(s[(g + i * k) % n] != '#' for i in range(abs(t - g) // k + 1))` checks for obstacles using a modulo operation, which can lead to incorrect checks if `g` and `t` are not in the same segment (i.e., if `g` is greater than `t` and the jump goes beyond the start of the string). The program should check only the cells between `g` and `t` without modulo wrapping.

3. **Path Validity**: The program does not correctly validate whether the grasshopper can reach 'T' from 'G' when considering the direction of jumps. It should just check in one direction (either left or right), depending on whether 'G' is to the left or right of 'T', rather than wrapping around.

### Example Case Where it Fails
Consider the input:
```
7 3
T..#..G
```
In this case, the grasshopper at position 5 cannot reach the insect at position 0 because there is an obstacle at position 3. The program would incorrectly evaluate this as reachable due to the modulo wrapping, leading to an incorrect output of "YES". 

Thus, the program fails to adhere to the problem description, and as such, it is not correct.
