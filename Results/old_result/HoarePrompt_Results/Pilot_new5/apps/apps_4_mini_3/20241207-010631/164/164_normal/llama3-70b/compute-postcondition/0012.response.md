The variable `g` is assigned the value of `i`, which is `n-1`. Since `n` is between 2 and 100, the value of `i` will be between 1 and 99. Therefore, `g` will take the value of `n-1`, which ranges from 1 to 99. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 100, `k` is between 1 and `n-1`, `s` is an input string, `g` is equal to `n-1`, `t` is either 0 or -1, `i` is `n-1`.**
