To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and see if it correctly identifies the smallest square frame that can encapsulate the 'w' pixels.

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the dimensions `n` and `m`, followed by the pixel representation of the monitor. This part appears to be handled correctly.

2. **Identifying White Pixels**: The program collects the coordinates of all white pixels ('w') in the list `white_pixels`. This seems to be working as intended.

3. **Calculating Frame Boundaries**: The program determines the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates of the white pixels to establish the outer boundaries of the square frame. This is done using:
   ```python
   (min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y) = (float('inf'), float('inf'), float('-inf'), float('-inf'))
   ```
   This should correctly compute the bounding box of the 'w' pixels.

4. **Frame Size Calculation**: The frame size is calculated based on the maximum distance between the min and max coordinates:
   ```python
   frame_size = max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1
   ```

5. **Checking Frame Size Against Monitor Size**: The code checks if the calculated `frame_size` exceeds the dimensions of the monitor:
   ```python
   if frame_size > max(n, m):
       print(-1)
   ```

6. **Constructing the Frame**: The program then attempts to draw the frame using '+' characters around the white pixels. It uses nested loops to iterate over the pixel grid.

7. **Edge Cases**: The program could fail if the frame calculated does not properly encapsulate all 'w' pixels when determining where to place the '+' characters. Specifically, the logic for adding '+' characters seems flawed because it only places them along the min and max coordinates without ensuring that the frame is correctly positioned around all 'w' pixels.

### Critical Test Case:
Consider the input:
```
3 5
w....
..w..
.....
```
Here, the white pixels form a non-rectangular pattern scattered vertically. The expected output should not be a square frame but rather should indicate that a frame cannot be formed correctly, and hence the output should be `-1`. However, the program may incorrectly attempt to create a square frame based on the outermost 'w' pixels.

Given this analysis, we can conclude that the program's logic does not cover all potential cases correctly, particularly when 'w' pixels are not positioned such that they can be encapsulated by a square frame.

Correctness: **False**
