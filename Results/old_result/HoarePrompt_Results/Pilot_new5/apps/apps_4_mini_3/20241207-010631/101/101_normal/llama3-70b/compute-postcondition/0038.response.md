The code `pixels[i][j] = '.'` assigns the value `'.'` to the element at the coordinates `(i, j)` in the `pixels` array. The value of `j` is `m + 1`, and since `j` is being used to index into `pixels`, it indicates that we're accessing a column that is one beyond the current maximum width of the relevant data.

The initial state provides that `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are the minimum and maximum coordinates of `white_pixels`, and `frame_size` is calculated based on these values. However, `frame_size` does not directly impact the assignment in this case. 

The values of `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` remain unchanged. The only variable that has a new value is `j`, which is effectively being used to access the `pixels` array.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are the minimum and maximum coordinates among all elements in `white_pixels`; `frame_size` is `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`, which is less than or equal to `max(n, m)`; `j` is `m + 1`, and `pixels[i][j]` is now set to '.'**
