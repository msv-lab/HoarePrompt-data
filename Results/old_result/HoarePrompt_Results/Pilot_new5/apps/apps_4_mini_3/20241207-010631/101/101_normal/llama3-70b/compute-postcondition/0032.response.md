Output State: **`min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are the minimum and maximum coordinates among all elements in `white_pixels`; `frame_size` is `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`, which is less than or equal to `max(n, m)`, where `n` and `m` are both greater than 0; `j` is `m`; `pixels[i][j]` is now '.'**
