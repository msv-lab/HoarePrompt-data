Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, and `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w'. If `top` is None, then `top` and `bottom` are both set to `n`, and `left` and `right` are both set to 0, with `i` equal to `n`, `j` equal to 0, and the current value of `screen[i][j]` being 'w'. Otherwise, if `top` is not None and `j` is greater than `right`, then `right` is updated to equal `j`.***
