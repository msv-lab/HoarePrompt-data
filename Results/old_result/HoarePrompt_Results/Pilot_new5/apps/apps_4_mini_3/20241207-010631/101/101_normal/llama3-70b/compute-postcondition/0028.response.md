Postcondition: ***`min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are the minimum and maximum coordinates among all elements in `white_pixels`, respectively. `frame_size` is `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`, which is less than or equal to `max(n, m)`, where `n` and `m` are both greater than 0. If `i` is either equal to `min_x` or `max_x`, and `j` is either equal to `min_y` or `max_y` with `pixels[i][j]` now being '+', then the pixel at `pixels[i][j]` has been updated. Conversely, if `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', no changes are made. If `pixels[i][j]` was not 'w', it has been updated to '.'***
