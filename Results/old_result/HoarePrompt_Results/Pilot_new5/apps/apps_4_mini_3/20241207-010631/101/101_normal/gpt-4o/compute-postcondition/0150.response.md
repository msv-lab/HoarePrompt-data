`frame_width` is assigned the value of `right - left + 1`. The values of `right` and `left` are defined and not None, so `frame_width` will be a positive integer (since `right` should be greater than or equal to `left`). The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, `screen` is a list of strings containing characters '.' and 'w' with at least one 'w', `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are all defined and not None; `frame_height` is equal to `bottom - top + 1`, and `frame_width` is equal to `right - left + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, `screen` is a list of strings containing characters '.' and 'w' with at least one 'w', `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are all defined and not None; `frame_height` is equal to `bottom - top + 1`, `frame_width` is equal to `right - left + 1`.**
