Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 2000. `screen` is a list of strings containing characters '.' and 'w' with at least one 'w'. `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are defined, `frame_height` is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` is greater than or equal to 2, and `result` is a list of lists representing the characters in `screen`. All positions in `result` corresponding to the edges defined by `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are updated to '+' if they were previously '.', while other positions remain unchanged. If the loop does not execute (if `bottom` is not greater than `top` or `right` is not greater than `left`), then `result` remains unchanged.**
