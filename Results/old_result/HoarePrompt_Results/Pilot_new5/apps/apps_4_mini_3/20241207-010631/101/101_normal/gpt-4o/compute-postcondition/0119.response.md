In the provided code, the assignment `top = bottom = i` sets both `top` and `bottom` to the value of `i`. The initial state indicates that `i` is equal to `n`, which is an integer within the range from 1 to 2000. Since `bottom` is initially set to `n`, this means both `top` and `bottom` will have the same value as `n`.

Therefore, after executing the code:
- `top` will be set to `n`
- `bottom` will remain equal to `n` (since it was already set to `n`)
- `i` will still be `n`

Since the other variables are not affected by this operation, we can summarize the output state as follows:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is equal to `n`, `bottom` is equal to `n`, `left` is set to 0, `right` is set to `right`, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is `m`.**
