The variable `pixels[i][j]` is assigned the value `'.'`. Initially, it is known that `pixels[i][j]` is not equal to `'.'` and is not equal to `'w'`, which means it must have been some other character before the assignment. The states of other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined; `frame_size` is less than or equal to `max(n, m)`; `i` is 2; `n` is greater than 2; `m` is greater than or equal to 1; `j` is 0; neither `i` equals `min_x` nor `max_x`, nor `j` equals `min_y` or `max_y`; `pixels[i][j]` is now '.'**
