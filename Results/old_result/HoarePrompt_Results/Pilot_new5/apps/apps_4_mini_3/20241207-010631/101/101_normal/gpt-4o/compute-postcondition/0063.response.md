In the initial state, `j` is equal to 0. The code `left = j` assigns the value of `j` to `left`. Since `j` is 0, `left` will also be 0. The other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is equal to `n`, `bottom` is equal to `n`, `left` is 0, `right` is defined accordingly, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is 0, the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w', `top` is not None, and the value of `j` is less than `left`.**
