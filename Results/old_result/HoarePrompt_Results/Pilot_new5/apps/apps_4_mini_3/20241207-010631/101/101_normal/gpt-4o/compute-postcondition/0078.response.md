Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', and `top` remains unchanged. If `j` is less than `left`, then `bottom` is updated to be equal to `n` if `i` (which is equal to `n`) is greater than `bottom`, `left` is set to `j`, and `right` remains unchanged. If `j` is not less than `left`, there are no changes to `left`, `right`, `bottom`, or `top`.***
