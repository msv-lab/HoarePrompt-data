Output State: **`min_x` is the minimum x-coordinate among all elements in `white_pixels`, `min_y` is the minimum y-coordinate among all elements in `white_pixels`, `max_x` is the maximum x-coordinate among all elements in `white_pixels`, `max_y` is the maximum y-coordinate among all elements in `white_pixels`, `white_pixels` must contain at least 0 elements. If `white_pixels` is empty, `min_x` and `min_y` remain as float('inf'), while `max_x` and `max_y` remain as float('-inf').**
