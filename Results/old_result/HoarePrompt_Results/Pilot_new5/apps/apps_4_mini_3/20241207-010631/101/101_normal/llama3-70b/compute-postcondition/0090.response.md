Output State: **`min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are the minimum and maximum coordinates among all elements in `white_pixels`; `frame_size` is `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`, which is less than or equal to `max(n, m)`; `pixels` is updated such that all positions on the edges defined by `min_x`, `max_x`, `min_y`, `max_y` are marked with '+' if they were originally '.', while the positions with 'w' remain unchanged, and all other positions are set to '.'; `i` is equal to `n - 1` after the last iteration, and `j` ranges from `0` to `m - 1` during the final processing of the last row.**
