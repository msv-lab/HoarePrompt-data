The variable `bottom` is assigned the value of `i`, which is equal to `n`. Therefore, `bottom` now holds the value of `n`. The conditions regarding `top`, `left`, `right`, and `screen` remain unchanged, and there are no modifications to these variables. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` remains unchanged, `bottom` is equal to `n`, `left` remains unchanged, `right` remains unchanged.**
