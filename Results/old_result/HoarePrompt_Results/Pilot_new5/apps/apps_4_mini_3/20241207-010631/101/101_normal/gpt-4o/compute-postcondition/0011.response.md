Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, `screen` is a list of strings containing characters '.' and 'w' with at least one 'w', `top` is equal to `i`, `bottom` is None, `left` is None, `right` is None, `j` is 0, and the character at `screen[i][j]` is 'w'. If `i` is less than `top`, then `top` is updated to the value of `i`. The current value of `i` is greater than `bottom`.***
