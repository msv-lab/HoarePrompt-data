Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, `screen` is a list of strings containing characters '.' and 'w' with at least one 'w', `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are defined, `frame_height` is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` is greater than or equal to 2, `result` is a list of lists representing the characters in `screen`, `bottom` is greater than `top`, and for every `j` from `left` to `right`, if `i` is equal to `top` or `bottom`, or if `j` is equal to `left` or `right`, then `result[i][j]` will be updated to '+' if it was previously '.'.**
