Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000; `m` is an integer greater than 0; `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w'; if `top` is None, then `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are all set to `n`, with `left` and `right` equal to `m + 1`, and `i` and `j` set to `n` and `m + 1`, respectively. If `top` is defined, then `top` remains either None or equal to `n`, while `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. If `j` is greater than `right`, then `right` remains unchanged; otherwise, no changes occur to the values of `n`, `m`, `screen`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `i`, or `j`.***
