The code assigns the value of `j` to `right`. Since there are no other conditions being evaluated or variables modified, we only need to update `right`. The other variables maintain their states.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` remains unchanged, `left` remains unchanged, `bottom` remains unchanged; `right` is equal to `j`.**
