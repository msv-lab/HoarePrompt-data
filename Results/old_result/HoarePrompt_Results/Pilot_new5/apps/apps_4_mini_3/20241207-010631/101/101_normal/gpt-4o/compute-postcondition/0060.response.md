The value of `bottom` is assigned the value of `i`, which is equal to `n`. Given that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, this means that `bottom` will take on the value of `n`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is equal to `n`, `bottom` is equal to `n`, `left` is defined accordingly, `right` is defined accordingly, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is 0, the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w', `top` is not None, and the current value of `i` is greater than `bottom`.**
