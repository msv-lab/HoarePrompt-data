Postcondition: ***`min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined, `frame_size` is less than or equal to `max(n, m)`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1. If `j` is either equal to `min_y`, `max_y`, `min_x`, or `max_x`, and `pixels[i][j]` was '.', then `pixels[i][j]` is now '+'. Otherwise, if `j` does not meet the above conditions, or if `pixels[i][j]` was not '.', then if `pixels[i][j]` was 'w', the current iteration of the loop is skipped; otherwise, `pixels[i][j]` is now equal to '.'***
