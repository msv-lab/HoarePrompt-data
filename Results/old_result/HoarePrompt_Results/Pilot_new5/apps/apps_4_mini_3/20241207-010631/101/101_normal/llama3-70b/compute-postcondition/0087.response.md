Postcondition: ***`min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined; `frame_size` is less than or equal to `max(n, m)`; `i` is 2; `n` is greater than 2; `m` is greater than or equal to 2; `j` is 2. If `pixels[2][2]` is 'w', the loop continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, `pixels[2][2]` is '.', indicating that the condition is not satisfied.***
