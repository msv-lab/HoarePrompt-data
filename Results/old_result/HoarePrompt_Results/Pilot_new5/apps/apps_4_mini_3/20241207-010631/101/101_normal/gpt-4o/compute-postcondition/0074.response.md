Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', and the variables `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged. If `i` (which is equal to `n`) is less than `top`, then `top` is updated to be equal to `n`.***
