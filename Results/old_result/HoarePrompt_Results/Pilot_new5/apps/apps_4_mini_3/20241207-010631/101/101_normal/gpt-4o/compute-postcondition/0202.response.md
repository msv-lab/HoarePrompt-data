Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 2000. `screen` is a list of strings containing characters '.' and 'w' with at least one 'w'. `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are defined, `frame_height` is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` is greater than or equal to 2, and `result` is a list of lists representing the characters in `screen`. For all values of `j` from `left` to `right`, if `i` is equal to `top` or `bottom`, or if `j` is equal to `left` or `right`, then for each `j`, if `result[i][j]` was '.', it is now set to '+'. If the loop does not execute (if `left > right`), then `result` remains unchanged.**
