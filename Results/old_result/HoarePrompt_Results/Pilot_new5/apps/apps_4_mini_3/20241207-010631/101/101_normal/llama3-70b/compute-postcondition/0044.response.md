Postcondition: ***`min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined, `frame_size` is less than or equal to `max(n, m)`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1. The current value of `i` is 1, and `j` is either equal to `min_y`, `max_y`, `min_x`, or `max_x`, and `pixels[i][j]` is equal to '.'***
