The code assigns the value of `j` to both `left` and `right`. The previous values of `left` and `right` are unchanged, but now both will equal `j`, which is currently 1. Thus, both `left` and `right` become 1. The other variables remain unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is equal to `n`, `bottom` is equal to `n`, `left` is 1, `right` is 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is 1**
