Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w'. If `top` is None, then `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are all set to `n` and `m`, while `i` is equal to `n` and `j` is equal to `m`. Otherwise, `top` is set to `n`, `bottom` remains `n`, and if `j` is greater than `right`, then `right` is updated to `m`, while `left` and `i` remain unchanged. If `j` is not greater than `right`, both `left` and `right` remain unchanged, and `i` remains equal to `n`.***
