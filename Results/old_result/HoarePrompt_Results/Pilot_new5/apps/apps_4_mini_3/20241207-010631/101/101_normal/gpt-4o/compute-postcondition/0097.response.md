According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the relationship between the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `n`, which means the loop has completed its iterations. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` would need to be incremented to `n + 1`, which exceeds the range of `n`, thus the loop cannot execute again. Therefore, it is not possible for the loop to execute one more time under the provided conditions.

The states will remain the same because the loop cannot proceed. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is the minimum row index of 'w', `bottom` is the maximum row index of 'w', `left` is the minimum column index of 'w', `right` is the maximum column index of 'w', `i` is equal to `n`, and `j` is equal to `m - 1**`
