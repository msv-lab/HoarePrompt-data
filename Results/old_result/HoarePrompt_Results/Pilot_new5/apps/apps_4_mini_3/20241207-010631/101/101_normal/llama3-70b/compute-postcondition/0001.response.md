The variable `pixels` is assigned a list of lists, where each inner list is created by taking input for `m` characters, repeated for `n` lines. The values of `n` and `m` indicate how many lines of input there are and how many characters each line contains, respectively. The state of `n` and `m` remains unchanged, but `pixels` now contains `n` lists, each with `m` characters.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input representing the number of lines, `m` is an integer input representing the number of characters in each line, `pixels` is a list of n lists, each containing m characters from input.**
