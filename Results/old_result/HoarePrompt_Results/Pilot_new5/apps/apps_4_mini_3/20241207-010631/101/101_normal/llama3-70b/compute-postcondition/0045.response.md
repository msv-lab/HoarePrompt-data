The value at `pixels[i][j]` is assigned the value `'+'`. The previous value of `pixels[i][j]` was `'.'`. Other variables such as `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, `frame_size`, `i`, `n`, `m`, and the conditions regarding `j` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined, `frame_size` is less than or equal to `max(n, m)`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is either equal to `min_y`, `max_y`, `min_x`, or `max_x`, and `pixels[i][j]` is now '+'**
