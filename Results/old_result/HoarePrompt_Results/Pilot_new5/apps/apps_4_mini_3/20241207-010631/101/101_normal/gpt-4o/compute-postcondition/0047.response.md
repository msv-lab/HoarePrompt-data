Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that `m` > 2, `screen` is a list of strings containing characters '.' and 'w' with at least one 'w', and `j` is 2. If `screen[i][j]` is 'w', and if `top` is None, then `top` and `bottom` are both set to `i`, and `left` and `right` are both set to 2. If `top` is not None, `left` remains 2, and if `j` is greater than `right`, these conditions remain unchanged. Otherwise, if `screen[i][j]` is not 'w', the state remains unchanged.***
