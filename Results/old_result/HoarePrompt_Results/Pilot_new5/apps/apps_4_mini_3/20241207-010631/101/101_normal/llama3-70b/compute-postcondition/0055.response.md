The `continue` statement causes the loop in which it is located to skip the rest of its body for the current iteration and move to the next iteration. Since there are no specific updates to the variables `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, `frame_size`, `i`, `n`, `m`, or `j` mentioned in this code snippet, their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the states of the variables are preserved as per the initial conditions.

Output State: **`min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined, `frame_size` is less than or equal to `max(n, m)`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `m` and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
