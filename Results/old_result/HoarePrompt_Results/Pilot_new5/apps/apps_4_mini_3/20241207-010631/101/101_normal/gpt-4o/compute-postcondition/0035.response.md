According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` in relation to `m`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Thus, `j` will be 2 at the start of the next iteration. Since `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, for the loop to execute again, `m` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` must be greater than 2, `screen` is a list of strings containing characters '.' and 'w' with at least one 'w', `j` is 2**
