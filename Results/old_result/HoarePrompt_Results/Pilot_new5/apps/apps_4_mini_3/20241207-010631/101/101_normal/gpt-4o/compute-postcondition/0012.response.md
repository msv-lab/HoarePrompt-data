The variable `bottom` is assigned the value of `i`. Since the current value of `i` is greater than `bottom`, this means that `bottom` is updated to the value of `i`. The values of `top`, `left`, `right`, `j`, `n`, `m`, and `screen` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, `screen` is a list of strings containing characters '.' and 'w' with at least one 'w', `top` is equal to `i`, `bottom` is equal to `i`, `left` is None, `right` is None, `j` is 0, and the character at `screen[i][j]` is 'w'.**
