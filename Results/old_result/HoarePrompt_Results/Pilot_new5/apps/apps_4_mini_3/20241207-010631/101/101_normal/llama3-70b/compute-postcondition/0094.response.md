The code `print(''.join(row))` concatenates all characters in the string `row` and prints the result. The variable `row` is expected to be a string, which is likely one of the entries in the `pixels` list based on the context.

However, since no specific assignment to `row` is provided in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. The values of `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` remain unchanged, and `i` is still `n`, with `j` ranging within its defined limits.

The Output State reflects that the program prints out a joined string formed from the variable `row`, which is an element from `pixels`. Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are valid coordinates from `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to `max(n, m)`, `pixels` is a list where each row is joined into a single string for printing, `i` is `n`, and `j` can range from 0 to `m-1`; the string formed by joining the characters in `row` has been printed.**
