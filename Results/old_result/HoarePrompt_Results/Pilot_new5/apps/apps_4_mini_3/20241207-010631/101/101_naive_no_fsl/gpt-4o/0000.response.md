Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that prevent it from fulfilling the requirements of the problem description.

1. **Single White Pixel Handling**: The program incorrectly checks if the frame height or width is less than 2 to return -1. This means that if there is only one white pixel (w), it will return -1, even though a frame of size 1 (just that pixel) should still be a valid output.

2. **Incorrect Frame Creation**: The way the frame is created is incorrect. The program creates a frame around the bounding box of the white pixels, but it does not handle cases properly when the bounding box is very small. For example, if there is one white pixel surrounded by black pixels, the program should return that single pixel as part of the frame instead of returning -1.

3. **Output Structure**: The output conditions state that the frame should be represented by "+" characters, but the program only tries to fill in edges. If the frame dimensions are too small, it prematurely returns -1 instead of correctly displaying a valid output.

Here's a simple case where the program would fail:

Input:
```
1 1
w
```
Expected Output:
```
w
```
Program Output:
```
-1
```

In this case, the program fails to recognize that a single "w" pixel constitutes a valid frame. Thus, the overall implementation is incorrect in handling edge cases and does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description.
