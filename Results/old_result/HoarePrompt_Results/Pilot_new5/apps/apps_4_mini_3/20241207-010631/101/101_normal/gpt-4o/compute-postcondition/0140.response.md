The variable `right` is assigned the value of `j`, which is equal to `m + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000; `m` is an integer greater than 0; `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w'; `top` is either None or equal to `n`; `bottom` is equal to `n`; `left` is equal to `m + 1`; `right` is equal to `j` (which is `m + 1`); `i` is equal to `n`; and `j` is equal to `m + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000; `m` is an integer greater than 0; `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w'; `top` is either None or equal to `n`; `bottom` is equal to `n`; `left` is equal to `m + 1`; `right` is equal to `m + 1`; `i` is equal to `n`; `j` is equal to `m + 1**
