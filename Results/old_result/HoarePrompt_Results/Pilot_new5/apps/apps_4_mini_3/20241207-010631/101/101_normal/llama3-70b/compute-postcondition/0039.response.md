Postcondition: ***`min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are the minimum and maximum coordinates among all elements in `white_pixels`; `frame_size` is `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`, which is less than or equal to `max(n, m)`; `j` is `m + 1`. If `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', we continue to the next iteration of the loop without modifying `pixels[i][j]`. Otherwise, `pixels[i][j]` is set to '.'***
