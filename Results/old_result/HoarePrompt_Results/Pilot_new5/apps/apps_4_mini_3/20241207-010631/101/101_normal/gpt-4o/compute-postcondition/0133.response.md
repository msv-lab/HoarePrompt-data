The code assigns the value of `j` to both `left` and `right`. Given that `j` is equal to `m + 1`, `left` and `right` will both take on the value of `m + 1`. The values of `n`, `screen`, `top`, `bottom`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is equal to `n`, `bottom` is equal to `n`, `left` is equal to `m + 1`, `right` is equal to `m + 1`, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is equal to `m + 1`.**
