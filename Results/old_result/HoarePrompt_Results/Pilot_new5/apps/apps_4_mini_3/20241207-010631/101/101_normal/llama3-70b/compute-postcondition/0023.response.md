Postcondition: ***`min_x` is the minimum x-coordinate among all elements in `white_pixels`, `min_y` is the minimum y-coordinate among all elements in `white_pixels`, `max_x` is the maximum x-coordinate among all elements in `white_pixels`, `max_y` is the maximum y-coordinate among all elements in `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to `max(n, m)`, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0. Additionally, it is not the case that `i` equals `min_x` or `max_x`, or `j` equals `min_y` or `max_y`, or `pixels[i][j]` equals '.'. The current value of `pixels[i][j]` is 'w'.***
