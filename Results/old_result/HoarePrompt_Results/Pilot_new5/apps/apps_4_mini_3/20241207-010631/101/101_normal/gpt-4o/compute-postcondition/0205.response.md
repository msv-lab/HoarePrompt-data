The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `screen`. The parameters are defined as follows: `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000, and `screen` is a list of strings, each of length `m` consisting of characters '.' and 'w', with at least one 'w' present.

After executing the function body, there are three potential return cases:
- Case_1: The function returns -1, indicating that it cannot calculate valid bounds for the 'w' characters due to at least one of the values of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, or `right` being None.
- Case_2: The function returns -1 due to the `frame_height` being less than 2 or `frame_width` being less than 2.
- Case_3: The function returns a list of lists `result` with updated edge positions marked as '+' if they were previously '.', while other positions remain unchanged. If no edges are updated, `result` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `n` and `m`, and a list of strings `screen`, and return either -1 in case of invalid bounds or frame dimensions, or return a modified version of `screen` with updated edge positions. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n and m (integers) and screen (a list of strings), returning -1 for invalid bounds or dimensions, or a modified list with updated edge positions marked as '+'.**
