According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop will execute once for each value of `j` from 0 to `m - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `m` must be at least 1. Given the current state, `m` is already greater than or equal to 1, which is sufficient for the loop to execute.

At the start of the loop, since `j` is initialized to 0 for the first iteration (as it ranges from 0 to `m-1`), there is no need to change the value of `i`, `n`, or `m`. The check for `pixels[1]` does not affect the execution of the loop since it is about the elements already being checked.

Thus, before the loop starts, we can state that `j` should start at 0 for the loop to execute. 

State: **`min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined; `frame_size` is less than or equal to `max(n, m)`; `i` is 2; `n` is greater than 2; `m` is greater than or equal to 1; `j` is 0**
