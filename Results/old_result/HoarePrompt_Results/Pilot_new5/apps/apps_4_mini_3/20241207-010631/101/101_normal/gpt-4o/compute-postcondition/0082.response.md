Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w'. If `screen[i][j]` is 'w' and `top` is None, then `top` and `bottom` are both set to `n`, `left` is set to 1, `right` is set to 1, and `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is 1. If `top` is not None and `j` is greater than `right`, then `right` is updated to `j`; otherwise, all values remain unchanged.**
