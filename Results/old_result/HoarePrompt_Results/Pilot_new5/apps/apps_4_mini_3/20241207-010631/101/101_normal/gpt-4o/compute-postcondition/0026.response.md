Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, `screen` is a list of strings containing characters '.' and 'w' with at least one 'w', `j` is 1. If `i` is less than `top`, then `top` is set to `i`. Otherwise, there is no change to the variables.***
