The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the remaining code inside the current loop iteration and proceed to the next iteration of that loop. The values of the variables are not changed; however, it affects the flow of execution within the loop.

Since none of the variables have been modified by this statement and all the preconditions remain valid, the output state indicates that we skip the current iteration of the loop without changing any variable values.

Output State: **`min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined, `frame_size` is less than or equal to `max(n, m)`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, and either `i` is not equal to `min_x`, `max_x`, or `j` is not equal to `min_y`, `max_y`, or `pixels[i][j]` is not equal to '.', and the current value of `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', and we skip the current iteration of the loop.**
