The assignment `top = bottom = i` sets both `top` and `bottom` to the current value of `i`. Since `top` was previously `None`, it will now hold the value of `i`, and `bottom` will do the same. The state of other variables remains unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, `screen` is a list of strings containing characters '.' and 'w' with at least one 'w', `top` is equal to `i`, `bottom` is equal to `i`, `left` is None, `right` is None, `j` is 0, the character at `screen[i][j]` is 'w'.**
