To analyze the impact of the code on the program, we note that the code `result[i][j] = '+'` updates the character at the specified position `(i, j)` in the `result` list to `'+'`. The initial state indicates that `result[i][j]` is equal to `'.'`, meaning that a character in `screen` at that position is being replaced with `'+'`.

Since `i` is defined to be either equal to `top` or `bottom`, and `j` is defined to be either equal to `left` or `right`, we know that the operation is valid within the bounds of the `result` list. Furthermore, the preconditions regarding `n`, `m`, `screen`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, and the dimensions of `result` remain unchanged, except for the specific position in `result` which has now been updated.

Thus, the output state reflects this update while preserving the integrity of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, `screen` is a list of strings containing characters '.' and 'w' with at least one 'w', `top` is defined, `bottom` is defined, `left` is defined, `right` is defined, `frame_height` is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` is greater than or equal to 2, `result` is a list of lists representing the characters in `screen`, `bottom` must be greater than `top`, `i` is the current value of `top` or `bottom`, `j` is the current value of `left` or `right`, and `result[i][j]` is now '+'**.
