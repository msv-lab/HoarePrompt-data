Postcondition: ***`min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined; `frame_size` is less than or equal to `max(n, m)`; `i` is 2; `n` is greater than 2; `m` is greater than or equal to 1; `j` is 0. If `i` is equal to `min_x` or `max_x`, or `j` is equal to `min_y` or `max_y`, and `pixels[2][0]` is '+', then the condition holds true. Otherwise, if neither condition applies, and `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', the execution continues to the next iteration of the loop; otherwise, `pixels[i][j]` is updated to '.'***
