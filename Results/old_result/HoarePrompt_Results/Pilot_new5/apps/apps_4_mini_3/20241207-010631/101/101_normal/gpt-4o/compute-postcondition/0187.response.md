According to the code, the loop iterates over a range defined by `top` and `bottom`. Currently, `i` is equal to `top + 1`. In order for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become `top + 2`. 

To ensure that the loop can execute again, `i` must still remain less than or equal to `bottom`. Since `bottom` is greater than `top`, for the loop to execute one more time, `top` must still be less than `bottom + 1`, so `i` should be less than or equal to `bottom`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, `screen` is a list of strings containing characters '.' and 'w' with at least one 'w', `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are defined, `frame_height` is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` is greater than or equal to 2, `result` is a list of lists representing the characters in `screen`, `bottom` is greater than `top`, `i` is equal to `top + 2`, `left` is less than or equal to `right`**
