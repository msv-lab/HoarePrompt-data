According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `white_pixels` list. If the list contains at least 2 elements, the loop will execute again for the second element. At the end of the last iteration, `white_pixels` contains at least 1 element, and `(x, y)` is the first element in `white_pixels`. For the loop to be executed one more time, the list must contain at least 2 elements, and `x` and `y` must be updated to the second element in `white_pixels`.

State: **`min_x` is `x`, `min_y` is `y`, `max_x` is `x`, `max_y` is `y`, `white_pixels` must contain at least 2 elements, and `(x, y)` is the second element in `white_pixels`**
