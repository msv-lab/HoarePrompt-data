According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the range of `m`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `m` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to be executed one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `m` must be greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined; `frame_size` is less than or equal to `max(n, m)`; `i` is 2; `n` is greater than 2; `m` is greater than or equal to 2; `j` is 1**
