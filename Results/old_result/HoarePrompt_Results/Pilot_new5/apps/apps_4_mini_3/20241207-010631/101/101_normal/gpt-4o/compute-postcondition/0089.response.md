Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer greater than 2, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is either `None` (if `i` is not less than `top`) or equal to `n` (if `i` is less than `top`), `bottom` is equal to `n`, `left` is 1, `right` is 1, `i` is equal to `n`, and `j` is 2. If `i` is greater than `bottom`, the values of `m`, `screen`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.***
