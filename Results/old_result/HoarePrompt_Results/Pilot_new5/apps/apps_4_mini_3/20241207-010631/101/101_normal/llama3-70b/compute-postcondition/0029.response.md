According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the range `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` has already been iterated through the values from 0 to `m-1`. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to `m`. 

However, the loop should also be able to execute when `j` is less than `m`. Therefore, the new state should reflect that `j` is now equal to `m`, indicating that the loop cannot execute again since it has exceeded its range.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:

State: **`min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are the minimum and maximum coordinates among all elements in `white_pixels`, respectively; `frame_size` is `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`, which is less than or equal to `max(n, m)`, where `n` and `m` are both greater than 0; `j` is `m`**
