Output State: **`min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined; `frame_size` is less than or equal to `max(n, m)`; `i` is 2; `n` is greater than 2; `m` is greater than or equal to 1; `j` is equal to `m - 1`. All elements `pixels[2][j]` for `j` in the range `[0, m-1]` have been processed. If `pixels[2][j]` was '.' and the condition `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y)` held true, then `pixels[2][j]` is updated to '+'; otherwise, if `pixels[2][j]` was 'w', it remains 'w'; otherwise, `pixels[2][j]` is updated to '.' for all other cases.**
