The statement `pixels[i][j] = '+'` assigns the character `'+'` to the position in the `pixels` array at indices `i` and `j`. The variable `i` is initialized as `1`, and `j` is equal to `m`, which is greater than or equal to `1`. 

Since `pixels` is assumed to be a 2D array, the operation does not affect the values of `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, `frame_size`, `n`, and `m`. However, it does modify the `pixels` array at the position `[1][m]` to hold the value `'+'`.

Thus, the output state reflecting these changes while maintaining the validity of the other precondition variables is as follows:

Output State: **`min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined; `frame_size` is less than or equal to `max(n, m)`; `i` is 1; `n` is greater than 1; `m` is greater than or equal to 1; `j` is `m`; `pixels[1][m]` is '+'**
