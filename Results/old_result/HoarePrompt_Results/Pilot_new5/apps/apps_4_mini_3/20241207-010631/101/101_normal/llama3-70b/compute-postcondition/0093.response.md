According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in the `pixels` list, which consists of strings representing rows of pixels. The loop will continue executing as long as there are more rows to process in the `pixels` list. Given that `i` is initialized to 0, it indicates the current row being processed. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` will have been incremented to represent the next row, and the loop will attempt to execute if there are more rows to handle. Since `j` can vary from 0 to `m-1`, it does not directly affect the continuity of the loop but indicates the width of the row being processed.

To determine the state for the next iteration:
- If `pixels` contains at least `i + 1` rows, then the loop can execute again.
- Therefore, if there were `n` rows in `pixels`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be `n` or less, and `pixels` must have at least `n + 1` rows.

Since `i` starts at 0 and increments with each iteration, if `i` was `n-1` at the end of the last iteration, then `i` will be `n` at the start of the next iteration, and `pixels` must have at least `n + 1` rows.

State: **`min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are valid coordinates from `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to `max(n, m)`, `pixels` is a list where each row is joined into a single string for printing, `i` is `n`, and `j` can range from 0 to `m-1`, and `pixels` must have at least `n + 1` rows.**
