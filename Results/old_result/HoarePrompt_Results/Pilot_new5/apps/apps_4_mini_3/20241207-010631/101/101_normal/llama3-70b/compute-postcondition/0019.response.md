To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the provided states and the for loop statement.

1. The loop iterates over `j` in the range of `m`. For the loop to execute at least once, `m` must be at least 1.
2. The current state indicates that `i` is initialized to 0. This is not directly relevant for the execution of the loop over `j`, but it may be relevant if `i` is used within the loop.

From the information given:
- `frame_size` is defined as `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`, which indicates that `frame_size` is dependent on the coordinates of `white_pixels`.
- We also have conditions stating that `frame_size` is less than or equal to `max(n, m)`, and `n` must be greater than 0. This implies that `m` must also be positive for the for loop to execute.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute:
- We must ensure that `m` is greater than 0.

In conclusion, the necessary state adjustments for the loop to execute are:
- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is initialized to 0 for the loop to start from the first index.

Putting this all together, the final state would be:

State: **`min_x` is the minimum x-coordinate among all elements in `white_pixels`, `min_y` is the minimum y-coordinate among all elements in `white_pixels`, `max_x` is the maximum x-coordinate among all elements in `white_pixels`, `max_y` is the maximum y-coordinate among all elements in `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to `max(n, m)`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
