To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the loop statement and the provided state variables. 

The loop iterates over the range from `top` to `bottom + 1`, which means it will execute as long as `top` is less than or equal to `bottom`. Since it's stated that `frame_height` is equal to `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, we know that `bottom` must be greater than `top`. 

Given that `frame_height` is defined as `bottom - top + 1 ≥ 2`, we can infer that:

1. `bottom` must be greater than `top`.
2. The loop index `i` will start at `top`.

Thus, for the loop to execute, the following adjustments must be stated:

- The loop can execute if `top` is at least 1 less than `bottom` (i.e., `bottom > top`).
- At the first iteration, `i` will be equal to `top`.

Therefore, the adjusted state should reflect that `top` and `bottom` are defined correctly, and `i` starts at `top`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, `screen` is a list of strings containing characters '.' and 'w' with at least one 'w', `top` is defined, `bottom` is defined, `left` is defined, `right` is defined, `frame_height` is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` is greater than or equal to 2, `result` is a list of lists representing the characters in `screen`, `bottom` must be greater than `top`, and `i` is `top`.**
