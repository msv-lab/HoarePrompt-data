Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters, `n` is greater than or equal to 5, `max_len` is 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 5, and `substr` is the substring of `s` from index 2 to index 4. If `substr` is not a palindrome (i.e., `substr` is not equal to its reverse), then the conditions for `s`, `n`, `max_len`, `i`, `j`, and `substr` hold.***
