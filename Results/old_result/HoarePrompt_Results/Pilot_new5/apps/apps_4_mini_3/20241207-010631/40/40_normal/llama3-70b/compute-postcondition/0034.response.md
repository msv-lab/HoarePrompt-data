To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the given state and the loop structure.

1. The loop is defined as `for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):`. This means the loop will iterate starting from `j = i + 1` to `j = n + 1`.
2. Given that `i` is 2, this implies that the loop starts at `j = 3` because `i + 1 = 3`.
3. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 2 (since `j` starts at 3 and must be â‰¤ `n + 1`).
4. The current condition states that `n` must be greater than 2, which is sufficient for the loop to have at least one iteration.
5. There are no additional adjustments needed for the variables `s`, `max_len`, or `i` as they do not affect the loop execution.

In conclusion, the adjustments that need to be explicitly stated are already satisfied by the conditions provided. 

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters, `n` must be greater than 2, `max_len` is the length of the longest non-palindromic substring found in `s`, `i` is 2, `j` is now 3**
