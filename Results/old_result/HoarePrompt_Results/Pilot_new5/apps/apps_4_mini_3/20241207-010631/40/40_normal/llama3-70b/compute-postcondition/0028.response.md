According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `j` and `n`. The for loop starts at `i + 1`, which is 2, and goes up to `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3 and `n` is greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than or equal to `n`. Since `j` is currently 3, for the loop to run again, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4 (as `j` would increment to 4).

Additionally, since the loop is iterating with `j`, we need to update its value for the next iteration. Therefore, `j` will increase to 4.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `max_len` is the maximum of its previous value and 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, and `substr` is the substring `s[1:3]`.**
