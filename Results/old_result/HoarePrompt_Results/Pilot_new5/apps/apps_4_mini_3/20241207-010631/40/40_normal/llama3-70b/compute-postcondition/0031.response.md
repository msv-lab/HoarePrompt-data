Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters, `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `max_len` is either its previous value or 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, and `substr` is `s[1:4]`. If `substr` is not equal to its reverse, then the conditions for `s`, `n`, `max_len`, `i`, `j`, and `substr` remain unchanged.***
