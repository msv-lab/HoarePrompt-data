In this case, `max_len` is updated based on the maximum value between its current value and the length of `substr`. The length of `substr` is equal to 2, as it consists of the first two characters of `s`. 

The initial state indicates that `max_len` is initially 1. Thus, the calculation will be:

- `len(substr)` is 2.
- `max(max_len, len(substr))` evaluates to `max(1, 2)`, which is 2.

Therefore, `max_len` is updated to 2, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters, `n` is the length of `s`, `max_len` is 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `substr` is the first two characters of `s`**.
