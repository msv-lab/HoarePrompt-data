The `max_len` variable is updated to be the maximum value between its current value and the length of `substr`. Since `substr` is the character at index 2 of `s`, its length is 1 (as it is a single character). Therefore, the value of `max_len` will remain unchanged if it is already greater than or equal to 1; otherwise, it will be updated to 1.

Since `max_len` can either remain the same or change to 1, we can summarize the output state as follows:

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters, `n` is greater than 2, `max_len` is either unchanged or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, and `substr` is the character at index 2 of `s`.**
