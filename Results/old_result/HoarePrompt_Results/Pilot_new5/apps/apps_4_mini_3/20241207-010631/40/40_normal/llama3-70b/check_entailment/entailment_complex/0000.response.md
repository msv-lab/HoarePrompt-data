Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to find the length of the longest non-palindromic substring according to the problem description. Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The function begins by reading a non-empty string `s` of lowercase English letters, which matches the problem's input specifications.

2. **Finding Substrings**: The program iterates through all possible substrings of `s`. It uses two nested loops where the outer loop determines the starting index `i` and the inner loop (which goes from `i + 1` to `n + 1`) determines the ending index `j`. This accurately captures all substrings.

3. **Palindrome Check**: For each substring, the program checks if it is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse (`substr[::-1]`). If the substring is not a palindrome, it updates the `max_len` variable with the length of that substring if it is greater than the current maximum length found.

4. **Output**: Finally, it prints the value of `max_len`. If `max_len` is greater than 0 (indicating at least one non-palindromic substring was found), it prints that length. Otherwise, it prints `0`, which is consistent with the requirement to return `0` if all substrings of `s` are palindromic.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases effectively. For example:
   - If the input string is entirely composed of the same character (like "qqqqqqqq"), the function will correctly find that all substrings are palindromic and return `0`.
   - For a string like "mew", the program will correctly identify it as a non-palindrome and return its full length (`3`).

In summary, the program logically and systematically fulfills the problem's requirements, ensuring that it evaluates the length of the longest non-palindromic substring correctly and outputs the expected result. As such, the program is correct.
