To analyze the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider what happens during each iteration and the conditions for `max_len`, `i`, `j`, and `substr`. 

The loop iterates over `j` from `i + 1` to `n + 1`, which means it will check all substrings starting from index `i` (which is 1) up to the end of the string `s`. The condition checks whether each substring `substr` is not a palindrome. If it isn't, `max_len` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the length of `substr`.

Given the initial state:

- `s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters,
- `n` is greater than 1,
- `max_len` is the length of the longest non-palindromic substring found in `s`,
- `i` is initialized to 1,
- `j` will reach `n + 1` at the end of the loop.

After all iterations of the loop, the following will be true:

- `s` remains a non-empty string of lowercase English letters.
- `n` will still be greater than 1.
- `max_len` will be updated to reflect the length of the longest non-palindromic substring found during the iterations. If there are no non-palindromic substrings, `max_len` will retain its initial value.
- `i` remains 1 since it doesn't change during the loop.
- `j` will be equal to `n + 1` since it iterates up to that value.

Now we summarize this into the output state:

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters, `n` is greater than 1, `max_len` is the length of the longest non-palindromic substring found in `s`, `i` is 1, `j` is `n + 1`.**
