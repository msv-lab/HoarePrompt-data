Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters, `n` is the length of `s`, `max_len` is the length of the longest non-palindromic substring found in `s`, `i` is 0, and `j` is equal to `n + 1`. The loop will have evaluated all substrings starting from the first character of `s`, and `max_len` will hold the maximum length of the substrings that are not equal to their reverse. If all substrings were palindromic, `max_len` would remain 0.**
