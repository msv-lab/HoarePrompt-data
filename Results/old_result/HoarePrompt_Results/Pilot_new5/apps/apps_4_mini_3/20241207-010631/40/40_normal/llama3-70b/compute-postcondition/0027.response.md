Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `max_len` is now updated to be the maximum of its previous value and 2. The values of `i` is 1, `j` is 3, and `substr` is the substring `s[1:3]`. If `substr` is not equal to its reverse, the above conditions hold true; otherwise, there is no else part.***
