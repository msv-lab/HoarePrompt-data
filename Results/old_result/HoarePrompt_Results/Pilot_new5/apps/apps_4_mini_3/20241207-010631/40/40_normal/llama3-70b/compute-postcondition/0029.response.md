`substr` is assigned the value of `s[i:j]`, where `i` is 1 and `j` is 4. This results in `substr` being the substring of `s` from index 1 to index 3 (the end index is exclusive). The values of `s`, `n`, `max_len`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `max_len` is the maximum of its previous value and 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, and `substr` is now `s[1:4]`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `max_len` is the maximum of its previous value and 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, and `substr` is `s[1:4]`.**
