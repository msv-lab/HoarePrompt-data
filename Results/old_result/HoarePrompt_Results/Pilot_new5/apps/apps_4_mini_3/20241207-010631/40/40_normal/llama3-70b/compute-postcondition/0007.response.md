The statement `max_len = max(max_len, len(substr))` updates the value of `max_len` based on the comparison of its current value and the length of `substr`. Since `substr` is defined as the first character of `s`, its length will be 1. The `max_len` variable is initially 0. 

Now, let's evaluate the impact of the code:
- If `max_len` is 0 and `len(substr)` is 1, then `max(max_len, len(substr))` will evaluate to 1. Therefore, `max_len` will be updated to 1.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters, `n` is the length of `s`, `max_len` is 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `substr` is the first character of `s`, and `substr` is not equal to its reverse (which is also `substr`.**
