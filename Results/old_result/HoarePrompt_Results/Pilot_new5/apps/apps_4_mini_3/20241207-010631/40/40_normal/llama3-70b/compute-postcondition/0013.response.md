According to the code, the loop will execute based on the value of `j` and the length `n`. The loop starts at `j = i + 1`, which is `j = 1`, and continues until `j` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to increment by 1 to 3. 

Since `n` is the length of `s`, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3. Thus, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 3.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters, `n` is the length of `s` that must be greater than or equal to 3, `max_len` is 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, and `substr` is still the first two characters of `s`**.
