According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is `n - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 2 (since subtracting 2 from `n` must still leave it greater than 0). Therefore, we need to adjust the state to indicate that `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list containing the value of `x`, `i` is 1, `x` is equal to `n.bit_length() - 1`, and `n` must be greater than 2**
