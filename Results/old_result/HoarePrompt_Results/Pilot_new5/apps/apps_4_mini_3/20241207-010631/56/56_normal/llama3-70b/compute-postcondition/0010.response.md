Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`. `a` is an empty list, `i` is equal to 0, and `x` is equal to `n.bit_length() - 1`. If `x` is less than or equal to `i`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
