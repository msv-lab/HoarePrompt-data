According to the code, the loop can execute if the variable `n` is greater than 0. Right before the loop, `n` is specified to be a positive integer, which means that it is already greater than 0. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for `n`. 

Since `n` is already a positive integer, the loop can execute one time as it stands. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `a` is an empty list, `i` is equal to 0**
