The variable `i` is assigned the value `0`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `k`, and `a`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer assigned a new value based on input, `k` is a positive integer assigned a new value based on input, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `a` is an empty list, and `i` is equal to `0`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer assigned a new value based on input, `k` is a positive integer assigned a new value based on input, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `a` is an empty list, `i` is equal to 0.**
