To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic and see if it covers all potential edge cases correctly.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program takes two integers `n` and `k` from input, which represent the required sum and the length of the sequence.

2. **Initial Check**:
   - The program first checks if `n < k`. If this is true, it outputs "No". This is a valid check because if there are `k` integers, the minimum sum we can achieve (using `k` integers each at least 0) is `k * 0 = 0`. Hence, if `n` is less than `k`, it is indeed impossible to form such a sequence.

3. **Constructing the Sequence**:
   - The program enters a loop to create the sequence of integers such that the sum of `2^a_i` equals `n`. It does this by finding the largest power of 2 that fits into `n`, appending the corresponding exponent to the list `a`, and then reducing `n` by that value.
   - The loop runs until `n` becomes 0 or there are no more powers of 2 that can fit into it.

4. **Final Checks**:
   - After constructing the list `a`, it checks if the length of `a` is less than `k`. If it is, it outputs "No". 
   - If there are enough values in `a`, it truncates `a` to size `k`, sorts it in reverse order (to ensure it's lexicographically largest), and then outputs "Yes" followed by the sequence.

### Potential Issues
While the current implementation seems to capture many important aspects, there are logical gaps:

1. **Lexicographical Order**:
   - The program only sorts the resultant array `a` to ensure it is in descending order but does not account for the remaining slots if the size of `a` is less than `k`. It needs to fill the remaining sequence members with the smallest possible integers (which would be `-1`, `0`, etc.) to fulfill the requirement of exactly `k` integers.

2. **Negative Powers**:
   - The program does not handle cases where it might need to use negative powers (like `-1`), especially in scenarios where `n` is small or `k` is large.

3. **Example Case**:
   - For example, consider the input `n = 1` and `k = 2`. The program should be able to output:
     ```
     Yes
     -1 -1
     ```
   - However, the current implementation may not correctly account for the need to produce two integers in the case that `n` is very small compared to `k`.

### Conclusion
Given the above considerations, the program fails to account for certain edge cases and does not always produce a valid output for the expected requirements based on the problem statement. 

Correctness: **False**
