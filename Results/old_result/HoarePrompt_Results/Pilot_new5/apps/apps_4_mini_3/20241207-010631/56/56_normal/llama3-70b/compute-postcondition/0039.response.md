Functionality: ** The function accepts two positive integers, `n` and `k`, and checks if it can generate a sequence of `k` integers based on the binary representation of `n`. If `n` is less than `k`, it outputs 'No'. If not, it generates integers derived from the bit length of `n`, ensuring that the length of the generated list is at least `k`. If the generated list has fewer than `k` integers, it outputs 'No'. If it has at least `k` integers, it sorts this list in descending order and prints 'Yes' followed by the first `k` integers from this list. The integers fit within the range [-10^18, 10^18], and the constraints on `n` and `k` are 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5. **
