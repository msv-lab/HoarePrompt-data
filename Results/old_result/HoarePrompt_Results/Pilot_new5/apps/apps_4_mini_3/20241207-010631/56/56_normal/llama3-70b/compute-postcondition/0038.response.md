The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, as there are no parameters mentioned in the function definition. However, it operates under the constraints that `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) and `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5). 

Based on the output conditions provided, the functionality of the function is to return a sequence of integers fitting the range [-10^18, 10^18]. 

Functionality: **The function generates and returns a sequence of integers based on the constraints that n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) and k is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5), with each integer in the sequence fitting within the range [-10^18, 10^18].**
