The variable `min_length` is updated by adding `min_speed` to its current value. Given that `min_speed` has already been updated to the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`, we can express the change in `min_length` as:

`min_length` becomes `min_length + min_speed`.

The other variables (`v_1`, `v_2`, `t`, `d`, `max_speed`, `max_length`, `i`) remain unchanged. Thus, the output state incorporates the updated value of `min_length`.

Output State: **`v_1` is an integer between 1 and 100, `v_2` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is greater than or equal to 3, `d` is an integer from user input, `min_speed` is updated to the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`, `max_length` is updated to `max_length + max_speed`, `min_length` is updated to `min_length + min_speed`, `i` is `t - 2`, `max_speed` remains unchanged.**
