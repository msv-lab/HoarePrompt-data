The variables `v_1` and `v_2` are assigned new integer values from the input, which are mapped and split from a single input string. The values of `v_1` and `v_2` now depend on the user input. The conditions that `1 ≤ v_1, v_2 ≤ 100` still hold true after the execution. The values of `t` and `d` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet. 

Output State: **`v_1` is an integer from user input between 1 and 100; `v_2` is an integer from user input between 1 and 100; `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `d` ≤ 10.**
