Given the initial state and the code provided, let's analyze the impact step by step.

Initial State: 
- `v_1` is an integer between 1 and 100
- `v_2` is an integer between 1 and 100
- `t` is an integer from user input
- `d` is an integer from user input
- `max_speed` is the maximum of `v_1` and `v_2`
- `min_speed` is the minimum of `v_1` and `v_2`
- `max_length` is `max_speed * t`

The code snippet:
```
min_length = min_speed * t
```

Analysis:
- `min_length` is assigned the value of `min_speed * t`.
- The values of `min_speed` and `t` are involved in the calculation. 
- The value of `min_speed` is dependent on the initial values of `v_1` and `v_2`, and since both are integers between 1 and 100, `min_speed` will also be between 1 and 100.
- The value of `t` is taken from user input, which is an integer.
- The output state must reflect the new value of `min_length` while retaining the values of other variables.

Output State: **`v_1` is an integer between 1 and 100; `v_2` is an integer between 1 and 100; `t` is an integer from user input; `d` is an integer from user input; `max_speed` is the maximum of `v_1` and `v_2`; `min_speed` is the minimum of `v_1` and `v_2`; `max_length` is `max_speed * t`; `min_length` is `min_speed * t`.**
