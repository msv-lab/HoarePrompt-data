Output State: **`v_1` is an integer between 1 and 100, `v_2` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is greater than or equal to 2, `d` is an integer from user input, `min_speed` is the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`, `max_length` is updated to `max_length + max_speed`, `min_length` is `min_speed * t`, `i` is initialized to `t - 1`, `max_speed` is updated to `max(max_speed - d, min_speed`.**
