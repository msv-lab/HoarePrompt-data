To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, let's analyze the initial state and the impact of the code.

Initial State:
- If `t` is `2`, then `speeds` will remain as `[v_1, v_2]`.
- If `t` is greater than `2`, `speeds[1]` to `speeds[t-1]` will be calculated based on the defined loop logic, ensuring `speeds[i]` will be bounded by the values influenced by `v_1`, `v_2`, and the increment `d`.
- Thus, we can conclude: 
  - `speeds[0]` is `v_1`
  - `speeds[-1]` is `v_2`
  - Each `speeds[i]` for `1 â‰¤ i < t` will be determined by the formula in the loop, representing a progressively updated speed value that cannot exceed `v_2`.

After executing:
```
total_distance = sum(speeds)
```

Now, let's analyze the impact of this code:
- The variable `total_distance` is assigned the sum of all elements in the `speeds` list. 
- If `t` is `2`, then `speeds` contains only `v_1` and `v_2`, making the sum `v_1 + v_2`. 
- If `t` is greater than `2`, then `speeds` will contain more elements, but since we only have the defining conditions for `speeds[0]`, `speeds[-1]`, and we know the loop updates, we conclude that the sum will include all elements from `speeds`.

In both cases, we observe that `total_distance` is a direct computation from the `speeds` list, which has been established based on the initial state of `t`.

Output State: **`speeds[0]` is `v_1`, `speeds[-1]` is `v_2`, and `total_distance` is the sum of `speeds`**.
