The code initializes the `speeds` list with `t` number of zeros. The value of `t` remains within the range of 2 to 100, and it influences the size of the `speeds` list. Other variables `d`, `v_1`, and `v_2` remain unchanged in this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `d` ≤ 10; `v_1` is an input integer between 1 and 100; `v_2` is an input integer between 1 and 100; `speeds` is a list of `t` zeros.**
