The code snippet provided simply prints the value of `max_length`. The value of `max_length` has been defined as `max_speed * t`. However, since no changes are made to any variables in the provided code, the output state will reflect the unchanged variables and the printed value.

Output State: **`v_1` is an integer between 1 and 100, `v_2` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is greater than or equal to 2, `d` is an integer from user input, `max_speed` is the maximum of `max_speed - d * (t - 1)` and `min_speed`, `min_speed` is the minimum of `min_speed + d * (t - 1)` and `max_speed`, `max_length` is `max_speed * t`, `min_length` is `min_speed * t`, `i` is 0, and `max_length` is printed out.`**
