The variable `max_speed` is updated to the maximum of `max_speed - d` and `min_speed`. The value of `max_speed` remains unchanged unless `max_speed - d` is less than `min_speed`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `v_1` is an integer between 1 and 100, `v_2` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` must be greater than 3, `d` is an integer from user input, `min_speed` is updated to the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`, `max_length` is updated to `max_length + max_speed`, `min_length` is updated to `min_length + min_speed`, `i` is `t - 3`, and `max_speed` is updated to `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`.

Output State: **`v_1` is an integer between 1 and 100, `v_2` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` must be greater than 3, `d` is an integer from user input, `min_speed` is updated to the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`, `max_length` is updated to `max_length + max_speed`, `min_length` is updated to `min_length + min_speed`, `i` is `t - 3`, `max_speed` is updated to `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`**.
