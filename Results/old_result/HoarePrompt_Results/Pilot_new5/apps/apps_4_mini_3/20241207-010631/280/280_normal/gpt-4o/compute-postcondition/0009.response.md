According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `t`. The loop iterates while `i` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `t` must be greater than 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 3 because the next value of `i` will be 3. 

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- `t` must be greater than 3 (to allow the loop to execute with `i` equal to 3).
- `i` will be incremented to 3 in the next iteration.

State: **`t` must be greater than 3, `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `d` ≤ 10, `v_1` is between 1 and 100, `v_2` is between 1 and 100, `i` is 3, and `speeds[3]` will be assigned a value based on `min(speeds[2] + d, v_2 + (t - 4) * d)`**
