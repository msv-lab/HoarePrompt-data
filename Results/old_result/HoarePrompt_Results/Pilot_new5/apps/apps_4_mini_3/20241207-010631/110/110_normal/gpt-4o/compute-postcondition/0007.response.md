The value `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` is being pushed onto the `heap`. Given that `x` is 0 and `y` is 2, we can substitute these values into the expression. The `coverage` function is not defined here, so we will leave it as is.

The `heap` will now include another tuple: `(-coverage(0, 2), 0, 2)` alongside the existing tuples. 

The variables `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` must be greater than 2, `r` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `heap` contains `(-coverage(0, 0), 0, 0), (-coverage(0, 1), 0, 1), (-coverage(0, 2), 0, 2)`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` must be greater than 2, `r` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `heap` contains `(-coverage(0, 0), 0, 0), (-coverage(0, 1), 0, 1), (-coverage(0, 2), 0, 2)`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2**.
