The function `heapq.heappush()` will push a new tuple onto the heap. The tuple being pushed is constructed as `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)`. Given that `x` is 0 and `y` is 1, the first element of the tuple will be `-coverage(0, 1)`. The variables `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the operation.

Thus, the new state of the `heap` will include the previous contents along with the new tuple derived from the coverage function. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` must be greater than 1, `r` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `heap` contains `(-coverage(0, 0), 0, 0), (-coverage(0, 1), 0, 1)`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1**
