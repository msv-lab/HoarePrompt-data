According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `x` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `x` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is 0, and `n` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` should be increased by 1. Therefore, `x` will become 1, and `n` must be greater than 1 to allow another iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer, `r` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `heap` contains `m` tuples of the form `(-coverage(0, y), 0, y)` for `y` in the range from 0 to `m-1`, `x` is 1**
