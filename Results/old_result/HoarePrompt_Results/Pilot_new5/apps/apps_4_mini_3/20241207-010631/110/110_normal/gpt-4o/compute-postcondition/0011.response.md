`heap` is updated with a new tuple `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)`. The values of `x` and `y` are known: `x` is 1 and `y` is 0. Therefore, `-coverage(x, y)` will evaluate to `-coverage(1, 0)`. 

The previous state of `heap` contained `m` tuples of the form `(-coverage(0, y), 0, y)` for `y` in the range from 0 to `m-1`. Since we are adding a new tuple, the output state reflects the updated `heap` while keeping all other variables unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `heap` contains `m + 1` tuples including `(-coverage(1, 0), 1, 0)` and previously `m` tuples of the form `(-coverage(0, y), 0, y)`, `x` is 1, `y` is 0.**
