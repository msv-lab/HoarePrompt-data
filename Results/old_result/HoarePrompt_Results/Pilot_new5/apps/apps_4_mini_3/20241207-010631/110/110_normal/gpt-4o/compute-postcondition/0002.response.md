Functionality: ** The function accepts non-negative integer coordinates `x` and `y`, and a positive integer `r`. It calculates and returns the area of a scoop-net defined by these coordinates and the radius `r`, constrained within a pond of dimensions `n` by `m`. However, the function lacks parameters for `n` and `m`, which should be provided to the function for it to operate correctly. As it stands, the function will raise a NameError when trying to access `n` and `m`, indicating missing context for the calculation. **
