Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. 

Here are the issues with the program:

1. **Expected Value Calculation**: The program calculates the expected number of caught fishes simply by taking the minimum of `k` and the number of possible positions for the scoop-net, which is `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`. This does not accurately reflect the expected value of the number of fishes caught when `k` fishes are placed in the pond. The expected value needs to consider how the fishes are distributed across the pond, and the impact of the scoop's size on the number of fishes caught, which the program does not do.

2. **Output Range and Precision**: The problem states that the output should be the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes, and it should be printed with a precision such that the relative or absolute error does not exceed \(10^{-9}\). The program directly divides `ans` by the number of positions without taking into account the distribution of fishes, which means the output will not reliably meet the precision requirement or reflect the correct expected value.

3. **No Handling of Fish Distribution**: The program doesn't actually place the fishes in the pond. The expected number of caught fishes depends on how the fishes are spread out in relation to where the scoop can be placed. 

Thus, the calculations in the program fail to account for the complexity of the problem, leading to incorrect outputs. A correct implementation would need to account for the optimal distribution of the fishes across the pond in conjunction with the scoop size to determine the maximum expected number of fish caught.
