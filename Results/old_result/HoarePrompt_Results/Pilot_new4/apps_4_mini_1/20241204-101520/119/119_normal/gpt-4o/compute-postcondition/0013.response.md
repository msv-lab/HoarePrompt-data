Postcondition: ***`t`, `s`, and `x` are non-negative integers where 0 ≤ `t`, `x` ≤ 10^9 and 2 ≤ `s` ≤ 10^9; additionally, `x` is not equal to `t`, `x` is greater than `t`. If `(x - t) % s == 0`, the output is 'YES'. Otherwise, if `(x - t - 1) % s == 0` and `x` is not equal to `t + 1`, the output is 'YES'; otherwise, the output is 'NO'.***
