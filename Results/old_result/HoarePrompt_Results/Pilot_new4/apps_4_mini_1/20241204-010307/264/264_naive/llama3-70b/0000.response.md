To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the provided code and the requirements:

The problem states that we have `n` benches, with `m` new people arriving, and we need to calculate the minimum and maximum number of people sitting on any bench after the new people have arrived. 

The provided code is as follows:
```python
n = int(input())
m = int(input())
a = [int(input()) for _ in range(n)]
min_k = max(a) + (m + n - 1) // n
max_k = max(a) + m
print(min_k, max_k)
```

### Breakdown of the Code:

1. `n` is read, representing the number of benches.
2. `m` is read, representing the number of new people.
3. List `a` is created, containing the initial number of people on each of the `n` benches.
4. `min_k` is calculated using `max(a) + (m + n - 1) // n`:
   - Here, `(m + n - 1) // n` computes the distribution of new people across the benches. It effectively divides `m` people across `n` benches as evenly as possible, rounding up.
   - The maximum number of people on a bench before adding new ones is `max(a)`.
   - Thus, `min_k` gives the minimum possible maximum after new people are seated.
5. `max_k` is calculated simply as `max(a) + m`, where all new people sit on the most populated bench.
6. Finally, both `min_k` and `max_k` are printed.

### Evaluation Against Problem Description:

- For `max_k`: The logic is correct. It accurately reflects adding all new people to the most populated bench.
- For `min_k`: The calculation `(m + n - 1) // n` ensures that the new people are distributed to minimize the maximum count on any bench. This effectively adds a rounded-up division of `m` by `n` to the current maximum, which is correct.

### Potential Edge Cases to Consider:

1. **Single Bench (`n = 1`)**: If there is only one bench and multiple new people arrive, both `min_k` and `max_k` should equal the total number of people on that bench after adding new ones.
   - For example, `n = 1`, `m = 5`, `a = [3]` should yield `min_k = 8`, `max_k = 8`.

2. **Equal Distribution**: If `m` is less than `n`, the new people may not fill every bench, which needs to be accounted for in `min_k`.
   - For example, `n = 5`, `m = 3`, `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` should yield `min_k = 2`, `max_k = 4`.

3. **Large Values**: If `m` is significantly larger than `n`, the calculation should still hold for large numbers.

4. **Zero New People**: If `m = 0`, the output should directly reflect the current maximum on the benches.

### Conclusion:

Based on the breakdown and the analysis of edge cases, the program appears to correctly implement the requirements stated in the problem description. I could not find any potential case where the code would fail to provide the correct result.

Correctness: **True**.
