To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. We have `n` benches and `m` new people coming to the park.
2. We need to calculate:
   - The **minimum possible** maximum number of people on any bench (`min_k`).
   - The **maximum possible** maximum number of people on any bench (`max_k`).

### Program Analysis:
```python
n = int(input())  # Read the number of benches
m = int(input())  # Read the number of new people
a = [int(input()) for _ in range(n)]  # Read the initial number of people on each bench

initial_max = max(a)  # Find the current maximum number of people on a single bench
total_people = sum(a)  # Calculate the total number of people currently sitting
max_k = initial_max + m  # Maximum k: all new people sit on the same bench as the current max
min_k = (total_people + m + n - 1) // n  # Minimum k: distribute newcomers evenly across all benches

print(min_k, max_k)  # Output the results
```

### Explanation of the Calculations:
- **Maximum `k` (`max_k`)** is correct because it accounts for all new people sitting on the bench that initially has the most people.
- **Minimum `k` (`min_k`)** calculation is based on the total number of people after adding newcomers, divided by the number of benches, rounded up. This approach correctly ensures that the newcomers are distributed as evenly as possible across the benches.

### Edge Cases:
- **Case with one bench (`n = 1`)**: Here, `min_k` and `max_k` should both equal the initial number of people plus `m`, which is handled correctly.
- **Case with balanced distribution**: For scenarios where `m` is significantly larger than `n`, the way `min_k` is computed should still hold.

### Potential Flaw:
Let's consider an edge case where the number of people on each bench is at its minimum and the number of newcomers is at its maximum:

1. **Input Example**:
   ```
   3
   10000
   1
   1
   1
   ```

   - Initial people: `[1, 1, 1]`, so `initial_max = 1`.
   - Total people currently = `3`.
   - Expecting `min_k = (3 + 10000 + 3 - 1) // 3 = 3334` and `max_k = 1 + 10000 = 10001`.

   The program would output `3334 10001`, which is correct.

2. **Another Input Example**:
   ```
   2
   7
   5
   3
   ```

   - Initial people: `[5, 3]`, so `initial_max = 5`.
   - Total people currently = `8`.
   - Expecting `min_k = (8 + 7 + 2 - 1) // 2 = 8` and `max_k = 5 + 7 = 12`.

   The program outputs `8 12`, which is also correct.

After testing various cases, all calculations and outputs based on the code hold true according to the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
Since I have not found any potential input case where the program fails to adhere to the problem description, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**.
