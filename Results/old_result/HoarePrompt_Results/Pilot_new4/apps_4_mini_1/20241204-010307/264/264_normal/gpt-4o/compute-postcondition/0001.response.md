The value of `m` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The variable `n` remains unchanged and still represents an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and `a_i` continues to be an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) for each i from 1 to `n`. However, `m` is now an input integer.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `m` is an input integer, `a_i` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) for each i from 1 to `n`.**
