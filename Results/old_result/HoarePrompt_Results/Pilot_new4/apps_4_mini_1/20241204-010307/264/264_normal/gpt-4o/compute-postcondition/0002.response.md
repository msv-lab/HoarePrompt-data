The variable `a` is assigned a list of integers, where each integer is taken as input from the user, and this process is repeated `n` times. The variable `n` remains an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive). The states of the other variables are not affected, but now `a` will contain `n` integers based on user input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers obtained from user input, each integer is between 1 and 100 (inclusive).**
