After executing the code `n = int(input())`, the value of `n` is assigned based on user input, which still falls within the specified range of 1 to 100 (inclusive). The other variables, `m` and `a_i`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 10,000 (inclusive), and `a_i` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) for each i from 1 to n; `n` is an input integer.**
