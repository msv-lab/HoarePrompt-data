The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it operates on the constraints defined for integers `n`, `m`, and the list of integers `a_i`. The constraints state that `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 10,000, and each `a_i` (where i ranges from 1 to n) is a positive integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 100. 

The output of the function is not explicitly stated in the provided information, but it suggests that the function processes the input integers and may produce a result based on these constraints.

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters directly but operates on positive integers n (1 <= n <= 100), m (1 <= m <= 10,000), and a list of positive integers a_i (1 <= a_i <= 100 for i from 1 to n). The exact return value is not specified.**
