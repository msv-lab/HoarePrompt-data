To determine the output state after executing the provided code, let's analyze the state of the variables given the initial conditions.

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is a positive integer based on user input.
   - `m` is a positive integer based on user input such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10,000\).
   - `a` is a list of `n` positive integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 100\) for \(i\) from 1 to `n`.
   - `min_k = \max(a) + \frac{m + n - 1}{n}\)
   - `max_k = \max(a) + m`

2. **Impact of the Code**:
   - The code `print(min_k, max_k)` prints the values of `min_k` and `max_k` to the output. It does not change the values of any variables.

3. **Variables Affected and Their Values**:
   - `min_k` is calculated based on the values of `a`, `m`, and `n`.
   - `max_k` is also calculated based on the values of `a` and `m`.

Since the print statement does not modify any variables, the output state will include the calculated values of `min_k` and `max_k`, which depend on the values of `n`, `m`, and `a`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer based on user input; `m` is a positive integer based on user input such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10,000; `a` is a list of `n` positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100 for i from 1 to n; `min_k = max(a) + (m + n - 1) // n; `max_k = max(a) + m; min_k and max_k are printed.**
