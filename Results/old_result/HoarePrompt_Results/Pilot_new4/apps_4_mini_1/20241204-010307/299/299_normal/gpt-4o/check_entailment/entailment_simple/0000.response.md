To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze both the problem requirements and the program itself.

### Problem Requirements
1. Two players (Sasha and Lena) take turns crossing out `k` sticks from `n` sticks.
2. Sasha moves first.
3. Sasha wins if he makes strictly more moves than Lena.
4. The game ends if there are fewer than `k` sticks before a player's turn.
5. If Sasha wins, the output should be "YES"; otherwise, it should be "NO".

### Game Dynamics
- Each player removes exactly `k` sticks per turn until there are fewer than `k` sticks left.
- The total number of turns is determined by how many complete sets of `k` sticks can be removed from `n`, which is given by `n // k`.
- If `n // k` (the total number of full turns possible) is odd, Sasha will have one more turn than Lena, hence he wins.
- If `n // k` is even, both players will have the same number of turns, and Sasha does not win.

### Program Analysis
The program implements the following logic:
- It computes `n // k` to determine how many complete turns can be made.
- It checks if `n // k` is odd or even:
  - If odd, it prints "YES" (indicating Sasha wins).
  - If even, it prints "NO" (indicating Sasha does not win).

### Correctness Evaluation
- The program correctly identifies the number of turns and evaluates whether Sasha has more turns than Lena based on the parity of `n // k`.
- The conditions in the program match the requirements stated in the problem description: it effectively determines if Sasha has strictly more moves based on the total turns.

### Conclusion
Since the program accurately follows the rules laid out in the problem description and handles all specified cases correctly, we can conclude that:

Correctness: **True**
