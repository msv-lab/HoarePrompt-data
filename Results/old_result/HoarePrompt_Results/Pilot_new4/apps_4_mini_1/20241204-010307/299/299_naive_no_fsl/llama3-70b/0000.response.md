Correctness: **False**

The program logic is incorrect. The condition `(n - 1) // k > n // k` is intended to determine if Sasha makes more moves than Lena. However, it does not accurately account for the actual turn-taking mechanics of the game.

To illustrate why the logic is flawed, consider the following case:

Example Input:
```
n = 2
k = 1
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
```

Explanation: 
- Sasha crosses out 1 stick (1 move), leaving 1 stick.
- Lena crosses out 1 stick (1 move), leaving 0 sticks.
- Sasha and Lena both made 1 move, so Sasha does not win.

However, if we apply the program's logic:
- `(2 - 1) // 1 > 2 // 1` becomes `1 > 2`, which is `False`.
- The program would incorrectly output "NO".

This shows that the program does not correctly determine the winner in all possible scenarios, leading to an incorrect result. Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description in every potential case.
