To determine if the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition: `(n + 1) % 10 == 0`. This condition checks whether `n + 1` is a multiple of 10.

Given that `n` can be any value from 0 to 9, let's examine each possibility:

- If `n` is 0, then `(0 + 1) % 10 == 1`, the loop cannot execute.
- If `n` is 1, then `(1 + 1) % 10 == 2`, the loop cannot execute.
- If `n` is 2, then `(2 + 1) % 10 == 3`, the loop cannot execute.
- If `n` is 3, then `(3 + 1) % 10 == 4`, the loop cannot execute.
- If `n` is 4, then `(4 + 1) % 10 == 5`, the loop cannot execute.
- If `n` is 5, then `(5 + 1) % 10 == 6`, the loop cannot execute.
- If `n` is 6, then `(6 + 1) % 10 == 7`, the loop cannot execute.
- If `n` is 7, then `(7 + 1) % 10 == 8`, the loop cannot execute.
- If `n` is 8, then `(8 + 1) % 10 == 9`, the loop cannot execute.
- If `n` is 9, then `(9 + 1) % 10 == 0`, the loop can execute once more.

From this analysis, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be adjusted to 9. All other values of `n` will not satisfy the condition needed for the loop to execute again.

Since `max_9s` is not relevant to the loop's execution condition (as it doesn't affect the current state of `n`), we only need to modify `n`.

State: **`n` must be 9, `max_9s` is 1**
