According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the upper limit defined by `n`. The loop iterates from 1 to `n // 2`, inclusive. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 3.

Since `n` is an integer such that \( 4 \leq n \leq 10^9 \), we need to ensure that the new value of `i` (which will be 3) still satisfies the loop condition \( i \leq n // 2 \). 

This means \( n // 2 \) must be at least 3, implying that \( n \) must be at least 6 (since \( n // 2 \) will yield 3 when \( n \) is 6). Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 6.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 6 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `ans` is set to 1, `i` is 3**
