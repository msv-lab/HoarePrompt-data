The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is designed to operate within the specified constraint that `n` is an integer, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. However, since the function does not take `n` as an input parameter, the specific return value based on this constraint is not mentioned. Therefore, the functionality of the function is not clearly defined without further information about how `n` is utilized or derived within the function.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its return value is not specified based on the constraints provided.**
