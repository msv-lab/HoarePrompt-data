The code `print(pairs)` outputs the value of `pairs`. The variable `pairs` is equal to `max_9s`, which is the number of trailing nines in the original value of `n`. Since `n` is 0 and has no trailing nines, `max_9s` would be 0. Therefore, `pairs` is also 0. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is 0, `max_9s` is 0, `pairs` is 0**
