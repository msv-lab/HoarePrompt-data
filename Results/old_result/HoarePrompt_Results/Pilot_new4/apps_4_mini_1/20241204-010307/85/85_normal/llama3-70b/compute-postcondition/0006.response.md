According to the code, the for loop executes as long as `i` is within the range from 1 to `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, which would make `i` equal to 2. The maximum value for `i` before the loop can no longer execute is `n // 2`, so we need to ensure that `n // 2` is at least 2 for the loop to run again with `i` being 2. This condition implies that `n` must be at least 4.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `ans` is 0, `i` is 2**
