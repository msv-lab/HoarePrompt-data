The value of `max_9s` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `max_9s` was 2, so after the increment, `max_9s` becomes 3. The state of the variable `n` remains unchanged at 9. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be adjusted to 9, `max_9s` is 3.

Output State: **`n` must be adjusted to 9, `max_9s` is 3**.
