You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You stumbled upon a new kind of chess puzzles. The chessboard you are given is not necesserily $8 \times 8$, but it still is $N \times N$. Each square has some number written on it, all the numbers are from $1$ to $N^2$ and all the numbers are pairwise distinct. The $j$-th square in the $i$-th row has a number $A_{ij}$ written on it.

In your chess set you have only three pieces: a knight, a bishop and a rook. At first, you put one of them on the square with the number $1$ (you can choose which one). Then you want to reach square $2$ (possibly passing through some other squares in process), then square $3$ and so on until you reach square $N^2$. In one step you are allowed to either make a valid move with the current piece or replace it with some other piece. Each square can be visited arbitrary number of times.

A knight can move to a square that is two squares away horizontally and one square vertically, or two squares vertically and one square horizontally. A bishop moves diagonally. A rook moves horizontally or vertically. The move should be performed to a different square from the one a piece is currently standing on.

You want to minimize the number of steps of the whole traversal. Among all the paths to have the same number of steps you want to choose the one with the lowest number of piece replacements.

What is the path you should take to satisfy all conditions?


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $N$ ($3 \le N \le 10$) — the size of the chessboard.

Each of the next $N$ lines contains $N$ integers $A_{i1}, A_{i2}, \dots, A_{iN}$ ($1 \le A_{ij} \le N^2$) — the numbers written on the squares of the $i$-th row of the board.

It is guaranteed that all $A_{ij}$ are pairwise distinct.


-----Output-----

The only line should contain two integers — the number of steps in the best answer and the number of replacement moves in it.


-----Example-----
Input
3
1 9 3
8 6 7
4 2 5

Output
12 1



-----Note-----

Here are the steps for the first example (the starting piece is a knight):  Move to $(3, 2)$  Move to $(1, 3)$  Move to $(3, 2)$  Replace the knight with a rook  Move to $(3, 1)$  Move to $(3, 3)$  Move to $(3, 2)$  Move to $(2, 2)$  Move to $(2, 3)$  Move to $(2, 1)$  Move to $(1, 1)$  Move to $(1, 2)$

```

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
