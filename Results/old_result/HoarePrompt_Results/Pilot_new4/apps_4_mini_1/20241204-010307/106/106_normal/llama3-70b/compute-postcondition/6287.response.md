Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `x` is defined and within bounds. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, and `queue` is updated to include `ncur, 2`. Otherwise, `dist[2][ncur]`, `parent[2][ncur]`, and `queue` remain unchanged. If the condition for the if statement is not satisfied, no updates occur, and all variables retain their original values.***
