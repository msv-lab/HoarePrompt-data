The code assigns new values to `nx` and `ny`. Specifically, `nx` is calculated as `x + dx`, and `ny` is calculated as `y + dy`. Given that `y` is 0, `ny` becomes `0 + dy`, which is equal to `dy`. The value of `nx` depends on the current values of `x` and `dx`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 0; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `dy`; `dist[2][ncur]` is unchanged; `parent[2][ncur]` is unchanged; `queue` is unchanged; `dx, dy` are at the end of the list of directions.**
