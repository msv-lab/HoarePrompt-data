The code `nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy` updates the variables `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. Let's calculate the new values:

- `x` is 0.
- `dx` is -1.
- `y` is 1.
- `dy` is -2.

Calculating `nx` and `ny`:
- `nx = x + dx = 0 + (-1) = -1`
- `ny = y + dy = 1 + (-2) = -1`

The new values are `nx = -1` and `ny = -1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

The output state therefore updates `nx` and `ny` while retaining all other initial conditions.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `dist[0]` remains unchanged; `parent[0]` remains unchanged except `parent[0][ncur]` is now equal to `cur, piece`; `dx` is -1; `dy` is -2; `nx` is -1; `ny` is -1.**
