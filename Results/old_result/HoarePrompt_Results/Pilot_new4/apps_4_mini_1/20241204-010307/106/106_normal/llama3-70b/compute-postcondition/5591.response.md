The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The state of other variables remains unaffected. The values of `ncur` and the constant `2` are used in the tuple being appended.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[x + dx][y + dy]; parent[2][ncur] is equal to cur; `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`**.
