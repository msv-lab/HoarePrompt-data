The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are given as `nx = x - 1` and `ny = 10`. The variable `ncur` will depend on the value at the specific indices in the array `A`. The initial state contains `N`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, and `ny`, but since `ncur` is being assigned a value from the array `A`, the other variables remain unchanged. 

The output state will reflect that `ncur` is now equal to the value found at `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is `x - 1` and `ny` is `10`. 

Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 9, `y` is 9, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is 10, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
