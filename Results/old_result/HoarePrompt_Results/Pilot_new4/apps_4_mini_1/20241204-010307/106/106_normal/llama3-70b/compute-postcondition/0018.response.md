In the given code snippet, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`. The variable `cur` is initialized to 1, and `piece` is initialized to 0. Therefore, `parent[0][ncur]` will be assigned the values of `cur` and `piece`. 

Since `ncur` is not explicitly defined in the initial state but is implied to be related to the context, we will keep it as `ncur` in the output state. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, `i` is 0, `x` is 0, `cur` is 1, `piece` is 0, `dist[0][1]` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent` is a 2D list with 3 rows and (N * N + 1) columns initialized to None, `queue` is empty, `y` is 0, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur` (which is 1), `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` (which is 1) and `piece` (which is 0).**
