The statement `dist[2][ncur] = dist[2][cur] + 1` updates the value of `dist[2][ncur]` to be one greater than the value of `dist[2][cur]`. Given that `dist[2][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, it will now be equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`. 

The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged, so the output state should reflect this.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `piece` is 2, `dist[1]` contains the updated minimum distances, `parent[1]` tracks the previous position, `queue` contains at least one valid `(ncur, 1)` tuple, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `0 + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds such that `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
