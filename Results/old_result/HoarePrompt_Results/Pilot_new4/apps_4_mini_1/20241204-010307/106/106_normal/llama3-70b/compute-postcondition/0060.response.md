The code snippet updates the `dist` array. Specifically, the element at `dist[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `dist[1][cur] + 1`. We need to know the current values of `dist[1][cur]` and `ncur`. 

The initial state provides that `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` depend on the values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. However, since the value of `cur` is not provided, we can't calculate the exact value of `dist[1][ncur]` directly. The other variables, `N`, `piece`, `nx`, `ny`, and the contents of the array `A`, remain unchanged.

Thus, the output state is:
Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= `N` <= 10, `piece` is 1, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
