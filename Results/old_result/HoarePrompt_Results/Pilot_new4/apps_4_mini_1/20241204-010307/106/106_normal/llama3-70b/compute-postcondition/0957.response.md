The values of `nx` and `ny` are assigned the results of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. However, the values of `dx` and `dy` are not given in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact values of `nx` and `ny` after the execution. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `0 + dx`, and `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `0 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`**
