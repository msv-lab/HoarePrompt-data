The code `queue.append((ncur, 1))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and the integer `1` are both added to the `queue`. The variable `queue` is affected by this operation, while the other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Given that `ncur` has been assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`, we know that `ncur` will take a specific value based on the contents of the 2D array `A` at the specified indices `nx` and `ny`. The variable `queue` is updated to include this new value.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the values `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`**.
