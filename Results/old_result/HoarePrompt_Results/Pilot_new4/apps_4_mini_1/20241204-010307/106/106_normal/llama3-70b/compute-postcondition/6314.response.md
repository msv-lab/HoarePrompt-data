The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[0][ncur]`. The previous values of `cur` and `piece` are retained, and there is no change to the other variables. The output state should reflect these assignments and the unchanged variables.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`.**
