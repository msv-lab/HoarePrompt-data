The statement `dist[2][ncur] = dist[2][cur] + 1` indicates that the value at `dist[2][ncur]` is being updated to one more than the value at `dist[2][cur]`. The initial state of `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, so this update will change the value of `dist[2][ncur]`. The other variables (`N`, `y`, `x`, `nx`, `ny`, `dist[1][ncur]`, `parent[1][ncur]`, `queue`, `dx`, `dy`, `ncur`, `piece`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `x` is defined and within bounds, `nx` is `x - 1`, `x + 1`, or `x`, `ny` is `1`, `2`, or `3`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated where conditions are met, `parent[1][ncur]` is set for each updated `ncur`, `queue` contains all tuples of updated `ncur` values with `1`, `dx` and `dy` are defined as the tuples [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `ncur` is now assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, the value of `piece` is 2, and `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
