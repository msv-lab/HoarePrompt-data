The variable `queue` is updated by appending the tuple `(ncur, 1)` to it. The other variables retain their previous values, and no other changes occur in the state of the program. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is the current y-coordinate, `piece` is 1, `dist[0][ncur]` holds the shortest distance from the start to all reachable positions in the grid, `parent[0][ncur]` indicates the predecessor of each position in the path, `queue` now contains the previously held tuples along with a new tuple `(ncur, 1)`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid such that `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is now equal to `cur, piece`.**
