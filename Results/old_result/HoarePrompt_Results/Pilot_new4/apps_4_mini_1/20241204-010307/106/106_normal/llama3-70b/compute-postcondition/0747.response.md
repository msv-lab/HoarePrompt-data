The code assigns `cur` and `piece` to `parent[1][ncur]`, where `ncur` is equal to `A[x + 1][4]`. The previous values of `ncur` are dependent on `x` since `ncur` is calculated as `A[x + 1][4]`. The other variables remain unaffected. The state of the variables after execution will include that `parent[1][ncur]` is now assigned the values of `cur` and `piece`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 3, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is 4, `ncur` is `A[x + 1][4]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is now `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned `cur, piece`.**
