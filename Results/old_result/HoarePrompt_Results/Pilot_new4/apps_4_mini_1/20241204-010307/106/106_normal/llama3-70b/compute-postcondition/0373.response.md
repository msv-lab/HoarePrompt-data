The line of code assigns `cur` and `piece` to `parent[0][ncur]`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. The variable `ncur` is dependent on the values of `nx` and `ny`, which are previously defined but do not change during this execution. The precondition regarding `dist` being updated and the values of `N`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` will remain valid.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is `x - 2`, `ny` is 2, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur, piece`.**
