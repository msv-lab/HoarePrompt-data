The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, which indicates that `ncur` takes the value from the 2D list or array `A` at the indices `nx` and `ny`. Given that `nx` can be either 0, 2, or 1, and `ny` can be either 0, 1, or 2, `ncur` will be defined by the current values of `nx` and `ny`, which fall within the bounds between 0 and N-1 (inclusive).

The Output State reflects that `ncur` has been assigned a value based on the previously mentioned conditions.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 1; `nx` is either 0, 2, or 1; `ny` is either 0, 1, or 2; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]` based on the current values of `nx` and `ny`.**
