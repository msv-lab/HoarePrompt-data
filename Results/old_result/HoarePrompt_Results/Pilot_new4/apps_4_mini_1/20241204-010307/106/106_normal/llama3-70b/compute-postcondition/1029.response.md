The code assigns the value of `dist[2][cur] + 1` to `dist[2][ncur]`. Since `dist[2][ncur]` was initially greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, it will now be equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `piece` is now 2, `nx` is between 0 and N-1, `ny` is between 0 and N-1, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
