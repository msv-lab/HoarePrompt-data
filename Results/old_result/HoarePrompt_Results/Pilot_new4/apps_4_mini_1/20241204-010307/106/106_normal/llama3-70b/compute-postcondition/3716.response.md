The code snippet `queue.append((ncur, 1))` adds a tuple containing `ncur` and the integer `1` to the list `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `1` are being appended, but no other variables in the initial state are changed by this operation.

Since `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `1` is a fixed integer being appended, the overall state of the variables remains unchanged except for `queue`, which now includes a new element.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `piece` is 1, `nx` is `2 + dx`, `ny` is `0 + dy`, `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is now equal to `cur`, `queue` contains the previous elements plus the tuple `(ncur, 1)`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and the value of `dist[1][ncur]` is now less than or equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`**.
