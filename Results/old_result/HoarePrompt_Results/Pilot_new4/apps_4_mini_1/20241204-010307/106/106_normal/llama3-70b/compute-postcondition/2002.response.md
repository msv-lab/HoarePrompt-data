Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent[2][ncur]` is updated to `cur`, `piece` remains 2, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, and `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1` if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`. If the condition `piece == 2 and dist[2][ncur] > dist[2][cur] + 1` is true, then `queue` includes `(ncur, 2)`; otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
