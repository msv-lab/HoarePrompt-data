Postcondition: ***`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is 4; `y` is 2; `nx` is 3, 4, or 5; `ny` is 1, 2, or 3; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`. Otherwise, there are no changes to the states of `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.***
