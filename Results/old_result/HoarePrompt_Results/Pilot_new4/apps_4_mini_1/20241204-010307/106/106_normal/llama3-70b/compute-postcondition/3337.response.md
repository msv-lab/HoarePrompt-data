The line of code `dist[0][ncur] = dist[0][cur] + 1` updates the value of `dist[0][ncur]` to be one more than the current distance `dist[0][cur]`. The other variables remain unchanged, but we need to specify the new value of `dist[0][ncur]` based on the relationship to `dist[0][cur]`.

Given that `dist[0][ncur]` is updated, we denote `dist[0][ncur]` as `dist[0][cur] + 1`.

The other variables retain their previous values:

- `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`
- `x` is 0
- `y` is 2
- `cur` remains unchanged
- `dist[1]` remains unchanged
- `parent[1]` remains unchanged
- `piece` was initially 2 but is updated to 0, which we will include
- `dist[2][ncur]` is still equal to the minimum distance from `(0, 2)`
- `parent[2][ncur]` still contains the updated parent positions
- `nx` is `0 + dx`
- `ny` is `2 + dy`
- `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`
- `dist[0][ncur]` was greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1` before the update.

The updated conditions state that `dist[0][ncur]` has been set to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `piece` is now 0.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `cur` is unchanged, `dist[1]` remains unchanged, `parent[1]` remains unchanged, `piece` is equal to 0, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to the minimum distance from `(0, 2)`, `parent[2][ncur]` contains the updated parent positions, `nx` is `0 + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
