The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The values of `x` and `y` are `dx` and `dy`, which are -1 and 0. Thus, `nx` will be calculated as `-1 + (-1)`, resulting in `nx = -2`, and `ny` will be calculated as `0 + 0`, resulting in `ny = 0`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is `dx`, `y` is `dy`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is -2, `ny` is 0**.
