According to the code, the loop iterates over the possible knight moves represented by the tuples `(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)`. Since this is a fixed-length list of four tuples, the loop is designed to execute a total of four times, once for each of the tuples.

At the end of the last iteration, we need to determine what the values of `dx` and `dy` will be at the start of the next iteration. Given that the iterations go through the list in order, if we denote the current iteration as `i`, then:

1. In the first iteration, `i = 0`, which gives `(dx, dy) = (-1, -1)`.
2. In the second iteration, `i = 1`, which gives `(dx, dy) = (-1, 1)`.
3. In the third iteration, `i = 2`, which gives `(dx, dy) = (1, -1)`.
4. In the fourth iteration, `i = 3`, which gives `(dx, dy) = (1, 1)`.

Since the task is to consider the state at the start of the next iteration after the last one has concluded, after the last valid iteration (where `i = 3`), there are no more tuples left in the list of knight moves. Therefore, the loop cannot execute again as there are no new `(dx, dy)` pairs to process.

Thus, since the loop cannot execute again, we describe the state as it would remain unchanged, but we acknowledge that it has completed its iterations.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `dist[1]` is updated at index `ncur`, `parent[1][ncur]` is now equal to `cur`, `piece` is equal to 1, `dist[0][ncur]` remains equal to the minimum distance from `(0, 2)`, `parent[0][ncur]` contains updated parent positions, `queue` contains tuples `(ncur, 0)` and `(ncur, 1)`, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 1 for the last iteration, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 1, and `ncur` maintains its latest value after processing all relevant conditions.**
