According to the code, the loop will execute for each tuple `(dx, dy)` in the list `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`. This list contains 4 elements, meaning the loop can run a total of 4 times. 

At the end of the last iteration, `dx` and `dy` correspond to the last tuple in the list, which is `(0, 1)` from the last iteration of the loop. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to increment to the next tuple in the list. However, since there are no more tuples left in the list, the loop cannot execute again.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that the loop has completed all its iterations and cannot execute further. 

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is -1, `ny` is 0, `dx` is not applicable, `dy` is not applicable**
