The statement `dist[1][ncur] = dist[1][cur] + 1` assigns a new value to `dist[1][ncur]`. The previous condition states that the distance at `ncur` is greater than the distance at `cur` plus 1. After the assignment, the distance at `ncur` will now equal `dist[1][cur] + 1`, thus it will no longer be greater than the previous value. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `cur` is a valid index, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid (0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N), the value of `piece` is 1, and now `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, contradicting the previous condition that `dist[1][ncur] > dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
