The variable `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, which is unknown, along with `piece`. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `dist`, `A`, and `cur` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will include all the preconditions that remain valid.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -2, `nx` is 0, `ny` is -2, `ncur` is equal to `A[0][-2]`, `dist[0][ncur] = dist[0][cur] + 1` (cur is unknown), `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.**
