According to the code, the loop iterates over a fixed list of tuples representing directional changes `dx` and `dy`. The loop will execute for each tuple in that list. Since the list `[(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]` contains 4 tuples, the loop will run 4 times in total. Given that the previous iteration is the last one of the loop, we need to consider the current iteration count.

At the end of the last iteration, if `dx` and `dy` correspond to the last tuple `(1, 1)`, then we need to adjust for the next iteration. The loop will not execute again because it has already processed all items in the list.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, it should not be based on the tuple values since they are fixed. Instead, we should note that the loop has completed its iterations.

State: **`N` is an integer between 3 and 10, `y` is equal to `N`, `x` is a valid integer within bounds, `nx` is equal to `x + 1`, and `ny` is equal to `N + 1`. The loop has already completed its 4 iterations with all tuples processed.**
