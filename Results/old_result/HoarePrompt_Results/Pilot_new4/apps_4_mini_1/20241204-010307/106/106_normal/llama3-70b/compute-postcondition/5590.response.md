The statement `parent[2][ncur] = cur` assigns the value of `cur` to the specific position `parent[2][ncur]`. 

Given the initial state:
- `N` is between 3 and 10
- `nx` is equal to `x + dx`
- `ny` is equal to `y + dy`
- `ncur` is equal to `A[x + dx][y + dy]`
- `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`

The assignment does not change the values of `N`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, or `dist` but updates the `parent` array.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[x + dx][y + dy]; parent[2][ncur] is equal to cur.**
