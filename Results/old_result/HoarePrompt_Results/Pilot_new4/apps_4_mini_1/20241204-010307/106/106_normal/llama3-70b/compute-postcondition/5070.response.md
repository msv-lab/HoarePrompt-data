In the provided code, `nx` and `ny` are computed based on the current coordinates `(x, y)` by adding `dx` and `dy`, respectively. Given that `dx` is `-1` and `dy` is `0`, this implies that `nx` will be one unit to the left of `x`, while `ny` will remain equal to `y`. The variables `dist` and `piece` remain unchanged. 

Thus, the output state will reflect the updated values of `nx` and `ny` based on the current `(x, y)` position:

Output State: **`dist` contains the shortest distances from (3, 0) to all reachable positions, `piece` is equal to 2, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y`.**
