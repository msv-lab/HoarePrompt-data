The variable `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`. The value of `nx` is `x - 1`, and `ny` is `0`. The value of `x` is in the range `0 <= x < N`, meaning `nx` will be in the range `-1 <= nx < N - 1`. 

Since `ny` is `0`, `ncur` will take on the value at the position `[nx][0]` in the array `A`. The values of `N`, `y`, `x`, `piece`, and `ny` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `piece` is 2, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is `A[nx][0]`.**
