Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `x` is defined and within bounds, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dx` and `dy` are taken from the list of tuples for possible moves, `ncur` is valid for `dist` updates when `piece` is 0, `piece` is equal to 1, and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`.***
