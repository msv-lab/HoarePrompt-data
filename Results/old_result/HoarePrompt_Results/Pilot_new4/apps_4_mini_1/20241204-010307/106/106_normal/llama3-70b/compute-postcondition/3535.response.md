`nx` is assigned the value of `x + dx`, and `ny` is assigned the value of `y + dy`. The values of `x` and `y` are within `0` and `N-1`, while `dx` and `dy` are presumably defined movement offsets. The states of the other variables remain unchanged, as the code only updates `nx` and `ny`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is within `0` and `N-1`, `y` is within `0` and `N-1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated for reachable positions based on the conditions of the loop, `parent[0][ncur]` reflects the last piece and position before reaching `ncur`, `queue` contains all positions reachable by the current piece from `(x,y)` using the defined moves, `dist[0][cur]` remains unchanged for any unreachable positions.**
