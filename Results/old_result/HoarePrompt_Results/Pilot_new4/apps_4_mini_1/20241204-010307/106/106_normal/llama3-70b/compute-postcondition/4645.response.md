The variable `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to be equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`. Given that `dist[0][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, it indicates that the new value is now less than the previous value of `dist[0][ncur]`. We do not have specific values for `cur` or `ncur`, but we know that the relation between these variables remains valid.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is equal to `1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]` where `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, `piece` is 0, and `dist[0][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1` (which is less than its previous value).**
