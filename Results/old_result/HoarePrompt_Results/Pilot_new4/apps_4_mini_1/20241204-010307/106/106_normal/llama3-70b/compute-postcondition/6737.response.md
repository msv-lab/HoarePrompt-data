The variable `queue` is updated by appending a tuple containing `cur` and `i`. The previous values of `cur` and `i` are not specified but are important for the new state of the program. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 1; `dist[1]` contains updated distances for valid positions reachable from (1, 1); `parent[1]` contains predecessors for valid positions reachable from (1, 1); `queue` now contains the previously existing tuples plus the new tuple `(cur, i)`; and the current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 1; `dist[1]` contains updated distances for valid positions reachable from (1, 1); `parent[1]` contains predecessors for valid positions reachable from (1, 1); `queue` contains tuples of all reachable positions from (1, 1) that had their distances updated during the loop plus the new tuple `(cur, i)`; and the current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`.**
