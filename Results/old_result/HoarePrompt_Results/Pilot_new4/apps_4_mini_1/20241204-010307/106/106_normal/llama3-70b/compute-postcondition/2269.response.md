The code results in appending a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The existing values of `ncur` and `piece` are not modified, and the states of the other variables remain unchanged. The output reflects the state of the `queue` after the operation.

Output State: **`piece` is 1, `(dx, dy)` is (0, -1), `nx` is `x`, `ny` is `y - 1`, `ncur` is `A[x][y - 1]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `piece`, and the tuple `(ncur, 2)` is appended to `queue`.**
