Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is an integer; `dist` contains the updated shortest distances for valid indices based on the conditions; `parent` contains the updated parent indices for valid nodes; `queue` contains tuples of valid states for indices where the conditions were met; the current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`.***
