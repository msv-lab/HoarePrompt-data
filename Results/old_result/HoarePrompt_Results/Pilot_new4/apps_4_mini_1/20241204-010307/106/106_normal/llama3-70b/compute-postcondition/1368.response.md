The code updates the value of `dist[1][ncur]` to `dist[1][cur] + 1`. The variables `ncur`, `cur`, and `dist` are affected by this operation. However, without specific values for `cur` and `dist`, we cannot determine the exact values after execution. 

Since `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, it is dependent on the values of `nx` and `ny`. Given that `nx = 2 + dx` and `ny = 0 + dy`, the values of `nx` and `ny` will also impact `ncur`. 

The values of `N`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the assignment. 

Therefore, the output state is:
- `N` is between 3 and 10
- `x` is 2
- `y` is 0
- `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`
- `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`
- `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`
- `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 2; `y` is 0; `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
