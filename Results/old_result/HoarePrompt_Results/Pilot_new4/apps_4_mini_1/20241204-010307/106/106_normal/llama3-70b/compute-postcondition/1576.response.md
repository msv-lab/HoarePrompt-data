Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 2. If `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, then `dist[2]`, `parent[2]`, and `queue` remain unchanged. If `piece` is not equal to `i`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur` where `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` was greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is updated for each corresponding `ncur`. Additionally, `queue` contains all tuples of valid `ncur` values where the piece is 2 plus the new tuple `(cur, i)`, and `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur` where `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` was greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`. If the loop did not execute, then `dist[2]`, `parent[2]`, and `queue` remain unchanged.***
