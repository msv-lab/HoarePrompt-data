Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` equals `x + dx`, `ny` equals `2 + dy`, `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`, where `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`. The value of `piece` is 0, and the current value of `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`.***
