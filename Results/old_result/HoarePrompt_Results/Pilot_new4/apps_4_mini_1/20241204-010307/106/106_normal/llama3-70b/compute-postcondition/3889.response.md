Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `nx` is `2 + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, and `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` was greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is now equal to `cur`, and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. The values of `dist[0]`, `parent[0]`, and `queue` remain unchanged.***
