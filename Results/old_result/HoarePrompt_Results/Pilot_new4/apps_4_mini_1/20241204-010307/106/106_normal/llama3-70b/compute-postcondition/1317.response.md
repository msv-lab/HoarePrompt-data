According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `x` is less than `N`. The variable `x` starts at 1. Since `N` is between 3 and 10, the loop will execute again as long as `x` is less than 3. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` will be increased by 1 to 2. Therefore, it must also be ensured that `N` remains at least 3 for `x` to be less than `N` in the next iteration.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 2; `dist` reflects the updated shortest path distances for all valid reachable `ncur` positions derived from the initial position `cur`, based on the conditions of the loop; `parent` stores the corresponding previous positions and piece types for those reachable `ncur`; `queue` contains all reachable tuples derived from the iterations, including tuples for each updated `ncur` based on the piece type conditions, and if `piece` is not equal to `i`, the tuple `(cur, i)` is also included.**
