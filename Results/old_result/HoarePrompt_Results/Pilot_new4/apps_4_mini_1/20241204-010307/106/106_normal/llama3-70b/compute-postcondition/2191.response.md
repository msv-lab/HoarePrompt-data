According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `y` and the defined range of `N`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `y` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is still within the range defined by `N`. Assuming that `y` is less than `N` at the end of the last iteration, `y` will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

Thus, if `y` is `n` at the end of the last iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be incremented to `n + 1`. Therefore, to determine the states at the start of the next iteration, we must ensure that `y` is updated accordingly.

State: **`dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices, and `queue` contains one element `[(cur, n + 1)]` if `A[x][y]` equals `cur` and `piece` is not equal to `n + 1`. If `piece` equals `n + 1`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged.**
