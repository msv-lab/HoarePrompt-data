According to the code, the loop iterates over a list of tuples representing direction changes for the variables `dx` and `dy`. The loop will execute for each tuple in the list.

At the end of the last iteration, the values of `dx` and `dy` will determine the next state. The current iteration of the loop has `dx` of -1 and `dy` of 0, which corresponds to moving left. The next tuple is (1, 0), which represents moving right. 

Since there are 4 tuples in total: (-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), the next iteration will use the second tuple, which is (1, 0). This means `dx` will be updated to 1 and `dy` will remain 0.

The loop can execute again, so the state needs to reflect this change. There are no additional constraints or changes to `N`, `x`, `y`, `dist`, `parent`, or `queue` described in the context of the next iteration.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, `dist[1]` remains unchanged, `parent[1]` remains unchanged, `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`, and `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1` if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0.**
