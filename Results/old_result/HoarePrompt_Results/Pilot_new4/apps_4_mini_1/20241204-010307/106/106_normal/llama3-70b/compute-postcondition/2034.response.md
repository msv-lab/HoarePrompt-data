Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 5; if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and if `piece` is equal to 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `queue` contains (cur, i), (ncur, 0), and (ncur, 0); `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is equal to `y - 1`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
