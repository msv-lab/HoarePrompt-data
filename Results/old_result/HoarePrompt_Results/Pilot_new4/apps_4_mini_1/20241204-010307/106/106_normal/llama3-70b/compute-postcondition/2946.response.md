The code appends a tuple containing `ncur` and `1` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `1` are used directly from the initial state without modification. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `dist` indicates at least one reachable position, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `piece` is equal to 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `0 + 1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`.**
