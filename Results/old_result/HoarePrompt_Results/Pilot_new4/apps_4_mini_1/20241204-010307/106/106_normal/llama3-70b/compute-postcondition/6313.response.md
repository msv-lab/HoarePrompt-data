The variable `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to the value of `dist[0][cur] + 1`. Given the initial state, `dist[0][ncur]` was greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, which means that the condition holds true. The other variables remain unchanged in this execution.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 0, and `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
