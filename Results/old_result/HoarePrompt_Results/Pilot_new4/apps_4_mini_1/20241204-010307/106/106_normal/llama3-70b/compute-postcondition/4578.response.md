Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 1; `dx` is -1; `dy` is -2; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is -1; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][-1]`; if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, and `queue` is updated to include `(ncur, 0)`; otherwise, no changes are made.***
