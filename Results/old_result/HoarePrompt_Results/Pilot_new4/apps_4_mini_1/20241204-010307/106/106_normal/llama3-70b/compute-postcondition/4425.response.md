The code snippet `nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy` calculates the new coordinates `nx` and `ny` based on the current coordinates `x` and `y`, and the directional offsets `dx` and `dy`. The initial state mentions that `y` is equal to `N`, and `N` is an integer such that `4 <= N <= 11`. However, the values of `x`, `dx`, and `dy` are not specified in the initial state.

Since there are no specific values for `x`, `dx`, or `dy`, we cannot determine exact values for `nx` and `ny`. As a result, the output state will reflect that `nx` and `ny` will be determined based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`, without providing explicit values.

The output state reflects that `N` is an integer within the given range and that `y` is equal to `N`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are dependent on the unknown values of `x`, `dx`, and `dy`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `4 <= N <= 11`; `y` is equal to `N`; `nx` is `x + dx`; `ny` is `y + dy`.**
