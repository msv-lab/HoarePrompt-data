The code snippet provided appends a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The variables themselves do not change, only the `queue` is modified by adding a new element to it. Therefore, the values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` remains unchanged, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to (`cur`, `piece`), `queue` now contains the element `(ncur, 2)`**.
