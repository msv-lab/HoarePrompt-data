According to the code, the for loop iterates over the list of tuples `[(−1, 0), (1, 0), (0, −1), (0, 1)]`, which consists of 4 pairs representing directions. In the last iteration, the loop is processing the first tuple `(-1, 0)`, then it moves to the next tuple in the next iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, the loop has processed the pair `(-1, 0)`. The `dx` and `dy` values will be updated to the next tuple in the list for the next iteration.

To execute one more time, the loop will now process the next tuple `(1, 0)`. After this iteration, it will continue to the subsequent pairs. 

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `ncur` is updated to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 2, `dist[1][ncur]` and `parent[1][ncur]` can still be updated, `queue` contains the newly appended tuple `(ncur, 2)`, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0**
