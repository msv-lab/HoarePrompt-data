The variable `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur` and `piece`. The states of the other variables are not affected. The initial state indicates that `N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is the original x position; `y` is the original y position + 1; `nx` equals `x + dx`; `ny` equals `y + dy`; `ncur` equals `A[nx][ny]`; and `dist[0][ncur]` equals `dist[0][cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is the original x position; `y` is the original y position + 1; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`.**
