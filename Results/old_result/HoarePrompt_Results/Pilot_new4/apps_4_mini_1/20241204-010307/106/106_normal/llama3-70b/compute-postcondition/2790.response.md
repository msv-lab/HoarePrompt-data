The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `piece` remain unchanged, but the state of the `queue` is modified by adding a new element.

Since `ncur` is equal to `A[x][y + 1]`, and `piece` is equal to `2`, the `queue` will now contain a new entry based on the current state. The earlier values of other variables remain valid, but the `queue` is updated.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is the current y-coordinate, `piece` is equal to 2, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x][y + 1]`, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to (cur, piece), `queue` has an additional element `(ncur, 2)`**
