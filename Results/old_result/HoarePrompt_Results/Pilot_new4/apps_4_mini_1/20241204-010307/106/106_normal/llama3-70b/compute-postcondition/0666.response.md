The values of `nx` and `ny` are updated based on the calculations using the values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. The formula `nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy` will change `nx` and `ny`. 

The variable `x` is an integer such that `0 < x < N`, so `x + dx` means `x - 1`, given that `dx` is -1. 

The variable `y` is currently 1, and with `dy` being -1, `y + dy` means `1 - 1`, which results in `0`.

Thus, after execution, `nx` becomes `x - 1`, and `ny` becomes `0`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 1; `x` is an integer such that `0 < x < N`; `dx` is -1; `dy` is -1; `nx` is `x - 1`; `ny` is 0**.
