Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dist[0]` remains unchanged, `parent[0]` remains unchanged, `queue` contains at least one tuple of (ncur, 1) and now also contains (ncur, 2) if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1` with `parent[2][ncur]` equal to `cur`. If the condition is not satisfied, the program state remains unchanged.***
