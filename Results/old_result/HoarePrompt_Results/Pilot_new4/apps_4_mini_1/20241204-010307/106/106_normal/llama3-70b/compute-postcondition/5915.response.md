The values of `nx` and `ny` are updated based on the calculations involving `x` and `y`. The variable `dx` is 1, which means `nx` will be `x + 1`, and `dy` is -1, which means `ny` will be `y - 1`. Since values of `x` and `y` are not provided, we only know that `nx` will be `x + 1` and `ny` will be `y - 1`.

The initial states of `N`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy` remain unchanged, while `nx` and `ny` are recalculated. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is between 0 and 8 (inclusive), `dx` is 1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x + 1`, and `ny` is equal to `y - 1.**
