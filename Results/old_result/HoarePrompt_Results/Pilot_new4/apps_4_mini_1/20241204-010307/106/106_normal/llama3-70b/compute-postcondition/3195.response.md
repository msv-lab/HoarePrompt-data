Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is within the range `[0, N-1]`, `ny` is within the range `[0, N-1]`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur` reachable from `(x, y)`, `parent[0][ncur]` is established for those reachable positions, `queue` contains tuples `(ncur, 0)` for each valid `ncur` that met the conditions. If `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is now equal to `cur, piece`, and `queue` includes `(ncur, 1)` as a new entry.***
