Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, `dist[0]` reflects updated distances based on valid moves, `parent[0]` contains parent relationships for valid moves, `queue` contains potential next states, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]` where `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`. The value of `piece` is 1, and the current value of `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`.***
