In the provided code snippet, the main operation is the appending of a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The other variables mentioned in the initial state remain unchanged. Thus, the output state reflects the updated status of `queue` after the operation. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 1, `dist[1]` remains unchanged, `parent[1]` remains unchanged, `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)` in addition to its previous contents, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `(cur, piece)`**.
