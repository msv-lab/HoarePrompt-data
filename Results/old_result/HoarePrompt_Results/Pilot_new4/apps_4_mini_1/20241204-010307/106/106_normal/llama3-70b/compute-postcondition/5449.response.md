The values of `nx` and `ny` are updated based on the expressions `nx = x + dx` and `ny = y + dy`. The initial values are `x = 4` and `y = 2`, so we can substitute those into the equations. The values of `dx` and `dy` are unknown, so we will leave them as variables in the output state.

1. `nx` becomes `4 + dx`.
2. `ny` becomes `2 + dy`.

The conditions state that both `nx` and `ny` must be between 0 and `N-1`, and since `N` is between 4 and 10, `N-1` ranges from 3 to 9. Therefore, the specific ranges for `nx` and `ny` will also depend on the values of `dx` and `dy`, but both must fall within the range of 0 to 9.

We know that `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]` if these conditions are met, but since we don't have specific values for `dx` and `dy`, we can't determine exact values for `nx` and `ny` or the final value of `ncur`.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is 4; `y` is 2; `nx` is equal to `4 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`; both `nx` and `ny` are between 0 and `N-1`.**
