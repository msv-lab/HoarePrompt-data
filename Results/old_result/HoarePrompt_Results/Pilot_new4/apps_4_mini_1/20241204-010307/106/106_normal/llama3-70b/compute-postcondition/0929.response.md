According to the code, the for loop will iterate through four pairs of `(dx, dy)`, specifically `(-1, -1)`, `(-1, 1)`, `(1, -1)`, and `(1, 1)`. Given that the loop has already executed once (the state is provided at the end of the previous iteration), the variable `dx` and `dy` must now be adjusted to reflect the next iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, `dx` and `dy` are currently set to the first pair, which is `(-1, -1)`. The loop has executed through that first pair already, so in order for the loop to execute again, it would need to move to the next pair.

For the first iteration:
- `(dx, dy)` was `(-1, -1)`

For the second iteration:
- `(dx, dy)` will be `(-1, 1)`

Given that `N` is between 3 and 10 and the conditions regarding `nx`, `ny`, `piece`, `dist`, `cur`, `ncur`, and `queue` are unchanged from the previous state, they do not need to be modified.

Thus, the updated state for the next iteration of the loop will reflect the change in `dx` and `dy`.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1**
