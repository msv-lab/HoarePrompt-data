The code snippet executes a method to append an item to a queue. The variable `queue` is not defined in the initial state, but it is assumed to exist and be a list. The operation `queue.append((ncur, 1))` adds a tuple containing the current value of `ncur` and the integer `1` to the `queue`. The initial state remains unchanged except for the addition of the new item in the `queue`.

Output State: **`parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur`, `piece`; `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)` appended.**
