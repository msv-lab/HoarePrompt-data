According to the code, the for loop iterates over the list of direction tuples `[( -1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`. Each iteration updates the variables `dx` and `dy` to the respective values from the tuples as it progresses through the list. 

At the end of the last iteration, `dx` and `dy` would have been set to the last direction tuple. Since there are four tuples in the list, after the last iteration, `dx` would be `0` and `dy` would be `1`. 

The loop will execute again only if there are more tuples in the list. However, in this case, since all tuples have been processed, there will not be a next iteration.

Therefore, there are no changes to the state that would indicate another iteration can occur; instead, we have reached the end of the loop.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `piece` remains equal to 2, `dist` and `parent` are unchanged, `queue` retains its current entries, `ncur` is unchanged, `dist[2][ncur]` and `parent[2][ncur]` remain as they were at the end of the last iteration.**
