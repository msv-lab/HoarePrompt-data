According to the code, the loop iterates over the directions represented by the tuples `(-1, 0)`, `(1, 0)`, `(0, -1)`, and `(0, 1)`. These represent movements in a grid: up, down, left, and right respectively. The loop can execute independently of the values of `N`, `y`, `dist[1]`, `parent[1]`, or `queue`.

However, for the loop body to have any meaningful effect, we need to consider the context of what the loop might be doing with the distances, parent relationships, and the queue. Since no specific conditions for executing the loop body are mentioned, we cannot determine any specific adjustments needed to the states concerning `dist`, `parent`, or `queue` based solely on the provided information.

Thus, we primarily need to ensure that relevant conditions for distance updates and parent relationships can be inferred from the state:

- There must be valid moves that can be performed based on the current distances and parents, which implies that there should be some meaningful content in `queue` to signify that the loop will be processing potential next states.

In summary, the states that ensure the loop can execute effectively are as follows:

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dist[1]` reflects updated distances based on valid moves, `parent[1]` contains updated parent relationships for valid moves, `queue` must contain potential next states based on valid moves from the initial position**.
