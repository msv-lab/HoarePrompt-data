The code assigns the value of `dist[1][cur] + 1` to `dist[1][ncur]`. Given that `dist[1][ncur]` is updated based on the previous values of `dist[1][cur]`, the conditions indicate that `dist[1][ncur]` was previously greater than this new calculated value. Therefore, the output state reflects this change.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dist` and `parent` will be updated based on the loop body, `queue` contains all valid `(ncur, 0)` pairs, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 1, and `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
