The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned new values based on the current values of `x`, `y`, and the directional changes `dx` and `dy`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Thus, after executing the code, `nx` is equal to `x + dx` and `ny` is equal to `y + dy`. The values of `dist`, `parent`, `piece`, `queue`, `N`, `y`, and `A[x][y]` remain the same as before.

Output State: **`dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices, `piece` is determined by the loop, `queue` contains valid tuples, `N` is greater than 0, `y` is 0, the current value of `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`**.
