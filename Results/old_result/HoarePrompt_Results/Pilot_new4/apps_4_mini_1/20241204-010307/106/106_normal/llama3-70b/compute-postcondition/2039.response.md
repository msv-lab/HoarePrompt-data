The code assigns the value of `cur` to `parent[0][ncur]`. The state of the other variables is not affected, and the previous values of the affected variables are still valid. The variable `ncur` is already defined as `A[nx][ny]`, but since we do not have specific values for `cur`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, and `ny`, we will keep their relationships as they are.

Output State: **`N` is at least 5, `dx` and `dy` correspond to the next tuple in the list of movement directions, `i` is less than 8, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur`.**
