Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is -1, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is 1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is -2`, and `ncur` is `A[nx][-2]`. If `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `queue` now contains an additional element `(ncur, 1)`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.***
