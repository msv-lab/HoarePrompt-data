The variable `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur` and `piece`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 3, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is 4, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `cur, piece`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 3, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is 4, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `cur, piece`.**
