The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue` list. The variables `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `piece`, `dist`, and `parent` remain unchanged by this operation. 

Since there are no changes to the existing states of the variables, and we only add to the queue, we still retain all the initial conditions.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `nx` is `2 + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `dist[0][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, and `queue` now includes `(ncur, 0)`**.
