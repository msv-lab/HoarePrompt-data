Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is -1, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is `x - 2`, and `ny` is 0. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, there are no changes to the state of the program.***
