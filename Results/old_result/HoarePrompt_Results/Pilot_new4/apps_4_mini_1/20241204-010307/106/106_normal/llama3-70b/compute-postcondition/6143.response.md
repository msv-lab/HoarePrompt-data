In the provided code snippet, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated by assigning it the value of `dist[0][cur] + 1`. The variable `ncur` is defined as `A[nx][ny]`, which means it takes its value based on the indices derived from `nx` and `ny`. The other variables remain unaffected.

- `N` is between 3 and 10, meaning it can take values 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10.
- `y` is 1, which remains unchanged.
- `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, and `ny` is equal to `1 + dy` (both remain unchanged).
- `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, which also remains unchanged.

The key change is in the `dist` variable, specifically at the index `[0][ncur]`. Its new value will be `dist[0][cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
