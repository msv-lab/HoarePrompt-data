Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is the current y-coordinate, `piece` is equal to 2, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1`, and if both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of 0 and N (exclusive), then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][y + 1]`. If `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`. If the condition is not met, no changes occur in the variables.***
