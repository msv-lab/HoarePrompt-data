The `queue` is updated by appending the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `dist`, `parent`, and `piece` remain unchanged as a result of this code execution. Therefore, the Output State reflects the unchanged variables along with the addition to the queue.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `queue` may contain multiple elements as a result of appending `(ncur, 0)` for valid `(nx, ny)` positions, now including `(ncur, 1)`; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `nx` can be -1 or 1; `ny` can be 0 or 2; `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` reflects the minimum distance found from `cur` to `ncur` incremented by the number of valid iterations; `parent[0][ncur]` holds the last valid parent value of `(cur, piece)`; `piece` is equal to 1; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1; parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`; now `queue` includes `(ncur, 1)`.**
