The code snippet assigns values to `parent[1][ncur]` using `cur` and `piece`. Since `ncur` is determined to be `A[3][0]`, we assume that `parent[1]` is an array and `ncur` represents the index to be updated. However, no specific values for `cur` or `piece` are given in the initial state, so we cannot determine their values. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 2; `y` is 1; `nx` is 3; `ny` is 0; `dx` is 1; `dy` is -1; `ncur` is `A[3][0]`; `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the values of `cur` and `piece`.**
