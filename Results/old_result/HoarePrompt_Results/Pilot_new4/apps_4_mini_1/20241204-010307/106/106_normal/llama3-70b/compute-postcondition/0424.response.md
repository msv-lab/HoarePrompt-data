The code updates the values of `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x` and `y`, along with the constants `dx` and `dy`. 

Given the initial state:
- `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`
- `y` is 1
- `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`
- `nx` is the current value of `x - 1`
- `ny` is 1
- `dx` is -1
- `dy` is 0

After executing the code `nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy`, we have:
- `nx` is updated to `x - 1`
- `ny` is updated to `1 + 0`, which is `1`

Since `nx` is set to `x - 1`, we need to check if `nx` still fulfills the condition `0 <= nx < N`. The value of `nx` will remain in the range as long as `x` is greater than `0`, which follows from the condition `0 <= x < N`. 

Therefore, the output state's variables after executing the code will be:
- `nx` is now equal to `x - 1`
- `ny` remains equal to `1`

The other variables retain their original constraints and values.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is 1.**
