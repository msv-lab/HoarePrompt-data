The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are not explicitly defined in the initial state but are equal to `dx` and `dy`, respectively. The values of `A[nx][ny]` depend on the current values of `nx` and `ny`, whose specific values are unknown. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 0; `y` is 0; `nx` is equal to `dx`; `ny` is equal to `dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
