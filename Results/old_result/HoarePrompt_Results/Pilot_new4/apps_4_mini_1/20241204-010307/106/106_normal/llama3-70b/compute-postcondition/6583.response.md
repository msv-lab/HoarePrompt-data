The code assigns the value of `cur` to `parent[0][ncur]`, along with the value of `piece`. The previous values of `parent[0][ncur]` are updated. Other variables such as `N`, `x`, `y`, `index`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and `dist` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this statement.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `index` is 0, `nx` is equal to `1 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`.**
