Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 3 <= `N` <= 10, `piece` is 1, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, and `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.***
