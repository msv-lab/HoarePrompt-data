Postcondition: ***`piece` is 1, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` reflect the initial state. If `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `dist[1][cur]` has increased by 1, and `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
