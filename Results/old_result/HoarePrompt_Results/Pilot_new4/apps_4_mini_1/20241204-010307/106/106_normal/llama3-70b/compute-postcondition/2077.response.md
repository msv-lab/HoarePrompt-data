The line of code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to the index `ncur` of the second row of the `parent` list. The values of `cur` and `piece` are not specified in the initial state, but since `piece` is mentioned as unchanged at 2, we can state that `piece` will have the value of 2. The variable `parent` will now reflect that `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece` simultaneously, meaning it holds a tuple of these two values.

The other variables such as `N`, `dist`, `queue`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state after executing the code will include the updated state of the `parent` variable.

Output State: **`N` is at least 5; `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, with `dist[2][ncur] = dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, 2)`; `piece` remains unchanged at 2; `queue` contains all new entries generated during the iterations; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
