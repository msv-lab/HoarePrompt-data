The line of code assigns a tuple `(cur, piece)` to `parent[1][ncur]`. The values of `cur` and `piece` are now stored in the `parent` array at the indices `[1][ncur]`. However, the states of the other variables remain unchanged and valid. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `piece` is either 0 or 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to 3, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `piece` is either 0 or 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to 3, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`**.
