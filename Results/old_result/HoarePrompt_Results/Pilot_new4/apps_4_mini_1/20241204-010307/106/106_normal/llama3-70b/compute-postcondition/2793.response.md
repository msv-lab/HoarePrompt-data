According to the code, the loop iterates over the tuples representing the changes in x and y coordinates (dx, dy). In each iteration, the loop will update the values of `dx` and `dy` based on the tuples provided.

At the end of the last iteration, `dx` is 0 and `dy` is 1, which corresponds to the last tuple (0, 1) from the list [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]. This means the loop has executed for all the tuples. 

Since there are no more tuples left in the list after the current iteration, the loop cannot execute again. Therefore, there are no states to modify for another iteration because the loop has already completed its iterations.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is the current y-coordinate, `piece` is equal to 2, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1` (indicating the last state before exiting the loop)**
