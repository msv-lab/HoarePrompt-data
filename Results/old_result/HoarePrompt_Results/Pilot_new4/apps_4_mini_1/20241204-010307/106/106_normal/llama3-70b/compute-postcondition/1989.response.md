Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 4; `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices; `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices; `piece` is 1; `nx` is `x + dx`; `ny` is `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is now equal to 2, and the distance `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`.***
