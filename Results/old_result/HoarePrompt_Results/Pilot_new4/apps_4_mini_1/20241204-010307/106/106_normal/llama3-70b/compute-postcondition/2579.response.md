The code assigns `cur` and `piece` as values to `parent[1][ncur]`. The previous state indicates that `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is equal to `x + dx` and `ny` is equal to `y + dy`. The relevant variables remain unchanged except for `parent[1][ncur]`, which will now hold the tuple `(cur, piece)`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is an integer less than `N`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `piece` is 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur] = (cur, piece)`**.
