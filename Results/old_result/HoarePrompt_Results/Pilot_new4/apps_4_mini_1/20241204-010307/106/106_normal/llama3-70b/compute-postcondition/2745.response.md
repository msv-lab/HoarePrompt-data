Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is the current y-coordinate; `piece` is not equal to the value represented by `i`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is set to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the program state.***
