Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[0]` contains the distances from `cur` to other reachable nodes, `parent[0]` contains the parent nodes for the reachable distances, and `queue` contains tuples representing reachable nodes and their corresponding pieces. If the loop does not execute, `dist[0]` remains unchanged, `parent[0]` remains unchanged, and `queue` remains empty.**
