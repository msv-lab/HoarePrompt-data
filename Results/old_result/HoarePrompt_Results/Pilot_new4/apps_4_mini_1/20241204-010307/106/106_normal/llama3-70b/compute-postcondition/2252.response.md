The code assigns values to `parent[2][ncur]`, where previously `dist[2][ncur]` was greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`. The assignment indicates that `parent[2][ncur]` is now set to `cur` and `piece`. The other variables remain unchanged, but the state of `parent[2][ncur]` has been updated.

Output State: **`piece` is 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dist[1]` reflects the shortest path distances from `cur`, `parent[1]` reflects the corresponding parents for reachable indices, `queue` contains all updated elements based on valid moves, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is now equal to `cur` and `piece`.**
