The variable `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`, which depends on the values of `nx` and `ny`. The initial state indicates that `nx` is equal to `x + dx` and `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and both `nx` and `ny` satisfy the conditions of being within bounds of the array `A`. The other variables (`N`, `y`, `x`, `piece`) remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 1 and N-2; `x` is between 1 and N-2; `piece` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
