The assignment modifies the `dist` array at the indices `[1][ncur]` and assigns it a new value based on the current state of `dist[1][cur]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `ncur` is equal to `A[x + 1][1]`, this means that the value assigned will depend on `dist[1][cur]` and the specific values in the `dist` matrix.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `dx` is 1, `dy` is -1, `piece` is either 0 or 1, `nx` is equal to `x + 1`, `ny` is 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
