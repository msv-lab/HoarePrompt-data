Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` equals `N`, `ny` equals `N + dy`, `nx` equals `x + dx`, and `nx` and `ny` are between 0 and N (exclusive), and `piece` equals 0. If `nx` and `ny` are within the specified bounds, then if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, the values of `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged. If `nx` or `ny` is out of bounds, no changes are made to any variables.***
