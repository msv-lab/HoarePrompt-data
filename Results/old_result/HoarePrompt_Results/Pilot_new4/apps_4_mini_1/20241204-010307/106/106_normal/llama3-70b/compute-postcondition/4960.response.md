Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 1 and N-2; `x` is between 1 and N-2; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is equal to `y + 1`. If `nx` is within the range [0, N) and `ny` is within the range [0, N), then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
