Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is between 1 and 8 (inclusive), `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and `ny` is between 1 and 15 (inclusive). If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is set to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `queue` now contains `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables in the program.***
