According to the code, the loop will execute `N` times, starting with `x` initialized to 0 and incrementing by 1 until it reaches `N`. Given that `N` is guaranteed to be between 3 and 10, the loop is ensured to execute at least 3 times.

Before the loop starts, the relevant states are:
- `N` must be within the range of 3 to 10 (which it is).
- The variable `x` needs to be initialized to 0 at the beginning of the loop.

Since `cur`, `piece`, `dist`, and `parent` do not have any constraints related to the execution of the loop, they do not need to be modified based on the loop structure.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments to the state for the loop to execute are:
State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0**
