The assignment `nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy` calculates new values for `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. 

Given the initial values:
- `x` is 1
- `y` is 0
- `dx` is -1
- `dy` is 1

Calculating:
- `nx = x + dx = 1 + (-1) = 0`
- `ny = y + dy = 0 + 1 = 1`

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; `queue` contains all satisfying tuples `(ncur, 0)`; `piece` is 0; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 1; `nx` is 0; `ny` is 1**
