The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to the `parent` array at the indices `[2][ncur]`. The previous state mentions that `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][2]`, which means that `parent[2][ncur]` is updated with the values of `cur` and `piece`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `x` is defined and within bounds, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is 2, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][2]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`.**
