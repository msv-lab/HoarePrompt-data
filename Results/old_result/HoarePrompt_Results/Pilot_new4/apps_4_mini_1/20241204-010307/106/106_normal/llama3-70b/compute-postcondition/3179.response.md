The values of `nx` and `ny` are updated based on the calculations involving `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. Here, `nx` is assigned the value `x + dx` and `ny` is assigned the value `y + dy`. Given that `x` is `0`, `dx` is `-1`, `y` is `0`, and `dy` is `-2`, the calculations yield:

- `nx = 0 + (-1) = -1`
- `ny = 0 + (-2) = -2`

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -2, `nx` is -1, `ny` is -2.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -2, `nx` is -1, `ny` is -2**
