According to the code, the loop iterates over the list of tuples `[(−1,−1), (−1,1), (1,−1), (1,1)]`. This means it will execute a total of 4 iterations. At the end of the last iteration of the loop, the control will have moved past the last tuple in the list.

Since `dy` and `dx` are unpacked from the tuples in each iteration, after the last iteration (the fourth one), `dx` and `dy` will no longer be defined because there are no more tuples to unpack. For the loop to execute one more time, we would need to reset the loop to the beginning of the list of tuples.

Thus, to execute the loop again, we must define `dx` and `dy` such that they correspond to the first tuple in the list.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `x` is defined and within bounds, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1**
