The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The values of `piece`, `dist`, and `parent` remain unchanged. The only change is that `queue` now includes the new tuple. Therefore, the Output State is: `piece` is 0, `ncur` is A[nx][ny], `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is `cur`, `parent` reflects the initial state with the update, `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`.

Output State: **`piece` is 0, `ncur` is A[nx][ny], `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is `cur`, `parent` reflects the initial state with the update, `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`**
