Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `nx` is calculated as `x + dx`; `ny` is calculated as `y + dy`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` equals 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
