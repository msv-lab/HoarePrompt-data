Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is `2 + dy`, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` represents the predecessor positions in the path, `queue` contains all reachable positions `(ncur, 0)` where `piece` equals 0 and valid updates occurred, `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 1, the previous `dist[1][ncur]` was greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`, `queue` now includes the position `(ncur, 1)`.**
