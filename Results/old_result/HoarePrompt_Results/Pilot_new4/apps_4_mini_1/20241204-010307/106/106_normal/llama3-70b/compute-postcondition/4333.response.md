The code updates the value of `dist[1][ncur]`, where `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. The previous value of `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`. Hence, the output state reflects that `dist[1][ncur]` has changed, while the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is equal to `N`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `N + dy`; `dist` is updated for valid `ncur` positions; `parent` is updated for valid `ncur` positions; `queue` contains tuples of `(ncur, 0)` and `(ncur, 1)` for valid positions; `piece` is equal to 1; current direction being processed is `(-1, 1)`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
