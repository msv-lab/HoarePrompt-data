The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[1][ncur]`. The variable `parent` is a two-dimensional array, and the specific element `parent[1][ncur]` is updated with the values of `cur` and `piece`. The values of `cur` and `piece` remain unchanged, while `parent[1][ncur]` is now a combination of these two values. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `4 <= N <= 11`, `y` is equal to `N`, `A` is a valid two-dimensional array, `cur` is defined, `dist[0]` contains updated distances from the starting point, `parent[0]` contains the parent nodes for each valid move, `queue` contains all valid positions `(ncur, 0)`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 1, and `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`**.
