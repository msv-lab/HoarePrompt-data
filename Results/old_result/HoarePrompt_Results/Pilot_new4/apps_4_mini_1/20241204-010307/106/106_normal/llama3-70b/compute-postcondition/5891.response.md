The statement `parent[0][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to the location `parent[0][ncur]`. The previous values of `parent` are not specified, so they remain unchanged except for the specified assignment. The values of `N`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and `dist` are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is between 1 and 8 (inclusive), `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ny` is between 1 and 15 (inclusive), `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `piece`**
