The variable `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `(cur, piece)`. The values of `ncur`, `cur`, and `piece` are not defined in the initial state, but `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` and `ny` are between `0` and `N-1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is between 0 and `N-1`; `y` is between 0 and `N-1`; `nx` is not defined; `ny` is not defined; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`**.
