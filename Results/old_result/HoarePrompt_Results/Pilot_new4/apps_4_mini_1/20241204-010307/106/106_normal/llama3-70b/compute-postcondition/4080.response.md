The assignment `dist[1][ncur] = dist[1][cur] + 1` updates the value at index `[1][ncur]` of the array `dist`. The value being assigned is the value at index `[1][cur]` incremented by 1. However, we do not have specific values for `dist` or `cur`, so we cannot derive exact numerical values or states for them. The other variables remain unaffected by this line of code.

Therefore, the output state retains the unchanged variables and includes a note about the operation that was performed. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is -1, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[-1][0]`, and `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
