Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `x + dx` is within the bounds of `A`, `y + dy` is within the bounds of `A`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, and `dist[1][ncur]` contains the minimum distance from `cur` to each reachable position `ncur`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x + 1][y]`. If `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur`, and `(ncur, 2)` is appended to `queue`. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
