The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The `queue` variable is not mentioned in the initial state, but we can assume it is defined and holds a list. The values of `ncur` and `1` are now added as a new entry to this list.

The initial state remains mostly unchanged, but we now include `ncur` and denote that `queue` has been updated. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 1; `nx` is 1 + `dx`; `ny` is 1 + `dy`; `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur, piece`; `queue` now includes `(ncur, 1)`.**
