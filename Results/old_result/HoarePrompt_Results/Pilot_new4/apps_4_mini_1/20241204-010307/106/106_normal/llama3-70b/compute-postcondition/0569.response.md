Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, and `piece` is 1. If the condition `dist[1][ncur] > dist[1][cur] + 1` holds true, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` now includes `(ncur, 1)`. Additionally, `dist[0]` is updated for all reachable positions from `(x, y)`, and `parent[0]` stores the previous position and piece for each reachable position. If the condition is not met, no changes occur in the variables.***
