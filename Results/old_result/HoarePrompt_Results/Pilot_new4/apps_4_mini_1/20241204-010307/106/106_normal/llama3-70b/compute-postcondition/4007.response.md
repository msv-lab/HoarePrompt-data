The command `queue.append((ncur, 2))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the list `queue`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect that the `queue` has been updated to include the new tuple while preserving the existing values of the other variables.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to its previous value, `ny` is equal to its previous value, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` contains the updated minimum distances, `parent[1][ncur]` contains the respective parent information, `queue` contains reachable positions including the tuple `(ncur, 2)`, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, 2)`.**
