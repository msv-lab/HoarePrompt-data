The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[1][ncur]`. The values of `ncur`, `cur`, and `piece` are not defined in the initial state, but `ncur` is calculated as `A[x - 1][2]` where `x` is bounded by `0 <= x < N`. Therefore, `parent[1][ncur]` will now hold the values of `cur` and `piece`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 1; `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 1; `nx` is `x - 1`; `ny` is 2; `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the values of `cur` and `piece`.**
