The `queue` variable is updated by appending the tuple `(cur, i)` to it. The values of `cur` and `i` are not specified in the initial state, but they are assumed to be valid values used in the context of the program. The other variables remain unchanged since the code only modifies the `queue`. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, all valid `(nx, ny)` pairs have been checked, `ncur` holds the value of `A[nx][ny]` for each valid `(nx, ny)`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated for each valid `ncur` based on the condition `dist[2][ncur] > dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` contains the predecessor relationships for each valid `ncur`, `queue` now includes the tuple `(cur, i)` that has been appended.**
