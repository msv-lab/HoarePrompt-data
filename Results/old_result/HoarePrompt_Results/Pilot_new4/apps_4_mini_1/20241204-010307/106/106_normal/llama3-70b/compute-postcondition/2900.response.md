Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `dist` contains the shortest distances for all reachable positions, `parent` reflects the predecessors for each reachable position, `queue` contains tuples for all reachable positions processed during the iterations, `x` is equal to `N`, `nx` is equal to `N + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 0, and the current value of `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`.***
