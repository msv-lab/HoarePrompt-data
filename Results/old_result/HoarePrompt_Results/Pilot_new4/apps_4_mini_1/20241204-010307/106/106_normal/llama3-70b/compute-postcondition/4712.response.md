According to the code, the loop iterates over the list of tuples representing the directions (`dx, dy`). The loop will execute four times, once for each direction. Since the previous iteration has just finished, we need to determine the next direction from the list.

At the end of the last iteration, `dx` is 1 and `dy` is 0, which indicates that the last direction processed was moving down. The next direction in the list to process will be `(0, -1)` for the third iteration, which corresponds to moving left.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the states as follows: 

1. The next direction will be `(0, -1)`, which means `dx` will be 0 and `dy` will be -1.
2. The loop will execute four times in total, so after the current iteration, it will be on the third direction.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `ncur` is equal to `A[x + 1][2]`, `piece` is 2, `dist[1][ncur]` and `parent[1][ncur]` can still be updated, `queue` contains the newly appended tuple `(ncur, 2)`, `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is 2, `dx` is 0, `dy` is -1**
