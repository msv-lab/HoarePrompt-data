Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `dist` contains the minimum distances from `cur` to all reachable positions for each piece type, `parent` holds the predecessor tuples for all reachable positions corresponding to their respective piece states, and `queue` contains all tuples of `(ncur, piece)` processed during the loop execution, reflecting all valid moves made by the pieces. If the loop did not execute, `dist` and `parent` would remain unchanged from their initial state, and `queue` would remain one less valid tuple.**
