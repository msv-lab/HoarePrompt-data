Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to its previous value, `ny` is equal to its previous value, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` contains the updated minimum distances, `parent[1][ncur]` contains the respective parent information, `queue` contains reachable positions (which may be empty). Additionally, `piece` is equal to 2, and the current value of `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`.***
