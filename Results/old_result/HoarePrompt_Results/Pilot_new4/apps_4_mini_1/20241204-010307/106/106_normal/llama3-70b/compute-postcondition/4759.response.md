The code attempts to append a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to a queue. However, it is noted that an out-of-bounds access was attempted for `ncur`. This implies that `ncur` might not have been defined or is outside the acceptable range for the operation being performed. Other variables and the states remain unchanged as the operation does not affect them directly. Therefore, the Output State will reflect the unchanged states and the issue with `ncur`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is -2, `ny` is -1, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, and an out-of-bounds access was attempted for `ncur`.**
