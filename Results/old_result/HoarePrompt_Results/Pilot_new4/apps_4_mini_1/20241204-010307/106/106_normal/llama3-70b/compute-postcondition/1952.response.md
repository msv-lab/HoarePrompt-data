The variable `ncur` is defined as `A[nx][ny]`, and the code updates the `dist` array at index `[0][ncur]`. The value assigned to `dist[0][ncur]` is calculated as `dist[0][cur] + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Since we do not have the specific value of `cur`, we denote the new value of `dist[0][ncur]` as `dist[0][cur] + 1`. 

Output State: **`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `piece` remains unchanged at 0, `y` is 4, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
