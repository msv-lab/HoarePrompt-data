The line of code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[1][ncur]`. This does not change the values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, or the `dist` array. However, it updates `parent[1][ncur]` to hold the values of `cur` and `piece`. 

Since `ncur` was previously determined to be equal to `A[nx][ny]`, the specific value of `parent[1][ncur]` will now refer to the current value of `cur` associated with `piece`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `4 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`.**
