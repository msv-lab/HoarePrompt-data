Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dist[2][ncur]` contains the updated minimum distances from the starting point to reachable points, `parent[2][ncur]` contains the respective parent information for each reachable point, and if `piece` is not equal to `i`, `queue` now contains the previously existing tuples plus the new tuple `(cur, i)`.***
