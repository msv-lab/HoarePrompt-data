Postcondition: ***`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is 4; `y` is 0; if `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, then `dist[2][ncur]` contains updated distances based on valid moves, `parent[2][ncur]` contains path information, and if `piece` is not equal to `i`, then `queue` contains the tuple `(cur, i)` along with previous applicable tuples of `(ncur, 2)` for valid moves where `piece` is 2. If no valid moves were available, `dist[2][ncur]`, `parent[2][ncur]`, and `queue` remain unchanged.***
