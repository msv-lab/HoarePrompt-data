The statement assigns values to `parent[0][ncur]`. The variable `cur` is used as an index or identifier for the current state. The previous values of `ncur` and `cur` are not changed by this operation, but `parent[0][ncur]` is updated to hold the value of `cur` along with the value of `piece`.

The output state updates `parent[0][ncur]` to be equal to `cur` and `piece`. The variables `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and `dist` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 0 and `N-1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur and piece`.**
