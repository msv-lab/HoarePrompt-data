The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to a list called `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `piece` are not changed by this operation, and none of the other variables in the initial state are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state remains the same for `N`, `x`, `y`, `piece`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `cur`, and `dist`. The new information is that `queue` now contains a new element.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `piece` is 2, `dx` is 0, `dy` is -1, `nx` is 1, `ny` is -1, `ncur` is equal to `A[1][-1]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` now contains `(ncur, 2)`**.
