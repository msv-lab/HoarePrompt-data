Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 0 and `N-1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, if `piece` is equal to 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`***
