The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. Given that `nx` is -1 and `ny` is 3, it implies an attempt to access the 0th index of the row at index 3 of the 2D list `A`. However, without further context on the dimensions and values of `A`, we cannot determine a specific value for `ncur`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `nx` is -1, `ny` is 3, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, and `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[-1][3]`.**
