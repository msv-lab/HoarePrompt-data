The code assigns new values to `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. The previous values are `dx` is `1`, `dy` is `-1`, `y` is `-1`, and `x` is an integer that is defined but not explicitly given (within the range `3 <= N <= 10`). 

Calculating the new values:
- `nx` is assigned the value `x + dx`, which becomes `x + 1`.
- `ny` is assigned the value `y + dy`, which becomes `-1 + (-1) = -2`.

The states of the other variables are not affected, so we maintain their values. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is -1, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is 1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is -2.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is -1, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is 1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is -2.**
