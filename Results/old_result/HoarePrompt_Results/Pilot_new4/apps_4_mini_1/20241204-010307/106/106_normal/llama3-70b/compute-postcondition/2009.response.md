Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `parent[2][ncur]` is updated to `cur`, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is `y`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y]`, and `dist[2][ncur]` is set to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, with the tuple `(ncur, 2)` appended to `queue`. Otherwise, the program continues without making changes to these variables.***
