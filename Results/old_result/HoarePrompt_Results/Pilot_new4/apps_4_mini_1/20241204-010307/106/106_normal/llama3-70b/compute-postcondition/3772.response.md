Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `nx` is updated based on the selected tuple, `ny` is updated based on the selected tuple, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. The value of `piece` is 0, and the distance `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`.***
