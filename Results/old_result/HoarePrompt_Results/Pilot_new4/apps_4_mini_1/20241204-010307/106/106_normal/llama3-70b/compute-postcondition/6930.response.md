The variable `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur`, and the second value assigned is `piece`. The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged, as this assignment only modifies the `parent` array at the specified index.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`.**
