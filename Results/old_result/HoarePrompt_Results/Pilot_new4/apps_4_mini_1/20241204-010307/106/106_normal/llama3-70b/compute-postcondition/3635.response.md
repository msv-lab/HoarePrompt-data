The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `1` are added to the queue, and the state of the other variables is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 0 and `N-1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is updated to `cur`, and `piece`, and the `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 0 and `N-1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is updated to `cur`, `piece`, and `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`**.
