Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is `N-1`. If `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, then `dist` contains the updated minimum distances from the starting point to all reachable points based on the rules defined for the pieces, `parent` contains the respective parent information for each reachable point, and `queue` contains the tuples representing the reachable points and their associated pieces. If no updates were made, `dist` and `parent` remain unchanged from their original state.**
