Output State: **`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects that `parent[2][ncur]` is now equal to `cur`, `piece` is equal to 2, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `queue` now contains all valid tuples of `(ncur, 1)` and also includes `(ncur, 2)`.**
