According to the code, the loop will iterate over the list of direction tuples `[(dx, dy)]`. The loop can execute four times, one for each direction. At the end of the last iteration, `dx` and `dy` represent the last direction that was processed.

Given that the loop starts from index 0 and goes to index 3, if `dx` and `dy` are currently the last values from the list, for the loop to execute one more time, the indices must be reset or incremented. At the end of the last iteration, it is assumed that `dx` and `dy` were the last values, which means the last executed direction was `(1, 1)` corresponding to the index 3. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the next values of `dx` and `dy` will need to be the first values in the list, which are `(-1, -1)`, and the index for the loop would need to be reset to 0.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `piece` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1**
