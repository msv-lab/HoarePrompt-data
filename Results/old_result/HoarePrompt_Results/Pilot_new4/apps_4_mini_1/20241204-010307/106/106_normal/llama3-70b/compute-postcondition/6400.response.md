The code attempts to assign the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[0][ncur]`. However, `ncur` is undefined due to invalid index access, which means the assignment cannot occur. As a result, the values of the variables are unaffected by the code execution. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dist[0]` remains unchanged, `parent[0]` remains unchanged, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is -2, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is undefined, `piece` is 0, and `dist[0][ncur]` remains greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1.**
