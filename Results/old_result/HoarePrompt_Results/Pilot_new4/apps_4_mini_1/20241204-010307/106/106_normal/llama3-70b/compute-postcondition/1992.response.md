The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. Since `queue` is assumed to be a list or similar data structure, it will now contain one additional element. The values of other variables remain unchanged, and the information about them is still valid after execution.

Output State: **`N` is at least 4; `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices; `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices, `piece` is 2; `nx` is `x + dx`; `ny` is `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `parent[2][ncur]` is now `cur, piece`; `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)` added.**
