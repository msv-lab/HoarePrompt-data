The line of code `queue.append((ncur, 0))` will add a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The value of `ncur` is already established as `A[nx][ny]` and is within the bounds defined by the initial state. Other variables are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the states of the other variables remain the same, and we only update the state of the `queue` to include the new tuple.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `x + dx` is within the bounds of `A`, `y + dy` is within the bounds of `A`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `nx` is within the range of 0 to N, `ny` is within the range of 0 to N, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `piece`, and `queue` now includes `(ncur, 0)`.**
