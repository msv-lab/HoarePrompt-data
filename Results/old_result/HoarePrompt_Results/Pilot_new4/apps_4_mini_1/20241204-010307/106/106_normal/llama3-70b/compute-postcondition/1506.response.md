The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[0][ncur]`. The previous value of `parent[0][ncur]` is not stated, but it is updated to `cur` and `piece`. The other variables remain unaffected in this execution. Thus, the output state will reflect the change made to `parent[0][ncur]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `A[x][y]` is defined, `cur` has a valid value, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `dist[2]`, `parent[2]`, `queue` are in a valid state, `dx` and `dy` can be reset to iterate over the tuples again, `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `parent[0][ncur]` is updated to `cur` and `piece`.**
