Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `dist[2]` contains updated distance values for all valid positions reachable with piece 2, `parent[2]` stores the last positions and pieces for those valid positions, and `queue` may contain multiple tuples of valid positions added during the iterations, depending on the conditions met during execution. If no valid moves were found, `dist[2]` and `parent[2]` remain unchanged from their initial states.**
