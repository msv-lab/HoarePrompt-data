Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `piece` is 0, `dist` may be updated based on reachable positions, `parent` may be updated accordingly, `queue` contains tuples of reachable positions, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy. The current values of `nx` and `ny` are such that they satisfy the condition `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`.***
