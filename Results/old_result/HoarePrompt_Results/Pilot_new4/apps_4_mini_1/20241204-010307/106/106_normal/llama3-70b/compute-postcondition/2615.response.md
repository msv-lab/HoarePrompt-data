Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is an integer less than `N - 1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, `piece` is assigned the value of `cur`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)` added to it.**
