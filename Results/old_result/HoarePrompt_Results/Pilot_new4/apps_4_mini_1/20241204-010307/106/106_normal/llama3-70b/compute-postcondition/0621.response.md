`nx` is assigned the value of `x + dx`, which becomes `x - 2`, and `ny` is assigned the value of `y + dy`, which becomes `1 - 1 = 0`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Given that `x` is constrained to `0 <= x < N` and `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, it follows that `x` must be at least 0 and at most 9 (if `N` is 10). Therefore, `nx` can take values ranging from `-2` (if `x` is 0) to `7` (if `x` is 9). 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is `x - 2`, `ny` is 0**
