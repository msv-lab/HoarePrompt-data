Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `piece` is 1, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x + 1`, `ny` is 2, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. If the condition `piece == 1 and dist[1][ncur] > dist[1][cur] + 1` holds true, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, and `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. If the condition does not hold, no changes occur.***
