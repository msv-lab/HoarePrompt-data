Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `dist[2][ncur]` contains the minimum distances from `cur` to each reachable cell based on the given conditions; `parent[2][ncur]` contains the previous cell and piece for each reachable cell; `queue` contains tuples of all reachable cells along with their corresponding piece value; if no cells were reachable, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged.**
