Postcondition: ***`N`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, and `ny` are unchanged integers where `3 <= N <= 10`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][-1]`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, and `queue` is updated to include the tuple `(ncur, 0)`.***
