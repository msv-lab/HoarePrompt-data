According to the code, the loop iterates over a list of directional changes represented by the tuples `(-1, 0)`, `(1, 0)`, `(0, -1)`, and `(0, 1)`. Each iteration will take one of these tuples, assigned to `dx` and `dy`. 

The number of iterations depends on the length of the list `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`, which contains 4 elements. At the end of the last iteration, no specific state changes were made that affect the loop structure, but we have used one tuple already.

Since `dx` and `dy` are iterated through a fixed list of 4 tuples, if the loop has executed once, the next values of `dx` and `dy` will correspond to the next tuple in the list. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, we need to move to the next tuple at index 1 or 2 or 3.

At the end of the last iteration, we can assume that the loop has been through the first tuple already. 

So, if the loop has gone through the first tuple `(-1, 0)`, then for the loop to execute one more time, it will take the second tuple `(1, 0)` next.

State: **`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is 4; `y` is 2; `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0; if `nx` is 3, 4, or 5 and `ny` is 1, 2, or 3, then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`; otherwise, there are no changes to the states of `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.**
