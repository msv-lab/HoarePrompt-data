Postcondition: ***`N` is greater than or equal to 9; `y` is 9; `dx` is -1; `dy` is -2; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is 7; `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][7]; if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`; otherwise, no changes are made.***
