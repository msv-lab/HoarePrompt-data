The code updates the value of `dist[2][ncur]` to be equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`. The state of other variables remains unchanged. Since `dist[2][ncur]` is updated based on the condition that it is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, the new value of `dist[2][ncur]` becomes equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and the values of `nx` and `ny` satisfy 0 ≤ `nx` < `N` and 0 ≤ `ny` < `N`.**
