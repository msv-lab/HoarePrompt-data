Given the initial state where `N` is between 3 and 10, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, and `nx` and `ny` must remain within the bounds of the grid, we analyze the code snippet provided.

The code `nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy` updates the values of `nx` and `ny`. The value of `nx` is calculated as `x + dx`, which means `nx` is decreased by 1 from `x`, and `ny` is calculated as `y + dy`, which means `ny` remains unchanged since `dy` is 0. 

Since we don't have the specific values for `x` and `y`, we will express the changes based on the calculations:

- `nx` now becomes `x - 1`.
- `ny` remains `y`.

The other variables (`N`, `dx`, `dy`) are unaffected by this operation.

So, the output state reflecting the updated values is:

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 0; `nx` is `x - 1`; `ny` is `y`.**
