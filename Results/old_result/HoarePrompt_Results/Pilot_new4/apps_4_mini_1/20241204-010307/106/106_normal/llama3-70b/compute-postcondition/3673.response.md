Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is between 0 and `N-1`; `y` is between 0 and `N-1`; `dist[2]` contains the shortest distances from the position represented by `cur` to all valid `ncur` positions for piece 2; `parent[2]` contains the parent positions and pieces for all valid `ncur`; `queue` contains tuples of all valid `ncur` positions and the piece number 2 that have been updated. If no valid moves were found, then `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initial states.**
