Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; `index` is 1; `nx` is `1 + dx`; `ny` is `0 + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `cur` and `piece`, and the tuple `(ncur, 0)` is appended to `queue`. Otherwise, there is no change to the state of these variables.***
