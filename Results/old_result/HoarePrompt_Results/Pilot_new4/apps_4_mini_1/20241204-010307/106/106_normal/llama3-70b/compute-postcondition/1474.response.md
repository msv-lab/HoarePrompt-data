The code assigns the value of `cur` (not previously defined in the state) and `piece` to `parent[2][ncur]`. The output does not change any other variables, but it sets the parent for the `ncur` index in the `parent` array at index `[2][ncur]`.

Thus, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 2; `y` is 1; `nx` is 2; `ny` is 2; `ncur` is equal to `A[2][2]; dist[2][ncur] is updated to dist[2][cur] + 1; `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 2; `y` is 1; `nx` is 2; `ny` is 2; `ncur` is equal to `A[2][2]; dist[2][ncur] is updated to dist[2][cur] + 1; `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, piece.**
