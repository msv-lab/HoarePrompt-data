Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `piece` is 1 if the loop executed, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur` values according to the conditions met during the loop, `parent[1][ncur]` contains the corresponding `cur` values for each updated `ncur`, and `queue` contains all tuples `(ncur, 1)` that were appended during the loop execution. If the loop did not execute, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initial states.**
