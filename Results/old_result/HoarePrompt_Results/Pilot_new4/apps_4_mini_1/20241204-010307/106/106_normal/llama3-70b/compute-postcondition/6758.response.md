Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `nx` is `1 + dx`, and `ny` is `2 + dy`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then if `piece` is equal to 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `cur`, `piece` is associated with `parent[0][ncur]`, and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, the values of `dist`, `parent`, `piece`, and `queue` remain unchanged. If the conditions for `nx` and `ny` are not satisfied, no changes are made to any of the variables.***
