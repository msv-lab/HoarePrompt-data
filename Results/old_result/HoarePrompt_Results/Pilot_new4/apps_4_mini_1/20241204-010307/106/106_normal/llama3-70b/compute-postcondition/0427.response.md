The statement `parent[2][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns a value to the element at the specific index `parent[2][ncur]`. The variable `cur` is unspecified, but it is used to update the `parent` structure. The values of `N`, `y`, `x`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `dist`, and any other variables remain unchanged with the exception of `parent[2][ncur]`, which now holds the value of `cur` and `piece`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is 1, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur` and `piece`.**
