The code updates the `dist` array at position `[2][ncur]` by assigning it the value of `dist[2][cur] + 1`. The previous values of `dist[2][ncur]`, `dist[2][cur]`, and `ncur` are affected. However, we do not have information about `cur` and the values in the `dist` array. We only know that `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.

Thus, after executing the code, the key updates are to `dist[2][ncur]`, which becomes equal to the value of `dist[2][cur] + 1`. The states of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `piece` is 2, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
