Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, the `queue` has the new element `(ncur, 0)` appended to it, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is -1, `ny` is 1, `ncur` remains `A[-1][-1]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is set to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`. Otherwise, there are no changes made to `queue`, `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `dist`, or `parent`.***
