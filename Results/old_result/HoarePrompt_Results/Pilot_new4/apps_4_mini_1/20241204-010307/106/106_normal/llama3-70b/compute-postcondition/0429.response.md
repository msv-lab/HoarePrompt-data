Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is 1, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur`, and `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
