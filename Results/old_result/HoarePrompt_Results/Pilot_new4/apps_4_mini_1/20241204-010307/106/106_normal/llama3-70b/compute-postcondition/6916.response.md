According to the code, the loop iterates over a list of tuples, each representing a pair of values (dx, dy). The loop will execute regardless of the values of `N` and `y`, as these variables do not affect the execution of the loop itself.

However, the values of `dx` and `dy` will be assigned in each iteration from the provided list of tuples. Since there is no indexing or conditional control affecting the loop's execution, all that is required is for the loop to iterate over the given tuples.

Thus, for the loop to execute, there are no specific adjustments needed for the variables `N` and `y`. The states of `dx` and `dy` will be set according to the tuples in the list upon each iteration.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `dx` and `dy` will be assigned from the list of tuples in each iteration**
