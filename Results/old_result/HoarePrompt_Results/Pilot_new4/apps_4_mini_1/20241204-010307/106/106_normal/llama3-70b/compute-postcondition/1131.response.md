According to the code, the for loop iterates over the four possible directions represented by the pairs (dx, dy). The loop will execute one more time for each pair in the list. 

At the end of the last iteration, the values of dx and dy will correspond to the last pair processed in the loop. Since the pairs are processed in the order they are listed, if `dx` is currently 1 and `dy` is 0 (the second pair), then the next pair in the iteration will be (0, -1).

Therefore, to prepare for this next execution of the loop, `dx` will be updated to 0 and `dy` will be updated to -1. The states related to `N`, `x`, `y`, `piece`, `nx`, and `ny` remain the same since they are not directly affected by the for loop's iterations. 

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `piece` is 2, `dx` is 0, `dy` is -1, `nx` is 2, and `ny` is 0**
