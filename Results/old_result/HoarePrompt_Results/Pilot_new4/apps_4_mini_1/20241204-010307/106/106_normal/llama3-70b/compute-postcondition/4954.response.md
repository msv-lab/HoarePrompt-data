The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned new values based on the expressions `x + dx` and `y + dy`. 

1. The variable `dx` is -1, so the new value for `nx` will be `x - 1`.
2. The variable `dy` is 1, so the new value for `ny` will be `y + 1`.

Since `x` is between 1 and `N-2`, and `y` is between 1 and `N-2` (with `N` being between 3 and 10), the values of `nx` and `ny` will be:
- `nx = x - 1`, which will still be between 0 and `N-3` (because `x` can be at least 1).
- `ny = y + 1`, which will still be between 2 and `N-1` (because `y` can be at most `N-2`).

Therefore, the updated values of the variables are:
- `nx` is equal to `x - 1`
- `ny` is equal to `y + 1`

No other variables are affected in the precondition. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 1 and `N-2`; `x` is between 1 and `N-2`; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is equal to `y + 1`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 1 and N-2; `x` is between 1 and N-2; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is equal to `y + 1**
