The statement `nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy` assigns the values to `nx` and `ny`. Since `dx` and `dy` are not applicable, their values are assumed to be 0 (as they do not impact the calculation). Therefore:

- `nx` becomes `x + 0`, which is `0 + 0 = 0`
- `ny` becomes `y + 0`, which is `0 + 0 = 0`

The other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is 0, `ny` is 0, `dx` is not applicable, `dy` is not applicable.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is 0, `ny` is 0, `dx` is not applicable, `dy` is not applicable**
