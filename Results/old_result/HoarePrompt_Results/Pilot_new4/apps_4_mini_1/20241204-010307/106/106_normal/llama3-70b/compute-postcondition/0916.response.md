The code updates the value of `dist[1][ncur]` to be equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`. The initial state indicates that `dist[1][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`. After the execution, `dist[1][ncur]` will now be equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and the precondition that it was greater than this value will no longer hold.

The other variables remain unchanged, including `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and `piece`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `0 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 1, and `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
