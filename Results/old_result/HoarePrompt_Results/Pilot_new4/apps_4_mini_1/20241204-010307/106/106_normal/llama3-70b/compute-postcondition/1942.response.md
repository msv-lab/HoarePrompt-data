Given the initial state, we have:

- `N` is at least 4
- `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices
- `piece` remains unchanged at 0
- `y` is 4
- `nx` is equal to `x + (-2)`
- `ny` is equal to `4 + 1`, which means `ny` is 5
- `ncur` is the next computed index
- `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`

The code snippet:

```
nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
```

In this case, `nx` will be updated with the value of `x + dx`, and `ny` will be updated with the value of `y + dy`. The initial value of `y` is 4, so `ny` will be modified based on the value of `dy`. The variable `nx` will also change based on the value of `dx`.

Since the exact values of `dx` and `x` are not provided, we will represent `nx` in terms of these variables. However, we know that `ny` will definitely change based on the value of `dy` added to `4`.

The output state will reflect the changes made to `nx` and `ny` while keeping all other variable information intact. 

Output State: **`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `piece` remains unchanged at 0, `y` is 4, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `5`, `ncur` is the next computed index, `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`**.
