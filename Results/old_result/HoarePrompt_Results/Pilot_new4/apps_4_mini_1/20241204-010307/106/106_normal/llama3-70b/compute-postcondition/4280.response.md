To determine the output state after executing the code snippet provided, we need to analyze the impact of the code on the variables involved.

1. The initial values are:
   - `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`
   - `x` is `1`
   - `y` is `N - 1`
   - `nx` is `0`
   - `ny` is `N - 1`
   - `ncur` is `A[0][N - 1]`

2. The code snippet `nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy` implies that `nx` and `ny` are being assigned new values based on `x`, `y`, and the values of `dx` and `dy`. However, the variables `dx` and `dy` are not defined in the initial state, meaning we cannot ascertain their values. Therefore, `nx` and `ny` will be updated based on whatever values `dx` and `dy` might have.

3. The values of `nx` and `ny` are updated as follows:
   - `nx` becomes `1 + dx`
   - `ny` becomes `(N - 1) + dy`

4. The other variables retain their original values, since the code only modifies `nx` and `ny`.

Based on this analysis, the output state will include updated values for `nx` and `ny`, while maintaining the conditions of the other variables.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 1, `y` is `N - 1`, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `(N - 1) + dy`, `ncur` is `A[0][N - 1]`**
