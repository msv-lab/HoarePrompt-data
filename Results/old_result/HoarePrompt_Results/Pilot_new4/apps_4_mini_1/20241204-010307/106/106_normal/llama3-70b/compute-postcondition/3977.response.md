Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dist[0]` contains the minimum distances, `parent[0]` contains parent information, `queue` is empty, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]` where `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`. The variable `piece` is equal to 1, and the current value of `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`.***
