The value of `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`. The initial condition states that if `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then this assignment takes place.  Therefore, `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to the previous value of `dist[1][cur] + 1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is at least 4; `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `dist[1][cur]` remains unchanged; `piece` is equal to 1; `dist` is valid for reachable indices; if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
