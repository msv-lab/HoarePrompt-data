The variable `ncur` is assigned the value from the array `A` at the coordinates `(nx, ny)`. Given the preconditions, `nx` and `ny` are valid and lie within the bounds of the array `A`, which means `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`. Therefore, `ncur` will take the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 0 and `N-1`, `nx = x + dx`, `ny = y + dy`, at least one of the resulting coordinates `(nx, ny)` must be valid, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
