Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is an integer; if `piece` is not equal to `i`, then `dist` contains the updated shortest distances for valid indices, `parent` contains the updated parent indices for valid nodes, and `queue` contains tuples of valid states for indices where the conditions were met, along with the newly added tuple `(cur, i)`. If `piece` is equal to `i`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initial states.***
