Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 5, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, and `parent` reflects that `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, 2)`. The variable `piece` remains unchanged at 2, while `queue` includes all new entries generated during the iterations, including the new entry `(ncur, 1)`. The values of `dx` and `dy` are taken from the tuples [(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)], with `nx` as `x + dx` and `ny` as `y + dy` for each respective `dx` and `dy`. The current value of `piece` is 1, and now `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1` when the condition of the if statement is satisfied.***
