The code appends a tuple containing the value of `ncur` and `1` to the `queue`. The variables `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `dist`, and `parent` remain unaffected by this operation. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `nx` is `0 + dx`; `ny` is `1 + dy`; `ncur` is `A[0 + dx][1 + dy]; `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is `cur, piece`; `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`.**
