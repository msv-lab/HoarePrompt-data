Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is -2, `ny` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, and `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur`, and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, no changes occur. If the conditions for the if statement are not met, no operations are executed.***
