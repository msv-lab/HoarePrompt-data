The statement `parent[2][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns a tuple `(cur, piece)` to the index `[2][ncur]` in the `parent` array. The other variables (`N`, `x`, `y`, `piece`, `dist`, `queue`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`) remain unchanged from their initial states. 

Since we do not have specific values for `cur` and `piece`, the output state will reflect that `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned a tuple containing those variables.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `piece` is 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `queue` now contains both `(ncur, 1)` and `(ncur, 2)`, `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is now one more than `dist[2][cur]`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the tuple `(cur, piece)`**.
