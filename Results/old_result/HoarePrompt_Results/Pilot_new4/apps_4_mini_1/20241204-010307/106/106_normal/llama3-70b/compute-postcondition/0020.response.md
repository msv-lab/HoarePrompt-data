Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, `i` is 0, `x` is 0, `cur` is 1, `piece` is 0, `dist[0][1]` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` (which is 1), `piece` remains 0, and `queue` contains the tuple (1, 0) if the condition `piece == 0 and dist[0][ncur] > dist[0][cur] + 1` is satisfied; otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.***
