The variable `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`. The initial values of `ncur`, `cur`, and `piece` are still applicable, and the values of the other relevant variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is between 0 and N-1, `y` is between 1 and N-1, `dx` is the first element of the tuple, `dy` is the second element of the tuple, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.**
