Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `dist[1]` contains updated distances for valid positions reachable from (1, 1), `parent[1]` contains predecessors for valid positions reachable from (1, 1). If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, if `piece` is equal to 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur]` plus 1, then `parent[0][ncur]` is updated to `(cur, 0)` and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
