The values of `nx` and `ny` are assigned based on the current values of `x`, `y`, and the arrays `dx` and `dy`, which are set for 8 iterations. Given that `x` is currently 1 and `y` is 0, `nx` and `ny` will depend on the specific values in the `dx` and `dy` arrays for the 8 iterations. Therefore, `nx` will take on the values `1 + dx[i]` for each `i`, and `ny` will take on the values `0 + dy[i]`. 

As the arrays `dx` and `dy` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact values for `nx` and `ny`, but we can state that they will be updated based on the values of `dx` and `dy`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `dist` arrays are initialized, `parent` arrays are initialized, `queue` contains valid moves processed during the loop, current value of `A[1][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` and `dy` set for 8 iterations; `nx` is `1 + dx[i]`, `ny` is `0 + dy[i]` for each iteration `i`.**
