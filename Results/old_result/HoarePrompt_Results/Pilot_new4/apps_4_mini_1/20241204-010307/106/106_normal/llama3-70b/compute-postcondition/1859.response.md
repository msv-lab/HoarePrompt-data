The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[0][ncur]`. Since `cur` is equal to `A[x][y]`, this means that `parent[0][ncur]` is updated to be the value of `A[x][y]` along with the value of `piece`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State will reflect the updated value of `parent[0][ncur]`.

Output State: **`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable cells from `cur`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`, `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`, `piece` has the final value determined by the loop conditions, `y` is 0, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
