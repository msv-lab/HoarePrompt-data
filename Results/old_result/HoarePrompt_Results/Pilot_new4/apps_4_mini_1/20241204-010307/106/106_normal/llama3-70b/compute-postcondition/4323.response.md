The value of `ncur` is assigned the value from the 2D array `A` at the position `(nx, ny)`. The variables `nx` and `ny` are defined as `nx = x + dx` and `ny = N + dy`, and both are within the bounds `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`. The values of `N`, `y`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by the assignment to `ncur`. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is equal to `N`, `dist` is updated for valid `ncur` positions, `parent` is updated for valid `ncur` positions, `queue` contains tuples of `(ncur, 0)` for valid positions; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `N + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`.**
