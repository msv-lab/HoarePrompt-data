Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is -1 or 1, `ny` is 0 or 2, `dist[0]` reflects the shortest distances calculated, `parent[0]` reflects the parents of the nodes, `queue` may contain valid `(ncur, 0)` tuples, `dx` and `dy` take on values from [(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)], and `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]` where `nx` is in the range [0, N) and `ny` is in the range [0, N).**
