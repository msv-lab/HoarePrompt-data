The code appends the tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `2` are the only ones directly affected by this operation, while other variables remain unchanged. The initial state provides context for what `ncur` represents, but it does not change during the execution.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 3 and 10, `x` is greater than 1 and less than `N - 1`, `y` has been updated to `y + dy`, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`.**
