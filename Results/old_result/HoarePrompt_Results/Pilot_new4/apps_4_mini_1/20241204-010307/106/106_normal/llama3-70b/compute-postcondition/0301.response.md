The values of `nx` and `ny` are assigned based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. Thus, `nx` will be equal to `x + dx` and `ny` will be equal to `y + dy`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `cur` is a valid index, `ncur` is a valid index after applying (dx, dy), `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` are initialized and ready for updates, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`.
