The code assigns `cur` and `piece` as the values for `parent[2][ncur]`. Given the initial state, `dist[2][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and now it will include the information of the last piece and position before reaching `ncur` via `parent[2][ncur]`.

Thus, the updated output state reflects that `parent[2][ncur]` is now equal to `(cur, piece)`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dist[1][ncur]` contains the minimum distances from the starting position to all reachable positions, `parent[1][ncur]` reflects the last piece and position before reaching `ncur`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the range [0, N), `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is now equal to `(cur, piece)`**.
