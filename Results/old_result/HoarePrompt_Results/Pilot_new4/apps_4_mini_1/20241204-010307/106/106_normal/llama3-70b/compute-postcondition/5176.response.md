After running the provided code, the impact on the program is as follows:

1. The variable `queue` is being modified by appending a new tuple `(ncur, 0)` to it. This means that `ncur`, which is defined as `A[nx][ny]`, will be added to the `queue` along with a value `0`.

2. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `piece`, `dist[0][ncur]`, and `parent[0][ncur]` remain unchanged by this line of code.

Thus, the output state retains all previous conditions and just specifies the new change in `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is between 0 and N-1, `y` is between 1 and N-1, `dx` is the first element of the tuple, `dy` is the second element of the tuple, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`**.
