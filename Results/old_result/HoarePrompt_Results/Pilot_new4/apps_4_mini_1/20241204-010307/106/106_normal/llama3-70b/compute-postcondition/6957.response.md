The line of code assigns a tuple `(cur, piece)` to `parent[1][ncur]`, effectively setting `parent[1][ncur]` to be equal to the current variable `cur` and the value of `piece`. The values of `cur` and `piece` remain unchanged, and the values of `N`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, and `dist` are also unaffected by this assignment.

The output state reflects that `parent[1][ncur]` is now a pair composed of the current value of `cur` and the fixed value `1` of `piece`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 1; `nx` is `x - 1`; `ny` is 2; `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][2]`; `cur` is defined; `piece` is 1; `parent[1][ncur]` is (cur, 1)**.
