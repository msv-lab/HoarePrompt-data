The value of `ncur` is assigned the value from the 2D array `A` at the indices `[nx][ny]`. Given that `nx` is calculated as `1 + dx` and `ny` is equal to `dy`, and the constraints on `nx` and `ny` ensure that they are valid indices within the bounds of the array dimensions, the value of `ncur` is now set to `A[1 + dx][dy]`. 

The other variables maintain their initial states, as no changes have been made to them through this operation.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `A` is a 2D array, `A[1][0]` equals `cur`, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[1 + dx][dy]`, and the current values satisfy `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`.**
