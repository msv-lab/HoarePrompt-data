The line of code `parent[1][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the value `cur` to `parent[1][ncur]`, with `piece` being an additional value that is also assigned in the same statement. The existing values of `N`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and `dist` are not altered by this assignment, but `parent[1][ncur]` is now set to `cur`.

Since `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, its value is determined based on the indices `nx` and `ny`, which are equal to `x + 1` and `y + 1` respectively.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `dx` is 1; `dy` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x + 1`; `ny` is equal to `y + 1`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` has been updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, and `piece` is set to a value**.
