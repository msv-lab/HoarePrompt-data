According to the code, the loop iterates over the list of tuples `[(dx, dy)]`, which contains 4 elements. The loop will execute once for each tuple in this list. 

At the end of the previous iteration, we know that `N` is between 3 and 10, and that the variables `x` and `y` are between 0 and `N-1`. Given this, the loop has already executed for one of the tuples in the list, and will execute for the next tuple in the next iteration.

Since the loop will execute for each of the 4 direction tuples `(-1, -1)`, `(-1, 1)`, `(1, -1)`, and `(1, 1)`, we need to determine what the next tuple will be.

If the loop has executed once, it has processed the first tuple. Therefore, for the next iteration, it will process the second tuple in the list:

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 0 and `N-1`, `dx` is -1 and `dy` is 1**
