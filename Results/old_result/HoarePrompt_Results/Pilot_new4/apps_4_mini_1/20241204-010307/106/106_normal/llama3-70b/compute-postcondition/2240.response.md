In this code snippet, `dist[1][ncur]` is being updated based on the value of `dist[1][cur]`. The variables affected by this operation are `dist`, `ncur`, and `cur`. The state of `ncur` is defined as `A[x - 1][y - 1]`, and we don't have a specific value for `cur`, but we know that `dist[1][ncur]` will be set to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.

Given that the initial state indicates `piece` is 0, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is `y - 1`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y - 1]`, we can summarize that the existing variables retain their values except for the specified update to `dist[1][ncur]`.

Since `dist[1][ncur]` takes the value of `dist[1][cur] + 1`, it indicates a specific adjustment in the distance array where the distance at index `[1][ncur]` is increased by one compared to its previous value.

Overall, the output state reflects that there is an updated value in `dist` and retains the initial values of the other variables.

Output State: **`piece` is 0, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is `y - 1`, `ncur` is `A[x - 1][y - 1]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
