Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is an integer less than `N`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and if `piece` equals 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to the tuple (cur, piece), and the tuple (ncur, 1) is appended to `queue`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
