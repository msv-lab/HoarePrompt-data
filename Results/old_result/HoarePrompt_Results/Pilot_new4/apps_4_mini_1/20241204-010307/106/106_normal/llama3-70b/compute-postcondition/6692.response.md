According to the code, the loop iterates over the pairs of `dx` and `dy` from the list `[(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]`. Each iteration will process a different pair of values for `dx` and `dy`. 

Since the loop has just completed its previous iteration, it has already processed the last pair `(1, 1)`. Consequently, in the next iteration, the loop will start again from the first pair `(-1, -1)`. 

However, since we want to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we also need to note that the loop will repeat at least once more to process the first pair.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 1, `nx` is `1 + (-1)`, `ny` is `1 + (-1)`**
