The variable `nx` is assigned the value of `x + dx`, and `ny` is assigned the value of `y + dy`. Given that `dx` is -1 and `dy` is 1, we can deduce that `nx` will be `x - 1` and `ny` will be `9 + 1`, which is `10`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is greater than or equal to 9, `y` is 9, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, and `ny` is 10.

Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 9, `y` is 9, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is 10.**
