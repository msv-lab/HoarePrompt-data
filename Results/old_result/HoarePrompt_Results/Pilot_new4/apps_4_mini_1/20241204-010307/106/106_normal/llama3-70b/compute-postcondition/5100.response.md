Postcondition: ***`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 3, `y` is 1, `nx` is 3 + `dx`, and `ny` is 1 + `dy`. If both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of 0 to `N`, the value of `ncur` is determined from the array `A[3 + dx][1 + dy]`. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is updated with (cur, piece), with `queue` containing the new element `(ncur, 0)`. If the condition is not met, no changes are made.***
