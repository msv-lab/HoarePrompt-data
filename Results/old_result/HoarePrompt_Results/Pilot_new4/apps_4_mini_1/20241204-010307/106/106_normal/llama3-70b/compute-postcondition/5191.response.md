The code assigns `cur` and `piece` to the `parent[0][ncur]`. The values of `cur` and `piece` are not specified in the initial state, but the state of other variables remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is between 0 and N-1, `y` is between 1 and N-1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is `x - 2`, `ny` is `y + 1`, `ncur` is `A[x - 2][y + 1]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is `cur`, `piece`.**
