According to the code, the for loop iterates over the list of tuples representing direction changes `(dx, dy)`. Each iteration updates the values of `nx` and `ny` based on the current `dx` and `dy`, which are determined by the current iteration of the loop. 

At the end of the last iteration, `y` is an integer less than `N`, and `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`. The loop has not yet executed for the last direction `(0, 1)` (the last tuple in the list).

The loop must execute again for the next iteration; thus, the following conditions must hold:

- The loop will execute one more time for `(0, 1)`, resulting in `nx = x + 0` and `ny = y + 1`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`. Given `y` is less than `N`, to check for `ny`, we need `y + 1 < N`.

Therefore, `y` must be less than `N - 1`. The indices `nx` and `ny` will be determined based on the current values of `x` and `y`.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is an integer less than `N - 1`, `nx` is `x + 0`, `ny` is `y + 1`**
