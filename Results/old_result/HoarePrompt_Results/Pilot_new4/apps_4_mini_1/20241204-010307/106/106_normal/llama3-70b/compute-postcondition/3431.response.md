According to the code, the loop will execute once for each pair `(dx, dy)` in the given list of tuples. There are 8 pairs in total. In the previous iteration, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, and it has been indicated that `nx` and `ny` have been calculated based on `dx` and `dy`. 

Since `x` and `y` will be updated in the next iteration of the loop based on the values of `dx` and `dy`, we need to consider the next pair in the list. Currently, `dx` and `dy` are the first pair `(-2, -1)` in the subsequent iteration of the loop, meaning the values for `nx` and `ny` will be updated to reflect the next coordinates based on the next pair. 

Since the loop iterates over all pairs, the values of `dx` and `dy` will sequentially take on each of the pairs from the provided list. Thus, in the next iteration, the first element will switch to the next tuple, and we will use the second tuple `(-2, 1)` next. 

Given that the loop will continue to iterate until all pairs have been processed, the state should now reflect the next iteration's variables:

- `x` is still 1, as it is not directly modified in the loop.
- `y` is still 0, for the same reason.
- `dx` and `dy` will take on the next pair from the list. 

Since we don't have the values for `cur`, `ncur`, or the contents of the arrays `dist` and `parent` to modify them here, we will keep them as they are until we can determine the next state.

At the start of the next iteration, the states need to reflect the next tuple being processed:

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `A[1][0]` equals `cur`, `nx` is `1 + dx` (for the next tuple), `ny` is `dy` (for the next tuple)**.
