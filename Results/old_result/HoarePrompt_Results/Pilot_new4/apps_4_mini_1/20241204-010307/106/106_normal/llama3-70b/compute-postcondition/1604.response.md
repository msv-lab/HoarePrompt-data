The value of `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The variable `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, and the value of `ny` is 1. However, the bounds of the array `A` are not specified in the initial state, so we cannot definitively state whether `ncur` is in bounds or what its value would be. 

The states of the other variables are not affected, so we maintain the conditions of those variables. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is 1, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]` (if it were in bounds), `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1**.
