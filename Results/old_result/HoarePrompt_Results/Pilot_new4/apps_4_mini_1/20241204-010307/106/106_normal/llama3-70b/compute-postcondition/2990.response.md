Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, and `dist` reflects the shortest distances for all reachable positions. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `(cur, 0)`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and `queue` now contains the previous elements plus the new tuple `(ncur, 0)`; otherwise, no changes are made.***
