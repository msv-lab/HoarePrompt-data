Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 1, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 3, and if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[1][3]`. If `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` contains `(ncur, 2)`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
