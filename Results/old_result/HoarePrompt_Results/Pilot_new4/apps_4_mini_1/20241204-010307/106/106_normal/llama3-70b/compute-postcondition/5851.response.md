The statement `parent[2][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the values of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[2][ncur]`. This means the `parent` array at the index `2` and `ncur` will be updated with these values. Other variables remain unchanged.

The specific impact on the state can be summarized as follows:
- `parent[2][ncur]` is now equal to a tuple `(cur, piece)`.

The other variables are unaffected, so the output state contains all the relevant information from the initial state along with the update.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `queue` initially contains at least one tuple of the form `(ncur, 1)`, `piece` is 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is 2, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is A[2][0], `parent[2][ncur]` is now equal to `(cur, piece)`.**
