The code snippet appends a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `1` are now added to the `queue`, but no other variables are affected directly by this operation. 

The values of the other variables remain unchanged, and the output state reflects the addition to the queue.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is -1, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[-1][0]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `piece`, `queue` contains `(ncur, 1)`**
