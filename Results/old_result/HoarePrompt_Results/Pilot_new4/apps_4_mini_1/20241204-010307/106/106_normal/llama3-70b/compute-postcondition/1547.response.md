The operation `nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy` updates the values of `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged, while `nx` and `ny` will be equal to `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The specific values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided, but they are assumed to be defined tuples that can impact the calculation.

Since `x` is currently 2 and `y` is currently 2, the output state reflects this along with the new values of `nx` and `ny`. Therefore, the Output State is: 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `A[x][y]` is defined, `cur` has a valid value, `dist[0]` is updated for each valid `ncur`, `parent[0]` is updated for each corresponding `ncur`, `queue` contains tuples of all valid `ncur` values with the associated piece 0, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur` where `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` was greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1, dx and dy will iterate through the defined tuples in the loop.**
