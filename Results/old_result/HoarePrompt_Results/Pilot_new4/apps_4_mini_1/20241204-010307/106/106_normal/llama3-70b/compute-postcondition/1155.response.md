According to the code, the loop iterates over a list of tuples representing the changes in indices (`dx`, `dy`). The loop will execute one more time for each tuple in the list. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 1, `y` is 1, and the possible values of `dx` and `dy` will be taken from the list provided.

The loop has already processed some of the tuples, and since the list contains 8 tuples, there are potentially 8 iterations in total. However, we need to determine what the current indices `cur` and `ncur` were after the last iteration to conclude the state correctly.

Assuming the loop has processed the first `k` tuples so far, and now we are on the `k+1`-th tuple (which consists of the values of `dx` and `dy`), the states will need to be updated accordingly.

The maximum number of iterations will be reached when all tuples have been processed. Therefore, `dx` and `dy` will be taken from the next tuple in the list after the current iteration.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that the loop processes all tuples in the list, so we need to increment `cur` or track how many tuples have been processed.

However, since no specific information about how many tuples have been executed is provided, we can generally state that if the loop executes once more, it will take the next tuple.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 1; `dx` and `dy` must be the next tuple in the list of [(-2, -1), (-2, 1), (-1, -2), (-1, 2), (1, -2), (1, 2), (2, -1), (2, 1)]**
