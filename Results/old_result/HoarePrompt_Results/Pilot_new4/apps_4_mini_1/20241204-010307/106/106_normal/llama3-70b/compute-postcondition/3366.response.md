The `queue` is updated by appending the tuple `(ncur, 1)` to it. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `cur` is unchanged, `dist[1]` remains unchanged except for `dist[1][ncur]`, `parent[1]` remains unchanged except for `parent[1][ncur]` which is now equal to `cur` and `piece`, `piece` is equal to 1, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to the minimum distance from `(0, 2)` considering valid knight moves, `parent[0][ncur]` contains the updated parent positions for each reachable position based on the knight's moves, `queue` contains all tuples `(ncur, 0)` appended for each valid move resulting in an update to `dist[0][ncur]`, `queue` now contains the additional tuple `(ncur, 1)`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1 for the first iteration, `nx` is -1, `ny` is 1, and `ncur` is equal to `A[-1][1]`.**
