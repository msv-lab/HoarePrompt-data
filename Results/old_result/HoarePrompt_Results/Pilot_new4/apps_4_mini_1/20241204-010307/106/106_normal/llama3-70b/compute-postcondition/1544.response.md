Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 2; `y` is 2; `A[x][y]` is defined; `cur` has a valid value; `dist[0]` is updated for each valid `ncur`; `parent[0]` is updated for each corresponding `ncur`; `queue` contains tuples of all valid `ncur` values with the associated piece 0 plus the new tuple `(A[1][3], 1)` if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`. If `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is set to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is updated to `(cur, piece)`, otherwise no updates are made. If `nx` or `ny` is out of bounds, no changes are made to `dist` or `parent`, and `queue` remains unchanged.***
