The variable `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`, where `cur` is the previous state or index. The values of `N`, `piece`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and `dist[2][ncur]` remain unchanged, but the value of `parent[2][ncur]` is updated based on the value of `cur` and the fixed value of `piece`, which is 2.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `piece` is 2; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, 2)`**.
