According to the code, the for loop iterates over the direction deltas `(-1, 0)`, `(1, 0)`, `(0, -1)`, and `(0, 1)`. At the end of the last iteration, the current values of `dx` and `dy` would have been those of the last tuple processed in the loop. Given that the loop body is omitted, I need to evaluate how the states would change for the next iteration.

The last iteration processed the last direction, which is `(0, 1)`. After processing this, it would move on to the next delta in the list but since there are no more deltas, the loop will not execute again. 

The final values of `dx` and `dy` from processing `(0, 1)` will not change, but the loop processing has finished. To enable the loop to execute again, we would need to consider the next iteration of deltas. However, since the for loop is defined with a fixed list of values, there wonâ€™t be a new state beyond the already defined deltas for `dx` and `dy`.

As such, there are no further changes to make for future iterations since the loop would not execute again with the same input conditions.

Therefore, the state remains unchanged:
State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 1, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 2, and if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[1][2]`.**
