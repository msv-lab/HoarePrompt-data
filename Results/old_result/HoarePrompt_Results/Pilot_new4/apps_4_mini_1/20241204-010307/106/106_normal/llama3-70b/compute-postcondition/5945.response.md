The statement `parent[2][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the value of `cur` (and `piece`) to `parent[2][ncur]`. The other variables remain unchanged, and since `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, this means `parent[2][ncur]` gets updated based on `cur`.

The output state will reflect this assignment while keeping the rest of the values the same.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 0 and 8 (inclusive); `dx` is 0; `dy` is -1; `nx` is equal to `x`; `ny` is between -1 and 7 (inclusive); `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur, piece`.**
