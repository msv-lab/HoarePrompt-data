According to the code, the for loop iterates over a set of tuples representing directional changes. The loop will execute again for each tuple in the list `[(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]`. At the end of the last iteration, the values of `dx` and `dy` would correspond to one of these tuples. Since the loop hasn't completed all iterations yet, we need to determine the state after the current iteration and before the next one.

The current state shows that `dx` is 1 and `dy` is 1, which suggests that the loop has just completed the iteration with the tuple `(1, 1)`. Consequently, the next iteration will proceed to the next tuple in the list, which is `(-1, -1)`. 

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `dx` and `dy` will be updated to `(-1, -1)`, and we need to maintain the other existing states as they are.

State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 3, `y` is 1, `dist` contains the shortest distances, `parent` reflects the updated parent tuples with `parent[1][ncur]` now being `(cur, piece)`, `queue` contains valid tuples and includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`, `piece` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is 2 + `dx`, `ny` is 0 + `dy`, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[1][ncur]` equals `dist[1][cur] + 1` if the condition `piece == 1 and dist[1][ncur] > dist[1][cur] + 1` is satisfied.**
