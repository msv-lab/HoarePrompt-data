Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `x` is between 2 and N-1, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, and `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, the state of `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remains unchanged. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` is false, no changes are made.***
