According to the code, the loop iterates over a fixed list of direction tuples `[(dx, dy)]`. Since the loop body is omitted, we can focus on how the loop progresses through its iterations. 

The loop will execute for each tuple in the list, which contains 4 tuples: `(-1, -1)`, `(-1, 1)`, `(1, -1)`, and `(1, 1)`. The loop index is not explicitly maintained in the provided context, but we know the loop will execute from an index of 0 to 3 (the length of the list minus one).

At the end of the last iteration, since there are no variables changing within the loop structure itself (as the loop iterates over a static list), we can determine that:

1. The first iteration corresponds to `(-1, -1)`.
2. The last iteration corresponds to `(1, 1)`.

If the loop has executed through `(-1, -1)`, `(-1, 1)`, `(1, -1)`, and `(1, 1)`, it will not execute again because the loop is over the length of the list which is fixed at 4. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute again, there must be a next iteration available, which is not possible under the current conditions.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= `N` <= 10, piece is 1, and dist[1][ncur] and dist[1][cur] have been evaluated as per the last iteration. The loop has completed its full execution.**
