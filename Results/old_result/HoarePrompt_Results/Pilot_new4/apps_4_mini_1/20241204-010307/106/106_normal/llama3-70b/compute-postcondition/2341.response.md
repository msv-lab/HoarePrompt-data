Postcondition: ***`dist[1]` contains the shortest distances from the initial position, `parent[1]` contains the parent positions, and `queue` now includes an additional tuple `(ncur, 2)` if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`. If `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` was greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1` and `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged if the condition is not met.***
