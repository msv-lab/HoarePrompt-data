Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `dist[0]` contains the minimum distances from the starting position to each reachable cell in the grid, `parent[0]` contains the parent information for each reachable cell, and `queue` contains tuples of cells that were added for processing based on valid moves. If no moves were valid, `dist[0]` and `parent[0]` remain unchanged, and `queue` is empty.**
