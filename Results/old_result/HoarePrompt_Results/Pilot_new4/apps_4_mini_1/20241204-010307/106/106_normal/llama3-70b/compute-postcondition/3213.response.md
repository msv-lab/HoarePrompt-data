Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur` reachable from `(x, y)` based on the knight's moves, `parent[1][ncur]` is established for those reachable positions, and `queue` contains tuples `(ncur, 1)` for each valid `ncur` that met the conditions. If `piece` is equal to 1, then `dist[1][ncur]` will reflect the minimum distance from the original position to each reachable `ncur`, and `parent[1][ncur]` will represent the previous position and piece that led to `ncur`. If no valid moves are possible, `dist[1][ncur]` and `parent[1][ncur]` will remain unchanged for those unreachable positions.**
