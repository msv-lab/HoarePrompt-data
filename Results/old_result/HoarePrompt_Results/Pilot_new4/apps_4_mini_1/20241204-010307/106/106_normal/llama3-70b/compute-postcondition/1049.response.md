Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then if `piece` equals 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, and `queue` includes the element `(ncur, 2)`; otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
