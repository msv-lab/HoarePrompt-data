According to the code, the for loop is iterating through a list of tuples representing possible changes in `dx` and `dy`. The loop will execute regardless of the values of `N`, `y`, or `A[x][0]`, as these variables do not affect the iterations of the loop itself. 

However, to ensure the loop executes correctly and to track its state, we need to initialize `dx` and `dy` for the first iteration. Given that the loop iterates over a fixed set of tuples, `dx` and `dy` must start with the first tuple in the list, which is `(-2, -1)`.

Therefore, the adjustments required for the state are as follows:

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1**
