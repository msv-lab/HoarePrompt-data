The variable `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are unchanged at -1 and 0, respectively. Since `N` can be between 3 and 10, the state of `ncur` depends on the specific values in the matrix `A` at position `A[-1][0]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is -1, `ny` is 0, and `ncur` is assigned the value `A[-1][0]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is -1, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is assigned the value `A[-1][0]**
