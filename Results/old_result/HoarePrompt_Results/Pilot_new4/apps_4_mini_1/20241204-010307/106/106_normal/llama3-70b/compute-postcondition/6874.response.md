Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `piece` is equal to 1. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then if `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to (cur, 1), and `queue` is updated to include the tuple `(ncur, 1)` along with the necessary elements.***
