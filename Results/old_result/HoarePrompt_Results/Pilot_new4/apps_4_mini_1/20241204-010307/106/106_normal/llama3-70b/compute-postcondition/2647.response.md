The variable `ncur` is assigned the value from the array `A` at the indices `[nx][ny]`. Given that `nx` is equal to `x - 2` and `ny` is 0, we calculate the indices as follows: `nx = x - 2` and `ny = 0`. The value `ncur` will therefore be `A[x - 2][0]`.

The value of `N` is not directly affected, but we must keep in mind the constraints on `N` (which is an integer between 3 and 10), as well as the values of `y` (which is -1), `dx` (which is -2), `dy` (which is 1), and the fact that `A[x][-1]` is equal to `cur` at the original state. 

Assuming `A` is defined in such a way that `A[x - 2][0]` returns a valid value based on the current definition of the array, the program's output will reflect the new assignment to `ncur`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is -1, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is `x - 2`, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 2][0]`.**
