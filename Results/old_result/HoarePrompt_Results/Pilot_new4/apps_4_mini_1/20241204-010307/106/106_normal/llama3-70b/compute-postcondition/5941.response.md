To assess the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze how the variables will change during the loop execution. 

The loop iterates over the pairs `(-1, 0)`, `(1, 0)`, `(0, -1)`, and `(0, 1)`, which represent the possible changes in `dx` and `dy`. At the end of the previous iteration, we know:

- `N` is between 3 and 10, which means the grid size is at least 3 and at most 10.
- `y` is between 0 and 8 (inclusive), which allows `ny` to vary from 1 to 9 based on the value of `dy`.
- `dx` is 0 and `dy` is 1, which means in the next iteration, we will check the pair `(0, -1)` next.

For the loop to execute again, we need to consider how `dx` and `dy` will change in the next iteration. The next sets of `dx` and `dy` will be:

1. For the first iteration `(dx, dy) = (-1, 0)`
2. For the second iteration `(dx, dy) = (1, 0)`
3. For the third iteration `(dx, dy) = (0, -1)`, which is the one we're currently at
4. For the fourth and final iteration `(dx, dy) = (0, 1)`, which is already processed.

Since we are currently at `(dx, dy) = (0, 1)` and `ny` is between 1 and 9 (inclusive), in preparation for the next iteration with `(dx, dy) = (0, -1)`, we will need to adjust `ny` such that it remains valid, which means it will be `ny` decreased by 1 (if `dy` is -1).

However, note that we have not executed any updates that would change `ncur`, `cur`, or affect the other variables.

As a result, for the next iteration, we need to update `dy` from 1 to -1, leaving all other states unchanged. 

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 0 and 8 (inclusive); `dx` is 0; `dy` is -1; `nx` is `x`; `ny` is between 1 and 8 (inclusive)**.
