In the given code snippet, we are updating the value of `dist[1][ncur]`. The value of `ncur` is defined as `A[x - 1][0]`, and `cur` is the value of `A[x][y]`.

The update to `dist[1][ncur]` is calculated based on the current value of `dist[1][cur]` plus 1. Thus, the value at `dist[1][ncur]` will become `dist[1][cur] + 1`.

The precondition states that:
- `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`
- `y` is -1
- `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`
- `dx` is -1
- `dy` is 1
- `nx` is `x - 1`
- `ny` is `0`
- `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][0]`

After executing the code, the states of the variables that remain unchanged will still be valid, and we will update the effective value of `dist[1][ncur]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is -1, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is `0`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][0]`, and `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
