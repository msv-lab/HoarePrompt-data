The code assigns the value of `A[nx][ny]` to `ncur`. The values of `nx` and `ny` satisfy the conditions `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and `A` is a matrix with dimensions defined by `N`. Since `N` is between 3 and 10, `nx` and `ny` will also be valid indices in the matrix `A`. The other variables in the state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 1, `y` is `N-1`, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `N - 1 + dy`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dist` contains the updated minimum distances, `parent` contains parent information, `queue` contains tuples representing reachable points, `nx` and `ny` satisfy `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
