The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The values of the variables `N`, `y`, `A[x][y]`, `x`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `dist[0][ncur]`, and `parent[0][ncur]` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the `append` operation. Therefore, the output state includes all the preconditions that are still valid after the code has been executed.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 0; `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`; `x` is between 2 and N-1; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[x + dx][dy]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`; `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`.**
