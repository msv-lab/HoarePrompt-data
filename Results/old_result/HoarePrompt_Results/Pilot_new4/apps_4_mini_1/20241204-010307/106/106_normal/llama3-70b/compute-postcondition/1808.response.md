Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `dx` is 1, `dy` is -1, `piece` is either 0 or 1, `nx` is equal to `x + 1`, and `ny` is equal to `y - 1` which is 1. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and if `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value (cur, piece), and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. If the condition is not satisfied, the state remains unchanged.***
