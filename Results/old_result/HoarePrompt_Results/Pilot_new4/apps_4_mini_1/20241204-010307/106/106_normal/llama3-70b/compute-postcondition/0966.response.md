The code `queue.append((cur, i))` appends a tuple `(cur, i)` to the list `queue`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated `queue` with the new tuple added.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated for all valid neighboring cells reachable from `(0, 1)`, `parent[2][ncur]` reflects the last valid parent node for those updates, `queue` is updated to include the tuple `(cur, i)`, and if no valid moves were found, `dist[2][ncur]` remains unchanged for those cells; the current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`.**
