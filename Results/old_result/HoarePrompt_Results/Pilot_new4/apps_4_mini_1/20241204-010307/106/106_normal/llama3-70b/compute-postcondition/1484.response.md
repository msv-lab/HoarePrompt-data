Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 2; `y` is 1; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 0; `nx` is 1; `ny` is 1; `ncur` is `A[1][1]`. If `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
