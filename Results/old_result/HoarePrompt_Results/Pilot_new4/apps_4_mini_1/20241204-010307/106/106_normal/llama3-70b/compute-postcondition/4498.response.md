Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dist` and `parent` are valid and updated based on knight's moves, `queue` contains valid `(ncur, 0)` tuples, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, the current values of `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid, specifically `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
