The code assigns the value of `cur` to `parent[2][ncur]`, along with the value of `piece`. The initial state remains valid, and only the `parent[2][ncur]` variable is updated with the new values. The other variables maintain their previous states as described.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is 0, `ny` is 2, `ncur` is `A[0][2]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dist[1]` reflects the shortest distance relevant to the moves, `parent[2][ncur]` is `cur, piece`, `parent[1]` reflects the current parent node relevant to the moves, and `queue` contains at least one valid `(ncur, 1)` tuple.**
