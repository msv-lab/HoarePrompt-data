The values of `nx` and `ny` are calculated based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. Since `x` and `y` are both 0, `nx` will be equal to `dx` and `ny` will be equal to `dy`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `dist[0]` has been updated for reachable positions, `parent[0]` has been assigned tuples for reachable positions, and `queue` contains tuples for each reachable position from `(0, 0)`**.
