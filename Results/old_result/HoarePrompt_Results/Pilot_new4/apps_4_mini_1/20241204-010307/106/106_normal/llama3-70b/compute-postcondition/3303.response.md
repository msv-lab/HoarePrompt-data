The code assigns the value of `A[nx][ny]` to `ncur`. The variables `nx` and `ny` are already defined as `0 + dx` and `1 + dy`, respectively, and satisfy the conditions `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, indicating they are valid indices for the array `A`. The value of `ncur` is now directly influenced by the specific values at the coordinates indicated by `nx` and `ny` in the array `A`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged, so the output state reflects the assignment of `ncur` based on the values in the array `A`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is `0 + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, `dist[1]` remains unchanged, `parent[1]` remains unchanged, `queue` may contain tuples of positions that were explored, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
