Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is an integer such that `0 <= y < N`, `dist` contains the shortest distances for all reachable `ncur` values from the starting point for each piece type, `parent` holds the corresponding previous positions for each `piece`, `queue` contains all tuples of reachable states based on the pieces and their moves, `piece` indicates the type of piece currently being processed, and if the loop executes for all `y` values, then the minimum distances in `dist` and the previous positions in `parent` are updated accordingly for all valid moves of each piece type. If the loop does not execute, `dist` and `parent` remain unchanged from their initial states.**
