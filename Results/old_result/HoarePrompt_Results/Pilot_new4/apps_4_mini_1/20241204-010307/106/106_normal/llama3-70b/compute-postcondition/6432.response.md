In the provided code, `nx` and `ny` are assigned new values based on the previous values of `x` and `y`, combined with the changes defined by tuples in `dx` and `dy`. The values of `dx` and `dy` can be any of the four tuples.

1. `nx` is calculated as `x + dx`, which means it will change depending on the specific tuple chosen from `dx`.
2. `ny` is calculated as `y + dy`, which also changes based on the specific tuple chosen from `dy`.

Given the initial state where `x` is `0` and `y` is `1`, we can derive the possible values for `nx` and `ny` based on the combinations of the tuples from `dx` and `dy`.

- If `dx` is `(-1, -1)`:
  - `nx = 0 - 1 = -1`
  - `ny = 1 - 1 = 0`
  
- If `dx` is `(-1, 1)`:
  - `nx = 0 - 1 = -1`
  - `ny = 1 + 1 = 2`
  
- If `dx` is `(1, -1)`:
  - `nx = 0 + 1 = 1`
  - `ny = 1 - 1 = 0`
  
- If `dx` is `(1, 1)`:
  - `nx = 0 + 1 = 1`
  - `ny = 1 + 1 = 2`
  
Since `nx` and `ny` have defined possible values depending on the choice of tuples, the output state must reflect all valid combinations along with the unchanged conditions.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `nx` is either -1 or 1; `ny` is either 0, 2, or both based on the combinations of `dx` and `dy`.**
