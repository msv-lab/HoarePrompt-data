Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `nx` is equal to `x + 1`, `ny` is equal to `y`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `piece` is 2. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and if `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to (cur, 2), and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`. Otherwise, no changes occur in the state.***
