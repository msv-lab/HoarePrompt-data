The variables `nx` and `ny` are being assigned new values based on the current values of `x` and `y`, along with the increments defined by `dx` and `dy`. Specifically, `nx` is calculated as `x + dx`, and since `dx` is `-1`, this means `nx` will be equal to `x - 1`. Similarly, `ny` is calculated as `y + dy`, and since `dy` is `-2`, this means `ny` will be equal to `y - 2`. Given that `y` is `-1`, `ny` will become `-1 - 2`, which results in `-3`.

Since `x` was not changed by the operation, we keep its original value. The other variables remain unchanged as well.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the new values of `nx` and `ny` while keeping the conditions of the other variables intact.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is -1, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -2, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is -3.**
