Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 3 and 10, `y` is equal to `N`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, and `ny` is equal to `N - 1`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is equal to 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`, and `(ncur, 0)` is added to `queue`. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
