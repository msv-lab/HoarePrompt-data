Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is either `x-1`, `x+1`, or `x`, `ny` is either `1`, `0`, or `2`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 2, and the distance from `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than the distance from `dist[2][cur]` plus 1.***
