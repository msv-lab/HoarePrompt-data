Output State: **`dist[1][ncur]` contains the minimum distances from the starting position to all reachable positions based on the conditions of the loop, `parent[1][ncur]` reflects the last piece and position before reaching `ncur`, `queue` contains all positions reachable by the current piece from `(x,y)`, while `dist[0][cur]` remains unchanged for any unreachable positions. If the loop does not execute, `dist` and `parent` remain unchanged, and `queue` stays empty.**
