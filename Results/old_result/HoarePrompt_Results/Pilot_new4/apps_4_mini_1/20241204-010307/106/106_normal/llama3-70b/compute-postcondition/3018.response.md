Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, and `piece` is 0. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `piece` is updated to 1; if `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `queue` now contains tuples of reachable positions including `(ncur, 1)`; otherwise, the state remains unchanged. If the condition does not hold, the state also remains unchanged.***
