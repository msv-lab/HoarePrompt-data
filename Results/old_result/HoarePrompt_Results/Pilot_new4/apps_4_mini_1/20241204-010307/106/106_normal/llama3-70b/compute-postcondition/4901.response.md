Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; if `nx` and `ny` are within bounds, and if `piece` equals 2 while `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `cur`, `piece` is updated, and `queue` now contains `(ncur, 2)`. If `nx` or `ny` are out of bounds, no changes are made.***
