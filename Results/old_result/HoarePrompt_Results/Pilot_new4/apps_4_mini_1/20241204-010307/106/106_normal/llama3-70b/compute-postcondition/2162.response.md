Postcondition: ***`dist` contains valid distances for reachable indices, `parent[1][ncur]` reflects the parent tracking for each updated index, `queue` contains tuples `(ncur, 1)` for each updated index during the loop, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, and the current values of `nx` and `ny` are such that both are within the range of 0 to N (0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N).***
