The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the list `queue`. This modifies the `queue` by adding an element to it. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `dx`, `dy`, `A[0][0]`, `cur`, `ncur`, `dist[0][ncur]`, and `parent[0][ncur]` remain unchanged in the output state.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` now includes (ncur, 0), `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is -2, `ny` is -1, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `ncur` is equal to `A[-2][-1]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`.**
