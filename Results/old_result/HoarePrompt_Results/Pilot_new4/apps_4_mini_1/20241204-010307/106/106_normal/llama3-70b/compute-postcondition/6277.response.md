The code snippet `queue.append((ncur, 2))` appends a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the list `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `2` are now added to the `queue`. Other variables in the initial state remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `x` is defined and within bounds, `nx` is `x - 1`, `x + 1`, or `x`, `ny` is `1`, `2`, or `3`, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is now equal to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` now contains `(ncur, 2)`.**
