Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `nx` is `2 + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the values of `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. If the condition for the if statement is not satisfied, no changes are made to the state.***
