The value of `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is between 0 and N-1 and `ny` is between 0 and N-1, ensuring that `ncur` is valid for `A[nx][ny]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `nx` is between 0 and N-1, `ny` is between 0 and N-1, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `cur` is defined, `piece` is 0.**
