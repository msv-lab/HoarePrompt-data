The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned values based on the expressions `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The value of `y` is equal to `N` which is constrained between 3 and 10, so `ny` will be equal to `N + dy`. The values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided, so `nx` will be `x + dx` and `ny` will be `N + dy`. The states of the other variables, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue`, remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is equal to `N`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `N + dy`, and `dist`, `parent`, `queue` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is equal to `N`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `N + dy`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged.**
