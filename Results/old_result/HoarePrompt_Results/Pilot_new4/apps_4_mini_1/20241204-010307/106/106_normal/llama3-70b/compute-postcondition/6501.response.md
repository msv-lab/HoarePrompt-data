The statement `dist[0][ncur] = dist[0][cur] + 1` indicates that the value at `dist[0][ncur]` is assigned a new value based on the current state's values in `dist`. The variable `ncur` is defined as `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is `x + dx` and `ny` is `y + dy`. The preconditions suggest that `N` is between 3 and 10, `x` and `y` are both between 0 and `N-1`, while `dist` and `cur` are not explicitly defined in the initial state but are implied to have existing values.

The impact of the code on the program is:
- The specific calculation for `ncur` is based on accessing the 2D list `A` at the indexes `nx` and `ny`.
- The value of `dist[0][ncur]` will be updated to be one more than `dist[0][cur]`.

Thus, while `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` retain their precondition definitions, the key change occurs in the `dist` array, particularly `dist[0][ncur]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 0 and `N-1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
