The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned new values based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. Specifically, `nx` is calculated as `x + dx` and `ny` is calculated as `y + dy`. 

Given that `dx` is -1, `nx` becomes `x - 1`, while `dy` is 1, making `ny` equal to `y + 1`. The values of `N`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged, but we update `nx` and `ny` based on the calculations.

Since `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` and `y` are both within the range `0` to `N-1`, we know that:
- `x - 1` will still be within the range `-1` to `N-2` (valid as long as `x` is greater than `0`).
- `y + 1` will be within the range `1` to `N` (valid as long as `y` is less than `N-1`).

Thus, the updated values of `nx` and `ny` depend on the current values of `x` and `y`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is within `0` and `N-1`, `y` is within `0` and `N-1`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is `y + 1`.**
