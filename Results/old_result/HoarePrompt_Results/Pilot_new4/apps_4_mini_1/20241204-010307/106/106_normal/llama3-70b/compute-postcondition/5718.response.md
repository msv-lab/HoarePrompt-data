Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `queue` contains the previous elements plus the tuple `(ncur, 0)`; `x` is 0; `y` is 2; `nx` is -2; `ny` is 1; `dx` is -2; `dy` is -1; `ncur` is equal to `A[-2][1]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece` if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`.***
