The variable `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are determined by their definitions: `nx` is `x + 1` and `ny` is `y`. Since `piece`, `dx`, and `dy` are not directly affected by this assignment, their values will remain the same. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `ncur` has been updated based on the indices `nx` and `ny`.

Output State: **`piece` is 1, `(dx, dy)` is (1, 0), `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is `y`, `ncur` is `A[x + 1][y]`**.
