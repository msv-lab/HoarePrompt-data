The code appends a tuple containing `ncur` and `2` to the `queue`. The state of the variables `N`, `x`, `y`, `piece`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remains the same except for the addition of the new tuple. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `piece` is now 2, `nx` is between 0 and N-1, `ny` is between 0 and N-1, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `2`, and a tuple `(ncur, 2)` has been added to `queue`.**
