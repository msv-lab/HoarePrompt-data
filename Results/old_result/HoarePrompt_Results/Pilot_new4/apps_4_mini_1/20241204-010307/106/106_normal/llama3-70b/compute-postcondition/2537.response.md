The code `queue.append((ncur, 2))` adds a tuple containing `ncur` and the integer `2` to the `queue`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Hence, the output state reflects the unchanged values and the new state of `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dist[2][cur]` is unchanged, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `queue` has an additional tuple `(ncur, 2)`, `dx, dy` are at the end of the list of directions, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
