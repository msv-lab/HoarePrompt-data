The assignment `parent[1][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the tuple `(cur, piece)` to the location `parent[1][ncur]`. Here, `cur` is the current variable and `piece` is equal to `1`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

In this case, `parent[1][ncur]` is updated, but there are no specific calculations or other variable changes indicated by the provided code.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `0 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, 1)`**.
