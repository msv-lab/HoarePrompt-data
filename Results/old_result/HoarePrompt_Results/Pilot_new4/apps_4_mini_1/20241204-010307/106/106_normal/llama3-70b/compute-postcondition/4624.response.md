Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dist[1]` reflects updated distances based on valid moves, `parent[1]` contains updated parent relationships for valid moves, `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)` in addition to its previous contents, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][2]`. If `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1` and `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`.***
