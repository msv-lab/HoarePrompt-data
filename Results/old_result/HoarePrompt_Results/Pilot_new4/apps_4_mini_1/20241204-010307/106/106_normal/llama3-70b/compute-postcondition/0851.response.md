Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 0; `y` is 0; `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur` values based on the conditions, and `parent[1][ncur]` is set for all valid `ncur` values; `queue` contains tuples of `(ncur, 1)` for all valid moves. If no valid moves exist, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged.**
