The code assigns the value of `cur` to `parent[0][ncur]`. The `piece` value remains unchanged at 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Since `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]` and `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is equal to `y - 1`, the values of `dist`, `piece`, `queue`, `dx`, and `dy` remain as described. 

Output State: **`N` is at least 5; `dist` contains updated minimum distances, where `dist[0][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur`; `piece` remains unchanged at 2; `queue` contains (cur, i) and (ncur, 0); `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is equal to `y - 1`.**
