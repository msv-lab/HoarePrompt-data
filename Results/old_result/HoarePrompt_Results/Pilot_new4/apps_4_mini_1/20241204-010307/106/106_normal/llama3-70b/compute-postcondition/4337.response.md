Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is equal to `N`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `N + dy`; if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` and `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is now equal to `(cur, 1)`, and `queue` contains an additional tuple `(ncur, 1)`. Otherwise, the precondition state remains unchanged.***
