Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `piece` is 0, `nx` is `2 + dx`, `ny` is `0 + dy`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` must allow for movements from position (2, 0) within the bounds of array `A`. The current values of `nx` and `ny` are such that `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`.***
