The code assigns `cur` and `piece` as values to `parent[1][ncur]`. The values of `cur` and `piece` are not provided in the initial state, but `ncur` is dependent on `nx` and `ny`, which are the results of adding `dx` to `x` and `dy` to `y`, respectively. The state of the related variables remains unchanged except for `parent[1][ncur]`.

The Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is the current y-coordinate, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x + dx][y + dy]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is the current y-coordinate, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x + dx][y + dy]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`.**
