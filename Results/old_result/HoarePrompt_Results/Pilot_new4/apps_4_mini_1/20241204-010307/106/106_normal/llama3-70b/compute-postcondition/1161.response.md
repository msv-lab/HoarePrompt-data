Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 1; `nx` is -1; `ny` is 0; `ncur` is `A[-1][0]`. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to equal `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, and `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
