According to the code, the loop iterates over the four possible direction changes defined by the tuples in the list [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]. The variables `dx` and `dy` will take on each of these values in turn.

At the end of the last iteration, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, and `y` is also between 0 and `N-1`. Since there are no changes to `N`, `x`, or `y` directly within the loop, these variables remain unchanged in their respective ranges. 

The iteration will execute four times, once for each tuple in the list. After the last iteration, `dx` and `dy` will have taken on the values of the last tuple, which is (0, 1). Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `dx` will reset to -1 and `dy` will reset to 0 for the first tuple.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is between 0 and `N-1`; `y` is between 0 and `N-1`; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 0**
