The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned new values based on the calculations involving `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy`. Specifically, `nx` becomes `x + dx` and `ny` becomes `y + dy`. 

From the initial state:
- `dx` is -2, so it will decrease the value of `x`.
- `dy` is 1, so it will increase the value of `y`.

The calculations for `nx` and `ny` will be:
- `nx = x + dx` = `x - 2`
- `ny = y + dy` = `1 + 1` = `2`

The precondition details remain valid. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated values for `nx` and `ny`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is `x - 2`, and `ny` is 2**.
