Postcondition: ***`dist[1]` contains the shortest distances based on valid moves, `parent[1]` indicates the relationship for each reachable position, `queue` holds tuples for positions added during the loop, `nx` is `x + dx`, and `ny` is `y + dy`. The current values of `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid, such that 0 is less than or equal to `nx` and `ny`, and both `nx` and `ny` are less than `N`.***
