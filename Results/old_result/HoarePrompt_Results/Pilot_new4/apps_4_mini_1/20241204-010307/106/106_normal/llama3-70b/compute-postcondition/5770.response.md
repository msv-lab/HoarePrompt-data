In the provided code snippet, the main impact is that `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` combined with the value of `piece`. The values of `N`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and the updated `dist` array remain unchanged.

- `parent[2][ncur]` receives the value `cur, piece`, reflecting that it now points to or is related to the current value of `cur` alongside `piece`.
- Other variables remain in their original state.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `dx` is 1; `dy` is 0; `nx` is equal to `x + 1`; `ny` is equal to `y`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`.**
