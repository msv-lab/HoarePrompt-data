Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` was greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dist[2][ncur]` is less than or equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, and `queue` includes `(ncur, 2)`.***
