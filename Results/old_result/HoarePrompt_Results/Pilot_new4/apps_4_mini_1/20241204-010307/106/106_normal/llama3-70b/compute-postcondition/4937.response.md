Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 1 and N-2; `x` is between 1 and N-2; `nx` varies as `x + dx` and `ny` varies as `y + dy` where `dx` and `dy` are unspecified within bounds. The current values of `nx` and `ny` are such that 0 is less than or equal to `nx` and `ny`, and `nx` and `ny` are less than `N`.***
