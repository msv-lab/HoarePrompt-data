According to the code, the loop iterates over the four possible directional movements represented by the tuples in the list `[( -1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]`. For the loop to execute one more time, it needs to move to the next tuple in the list.

At the end of the last iteration, we are currently at the first tuple `(-1, -1)`, and we have processed that direction. Therefore, we should increment the index of the tuple being processed. There will be no changes to the other variables (`N`, `y`, `dist`, `parent`, `queue`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `piece`) as they remain unchanged across iterations of this loop.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the direction being processed. As it is currently at index 0, the next direction will be at index 1, which corresponds to `(-1, 1)`.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is equal to `N`; `dist` is updated for valid `ncur` positions; `parent` is updated for valid `ncur` positions; `queue` contains tuples of `(ncur, 0)` and `(ncur, 1)` for valid positions; `nx` is equal to `x + dx` and `ny` is equal to `N + dy`; if both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 1, and if `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1` and `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur, piece`; current direction being processed is `(-1, 1)`.**
