Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is an integer between `0` and `N-1`; `y` is an integer between `0` and `N-2`; `nx` is equal to `x - 2`; `ny` is equal to `y - 1`; `dx` is -2; `dy` is -1; `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 2][y - 1]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur, piece`; `queue` now includes `(ncur, 0)`.**
