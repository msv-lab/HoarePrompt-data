`nx` is assigned the value of `x + dx`, and `ny` is assigned the value of `y + dy`. Given that `x` is 0, `dx` is -2, `y` is 1, and `dy` is -1, we can calculate the values: `nx` becomes `0 + (-2)` which is `-2`, and `ny` becomes `1 + (-1)` which is `0`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dist[0]` remains unchanged, `parent[0]` remains unchanged, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is -2, `ny` is 0**.
