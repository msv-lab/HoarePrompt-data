According to the code, the for loop iterates over a list of tuples `[(dx, dy)]`, which consists of four directional movements. The loop will execute regardless of the values of `N`, `y`, `x`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue`, since the loop does not depend on the values of these variables.

Therefore, the only thing we need to ensure is that the loop can iterate correctly. The variables `dx` and `dy` will take the values from the tuples in the list, so there is no need to adjust any state variables specifically for the loop to begin executing.

However, if we are considering the overall logic of the program, the states of `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` should be set up correctly prior to the loop to ensure that the loop body can work as intended after the first execution.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `dist[0]` is updated for all reachable positions from `(x, y)`, `parent[0]` stores the previous position and piece for each reachable position, `queue` contains all the valid `(ncur, 0)` positions**.
