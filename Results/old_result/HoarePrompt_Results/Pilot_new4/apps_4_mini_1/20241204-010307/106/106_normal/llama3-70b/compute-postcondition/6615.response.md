The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. Given the initial state where `x` is 1 and `dx` is -1, we calculate `nx` as follows: 

- `nx = 1 + (-1) = 0`

For `ny`, since `y` is 0 and `dy` is -1, we calculate:

- `ny = 0 + (-1) = -1`

The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy` are unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State reflects the updated values of `nx` and `ny`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is 0, `ny` is -1**
