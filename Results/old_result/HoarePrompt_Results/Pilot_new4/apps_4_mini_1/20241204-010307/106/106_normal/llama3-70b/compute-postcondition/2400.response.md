Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 0; `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`; `dist[0][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur` reached from `(x, y)` based on the conditions within the loop; `parent[0][ncur]` is set for all valid `ncur` reached, where each `ncur` is the corresponding `A[nx][ny]` for valid `(nx, ny)` pairs; `queue` contains all tuples `(ncur, 0)` for valid `ncur` values. If the loop does not execute, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initial states.**
