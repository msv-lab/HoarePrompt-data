In the provided code snippet, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the tuple `(cur, piece)`. The initial values of `cur` and `piece` remain unchanged, while `ncur` is a value derived from the 2D array `A` using the coordinates `nx` and `ny`. 

The relevant variables impacted by the code execution are:
- `parent[0][ncur]` is updated to the tuple `(cur, piece)`.

The initial state that remains valid includes the existing conditions regarding `N`, `piece`, `cur`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` as described. Since the values of `cur` and `piece` do not change, and only `parent` is updated, the output state will reflect that change.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= `N` <= 10; `piece` is 0; `cur` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is `(cur, piece)`.**
