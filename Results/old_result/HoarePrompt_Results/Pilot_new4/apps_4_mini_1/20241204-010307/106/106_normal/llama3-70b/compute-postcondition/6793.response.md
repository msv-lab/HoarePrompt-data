Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 2; `nx` is `1 + dx`; `ny` is `2 + dy`; if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, and `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`; otherwise, no changes are made to the variables. If the condition is not met, there are no changes to any variables.***
