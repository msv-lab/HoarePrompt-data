Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `piece` is 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and the `queue` contains `(ncur, 1)` and `(ncur, 2)`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to be one more than `dist[2][cur]`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the tuple `(cur, piece)`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
