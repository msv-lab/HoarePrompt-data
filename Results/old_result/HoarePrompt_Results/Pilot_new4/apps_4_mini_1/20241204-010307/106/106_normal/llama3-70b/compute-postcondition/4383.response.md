Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `4 <= N <= 11`, `y` is equal to `N`, `A` is a valid two-dimensional array with sufficient dimensions to access `A[x][y]`, `cur` is defined, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `N + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 0, and the value of `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`.***
