The code snippet `queue.append((ncur, 0))` appends a tuple containing the value of `ncur` and `0` to the list `queue`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. The previous values of the affected variable are not explicitly mentioned, but `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]` and `0` is a constant. Therefore, the output state reflects that a new tuple has been added to `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `piece` remains unchanged at 0, `y` is 4, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to 5, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `queue` contains the previous tuples plus the new tuple `(ncur, 0)`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, 0)`**.
