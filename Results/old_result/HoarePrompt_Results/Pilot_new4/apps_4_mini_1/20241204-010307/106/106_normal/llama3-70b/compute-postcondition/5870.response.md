Given the initial state:

- `N` is between 3 and 10
- `y` is between 0 and 8 (inclusive)
- `dx` and `dy` take values from [(-2, -1), (-2, 1), (-1, -2), (-1, 2), (1, -2), (1, 2), (2, -1), (2, 1)]

Upon executing the code:

```
nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
```

We know that `nx` and `ny` are calculated based on the values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. However, we do not have specific values for `x`, `y`, `dx`, or `dy`. Therefore, the specific results for `nx` and `ny` will depend on the specific values chosen for `dx` and `dy` as well as the value of `x`.

- The value of `nx` will be `x + dx`, where `dx` can take any of the values from the set of tuples provided.
- The value of `ny` will be `y + dy`, where `dy` can also take any of the values from the same set.

Thus, without specific values for `x` and the chosen `dx`, and `dy`, we can only describe the relationships. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 0 and 8 (inclusive); `nx` is equal to `x + dx` where `dx` is from [(-2, -1), (-2, 1), (-1, -2), (-1, 2), (1, -2), (1, 2), (2, -1), (2, 1)]; `ny` is equal to `y + dy` where `dy` is from [(-2, -1), (-2, 1), (-1, -2), (-1, 2), (1, -2), (1, 2), (2, -1), (2, 1)].**
