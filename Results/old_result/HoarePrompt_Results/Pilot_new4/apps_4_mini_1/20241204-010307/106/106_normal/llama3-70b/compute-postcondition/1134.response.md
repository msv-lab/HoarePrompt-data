The code assigns a value to `dist[2][ncur]`, which is derived from the previous value of `dist[2][cur]` incremented by 1. The variable `ncur` is equal to `A[1][-1]`, but without knowing the specific values of `A` and `cur`, we can't determine their exact contributions to the state. However, we know that `dist[2][ncur]` changes based on the previous value of `dist[2][cur]`.

Since `dist[2][cur]` remains unchanged in this context, only `dist[2][ncur]` is updated. Other variables remain unchanged, so:

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `piece` is 2, `dx` is 0, `dy` is -1, `nx` is 1, `ny` is -1, `ncur` is equal to `A[1][-1]`, and `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1.**
