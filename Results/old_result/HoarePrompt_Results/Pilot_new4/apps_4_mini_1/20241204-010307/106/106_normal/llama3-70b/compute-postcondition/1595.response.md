The values of `nx` and `ny` are calculated based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The initial values of `y` is 0, and `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, so `nx` will change depending on the current value of `x`. The value of `ny` will be `0 + dy`, which means it will be equal to `dy`. 

The variables `N`, `A[nx][ny]`, and the relationships with `ncur` remain unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x + dx - 2`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, and `A[nx][ny]` is equal to `ncur` (if it were in bounds).**
