The code snippet adds a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The previous values of `ncur` and the `queue` itself are not given, but it can be inferred that the `queue` is a collection that holds tuples representing coordinates or states in the context of the program.

The variables affected directly by this operation are `queue`, which now includes a new element `(ncur, 1)`. The other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `0 + dy`, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is `cur`, `piece`, `queue` includes the element `(ncur, 1)`**
