The value of `dist[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `dist[2][cur] + 1`. Given that `dist[2][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, this implies that the condition holds true after the assignment. The other variables remain unchanged, including `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and `piece`. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is one of [-1, 1, 0, 0], `ny` is one of [1, 1, 0, 2], `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`**.
