Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 3 <= `N` <= 10, `piece` is 1, `nx` is `x + dx`, and `ny` is `y + dy`. If both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid defined by `N`, and if `piece` is 1 with `dist[1][ncur]` being greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.***
