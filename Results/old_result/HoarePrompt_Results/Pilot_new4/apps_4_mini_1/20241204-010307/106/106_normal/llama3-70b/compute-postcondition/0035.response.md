The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The value of `ncur` is previously defined as `A[nx][ny]`, which depends on the values of `nx` and `ny`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated state of the `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= `N` <= 10; `piece` is 0; `cur` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is `(cur, piece)`; `queue` now contains `(ncur, 0)`.**
