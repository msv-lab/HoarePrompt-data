In the given code snippet, `dist[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `dist[2][cur] + 1`. The variable `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, which implies that `ncur` is determined based on the values of `nx` and `ny`. The calculation influences the `dist` array but does not alter the other state variables.

The values of `dist[2][ncur]` now depend on the value of `dist[2][cur]`, which is incremented by 1. The values of `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and `cur` remain unchanged as a result of this operation.

Since `N` is between 3 and 10, `y` and `x` are between 1 and `N-2`, and `nx`, `ny` are between 0 and `N-2` or `N-1`, we do not have specific values for these variables, but we know their ranges.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 1 and `N-2`; `x` is between 1 and `N-2`; `nx` is between 0 and `N-2` or `N-1`; `ny` is between 0 and `N-2` or `N-1`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
