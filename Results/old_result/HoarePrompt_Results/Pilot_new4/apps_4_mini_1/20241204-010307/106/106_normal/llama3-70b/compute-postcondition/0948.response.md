According to the code, the for loop iterates over a list of tuples that represent the changes in the x and y coordinates. Each iteration assigns new values to `dx` and `dy`. The current values of `nx` and `ny` depend on `dx` and `dy`, and the following checks are performed. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know:
- `N` is between 3 and 10 (inclusive).
- `x` is 0.
- `y` is 1.
- `nx` is equal to `dx`, which means that `nx` will take values from the tuples.
- `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, which means that `ny` will also change based on the tuples.

The loop will execute four times, once for each tuple in the list. After the last iteration (the fourth one), the values of `dx` and `dy` would be (0, 1). 

For the loop to execute one more time, the next tuple in the list would need to be processed. Since the tuples are already exhausted after the fourth iteration, we simply move to the next iteration where `dx` and `dy` will be the first tuple again given that the loop is designed to cover all tuples.

Thus, after iterating through all values, the next iteration will again use the first tuple (-1, 0).

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` must be -1, `ny` must be 0**
