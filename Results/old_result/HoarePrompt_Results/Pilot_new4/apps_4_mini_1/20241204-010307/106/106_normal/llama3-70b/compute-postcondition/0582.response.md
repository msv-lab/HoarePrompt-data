The code updates the value at `dist[1][ncur]` to be equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`. Here, `dist[1][cur]` is unaffected in this execution. The value of `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][1]`, which is not affected by this code. Therefore, `dist[1][ncur]` will be updated based on its previous state plus one, but we have no specific values for `dist[1][cur]` or `dist[1][ncur]`. 

The other variables remain unchanged, but we do not know their specific values.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `piece` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is 1, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][1]`, and `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
