In the given code snippet, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The variables `nx` and `ny` are calculated as `x + dx` and `y + dy` respectively, but their specific values are not provided in the initial state. However, it is stated that `dist` contains valid distances for reachable indices and that `parent[0][ncur]` is initialized for valid `ncur`, which implies that `A[nx][ny]` is also valid.

Since `ncur` now holds the value derived from `A[nx][ny]`, we will update the state to reflect this change. The other variables remain unchanged, and we will retain the information that `dist` contains valid distances and that `parent[0][ncur]` is initialized for valid `ncur`.

Output State: **`dist` contains valid distances for reachable indices, `parent[0][ncur]` is initialized for valid `ncur`, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
