Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 2; `piece` is either 0 or 1; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, and `ny` is equal to `2 + dy` for each of the four directional tuples. The current value of `nx` is such that it is between 0 and N (exclusive) and the current value of `ny` is such that it is between 0 and N (exclusive).***
