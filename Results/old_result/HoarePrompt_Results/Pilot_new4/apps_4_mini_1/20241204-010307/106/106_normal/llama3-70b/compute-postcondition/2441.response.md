The variable `dist[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `dist[2][cur] + 1`. The value of `dist[2][cur]` remains unchanged, and since there are no specific values for `cur` or `ncur` mentioned, we know that `dist[2][ncur]` will now be one greater than whatever `dist[2][cur]` was. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 0; `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`; `nx` is `x + dx`; `ny` is `-1 + dy`; `piece` remains equal to 2; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur`; `queue` has appended the tuple `(ncur, 2)`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
