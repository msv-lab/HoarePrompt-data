The code updates the value of `dist[0][ncur]` to be equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`. The value of `ncur` is determined by the expression `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is equal to `dx` and `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` is not empty, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
