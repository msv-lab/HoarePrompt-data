The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned new values based on the calculations involving `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy`. The value of `nx` is updated to `x + dx`, and since `dx` is 0, this means `nx` remains the same as `x`. The value of `ny` is updated to `y + dy`, where `y` is equal to `N` and `dy` is 1, resulting in `ny` being `N + 1`. 

Since `N` is defined to be an integer in the range of 4 to 11, `ny` will therefore be in the range of 5 to 12. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `4 <= N <= 11`, `y` is equal to `N`, `A` is a valid two-dimensional array, `cur` is a valid position in `A`, `dist[1]` and `parent[1]` may remain unchanged, `queue` contains valid positions including (ncur, 2), `nx` is equal to `x`, `ny` is equal to `N + 1`, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x`, `ny` is equal to `N + 1` (where `5 <= ny <= 12`).**
