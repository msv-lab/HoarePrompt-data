The code snippet updates the `dist` array at the indices `[1][ncur]` by assigning it the value of `dist[1][cur] + 1`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Given the initial state, we know that `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, but we do not have specific values for `cur`, `A`, or `dist`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the changes made to the `dist` array based on the current values.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` contains tuples of (ncur, 0) and (ncur, 1), (dx, dy) is (-1, -1), `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y - 1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
