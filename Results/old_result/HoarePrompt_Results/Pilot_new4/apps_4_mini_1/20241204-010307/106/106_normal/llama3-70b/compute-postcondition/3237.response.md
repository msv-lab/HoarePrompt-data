The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The variable `ncur` is previously defined as `A[-1][0]`, and since no specific value for `A` is provided in the initial state, we cannot determine a specific value for `ncur`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is -1, `ny` is 0, `ncur = A[-1][0]`, `parent[2][ncur] = cur, piece`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`**.
