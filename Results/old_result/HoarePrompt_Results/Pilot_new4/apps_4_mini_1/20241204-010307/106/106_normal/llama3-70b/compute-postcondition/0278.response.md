The value of `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to be equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`. Given that `dist[0][ncur]` was initially greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, the code changes `dist[0][ncur]` to a new value that satisfies the condition based on the previous values of `dist[0][cur]` and `ncur`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `nx` is between 0 and `N - 1`, `ny` is between 0 and `N - 1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `dist[0][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
