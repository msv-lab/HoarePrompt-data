According to the code, the loop iterates over the tuples representing the changes in `x` and `y` coordinates given by `(-1, 0)`, `(1, 0)`, `(0, -1)`, and `(0, 1)`. At the end of the last iteration, `dx` and `dy` will correspond to the last tuple in the list, which in this case would be `(0, 1)`. 

The loop will execute for each of the four coordinate changes. Since the loop is controlled by the list of tuples and will iterate through each tuple in order, after the last execution of the loop body, the next iteration will utilize the first tuple again due to how the for loop structure works. 

Since `N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, and `y` is 2, the adjustments needed for the next iteration will remain unchanged for the loop as it is defined to process each tuple sequentially.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `nx` is `2 + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy` (for the first iteration, which would be `(-1, 0)` leading to `nx` as 1, `ny` as 2).**
