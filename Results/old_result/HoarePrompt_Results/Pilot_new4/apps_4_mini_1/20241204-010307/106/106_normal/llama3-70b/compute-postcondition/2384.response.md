According to the code, the loop iterates over a set of directional changes represented by the tuples `(-2, -1), (-2, 1), (-1, -2), (-1, 2), (1, -2), (1, 2), (2, -1), (2, 1)`. This means that for each iteration, `dx` and `dy` will take on the values of each of these tuples in sequence. 

At the end of the last iteration, `y` is 0, `x` is some integer within the bounds defined by `N`, and `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`. The loop has not yet iterated through all the directional changes. Since the loop is structured to execute for each of the 8 directional tuples, the loop will execute for a total of 8 iterations.

The state at the end of the previous iteration suggests that the last direction processed was determined by the last tuple in the list. To find the new state at the start of the next iteration, we need to know which tuple was processed last.

If we assume that the loop has completed processing the first `k` tuples, where `k` is less than 8, then for the next iteration, `dx` and `dy` will correspond to the `(k+1)`-th tuple. The next values of `dx` and `dy` depend on `k`.

If `k` is 7 (meaning all tuples have been processed), then there are no more tuples to process, and the loop will not execute again.

However, since we are required to explore the next state assuming there are still tuples left, let's consider `k` is at most 6. Thus, for the next iteration, if we are processing the 7th direction `(2, 1)`, then we need to adjust the state accordingly.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `dx` is 2, `dy` is 1**
