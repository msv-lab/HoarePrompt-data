The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[2][ncur]`. Since `cur` is a previously defined variable, it holds a specific value that corresponds to a reachable position, and `piece` is equal to 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The output state reflects this change.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 0; `dist` reflects the shortest distances for all reachable positions; `parent` indicates the predecessors for each reachable position, with `parent[2][ncur]` assigned the values of `cur` and `piece`; `queue` contains at least one tuple of a reachable position processed during the iterations; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is equal to 2; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
