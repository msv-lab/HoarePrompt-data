The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The value of `x` is currently `2`, and the value of `y` is `0`. However, the values of `dx` and `dy` are not specified in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `nx` and `ny` will be dependent on `dx` and `dy`.

Since `dx` and `dy` are not defined in the initial state, we cannot provide specific numeric values for `nx` and `ny`, but we can state how they are calculated.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `piece` is 1, `dist` is initialized to valid distances, `parent` is initialized to track valid paths, `queue` contains at least one valid `(ncur, 1)` pair; `nx` is `2 + dx`, `ny` is `0 + dy`.**
