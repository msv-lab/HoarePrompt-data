The code assigns the value of `cur` to `parent[0][ncur]` and the value of `piece` is also assigned to `parent[0][ncur]`. The variable `ncur` is equal to `A[-2][1]`, and `cur` is equal to `A[0][0]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` is not empty, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is -2, `ny` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is now equal to `cur` and `piece`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` is not empty, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is -2, `ny` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `ncur` is equal to `A[-2][1]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1,` and `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`.**
