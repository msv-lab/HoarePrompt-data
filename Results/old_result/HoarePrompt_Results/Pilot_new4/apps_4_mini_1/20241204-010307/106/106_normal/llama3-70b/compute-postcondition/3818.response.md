The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. This does not modify any existing variables but updates the state of the `queue` by adding a new element. 

The initial conditions still hold, so the output state remains consistent with the provided conditions. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `4 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`, `queue` now contains `(ncur, 1)`**
