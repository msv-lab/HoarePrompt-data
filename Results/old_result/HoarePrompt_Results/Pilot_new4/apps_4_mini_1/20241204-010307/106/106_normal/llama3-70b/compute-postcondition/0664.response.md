Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 1; `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 1; `nx` is `x - 1`; `ny` is 2. If both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of `0` and `N`, then if `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the values of `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. Otherwise, no changes are made. If either `nx` or `ny` is out of bounds, no changes are made.***
