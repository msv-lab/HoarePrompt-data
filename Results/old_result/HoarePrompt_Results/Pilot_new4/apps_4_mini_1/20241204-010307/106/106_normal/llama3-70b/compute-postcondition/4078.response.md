The values of `nx` and `ny` are updated based on the current values of `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy`. The calculations are as follows:

- `nx` is calculated as `x + dx`, which is `0 + (-1) = -1`.
- `ny` is calculated as `y + dy`, which is `1 + (-1) = 0`.

The other variable values remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is -1, `ny` is 0, and `ncur` is equal to `A[-1][2]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is -1, `ny` is 0, and `ncur` is equal to `A[-1][2]**.
