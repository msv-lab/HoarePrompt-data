Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is an integer in the range `[0, N-1]`. If `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur` for any `y`, then `dist` contains the updated shortest distances calculated from `cur` for all valid positions `ncur` reached from `(x, y)` based on the values of `piece`, `parent` reflects the previous states leading to each reachable `ncur`, and `queue` contains tuples of valid states where conditions were met. If the loop does not execute (i.e., if `A[x][y]` is not equal to `cur` for all `y`), then `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initial states.**
