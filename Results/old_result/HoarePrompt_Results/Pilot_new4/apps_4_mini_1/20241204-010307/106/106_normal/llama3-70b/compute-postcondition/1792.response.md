Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `dx` and `dy` have values from [(-2, -1), (-2, 1), (-1, -2), (-1, 2), (1, -2), (1, 2), (2, -1), (2, 1)], `piece` is either 0 or 1. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, `piece` is set to 1; if `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged. If the condition is not satisfied, no changes occur.***
