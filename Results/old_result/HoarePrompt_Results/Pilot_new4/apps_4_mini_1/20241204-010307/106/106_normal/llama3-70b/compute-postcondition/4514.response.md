The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned new values based on the current values of `x` and `y`, adjusted by the values of `dx` and `dy`. This means that `nx` will be equal to `x + dx` and `ny` will be equal to `y + dy`. The values of `N`, `y`, `A[x][0]`, `dist`, `parent`, `dx`, and `dy` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dist` and `parent` are valid and updated based on knight's moves, `dx` and `dy` are the second tuple in the list of possible moves, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`.**
