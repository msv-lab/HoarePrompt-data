Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is equal to `N`, `dist` has been updated for valid `ncur` positions where the condition `piece == 2` and `dist[2][ncur] > dist[2][cur] + 1` were met, `parent` has been updated for those same valid positions, `queue` contains tuples of `(ncur, 2)` for all valid positions processed during the loop execution, and if `piece` is not equal to `i`, `queue` now also includes the tuple `(cur, i)` where the current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`. If `piece` is equal to `i`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` retain their prior values.***
