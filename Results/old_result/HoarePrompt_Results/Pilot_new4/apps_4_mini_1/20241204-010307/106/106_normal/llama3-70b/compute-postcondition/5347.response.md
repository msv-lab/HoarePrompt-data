The value of `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The variables `nx` and `ny` are previously defined as `4 + dx` and `1 + dy`, respectively. Since `N` is between 4 and 10, the values of `nx` and `ny` remain within acceptable bounds due to the prior conditions stated in the initial state. Thus, `ncur` will be defined based on the specific values at the indices `nx` and `ny` in the array `A`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is 4; `y` is 1; `nx` is equal to `4 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[2][ncur]` and `parent[2][ncur]` are valid; `queue` contains applicable tuples including `(cur, i)` and `(ncur, 2)` if `piece` is not equal to `i`; the current value of `nx` is between 0 and N; and the current value of `ny` is between 0 and N.**
