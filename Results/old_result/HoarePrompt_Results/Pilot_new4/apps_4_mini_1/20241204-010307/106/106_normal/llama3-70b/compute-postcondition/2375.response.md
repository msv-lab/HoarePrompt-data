The code assigns values to `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. The values of `dx` and `dy` are derived from tuples in the list, but their specific values are not provided in the initial state. Thus, `nx` becomes `x + dx` and `ny` becomes `y + dy`. The dimensions of `N` and the specific values of `A[x][y]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`.**
