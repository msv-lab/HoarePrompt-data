The code assigns `cur` to `(2, ncur)` in the `parent` array for the specific values of `piece` and `ncur`. The values of the other variables (`N`, `x`, `y`, `dist`, `queue`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur`) remain unchanged in this execution as this line of code only modifies the `parent` variable.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 2; `y` is 0; `piece` is 2; `dist` is initialized to valid distances; `parent[2][ncur]` is updated to `cur` and `piece`; `queue` contains at least one valid `(ncur, 1)` pair; `nx` is `2 + dx`; `ny` is `0 + dy`; `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
