The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. Given that `nx` is equal to `x - 1` and `ny` is equal to `y + 1`, we can determine that `ncur` will be equal to the value located at the coordinates defined by `x - 1` for the row and `y + 1` for the column in the array `A`. 

The previous states of `N`, `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, and `ny` remain intact, with the only change being the assignment of a new value to `ncur`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is between 0 and `N-1`; `y` is between 0 and `N-1`; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is equal to `y + 1`; `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y + 1]`.**
