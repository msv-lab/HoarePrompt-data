Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` contains elements appended as `(ncur, 1)` for valid `(nx, ny)` positions, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is `dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, and `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The variable `piece` is equal to 2, the current value of `ncur` satisfies the condition that `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`.***
