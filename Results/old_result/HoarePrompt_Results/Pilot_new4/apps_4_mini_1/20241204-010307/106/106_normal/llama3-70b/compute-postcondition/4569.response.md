The code snippet `queue.append((ncur, 0))` adds the tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and the number `0` are unchanged; however, the `queue` is updated to include this new element.

The previous values of the affected variables are:
- `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 4][2]`
- `queue` is updated to include the tuple `(ncur, 0)`

Since `N` is constrained to values from 3 to 10, and other variables retain their state or are dependent on conditions that are not changed, the output state reflects the new inclusion in the `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 4`, `ny` is 2, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 4][2]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned `cur, piece`, and `queue` now includes `(ncur, 0)`**.
