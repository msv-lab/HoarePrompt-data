Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 0; if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is `A[x + 1][y]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur` positions based on the knight's moves; `parent[1][ncur]` contains tuples of `cur` and `piece` for those valid positions if `piece` is 1; if `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is updated to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` now contains `(ncur, 2)`; otherwise, no changes occur. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` is not satisfied, the state remains unchanged.***
