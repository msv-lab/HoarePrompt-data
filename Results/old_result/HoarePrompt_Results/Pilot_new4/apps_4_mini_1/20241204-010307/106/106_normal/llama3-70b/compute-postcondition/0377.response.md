According to the code, the for loop iterates over a set of tuples representing directional changes in `dx` and `dy`. The loop will continue to execute for each tuple in the list. The current state indicates that `dx` is -2 and `dy` is 1 at the end of the previous iteration. 

The loop contains a total of 8 directional changes, and since there are no other constraints indicated by the loop body that affect the iterating variables or terminate the loop, we can conclude that there are more iterations left. The next tuple in the sequence is (-1, -2), which means the values of `dx` and `dy` will be updated accordingly.

Thus, we need to adjust `dx` to -1 and `dy` to -2 for the start of the next iteration of the loop.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -2, `nx` is `x - 1`, and `ny` is 2. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur, piece`, and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`**
