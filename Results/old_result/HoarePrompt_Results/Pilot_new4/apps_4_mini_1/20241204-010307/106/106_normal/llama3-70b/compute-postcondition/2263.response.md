Postcondition: ***`piece` is 1, `(dx, dy)` is (1, 0), `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is `y`, and if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is `A[x + 1][y]`. If `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`. If the condition is not met, no changes occur.***
