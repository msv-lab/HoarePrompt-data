According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `y` which takes values from 0 to N-1, meaning it will execute N times. Since N is given as an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, the loop can execute as long as N meets this condition. The variable `y` starts at 0 at the beginning of the loop. 

To summarize, the conditions needed for the loop to execute are as follows:
- `N` must be between 3 and 10 inclusive, which is already satisfied by the given state.
- `y` will start from 0 and will be incremented with each iteration of the loop.

Thus, the necessary state adjustments before the loop starts are:

State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, `i` is 0, `x` is 0, `cur` is 1, `piece` is 0, `dist[0][1]` is 0, `dist` is a 2D list with 3 rows and (N * N + 1) columns initialized to float('inf'), `parent` is a 2D list with 3 rows and (N * N + 1) columns initialized to None, `queue` is empty, `y` is 0**
