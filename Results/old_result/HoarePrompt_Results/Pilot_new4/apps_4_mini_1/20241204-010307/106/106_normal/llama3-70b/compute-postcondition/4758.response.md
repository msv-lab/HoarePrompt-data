The code attempts to assign the value of `cur` and `piece` to the out-of-bounds index `ncur` in the `parent` array. Since `ncur` is an out-of-bounds access, this operation cannot be completed successfully. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is -2, `ny` is -1, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, and an out-of-bounds access was attempted for `ncur`.**
