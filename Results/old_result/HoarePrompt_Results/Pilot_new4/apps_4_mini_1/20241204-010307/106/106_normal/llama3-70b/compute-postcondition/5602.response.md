Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `dist[2][ncur]` represents the shortest distance from `cur` to each valid `ncur` that was reachable from `cur` with `piece` equal to 2, `parent[2][ncur]` contains the previous state `(cur, piece)` for each valid `ncur` reached, and `queue` contains all valid `(ncur, 2)` tuples generated during the loop iterations. The values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, and `A[0][0]` remain unchanged. If the loop executed, then the final states depend on the conditions for updating `dist` and `parent` based on the values of `dist[2][cur]` and valid neighbors defined by `A[nx][ny]`.**
