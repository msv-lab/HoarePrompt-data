According to the code, the for loop iterates over a predefined list of tuples representing directional movements. The loop will execute regardless of the values of `dist`, `parent`, and `queue`, as they are unchanged and do not affect the loop's execution. The variable `y` being set to `N` does not influence the loop either. Thus, the loop will run a fixed number of times (specifically, 8 times for each pair in the list).

Therefore, for the loop to execute, there are no specific requirements needed regarding the other states, only that the loop is capable of running through the defined pairs.

State: **`dist`, `parent`, and `queue` are unchanged; `y` is N, (dx, dy) will iterate through the pairs (-2, -1), (-2, 1), (-1, -2), (-1, 2), (1, -2), (1, 2), (2, -1), (2, 1)**
