The values of `nx` and `ny` are updated based on the expressions `x + dx` and `y + dy`. The initial conditions specify that `nx` and `ny` must be in the range `[0, N-1]`, and both `nx` and `ny` are recalculated using the values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. The states of `N`, `y`, `ncur`, and the conditions regarding the bounds remain valid.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is an integer less than `N`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, where `nx` and `ny` are updated to the new values based on `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`.**
