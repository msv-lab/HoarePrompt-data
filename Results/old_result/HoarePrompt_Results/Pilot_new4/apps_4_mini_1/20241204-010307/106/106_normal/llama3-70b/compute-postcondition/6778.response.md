According to the code, the loop iterates over a list of tuples representing the changes in coordinates `(dx, dy)`. Since there are four pairs of coordinates in the list, the loop will execute four times. 

At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 1 and `y` is 2. The `dx` and `dy` values will take on each of the four pairs in sequence. After this iteration, the loop will proceed to the next tuple in the list. In this case, since the loop has not yet executed for the third tuple `(1, -1)`, we need to prepare for that next iteration.

However, to understand the current state of `ncur`, `dist`, and `parent`, we note that they may have been updated during the last execution of the loop body. Here we are specifically looking for what values they have reached before the next iteration begins.

Assuming the last values for `ncur` and other parameters were updated during the last iteration, let's consider that they need to reflect the next operation that will occur. 

At the end of the previous iteration, we are ready to execute the next `(1, 1)` move. We will need to ensure the next values for `ncur` will be correctly calculated based on the previous values.

Thus, the state needs to reflect the unchanged values of `N`, `x`, and `y`, while indicating what the `dx` and `dy` will be in the next iteration.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `nx` is `1 + 1`, `ny` is `2 + 1`, `piece` is the same, `dist[0]`, `parent[0]`, and `ncur` are updated during the loop execution**
