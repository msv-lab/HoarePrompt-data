Postcondition: ***`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is between 0 and N-1, `y` is between 0 and N-1, `dist` is appropriately initialized, `parent` reflects valid parent tuples, `queue` contains valid tuples, `piece` is greater than 0, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `parent[2][ncur]` is updated to `(cur, piece)`, `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`, and `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
