According to the code, the for loop iterates over tuples `(dx, dy)` defined by the list `[(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]`. This means that there are four iterations in total for the values of `dx` and `dy`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we have:
- `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; 
- `y` is 1; 
- `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`; 
- `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; 
- `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`. 

The loop will execute again for the next tuple `(dx, dy)` in the list. After the last iteration, the current values of `(dx, dy)` would be at the end of the list. The loop has iterated over all four direction tuples. 

To prepare for the next iteration, we need to consider that the loop will not execute again because it has exhausted all elements in the list. Therefore, there is no further adjustment of states in terms of `dx` and `dy` as the loop has completed its iterations.

Hence, the final state reflects that the loop has finished iterating through all possible directions:

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 1; `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`; `dx` and `dy` have exhausted all tuples from the list.**
