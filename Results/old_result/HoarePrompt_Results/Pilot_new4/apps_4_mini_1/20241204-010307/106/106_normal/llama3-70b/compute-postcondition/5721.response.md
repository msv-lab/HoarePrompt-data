According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the values of `dx` and `dy`, which iterate through the given list of tuples. The loop will execute for each tuple, so no adjustments are needed for `dx` and `dy`. The loop iterates through the four pairs of values provided, indicating that it will run four times, once for each direction.

However, the execution of the loop body may depend on the state of the `dist`, `parent`, `piece`, and the conditions relating to the distance and the validity of the updated values. 

Given that `N` is between 3 and 10, and `queue` contains tuples of `(ncur, 0)`, the loop can execute without any direct adjustments to `N`, `queue`, or the specific `dx` and `dy` values.

However, we need to ensure that:
1. The `dist` array has been properly initialized and can hold the minimum distance values.
2. The `parent` array has been initialized to hold the values `(cur, piece)` for valid updates.
3. The variables `ncur`, `piece`, and the distances are set in such a way that the conditions for updating `dist` and `parent` can be satisfied within the loop.

Since `x` and `y` are fixed at 0 and 2 respectively and `nx` and `ny` are calculated as `dx` and `2 + dy`, it means that for each iteration of the loop, `nx` and `ny` will yield specific indices that need to be valid for the `dist` and `parent` updates.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` contains tuples of (ncur, 0), `dist` must be initialized for N values, `parent` must be initialized for N values, `piece` must be defined before the loop, `ncur` must be a valid index for `dist` and `parent` updates.**
