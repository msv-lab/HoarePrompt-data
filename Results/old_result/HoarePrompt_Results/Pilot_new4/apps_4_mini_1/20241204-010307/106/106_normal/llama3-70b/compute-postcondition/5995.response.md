The assignment `dist[1][ncur] = dist[1][cur] + 1` means that the value at `dist[1][ncur]` is set to the value of `dist[1][cur]` incremented by 1. 

From the initial state:
- `N` is greater than or equal to 9
- `y` is 9
- `dx` is -1
- `dy` is 1
- `nx` is equal to `x - 1`
- `ny` is 10
- `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`

The variable `dist[1][ncur]` is updated based on the value of `dist[1][cur]`. However, the specific values of `dist[1][cur]` and `dist[1][ncur]` are not provided in the initial state, so we can only express that `dist[1][ncur]` is now one greater than `dist[1][cur]`. 

The other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. 

Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 9, `y` is 9, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is 10, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
