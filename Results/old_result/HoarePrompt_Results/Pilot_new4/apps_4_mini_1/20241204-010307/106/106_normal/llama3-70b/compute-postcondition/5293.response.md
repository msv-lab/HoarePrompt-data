Postcondition: ***`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 0, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is 3, `ny` is -1, and `ncur` cannot be assigned a valid value due to out-of-range index `ny`. If `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`.***
