The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the list `queue`. The values of `ncur` and the integer `0` are added as an entry in `queue`. The initial state specifies values for other variables, but they remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State includes the unchanged conditions along with the new state of `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 2; `y` is 0; `nx` is `2 + dx`; `ny` is `0 + dy`; `piece` is 0; `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to be `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is now equal to `cur, piece`; `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`**.
