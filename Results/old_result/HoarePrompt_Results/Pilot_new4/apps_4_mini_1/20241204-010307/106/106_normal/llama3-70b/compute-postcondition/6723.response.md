The code assigns two values to the `parent` array at the indices `[2][ncur]`. The specific values being assigned are `cur` and `piece`, which are not specified in the initial state but are expected to be valid variables. The initial state of `N`, `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, and `ny` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 1; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 0; `nx` is 0; `ny` is 1; `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to be equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `cur`, `piece`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 1; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 0; `nx` is 0; `ny` is 1; `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to be equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `cur`, `piece`.**
