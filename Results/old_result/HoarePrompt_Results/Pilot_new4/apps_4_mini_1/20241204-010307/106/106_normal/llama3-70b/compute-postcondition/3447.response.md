Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `A[1][0]` equals `cur`, `dist[0]` is updated for all valid `ncur` positions reachable from `(1, 0)` based on the knight's movement rules, `parent[0]` is set accordingly for those positions, and `queue` contains tuples of all valid `ncur` positions along with `0` for piece, while distances from `dist[0][cur]` reflect the minimum steps required to reach each position from `(1, 0)`; if no positions are reachable, `dist` and `parent` remain unchanged.**
