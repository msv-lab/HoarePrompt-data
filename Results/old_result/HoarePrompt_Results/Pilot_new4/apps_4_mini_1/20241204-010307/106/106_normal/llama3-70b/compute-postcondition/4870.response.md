The code snippet updates the value of `dist[1][ncur]`. It is assigned the value of `dist[1][cur] + 1`. The previous values of `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`. The other variables `N`, `nx`, `ny`, and `cur` are not affected by the execution of this code. 

Since `ncur` is determined by the values of `nx` and `ny`, the overall condition remains that `N` is between 3 and 10, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. 

The output state reflects these unchanged variables and includes the update in the `dist` array.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
