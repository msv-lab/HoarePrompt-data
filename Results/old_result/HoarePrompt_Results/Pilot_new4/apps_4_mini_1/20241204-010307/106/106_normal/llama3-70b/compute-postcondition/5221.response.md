Postcondition: ***`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is between 0 and `N-1`; `y` is between 1 and `N-1`; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is equal to `y + 1`; if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y + 1]`; if `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `queue` contains `(ncur, 1)`; otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
