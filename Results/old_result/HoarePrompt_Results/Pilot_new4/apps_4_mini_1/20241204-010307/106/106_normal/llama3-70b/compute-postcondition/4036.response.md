Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is -2, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is the value of `A[nx][ny]`, and the conditions `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` remain valid. The variable `piece` is 0, and the current value of `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`.***
