The value of `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is equal to `x + dx` and `ny` is equal to `y + dy`. Since both `nx` and `ny` are within the range 0 to N (inclusive of 0 and exclusive of N), the assignment of `ncur` will succeed without any issues related to index out of bounds. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 3 and 10, `x` is greater than 1 and less than `N - 1`, `y` has been updated to `y + dy`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the range 0 to N (inclusive of 0 and exclusive of N), and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
