The code snippet assigns a value to `parent[2][ncur]`. The variable `ncur` holds a value from the matrix `A` at coordinates `[1][2]`. The variable `cur` is also used in the assignment, but its value is not specified in the initial state. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 2, `ncur` is equal to `A[1][2]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`.**
