Postcondition: ***`dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged if the loop did not execute. If `piece` is not equal to `i`, then `dist[2][ncur]` contains the updated distances for valid `ncur` indices, `parent[2][ncur]` reflects the last valid `(cur, piece)` pair for those `ncur`, `queue` contains all valid tuples of `(ncur, 2)` appended during the iterations, and now additionally includes the tuple `(cur, i)`.***
