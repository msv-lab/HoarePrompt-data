The value of `ncur` is assigned from the 2D array `A` at the indices `(nx, ny)`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are calculated as `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively, and we know that they satisfy the conditions 0 <= `nx` < `N` and 0 <= `ny` < `N`. Thus, `ncur` will take a value from the array `A`, which depends on the current values of `nx` and `ny`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` contains all valid `(ncur, 0)` tuples, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated for each valid `ncur`, `parent[0][ncur]` corresponds to the respective `cur` and `piece`, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
