Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is between 0 and `N-1`; `y` is between 0 and `N-1`; `nx` and `ny` are not defined; if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to be `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`. There is no else part to consider.***
