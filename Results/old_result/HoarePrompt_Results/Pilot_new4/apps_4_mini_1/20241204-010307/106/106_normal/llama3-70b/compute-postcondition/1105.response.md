The variables `dx` and `dy` are not defined in the initial state, but they are expected to be the changes in `x` and `y`, respectively, that are being added to the current values of `x` and `y`.

Assuming that `dx` and `dy` are defined somewhere else before this line of code, let's denote them for the sake of the output. 

Let's analyze the impact of the code:

1. `nx` is updated to `x + dx`. Given that `x` is currently `1`, the new value of `nx` will depend on the value of `dx`.
2. `ny` is updated to `y + dy`. Given that `y` is currently `0`, the new value of `ny` will depend on the value of `dy`.

The initial state does not provide specific values for `dx` and `dy`, so we cannot compute specific numerical values for `nx` and `ny`. Instead, we can express `nx` and `ny` in terms of `dx` and `dy`.

After running the code, the states of the variables will be updated as follows:

- `N` is between 3 and 10
- `x` is 1
- `y` is 0
- `piece` is 1
- `dist` remains unchanged
- `parent` remains unchanged
- `queue` remains unchanged
- `nx` is equal to `1 + dx`
- `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`
- `ncur` is equal to `A[2][1]`
- index for tuple is 0 for (-1, -1)

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; `piece` is 1; `dist` remains unchanged; `parent` remains unchanged; `queue` remains unchanged; `nx` is equal to `1 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[2][1]`; index for tuple is 0 for (-1, -1)**.
