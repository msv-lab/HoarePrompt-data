Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is -2, `ny` is -1; `ncur` assignment is invalid due to out-of-bounds indices; the current value of `piece` is 0; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1` (since `dist[0][ncur]` is updated).**
