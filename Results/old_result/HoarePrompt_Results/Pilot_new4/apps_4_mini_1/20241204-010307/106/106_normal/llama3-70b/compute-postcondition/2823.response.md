Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `piece` is equal to `0`, if `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`; `dist[2]` holds the shortest distances, and `parent[2]` indicates the predecessors.***
