Postcondition: ***If `nx` and `ny` are both within the range of 0 and `N` (exclusive), then `ncur` is set to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` equals 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, the program makes no changes.***
