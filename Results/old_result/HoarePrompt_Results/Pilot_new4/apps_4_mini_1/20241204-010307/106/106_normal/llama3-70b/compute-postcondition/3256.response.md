According to the code, the loop iterates over the list of tuples representing the changes in coordinates `(dx, dy)`. The loop will execute for each tuple in the list until all tuples have been processed. 

At the end of the last iteration, the current states are:
- `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`,
- `x` is 0,
- `y` is 1,
- `nx` is equal to `x + dx`,
- `ny` is equal to `y + dy`.

The loop will execute again for the next tuple in the list. Since there are 8 tuples in the provided list of coordinate changes, we need to keep track of how many tuples have already been processed. 

If we assume the loop has just processed the last tuple `(2, 1)`, which would correspond to the eighth iteration, the next state will move to the first tuple again.

In this case, after processing the last tuple `(2, 1)`, we need to restart from the first tuple `(-2, -1)` for the next iteration. 

Therefore, the adjusted states for the next loop iteration will be:
- `dx` will be `-2` and `dy` will be `-1`.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `0 - 2`, `ny` is equal to `1 - 1` (which calculates to `nx` equals `-2` and `ny` equals `0`).**
