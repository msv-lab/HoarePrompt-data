Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is one of [-1, 1, 0, 0], `ny` is one of [1, 1, 0, 2], `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and if `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, 2)`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`; otherwise, no changes are made.***
