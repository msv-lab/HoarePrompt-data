The variable `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the tuple `cur` and `piece`. The values of `ncur`, `cur`, and `piece` are used in this assignment, but their specific values are not provided in the initial state. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 0; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is 1; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1; parent[1][ncur]` is now assigned the tuple `(cur, piece)`**.
