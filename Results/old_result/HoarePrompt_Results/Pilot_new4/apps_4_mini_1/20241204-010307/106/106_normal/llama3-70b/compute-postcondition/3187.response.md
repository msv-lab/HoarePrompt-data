According to the code, the loop iterates over the pairs of changes in coordinates represented by `dx` and `dy`. Since the loop is based on the list `[(−1,−1), (−1,1), (1,−1), (1,1)]`, this means the loop will execute regardless of the current states of `N`, `x`, `y`, `cur`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue`. 

Thus, for the loop to execute, there are no specific conditions based on the provided state that need to be adjusted. The loop is independent of the values of `N`, `x`, `y`, and other variables as they do not affect the execution of the loop itself. 

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur` reachable from `(x, y)` based on the knight's moves, `parent[0][ncur]` is established for those reachable positions, and `queue` contains tuples `(ncur, 0)` for each valid `ncur` that met the conditions.**
