The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned new values based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. Initially, `x` is 0 and `y` is 1, with `dx` set to 0 and `dy` set to 1. As a result, `nx` becomes `0 + 0 = 0` and `ny` becomes `1 + 1 = 2`. The other variables retain their prior values, so the updated states reflect the new values of `nx` and `ny`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is 0, `ny` is 2, `dist[1]` reflects the shortest distance relevant to the moves, `parent[1]` reflects the current parent node relevant to the moves, and `queue` contains at least one valid `(ncur, 1)` tuple.**
