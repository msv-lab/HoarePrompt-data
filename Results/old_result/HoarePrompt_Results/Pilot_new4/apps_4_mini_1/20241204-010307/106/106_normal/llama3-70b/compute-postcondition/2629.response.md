Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is an integer less than `N`, and if `piece` is not equal to `i`, then `dist[2][ncur]` contains the updated minimum distances from `cur` to each valid `ncur` position for all reachable positions, `parent[2][ncur]` indicates the parent positions and pieces leading to each `ncur`, and `queue` now contains the previously reachable tuples along with the new tuple `(cur, i)`. If the `if` condition does not hold, the values of `dist[2]`, `parent[2]`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initial states.***
