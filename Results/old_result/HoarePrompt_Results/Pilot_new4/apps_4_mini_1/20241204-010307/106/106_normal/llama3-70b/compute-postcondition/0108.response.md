According to the code, the loop iterates over the defined pairs of `(dx, dy)` in the list. The loop will execute a total of 8 times since there are 8 pairs. 

At the end of the last iteration, we don't have information about which pair was last used, and the variables `nx` and `ny` are based on the last values of `dx` and `dy`. The loop will proceed to the next pair in the list for the next iteration. 

Assuming the last pair processed was the one corresponding to `dx` and `dy`, we need to increment the index of the current iteration within the list of pairs. Since the loop processes all pairs in order, if the last pair was the eighth one, the loop cannot execute again because there are no more pairs.

Given that `N` is an integer within the range stated, `y` equals `N`, and the values of `nx` and `ny` depend on the last used `dx` and `dy`, we must ensure that `nx` and `ny` remain within the specified bounds.

Since the specific values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided in the problem statement, we can say for the loop to execute again, it must be at the start of the iteration with the next `(dx, dy)` pair.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` equals `N`, `ny` equals `N + dy`, `nx` equals `x + dx`, and both `nx` and `ny` must remain between 0 and N (exclusive), and `piece` is equal to 0, `ncur` and `cur` have their respective values from the previous iteration.**
