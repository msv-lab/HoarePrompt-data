The value of `ncur` is assigned based on the value located at the two-dimensional array `A` at the indices `[nx][ny]`. The variables `nx` and `ny` are previously calculated, where `nx` is equal to `x - 1` and `ny` is equal to `0 + 1`. The exact values of `nx` and `ny` depend on `x`, which is not provided, but they are both now defined and valid for the context.

The states of the other variables (`N`, `y`, `dist`, `parent[1][ncur]`, `piece`, `dx`, `dy`) remain unchanged, as their values are not directly affected by this assignment operation.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `dist` indicates at least one reachable position, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `piece` is equal to 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `0 + 1`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
