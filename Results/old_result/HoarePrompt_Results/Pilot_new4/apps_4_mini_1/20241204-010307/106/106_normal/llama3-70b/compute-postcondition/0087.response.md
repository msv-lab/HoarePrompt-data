The statement `dist[2][ncur] = dist[2][cur] + 1` assigns a new value to `dist[2][ncur]`. The value is calculated based on `dist[2][cur]`, which is incremented by 1. The variable `ncur` has been defined as `A[nx][ny]`, and `cur` is assumed to be defined previously. However, the specific values of `ncur` and `cur` are not provided in the initial state, therefore, we cannot determine their specific values.

The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State should reflect the change in the `dist` array, showing that the value at `dist[2][ncur]` has been updated based on `dist[2][cur]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `piece` is 2; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
