The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `piece` are not changed by this operation. The other variables remain unchanged as well. The output state will reflect that the `queue` now includes the new element.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `piece` is 2, `dx` is 0, `dy` is -1, `nx` is 0, `ny` is 1, `ncur` is equal to `A[0][1]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` now includes the element `(ncur, 2)`**.
