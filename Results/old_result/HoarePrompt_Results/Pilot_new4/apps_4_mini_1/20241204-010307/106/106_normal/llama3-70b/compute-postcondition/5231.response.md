Postcondition: ***`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 1 and `N-1`, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `ncur` is the value at `A[nx][ny]`, and if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is not greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is now `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`.***
