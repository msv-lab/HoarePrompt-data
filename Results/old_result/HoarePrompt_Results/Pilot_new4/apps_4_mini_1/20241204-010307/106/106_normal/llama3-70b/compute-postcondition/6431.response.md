According to the code, the for loop will execute once for each tuple in the list `[(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]`. Since this list contains exactly 4 tuples, the loop has already executed 4 times, once for each tuple. The loop's execution depends on there being more tuples in the list. 

At the end of the last iteration, the loop has completed its 4 iterations using the tuples. Since there are no additional tuples left in the list for the loop to process, it cannot execute again.

Therefore, the states do not change because the loop will not execute again, and all existing state values remain unchanged.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is -1 or 1, `ny` is 0 or 2, `dist[0]` reflects the shortest distances calculated, `parent[0]` reflects the parents of the nodes, `queue` may contain valid `(ncur, 0)` tuples, and `dx` and `dy` take on values from [(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]**
