The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The current values of `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the array, so `ncur` will take on a value from the `A` array based on valid indices. The states of the other variables are not affected, and since `N` is between 3 and 10, `nx` and `ny` will also fall within the appropriate range for indexing into `A`. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `dist` arrays are initialized, `parent` arrays are initialized, `queue` contains valid moves processed during the loop, the current value of `A[1][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` and `dy` set for 8 iterations; `nx` is `1 + dx[i]`, `ny` is `0 + dy[i]` for each iteration `i`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`**.
