The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned new values based on the calculations from `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy`. Specifically, `nx` is calculated as `x + dx` and `ny` is calculated as `y + dy`. 

Given that `dx` is -1 and `dy` is -2, we can express `nx` and `ny` as:
- `nx = x - 1` (since `dx` is -1)
- `ny = 9 - 2 = 7` (since `y` is 9 and `dy` is -2)

The values of `N`, `y`, and the other variables (`dx`, `dy`) remain unaffected. Since `N` is greater than or equal to 9, it will still be valid after the execution.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is greater than or equal to 9, `y` is 9, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -2, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is 7.

Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 9; `y` is 9; `dx` is -1; `dy` is -2; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is 7.**
