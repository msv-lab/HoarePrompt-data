The variable `ncur` is assigned the value from the 2D array `A` at the indices `[nx][ny]`. The current values of `nx` and `ny` are `1` and `0`, respectively. The value of `N` does not affect this operation directly since it is not used in the assignment.

Since `nx` is `1` and `ny` is `0`, we can express `ncur` as `A[1][0]`, but we do not know the specific value of `A[1][0]` as it depends on the contents of the array `A`. Therefore, we cannot assign a specific value to `ncur`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 2; `y` is 1; `nx` is 1; `ny` is 0; `dx` is -1; `dy` is -1; `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[1][0]`.**
