The statement `queue.append((ncur, 1))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The values of other variables are not changed by this operation, and the state of `queue` is impacted by appending the new tuple. 

Output State: **`N` is greater than 3 and less than or equal to 10, `y` is 2, `piece` is 1, `x` is at least 1, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `dist[1][ncur]` is no longer greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, 1)`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`.**
