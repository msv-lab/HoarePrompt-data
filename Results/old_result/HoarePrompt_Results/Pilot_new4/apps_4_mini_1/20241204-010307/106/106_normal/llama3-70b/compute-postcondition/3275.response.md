Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `nx` is `0 + dx`; `ny` is `1 + dy`; `dist[0]` contains the shortest distances from `(x, y)`; `parent[0]` contains the parent positions; `queue` contains potential positions to explore. The current values of `nx` and `ny` satisfy the condition `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`.***
