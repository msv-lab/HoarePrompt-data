Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, if `piece` is not equal to `i`, then `dist[2][ncur]` contains the minimum distances for all reachable `ncur` positions from the current position `(x, y)` based on valid knight moves, `parent[2][ncur]` stores the associated parent positions for each updated `ncur`, and `queue` contains all tuples `(ncur, 2)` along with the newly added tuple `(cur, i)`. If `piece` is equal to `i`, then `dist[2]`, `parent[2]`, and `queue` remain unchanged.***
