The code assigns the value of `cur` to `parent[2][ncur]` and also assigns `piece`. The variables `N`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and `dist` remain unaffected. The output state will reflect the unchanged values while noting that `parent[2][ncur]` has been updated to `cur` and `piece`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `dx` is 0, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x`, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[x][0]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`.**
