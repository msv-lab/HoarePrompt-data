The line of code `parent[2][ncur] = cur, piece` updates the `parent` array at the position `[2][ncur]` to hold the value of `cur` along with `piece`. The specifics of `cur` and `piece` are not defined in the initial state, but we know that `piece` is equal to 2. The previous state of the other relevant variables remains valid.

Thus, after executing the code, the updated value in `parent[2][ncur]` will reflect this relationship involving `cur` and the constant `piece`.

Output State: **`dist[1]` contains the shortest distances based on valid moves; `parent[1]` indicates the relationship for each reachable position; `queue` holds tuples for positions added during the loop; `nx` is `x + dx`; `ny` is `y + dy`; `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is 2; `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1; parent[2][ncur]` is assigned a tuple `(cur, 2)`**.
