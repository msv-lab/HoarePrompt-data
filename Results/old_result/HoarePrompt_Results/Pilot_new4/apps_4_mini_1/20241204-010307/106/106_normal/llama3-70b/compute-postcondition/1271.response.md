The code assigns the value of `dist[1][cur] + 1` to `dist[1][ncur]`. The value of `cur` remains unchanged, while `ncur` is already specified as `A[0][3]`. We know that `dist[1][cur]` is based on the previous distance at `cur`, and we add 1 to it to obtain the new distance at `ncur`. Given that `N` is between 3 and 10, the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `cur` is unchanged, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `dist[0]` contains the updated distances for reachable positions, `parent[0]` reflects the paths taken, `queue` contains tuples of all updated positions, `piece` is 1, `nx` is 0, `ny` is 3, `ncur` is `A[0][3]`.**
