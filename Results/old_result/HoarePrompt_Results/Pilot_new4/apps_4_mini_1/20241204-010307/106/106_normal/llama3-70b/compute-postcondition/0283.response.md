According to the code, the loop iterates over a list of tuples representing possible movements `(dx, dy)`. Since there are eight tuples in this list, the loop will execute a total of eight times. 

At the end of the last iteration, `y` is 0, and the first iteration would have consumed the first tuple `(-2, -1)`. If we consider that the first tuple is processed, then on the next iteration, the second tuple `(-2, 1)` will be processed.

The loop continues until all tuples have been processed. At the end of the last iteration, it will check if there are more tuples to process. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the state to reflect the next tuple being executed.

The current index of the tuple can be represented by a zero-based index which will be 1 for the next execution (the second tuple).

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, if `nx` is between 0 and `N - 1` and `ny` is between 0 and `N - 1`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and the next tuple `(-2, 1)` is being processed.**
