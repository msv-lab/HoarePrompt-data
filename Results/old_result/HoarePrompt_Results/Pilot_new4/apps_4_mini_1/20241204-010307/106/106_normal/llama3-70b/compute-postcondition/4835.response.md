The statement `dist[0][ncur] = dist[0][cur] + 1` updates the value in the `dist` array at index `[0][ncur]`. The value assigned is the current value at `dist[0][cur]` incremented by 1. The variables `ncur`, `dist`, and the current value at `dist[0][cur]` are affected by this line of code.

1. The variable `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, but its specific value is not provided, so we will keep it as is.
2. The value of `dist[0][ncur]` will be updated to the value of `dist[0][cur] + 1` but we do not know the specific values of `dist[0][cur]` or `dist[0][ncur]`.

Since the exact values of `dist[0][cur]`, `dist[0][ncur]`, and `A[nx][ny]` are not provided, we cannot specify their new values. However, we know that `dist[0][ncur]` is now one more than `dist[0][cur]`.

The output state accounts for the fact that the value of `dist[0][ncur]` is now updated but does not specify exact numerical results due to unknown variables.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is the original x position; `y` is the original y position + 1; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
