To analyze the provided code, we note that it assigns new values to `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x` and `y` along with a defined move from the list of valid moves. Since the values for `dx` and `dy` are not specified in the initial state, we need to assume they are taken from one of the valid moves. 

Assuming we use the first move from the list, which is `(-1, 0)`, we can proceed to compute the new values of `nx` and `ny`:

1. The initial value of `x` is in the range `0 <= x < N` (hence `x` is a non-negative integer less than `N`).
2. The initial value of `y` is `1`.
3. The values of `dx` and `dy` are `-1` and `0`, respectively.

Calculating the new values:
- `nx = x + dx` => `nx = x + (-1)` => `nx = x - 1`
- `ny = y + dy` => `ny = 1 + 0` => `ny = 1`

Since `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, after the operation, `nx` will be `x - 1`. Given that `x` is non-negative, `nx` can be `-1` or any integer less than `N - 1`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is 1**.
