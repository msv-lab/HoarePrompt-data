According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `y` compared to `N`. The loop executes for values of `y` starting from 0 up to `N - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is equal to `N`, which means it has reached the upper limit of the specified range.

To allow for the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be increased by 1. Since `y` is currently equal to `N`, we cannot increase it further without exceeding the range. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `N` must be modified to allow for `y` to reach `N + 1`.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `4 <= N <= 11`, `y` is equal to `N`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` retain their prior values.**
