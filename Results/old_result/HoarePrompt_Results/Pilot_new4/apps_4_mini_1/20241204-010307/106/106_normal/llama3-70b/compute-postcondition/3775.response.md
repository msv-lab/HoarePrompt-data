The code appends a tuple containing `ncur` and `0` to the `queue`. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged, and no other variables are directly impacted by this operation. The value of `ncur` is derived from previous operations but is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, my output will reflect the operation's result without changing the values of other variables.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `nx` is updated based on the selected tuple, `ny` is updated based on the selected tuple, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the values of `cur` and `piece`, and the tuple `(ncur, 0)` is appended to `queue`.**
