The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The values of the variables `ncur` and `queue` are directly impacted by this operation. The other variables remain unchanged in their respective states.

- `N` is between 3 and 10.
- `x` is between 0 and `N-1`.
- `y` is between 0 and `N-1`.
- `dx` is -1.
- `dy` is 1.
- `nx` is equal to `x - 1`.
- `ny` is equal to `y + 1`.
- `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y + 1]`.
- `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.
- `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`.
- `queue` now includes the new tuple `(ncur, 1)`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is between 0 and `N-1`; `y` is between 0 and `N-1`; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is equal to `y + 1`; `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y + 1]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`; `queue` includes `(ncur, 1)`.**
