Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 2; `y` is 2; `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`; if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is updated to `A[nx][ny]`; if `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the values of `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` now contains `(ncur, 1)`; otherwise, no changes are made. If `nx` or `ny` is out of bounds (not satisfying `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`), then no operations are performed.***
