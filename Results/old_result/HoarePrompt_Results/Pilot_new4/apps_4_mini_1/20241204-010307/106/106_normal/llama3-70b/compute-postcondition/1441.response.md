Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `nx` is 2 + `dx`, `ny` is 1 + `dy`, `dist[0]` contains the minimum distances from the starting position to each reachable cell in the grid, `parent[0]` contains the parent information for each reachable cell, `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)` if `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, otherwise `queue` remains empty; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and if `piece` is 1, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`.***
