Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `dx` and `dy` take on values from [(-2, -1), (-2, 1), (-1, -2), (-1, 2), (1, -2), (1, 2), (2, -1), (2, 1)], `piece` is 0, `x` is such that `nx = x + dx` and `ny = 2 + dy`, `ncur` is defined based on valid `nx` and `ny`. The current values of `nx` and `ny` are such that 0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N.***
