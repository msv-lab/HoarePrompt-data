Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 0; `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`; `nx` is `x + dx`; `ny` is `dy`; `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`; if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur`, `piece` remains equal to 2, and `queue` has appended the tuple `(ncur, 2)`. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
