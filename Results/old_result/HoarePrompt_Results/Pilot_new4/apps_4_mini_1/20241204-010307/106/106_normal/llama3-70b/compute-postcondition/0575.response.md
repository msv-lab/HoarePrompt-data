The code `parent[1][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns `cur` and `piece` to the `parent` array at the indices `[1][ncur]`. The state of other variables remains unchanged. 

- `ncur` is previously defined as `A[x - 1][-1]`, which is an element from a 2-dimensional array `A`. 
- `piece` has a value of 1, and `cur` is not defined in the initial state but is used in the assignment.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the assignment to `parent` while maintaining the other variable states.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `piece` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is -1, `ncur` is `A[x - 1][-1]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the values `cur` and `piece`.**
