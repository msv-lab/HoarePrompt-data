The code snippet `queue.append((ncur, 0))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The state of other variables remains unchanged except for the `queue`, which now includes the new tuple.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `cur` is the same as before, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `dist` is updated for all reachable positions based on conditions, `piece` is 0, `parent[0][ncur]` is `cur, piece`, `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`**.
