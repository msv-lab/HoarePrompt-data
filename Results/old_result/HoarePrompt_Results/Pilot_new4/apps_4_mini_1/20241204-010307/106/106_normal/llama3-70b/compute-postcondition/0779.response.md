The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned new values based on the expressions `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The value of `x` is in the range `0 <= x < N`, and `y` can either be `2 or 3`. The state of `dx` and `dy` is not provided, but they will influence the new values of `nx` and `ny`. 

The previous values of `nx` and `ny` are `x + (-1)` and `y + 1 + 0`, respectively. However, the exact calculations for `nx` and `ny` cannot be determined without knowing the current values of `dx` and `dy`. Thus, we can conclude that `nx` and `ny` will now change according to the new values based on `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is `2 or 3`; `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`.**
