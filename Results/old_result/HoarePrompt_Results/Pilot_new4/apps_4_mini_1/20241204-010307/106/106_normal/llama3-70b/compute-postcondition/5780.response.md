According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `x` and the value of `N`. Since `x` is currently 0 and `N` is between 3 and 10, the loop can execute again. In the next iteration, `x` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `x` needs to be 1.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` is not empty, `x` is 1, `dist` is updated to reflect the minimum distances from `cur` for all valid `ncur`, `parent` is updated to store the previous states `(cur, piece)` for each valid `ncur`, and `queue` contains all tuples of `(ncur, piece)` for which the distance conditions were satisfied throughout all iterations.**
