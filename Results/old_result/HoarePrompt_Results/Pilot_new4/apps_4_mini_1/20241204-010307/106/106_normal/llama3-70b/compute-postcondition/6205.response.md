The statement `dist[2][ncur] = dist[2][cur] + 1` indicates that we are updating the value of `dist[2][ncur]` based on the current value of `dist[2][cur]` incremented by 1. However, the initial state does not provide specific values for `dist`, `cur`, or `ncur`. Thus, we assume `dist` is a matrix and `cur` is an index.

Given that:

- `N` is between 3 and 10 (this remains unchanged).
- `y` is 1 (this remains unchanged).
- `dx` is 0 (this remains unchanged).
- `dy` is -1 (this remains unchanged).
- `nx` is equal to `x` (this remains unchanged).
- `ny` is 0 (this remains unchanged).
- `ncur` is equal to `A[x][0]` (this remains unchanged).

The code will change the value of `dist[2][ncur]`. The preconditions related to `dist`, `cur`, and `ncur` do not change, as we don't have specific values to evaluate further.

Since `dist[2][cur]` is involved in updating `dist[2][ncur]`, we note that `dist[2][ncur]` will now be equal to the previous value of `dist[2][cur]` plus 1. However, without knowing specific values, we can't specify exact new values. 

Thus, the Output State after execution of the code is as follows:

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `dx` is 0, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x`, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[x][0]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
