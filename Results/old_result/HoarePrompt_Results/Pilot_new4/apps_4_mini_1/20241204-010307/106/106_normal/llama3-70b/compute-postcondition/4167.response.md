The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[1][ncur]`. The variable `ncur` holds the value `A[1][1]`, but the specific value of `cur` and `piece` is not given. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 1, `dx` is 1, `dy` is -1, `ncur` is `A[1][1]`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur` and `piece`.**
