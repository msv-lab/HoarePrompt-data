The code updates the value at `dist[0][ncur]` to be `dist[0][cur] + 1`. The initial conditions specify that `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur` and `A[nx][ny]` is equal to `ncur`. Therefore, the value being assigned to `dist[0][ncur]` will depend on the previous value of `dist[0][cur]`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `x + dx` is within the bounds of `A`, `y + dy` is within the bounds of `A`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
