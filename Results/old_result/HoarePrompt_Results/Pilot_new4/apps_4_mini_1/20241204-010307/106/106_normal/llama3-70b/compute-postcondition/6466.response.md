According to the code, the for loop iterates over a list of tuples representing directional movements, specifically `dx` and `dy`. The variable `dx` and `dy` will take on values from `(-1, 0)`, `(1, 0)`, `(0, -1)`, and `(0, 1)` for each iteration of the loop. 

At the end of the last iteration, `dx` and `dy` will have taken the values from the first three tuples in the iteration, and `dx` and `dy` will be equal to `(0, 1)` after the third iteration. The loop will continue for each of the four tuples.

After this iteration, we need to set `dx` and `dy` to the next tuple in the list. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration of the loop, `dx` and `dy` will take the values from the last tuple in the list, which is `(0, 1)`.

Since the loop should execute again and there are no constraints on `dx` and `dy` affecting the loop execution itself, the only thing that needs to be updated is the values of `dx` and `dy`.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is 0, `ny` is 2, and `ncur` is `A[0][2]`, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 1**
