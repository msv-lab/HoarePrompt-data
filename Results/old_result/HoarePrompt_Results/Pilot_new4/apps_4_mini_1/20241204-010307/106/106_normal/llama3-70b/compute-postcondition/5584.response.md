Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, 2)`, and `(ncur, 2)` is added to the `queue`. The values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, and `A[0][0]` remain unchanged, while `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.***
