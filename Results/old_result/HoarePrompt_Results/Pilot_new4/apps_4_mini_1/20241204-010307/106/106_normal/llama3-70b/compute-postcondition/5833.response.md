The code appends the tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The value of `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, which is dependent on the specific value of the `A` matrix. The initial conditions regarding `N`, `x`, `y`, and other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated `queue` while maintaining the other variable states.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; `queue` now contains all satisfying tuples `(ncur, 0)`, possibly `(ncur, 1)`, and has a new entry `(ncur, 1)`; `piece` is set to 0; `dx` is 1; `dy` is -1; `nx` is 2; `ny` is -1; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `parent[1][ncur]` is now equal to `(cur, piece)`**.
