Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is within `0` and `N-1`, `y` is within `0` and `N-1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated for reachable positions based on the conditions of the loop, `parent[0][ncur]` reflects the last piece and position before reaching `ncur`, `queue` contains all positions reachable by the current piece from `(x,y)` using the defined moves, `dist[0][cur]` remains unchanged for any unreachable positions. The current value of `nx` is within `0` and `N-1`, and the current value of `ny` is within `0` and `N-1`.***
