The values of `nx` and `ny` are updated with the expressions `x + dx` and `y + dy` respectively. Given that `dx` is `1` and `dy` is `0`, `nx` becomes `x + 1` and `ny` remains `y`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`dist` contains valid distances for reachable indices, `parent[1][ncur]` reflects the parent tracking for each updated index, `piece` is 2, `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is `y**.
