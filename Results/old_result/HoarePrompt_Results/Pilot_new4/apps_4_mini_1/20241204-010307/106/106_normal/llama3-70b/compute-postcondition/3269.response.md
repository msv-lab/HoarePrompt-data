The code appends a tuple containing the values of `ncur` and `0` to the `queue`. The other variables remain unaffected. Since `ncur` is equal to `A[-2][0]`, that specific value is added to the queue along with `0`. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is -2, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[-2][0]`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`, `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`.**
