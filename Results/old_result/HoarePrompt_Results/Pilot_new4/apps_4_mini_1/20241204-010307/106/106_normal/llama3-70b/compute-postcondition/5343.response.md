According to the code, the loop can execute if the variable `y` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is 0 and `N` is between 4 and 10. For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `y` will be 1 at the start of the next iteration. Since `N` is between 4 and 10, and `y` will be 1, the loop can definitely execute again. 

State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 1, if `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, then `dist[2][ncur]` contains updated distances based on valid moves, `parent[2][ncur]` contains path information, and if `piece` is not equal to `i`, then `queue` contains the tuple `(cur, i)` along with previous applicable tuples of `(ncur, 2)` for valid moves where `piece` is 2. If no valid moves were available, `dist[2][ncur]`, `parent[2][ncur]`, and `queue` remain unchanged.**
