The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The value of `nx` is `x + 1` and `ny` is 1, so `ncur` becomes `A[x + 1][1]`. The other variables remain unchanged, but since `ncur` is now dependent on the value of `A`, we can express its value in terms of `x`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `cur` is a valid index, `ncur` is equal to `A[x + 1][1]`, `nx` is equal to `x + 1`, `ny` is 1, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 1**
