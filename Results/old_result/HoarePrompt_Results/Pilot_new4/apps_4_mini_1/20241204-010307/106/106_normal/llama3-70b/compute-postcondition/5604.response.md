The code executes the `append` method on the `queue` list, adding a tuple `(cur, i)` to it. Since `cur` represents the current state and `i` is the current piece, the `queue` is updated to include this new tuple. The values of `N`, `dist`, `parent`, `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, and `A[0][0]` remain unchanged. The current value of `piece` is still not equal to `i`, and there is no additional impact on the other variables as a result of this code snippet.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `dist[2][ncur]` represents the shortest distance from `cur` to each valid `ncur`; `parent[2][ncur]` contains the previous state `(cur, piece)` for each valid `ncur`; `queue` now includes the tuple `(cur, i)`; the values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, and `A[0][0]` remain unchanged; the current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`.**
