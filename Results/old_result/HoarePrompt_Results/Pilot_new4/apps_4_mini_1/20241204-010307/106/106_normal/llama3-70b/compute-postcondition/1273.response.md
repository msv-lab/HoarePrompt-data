The code `queue.append((ncur, 1))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the list `queue`. The value of `ncur` is derived from the initial state `ncur = A[0][3]`, which is dependent on the specific structure of `A`. Since `A` is not defined in the initial state, we will retain `ncur` as it is. The other variables remain unchanged as the operation does not affect them.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `cur` is unchanged, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `dist[0]` contains the updated distances for reachable positions, `parent[0]` reflects the paths taken, `queue` contains tuples of all updated positions and now includes `(ncur, 1)`, `piece` is 1, `nx` is 0, `ny` is 3, `ncur` is `A[0][3]`, `parent[1][ncur]` is `(cur, piece)`**.
