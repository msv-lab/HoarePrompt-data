The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]` where `nx` is equal to `1 + dx` and `ny` is equal to `(N - 1) + dy`. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, and `ny` remain unchanged, but `ncur` now holds the value at the specified index in the 2D array `A`. The previous information is valid with the inclusion of the new assignment to `ncur`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 1, `y` is `N - 1`, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `(N - 1) + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`.**
