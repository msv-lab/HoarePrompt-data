Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 1 and N-2; `x` is between 1 and N-2; if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `piece` is set to 2. If `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dist[2][cur]` remains unchanged, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
