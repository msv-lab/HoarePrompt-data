The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `piece` are not modified, and the previous state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `piece` remains equal to 2; `dist` is updated as `dist[2][ncur] = dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur`; `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is equal to `x + dx` and `ny` is equal to `y + dy`.**
