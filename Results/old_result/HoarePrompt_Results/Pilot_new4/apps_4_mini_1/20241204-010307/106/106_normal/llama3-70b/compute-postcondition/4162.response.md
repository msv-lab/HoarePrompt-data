Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `nx` is -1, `ny` is 3, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[-1][3]`. If `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, and `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)` appended to it. Otherwise, no updates occur. If the condition is not met, no changes are made to any variables.***
