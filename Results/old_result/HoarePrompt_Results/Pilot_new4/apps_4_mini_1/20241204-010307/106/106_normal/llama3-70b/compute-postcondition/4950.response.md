The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The variables that are relevant to the output state are `ncur` and the state of the `queue`. 

Since `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y - 1]`, it will be added to the `queue` along with the value `1`. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 1 and N-2; `x` is between 1 and N-2; `dx` is -1; `dy` is -1; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is equal to `y - 1`; `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y - 1]; dist[1][ncur] is equal to dist[1][cur] + 1; parent[1][ncur] is equal to `cur`, `piece`; `queue` contains a tuple `(ncur, 1)` appended.**
