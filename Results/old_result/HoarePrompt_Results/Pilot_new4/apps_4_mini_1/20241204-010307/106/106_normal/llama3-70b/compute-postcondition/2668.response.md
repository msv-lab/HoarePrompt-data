The statement `parent[1][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[1][ncur]`. The previous values of the variables are not affected by this assignment, and since `piece` is equal to `1`, the assignment is now explicitly `parent[1][ncur] = cur, 1`. 

The other variables remain unchanged, so we maintain the existing information about their states. No other variables in the initial state are modified by this code.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is -1, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` has been set for each valid `ncur`, `queue` contains tuples for all valid `ncur` reached from the original position `(x, y)`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 1, `dist[1][cur]` is less than `dist[1][ncur]`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur, 1`.**
