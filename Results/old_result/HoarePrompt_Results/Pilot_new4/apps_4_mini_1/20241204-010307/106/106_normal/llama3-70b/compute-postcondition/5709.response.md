The code `queue.append((ncur, 0))` adds a tuple consisting of the values `ncur` and `0` to the `queue`. Since `queue` is not empty and the other variables remain unchanged, the output state reflects the addition to the `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` has an additional entry `(ncur, 0)`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`**.
