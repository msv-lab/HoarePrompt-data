The variable `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is equal to `x + dx` and `ny` is equal to `y + dy`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are confirmed to be within bounds, specifically `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`. This means that `ncur` will take a valid value from the 2D array `A`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
