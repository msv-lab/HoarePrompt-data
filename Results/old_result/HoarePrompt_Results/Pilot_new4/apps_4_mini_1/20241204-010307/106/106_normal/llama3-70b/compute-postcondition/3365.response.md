The line of code `parent[1][ncur] = cur, piece` updates the `parent` array at index `1` and `ncur` to hold the values `cur` and `piece`. 

Since `piece` is equal to 1, the assignment will store the value of `cur` and the piece information in `parent[1][ncur]`. 

The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `dist`, `parent`, `queue`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur` remain unchanged, except for the specific update made to `parent[1][ncur]`. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `cur` is unchanged, `dist[1]` remains unchanged except for `dist[1][ncur]`, `parent[1]` remains unchanged except for `parent[1][ncur]` which is now equal to `cur` and `piece`, `piece` is equal to 1, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to the minimum distance from `(0, 2)` considering valid knight moves, `parent[0][ncur]` contains the updated parent positions for each reachable position based on the knight's moves, `queue` contains all tuples `(ncur, 0)` appended for each valid move resulting in an update to `dist[0][ncur]`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1 for the first iteration, `nx` is -1, `ny` is 1, and `ncur` is equal to `A[-1][1]`.**
