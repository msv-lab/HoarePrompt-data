Output State: **`dist` contains valid distances for reachable indices, `parent[1][ncur]` reflects the parent tracking for each updated index, `queue` now contains the previously existing tuples plus the new tuple `(ncur, 2)`, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and the current value of `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to be greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1; parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`**
