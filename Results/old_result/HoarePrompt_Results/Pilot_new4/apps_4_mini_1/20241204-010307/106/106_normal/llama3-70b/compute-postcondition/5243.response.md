In this case, the variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are previously defined, where `nx` is `x - 1` and `ny` is `y`. Since `N` is between 4 and 10, `x` can take values from 0 to `N-1`, meaning `nx` will range from -1 to `N-2`. The variable `ny` ranges between 1 and `N-1`. Thus, `ncur` will be set to the value at the index `[nx][ny]` in the array `A`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is between 0 and `N-1`; `y` is between 1 and `N-1`; `nx` is `x - 1`; `ny` is `y`; `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[x - 1][y]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is between 0 and `N-1`; `y` is between 1 and `N-1`; `nx` is `x - 1`; `ny` is `y`; `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[x - 1][y]`.**
