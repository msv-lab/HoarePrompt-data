Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `cur` is defined, and if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and if `piece` is equal to 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` was greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
