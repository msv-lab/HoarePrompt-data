The code assigns the value of `dist[2][cur] + 1` to `dist[2][ncur]`. The value of `dist[2][cur]` is not specified, but `dist[2][ncur]` will now be one more than that value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `piece` is 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `queue` now contains both `(ncur, 1)` and `(ncur, 2)`, `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is now one more than `dist[2][cur]`.**
