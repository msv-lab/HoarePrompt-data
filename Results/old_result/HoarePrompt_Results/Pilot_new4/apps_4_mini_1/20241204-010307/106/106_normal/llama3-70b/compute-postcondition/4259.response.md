Postcondition: ***If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 1, `y` is `N - 1`, `nx` is `1 + dx`, and `ny` is `(N - 1) + dy`. If `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, and `queue` is updated to include `(ncur, 1)`. Otherwise, no changes occur. If the condition is not satisfied, no operations are performed, maintaining the initial values.***
