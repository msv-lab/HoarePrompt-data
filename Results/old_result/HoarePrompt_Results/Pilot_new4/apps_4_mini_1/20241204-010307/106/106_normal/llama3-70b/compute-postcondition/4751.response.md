The code `queue.append((ncur, 0))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `dist[0][ncur]`, `parent[0][ncur]`, and `cur` remain unchanged. The variable `queue` is updated to include the new element.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 0; `y` is 0; `nx` is equal to `dx`; `ny` is equal to `dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[dx][dy]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur` and `piece`; `queue` now includes `(ncur, 0)`**.
