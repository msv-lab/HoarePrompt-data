Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `nx` is `0 + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `dist` and `parent` are ready for updates based on the loop conditions, `queue` can be empty initially or filled based on the loop execution. The current value of `nx` is in the range `0 <= nx < N` and the current value of `ny` is in the range `0 <= ny < N`.***
