Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `piece` is 1, `nx` is `2 + dx`, `ny` is `0 + dy`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` allow for movements from position (2, 0) within the bounds of array `A`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. The value of `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`.***
