Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `dist` contains the shortest distances from `cur` to all reachable positions, `parent` reflects the predecessors for each reachable position and their corresponding piece values, `queue` contains tuples of reachable positions processed during the iterations, `cur` is the value of the last processed piece, and `cur` and `piece` are assigned the values from the leftmost tuple in `queue` after removing it.**
