Given the initial state where `N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `dist` and `parent` are initialized, and `queue` contains reachable positions, the code snippet `nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy` assigns new values to `nx` and `ny`.

Here, `nx` is computed as `x + dx` and `ny` is computed as `y + dy`. Since `dx` and `dy` are not specified in the initial state, we will consider them as variables that can take on any integer values based on the context of the program.

The current values of `x` and `y` are 1 and 0, respectively. Therefore:

- `nx` will be calculated as `1 + dx`
- `ny` will be calculated as `0 + dy`

The states of the other variables (`N`, `dist`, `parent`, `queue`) remain unchanged, and we do not have specific values for `dx` and `dy`, so we represent the new values of `nx` and `ny` in terms of `dx` and `dy`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `0 + dy`, `dist` and `parent` are initialized, and `queue` contains reachable positions.**
