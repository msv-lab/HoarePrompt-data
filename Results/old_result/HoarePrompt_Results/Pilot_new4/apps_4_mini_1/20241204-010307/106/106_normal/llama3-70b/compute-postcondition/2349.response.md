Postcondition: ***`dist[1]` contains the shortest distances from the initial position and `parent[1]` contains the parent positions. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then if `piece` is equal to 2 and the shortest distance to `ncur` in `dist[2]` is greater than the shortest distance to `cur` in `dist[2]` plus 1, `parent[2][ncur]` is updated to `cur`, `dist[2][ncur]` is set to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `queue` includes `(ncur, 2)`. Otherwise, no changes are made as there is no else part.***
