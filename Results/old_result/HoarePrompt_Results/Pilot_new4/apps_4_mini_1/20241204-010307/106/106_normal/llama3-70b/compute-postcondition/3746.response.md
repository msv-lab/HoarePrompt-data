To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. The loop iterates over the tuple list `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`, which means there are four iterations in total. 

2. The variables `dx` and `dy` will take on the values from the tuples in the list in each iteration. 

3. We need to understand the current iteration's context and where it might be when the loop ends:
   - Since there are four pairs in the list, if we assume that the loop just finished processing the last pair `(0, 1)` (the last iteration), then `dx` would be `0` and `dy` would be `1` at the end of the last iteration.

4. After that last iteration, the loop will try to pick the next pair from the list. However, since the list is exhausted after the fourth pair, the loop cannot continue to execute.

5. Hence, for the loop to execute one more time, we must consider the current index of the looping through the pairs and determine what needs to happen:
   - If we want the loop to execute again, we need to start over with the pairs from the beginning.

Thus, after considering the above points, hereâ€™s the adjusted program state for the next iteration of the loop:

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, and the `queue` contains at least one valid `(ncur, 1)` pair, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0**
