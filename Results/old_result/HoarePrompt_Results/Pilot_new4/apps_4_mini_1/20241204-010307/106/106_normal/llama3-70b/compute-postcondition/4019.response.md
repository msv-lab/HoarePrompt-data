The values of `nx` and `ny` are calculated based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. 

- `nx` is assigned the value of `x + dx`, which is `0 + 0 = 0`.
- `ny` is assigned the value of `y + dy`, which is `0 + 1 = 1`.

The states of the other variables (`N`) are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 1, `nx` is 0, and `ny` is 1.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 1, `nx` is 0, `ny` is 1**.
