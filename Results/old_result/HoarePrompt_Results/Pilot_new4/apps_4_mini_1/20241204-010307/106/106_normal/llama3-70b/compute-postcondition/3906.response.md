Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `4 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 2; `y` is 2; `nx` is `2 + dx`; `ny` is `2 + dy`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is assigned the value from `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to the value of `cur`, and `(ncur, 1)` is added to `queue`. If either `nx` or `ny` is out of bounds, no changes are made to `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.***
