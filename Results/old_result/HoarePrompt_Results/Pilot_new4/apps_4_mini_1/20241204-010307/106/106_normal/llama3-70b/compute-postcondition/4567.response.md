The code snippet modifies the `dist` array at the index `[0][ncur]`. It assigns a new value to `dist[0][ncur]`, which is the sum of `dist[0][cur]` and `1`. The state of `ncur` is still equal to `A[x - 4][2]`, but we do not know the specific values of `dist[0][cur]`, `ncur`, or `cur`. Therefore, we only update the `dist` value based on the provided formula.

Since the values of `N`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, and `ny` remain unchanged, we keep them as they are.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 4`, `ny` is 2, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 4][2]`, and `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
