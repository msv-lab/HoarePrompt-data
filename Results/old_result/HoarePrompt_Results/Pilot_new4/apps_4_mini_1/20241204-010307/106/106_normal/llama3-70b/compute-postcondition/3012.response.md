The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, which is the element in the 2D list `A` at the coordinates defined by `nx` and `ny`. Since `nx` and `ny` satisfy the conditions `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, we can access the element at that position in the list. The states of the other variables are not affected, so we maintain their previous conditions.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `piece` is 0, `dist` may be updated based on reachable positions, `parent` may be updated accordingly, `queue` contains tuples of reachable positions, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`**
