The `parent` array at index `[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur` and `piece`. The previous values indicate that `ncur` is determined by the value of `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[1][ncur]` has already been updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` contains tuples of (ncur, 0) and (ncur, 1), (dx, dy) is (-1, -1), `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y - 1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur` and `piece`.**
