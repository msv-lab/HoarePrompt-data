The code assigns a tuple `(cur, piece)` to `parent[2][ncur]`. The other variables remain unchanged. `parent[2][ncur]` now contains the current index `cur` and the value of `piece`, which is `2`. The initial conditions state that `ncur` is now `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[2][ncur]` has already been updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, which is greater than `dist[2][cur]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 0 and 8 (inclusive); `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all valid moves `(nx, ny)` that were within bounds; `parent[1][ncur]` contains tuples of the previous indices leading to each `ncur`; `queue` contains tuples of all valid moves `(ncur, 1)` for each update made during the iterations; `ncur` is now `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is 2; `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1` and is greater than `dist[2][cur]`; `parent[2][ncur]` is now `(cur, 2)`**.
