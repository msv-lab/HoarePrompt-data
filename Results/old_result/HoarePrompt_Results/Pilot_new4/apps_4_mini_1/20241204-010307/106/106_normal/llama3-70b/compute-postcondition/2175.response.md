Output State: **`dist` contains valid distances for reachable indices, `parent[1][ncur]` reflects the parent tracking for each updated index, `piece` is 2, `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is `y`, `ncur` is `A[x + 1][y]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is (cur, 2), and `queue` now includes (ncur, 2).**
