Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 2, and `ncur` is equal to `A[1][2]`. If `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`.***
