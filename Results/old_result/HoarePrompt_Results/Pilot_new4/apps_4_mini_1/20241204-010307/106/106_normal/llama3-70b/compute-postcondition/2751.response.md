Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is the current y-coordinate, `piece` is not equal to the value represented by `i`, `dist[0][ncur]` holds the shortest distance from the start to all reachable positions in the grid, `parent[0][ncur]` indicates the predecessor of each position in the path, `queue` contains the tuples of reachable positions with their respective piece values, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid such that `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`.**
