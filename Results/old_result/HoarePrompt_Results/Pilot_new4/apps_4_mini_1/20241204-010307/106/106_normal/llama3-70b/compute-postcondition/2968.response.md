According to the code, the for loop iterates over the list of direction changes represented by the tuples `(-1, 0)`, `(1, 0)`, `(0, -1)`, and `(0, 1)`. The loop will execute once for each tuple in that list. 

At the end of the last iteration, the program state indicates that the loop body has run for one of the direction tuples, but it doesn't specify which one. Given that there are four tuples, if the loop has just executed for one tuple, it is now ready to execute for the next tuple.

Since the loop can execute four times in total, if it has just completed the first iteration for `(-1, 0)`, the next iteration will be for `(1, 0)`, then `(0, -1)`, and finally `(0, 1)`. 

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the state such that we are aware of the current direction being processed. Since no specific information of which direction was last processed is given, we will assume that we are moving to the next direction in sequence.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `dist` reflects the shortest distances for all reachable positions, if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, `piece` is updated, and `queue` now also contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`, and the next direction tuple is `(1, 0)` (assuming we started with `(-1, 0)` or similar).**
