Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices, and `parent` reflects that `parent[2][ncur]` is now equal to `cur`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` holds true, and if `piece` is equal to 2 with `dist[2][ncur]` greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `queue` now contains all valid tuples of `(ncur, 1)` as well as `(ncur, 2)`. The variable `piece` remains unchanged, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny}`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` does not hold true, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
