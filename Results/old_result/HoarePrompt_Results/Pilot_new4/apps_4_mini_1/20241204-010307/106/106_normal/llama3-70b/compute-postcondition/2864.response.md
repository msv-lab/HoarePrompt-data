The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The variables `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid, meaning that they correspond to valid indices for the array `A`. The values of `A[nx][ny]` will depend on the specific contents of the array `A`, which are not provided in the initial state. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `piece` is 1, `dist[0]` holds the updated shortest distances for reachable positions, `parent[0]` indicates predecessors for reachable positions, `dist[1]` holds shortest distances for positions reachable with piece value 1, `parent[1]` indicates predecessors for those positions, `queue` must not be empty, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`.**
