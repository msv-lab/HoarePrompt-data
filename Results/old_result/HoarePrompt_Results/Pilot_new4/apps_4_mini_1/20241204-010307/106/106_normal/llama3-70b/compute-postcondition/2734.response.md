The code snippet updates a specific element in a 2D array `dist`. The value at `dist[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `dist[0][cur] + 1`. The variables impacted are `dist` and `ncur`, which is determined by the current position in the bounds.

Given that `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and assuming `cur` remains unchanged, `dist[0][ncur]` will be updated based on the current distance at `cur`. 

The initial conditions do not restrict any of the values of `dist`, `cur`, or `ncur`, other than `ncur` being valid due to the bounds check. Thus, the values of `dist` are updated without altering any of the other variables provided.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is the current y-coordinate, `piece` is not equal to the value represented by `i`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
