The line of code `queue.append((ncur, 1))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The variable `ncur` has already been defined as `A[x + 1][y + 1]`. The other variables (`N`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, and `parent`) remain unchanged by this operation. 

Since `N` is between 3 and 10, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x + 1`, and `ny` is equal to `y + 1`, we can summarize the output state.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `dx` is 1; `dy` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x + 1`; `ny` is equal to `y + 1`; `ncur` is equal to `A[x + 1][y + 1]; parent[1][ncur] is updated to cur, piece; `queue` now contains `(ncur, 1)`.**
