The variable `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are previously defined by the expressions `nx = x + dx - 1` and `ny = 1 + dy`. Since `N` is between 3 and 10, the variable `ncur` will be an element from the 2D array `A` at the indices calculated by `nx` and `ny`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x + dx - 1; ny` is equal to `1 + dy; ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]**.
