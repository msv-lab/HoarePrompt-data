Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 1; `A` must have dimensions that allow access to indices from `(x + dx, y + dy)` for each `dx, dy` in the list; `piece` is 2; `nx` is `1 + dx`; `ny` is `1 + dy`; `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is 0 and the distance from the starting point to `ncur`, `dist[0][ncur]`, is greater than the distance to the current point, `dist[0][cur]`, plus 1.***
