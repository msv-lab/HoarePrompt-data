The variable `dist[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `dist[0][cur] + 1`. However, the specific values of `cur` and `dist[0]` are not provided in the initial state, which affects how we interpret the assignment. 

The state of the other variables remains unchanged, thus:

- `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`
- `y` is 1
- `dx` is -2
- `dy` is 1
- `nx` is equal to `x - 2`
- `ny` is 2
- `ncur` is assigned the value `A[x - 2][2]`
- `dist[0][ncur]` is now `dist[0][cur] + 1`

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is 2, `ncur` is assigned the value `A[x - 2][2]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is now `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
