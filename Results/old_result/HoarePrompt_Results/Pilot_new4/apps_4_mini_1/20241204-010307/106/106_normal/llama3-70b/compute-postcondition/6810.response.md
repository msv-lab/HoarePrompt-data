The code `queue.append((ncur, 2))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The variable `ncur` is already defined as `A[1][3]`, which is not further specified, but it exists in the context. The state of other variables remains unchanged since they are not affected by this line of code. 

Thus, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 1, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 3, `ncur` is equal to `A[1][3]`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`, and the `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 1, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 3, `ncur` is equal to `A[1][3]`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` contains `(ncur, 2)`**.
