The `queue` is being updated to include a tuple containing `(ncur, 1)`. The values of `ncur` and `piece` are specified as they contribute to the new state of the `queue`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 3 and 10; `x` is greater than 1 and less than `N - 1`; `piece` is 1; `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1` for at least some valid `ncur`; `nx` is `x + dx`; `ny` is `y + dy`; 0 â‰¤ `nx`, `ny` < `N; `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is (cur, piece); `queue` now contains `(ncur, 1)`.**
