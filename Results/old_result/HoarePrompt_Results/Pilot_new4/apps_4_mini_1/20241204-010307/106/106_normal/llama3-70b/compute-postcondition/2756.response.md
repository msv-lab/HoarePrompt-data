Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is the current y-coordinate, if `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, the `queue` is updated to include the tuple `(ncur, 1)`, `dist[1][ncur]` is set to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur, piece`.***
