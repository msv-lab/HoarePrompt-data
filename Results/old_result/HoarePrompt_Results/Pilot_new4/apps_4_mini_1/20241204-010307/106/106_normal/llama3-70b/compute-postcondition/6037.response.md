The code appends a tuple `(cur, i)` to the `queue`. The value of `cur` is not defined in the initial state but is assumed to be a valid current position based on the context. The variable `i` is mentioned as the current value of `piece`, which is not equal to `i`. Therefore, the `queue` is updated to include the new tuple while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 9, `y` is 9, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur` reachable from the starting position, `dist[2][ncur]` contains the shortest distance from the starting point to `ncur` using piece equal to 2, `parent[1][ncur]` contains the parent relationships for each updated `ncur`, `parent[2][ncur]` contains the parent relationships for each updated `ncur` when piece is 2, `queue` now contains the previous tuples plus the new appended tuple `(cur, i)`, and the current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`.**
