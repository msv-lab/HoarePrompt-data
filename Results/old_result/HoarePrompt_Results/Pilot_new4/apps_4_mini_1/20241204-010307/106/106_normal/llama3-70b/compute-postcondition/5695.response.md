The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The initial state indicates that `x` is 0 and `y` is 2. The values of `dx` and `dy` are iterated over specified pairs, but since those specific pairs are not given, we cannot determine their exact values. Therefore, the state of `nx` and `ny` depends on those pairs.

Assuming `dx` and `dy` could take on various values, we can express `nx` as `0 + dx` which simplifies to just `dx`, and `ny` as `2 + dy`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` is not empty, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `nx` is equal to `dx`, and `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`.**
