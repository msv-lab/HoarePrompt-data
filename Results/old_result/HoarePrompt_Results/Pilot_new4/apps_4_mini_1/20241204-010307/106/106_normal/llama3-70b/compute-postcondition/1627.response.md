Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 0; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; if `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `cur`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)` as an additional element. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
