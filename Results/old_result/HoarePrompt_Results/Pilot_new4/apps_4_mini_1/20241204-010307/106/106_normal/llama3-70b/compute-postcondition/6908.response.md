Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `dx` is 1; `dy` is 0; `nx` is `x + 1`; `ny` is `y`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`; otherwise, no changes are made.***
