The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. Since `ncur` cannot be assigned a valid value, it remains in its original indeterminate state when the tuple is created. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, `piece`, and `parent` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is -2, `ny` is 1, `ncur` cannot be assigned a valid value, `piece` is equal to 0, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and 0, and `queue` has appended the tuple `(ncur, 0)`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is -2, `ny` is 1, `ncur` cannot be assigned a valid value, `piece` is equal to 0, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and 0, `queue` has appended the tuple `(ncur, 0)`**.
