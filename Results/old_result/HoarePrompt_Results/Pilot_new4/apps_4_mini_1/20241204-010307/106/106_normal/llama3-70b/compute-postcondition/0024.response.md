The code assigns the value of `A[nx][ny]` to `ncur`. The variables `nx` and `ny` have specific values derived from the expressions `x - 2` and `y + 1`, respectively. Therefore, `ncur` is assigned the value located at the 2D array `A` with the indices `nx` (which is `x - 2`) and `ny` (which is `y + 1`). The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, `piece` remains 0, `cur` is set to 1 for the next iteration, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 2][y + 1]**
