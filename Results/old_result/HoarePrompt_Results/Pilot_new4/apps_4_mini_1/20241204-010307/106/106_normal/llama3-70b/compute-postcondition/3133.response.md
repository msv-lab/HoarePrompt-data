The code snippet provided is `nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy`. However, the initial state does not include any definitions for `x`, `dx`, or `dy`. Consequently, we cannot determine their values or how they interact with the existing variables.

The variables that are defined in the initial state are:
- `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`
- `y` is 2
- `piece` is set to 1

Since `nx` and `ny` depend on variables `x`, `dx`, and `dy`, and those variables are not defined in the initial state, we cannot update `nx` and `ny`. Therefore, the output state should reflect that no changes can be made to `y`, `N`, or `piece`, and also note that `nx` and `ny` remain undefined.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `piece` is set to 1, and `nx`, `ny` remain undefined**.
