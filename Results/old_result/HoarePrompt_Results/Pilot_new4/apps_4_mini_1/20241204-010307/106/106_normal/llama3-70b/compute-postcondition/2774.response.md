Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is the current y-coordinate, `piece` must be equal to 1, `dist[1][ncur]` contains the shortest distances from the starting position to reachable positions in the grid, `parent[1][ncur]` indicates the predecessors of each position in the path, and `queue` contains tuples of reachable positions with their respective piece values after all iterations of the loop. If no positions are reachable, `dist` and `parent` remain unmodified for those positions, and `queue` is empty.**
