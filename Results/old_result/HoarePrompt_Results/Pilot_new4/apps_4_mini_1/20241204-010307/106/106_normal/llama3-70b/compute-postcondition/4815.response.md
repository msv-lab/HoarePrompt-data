Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` holds true, and if the condition `piece == 2` and `dist[2][ncur] > dist[2][cur] + 1` holds, then `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, and `ny` remain unchanged at -1, 0, -1, 0, -2, and 0 respectively, while `ncur` is set to `A[-2][0]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the values of `cur` and `piece`. If the condition does not hold, no changes occur.***
