The code assigns the value `cur` to `parent[2][ncur]` along with the value of `piece`. Since `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`, this means that `parent[2][ncur]` will be updated based on the current state of `cur` and `piece`. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `dist`, `queue`, and `piece` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is `0 + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, `dist[1]` remains unchanged, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[1]` remains unchanged, `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`, `parent[2][ncur]` is updated to `(cur, piece)`.**
