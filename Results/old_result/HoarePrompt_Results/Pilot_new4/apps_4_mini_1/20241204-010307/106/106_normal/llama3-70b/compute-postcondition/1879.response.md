The variable `queue` is updated to include a new tuple `(ncur, 1)`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the initial conditions still hold. 

Output State: **`N` is at least 4, `dist` is valid for reachable indices, `parent` is updated such that `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`, `queue` contains valid tuples of `(ncur, 0)` and now includes `(ncur, 1)`, `piece` is 1, `cur` is valid for index calculations, `x` is a valid index, `y` is a valid index, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid (0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N), and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
