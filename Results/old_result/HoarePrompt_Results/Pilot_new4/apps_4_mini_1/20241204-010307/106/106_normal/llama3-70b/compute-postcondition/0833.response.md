Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 0; `y` is 0; `nx` is `0 + dx`; `ny` is `0 + dy`; if `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is updated to `(cur, piece)`; `parent[0]` is updated for all valid `ncur` values; `queue` contains valid tuples of `(ncur, 0)` and the new tuple `(ncur, 1)` for valid moves; `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`; the current value of `dist[1][cur]` remains valid. If the condition is not met, no changes occur.***
