Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` and `ny` are equal to their previous values, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` contains the updated minimum distances, `parent[1][ncur]` contains the respective parent information, and `queue` contains reachable positions. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` hold true and `piece` is equal to 2 while `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, 2)`, and `(ncur, 2)` is added to the `queue`; otherwise, the program state remains unchanged.***
