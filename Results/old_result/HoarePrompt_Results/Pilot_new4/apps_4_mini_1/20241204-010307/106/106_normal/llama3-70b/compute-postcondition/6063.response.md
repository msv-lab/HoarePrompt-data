`nx` is assigned the value `x + dx` and `ny` is assigned the value `y + dy`. The initial state specifies that `nx` and `ny` are both within the range of 0 to N, meaning the calculations are valid. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `x + dx` is within the bounds of `A`, `y + dy` is within the bounds of `A`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`**.
