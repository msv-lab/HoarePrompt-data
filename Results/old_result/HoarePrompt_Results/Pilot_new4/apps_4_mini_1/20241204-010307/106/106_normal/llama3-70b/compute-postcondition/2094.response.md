The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The value of `ncur` is determined by the previously stated conditions, and `2` represents the `piece` value. The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged, as the operation only affects the `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is at least 5, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` now includes `parent[2][ncur] = (cur, piece)`, `piece` is equal to 2, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `queue` now includes `(ncur, 2)`**.
