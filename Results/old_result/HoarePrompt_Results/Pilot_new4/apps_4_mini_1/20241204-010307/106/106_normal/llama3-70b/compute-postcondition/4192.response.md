The variable `ncur` is assigned the value from the 2D array `A` at the indices `[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are dependent on their previous assignments, which are still valid after execution. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist` and `parent` remain unchanged, `queue` remains unchanged.**
