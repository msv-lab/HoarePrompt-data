To determine the output state after executing the code snippet, we need to analyze the impact of the line `ncur = A[nx][ny]` given the initial state.

Initial State: 
- `N` is between 3 and 10
- `x` is 1
- `y` is 2
- `dx` is 0
- `dy` is 1
- `nx` is 1
- `ny` is 3

The code `ncur = A[nx][ny]` assigns the value of the element in the 2D array `A` at the position determined by `nx` and `ny`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are 1 and 3, respectively. 

Assuming that `A` is defined, `ncur` will hold the value of `A[1][3]`. However, since we don't know the content of `A`, we cannot specify the exact value of `ncur`, just that it is determined by the array based on the current indices.

All other variables remain unchanged in this operation.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 1, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 3, and `ncur` is equal to `A[1][3]`.**
