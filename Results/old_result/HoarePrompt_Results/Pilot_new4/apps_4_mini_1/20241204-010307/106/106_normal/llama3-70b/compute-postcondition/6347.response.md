The variable `ncur` is assigned the value from the 2D array `A` at the indices `[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are equal to `dx` and `dy`, respectively, but their specific values are not mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the output state will indicate that `ncur` is assigned the value from array `A` based on the current indices.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[0]` contains the distances from `cur` to other reachable nodes, `parent[0]` contains the parent nodes for the reachable distances, `queue` is updated accordingly for the next iteration, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
