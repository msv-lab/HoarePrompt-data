Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, if the current value of `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `(cur, 1)`, and `queue` includes `(ncur, 1)`. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
