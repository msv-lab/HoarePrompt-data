The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[1][ncur]`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. The output state reflects that `parent[1][ncur]` now holds the value of `cur` and `piece`, while the rest of the variables maintain their original state.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `0 + dy`, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is `cur`, `piece`**.
