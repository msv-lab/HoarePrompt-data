Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `piece` remains equal to 2, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
