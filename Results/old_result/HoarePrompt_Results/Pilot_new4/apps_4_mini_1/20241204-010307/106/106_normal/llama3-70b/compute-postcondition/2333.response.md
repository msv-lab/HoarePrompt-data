The code assigns new values to `nx` and `ny`, which are computed by adding `dx` to `x` and `dy` to `y`, respectively. The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged, while `nx` and `ny` will represent the new positions based on the deltas provided by `dx` and `dy`. The other variables `dist[1]`, `parent[1]`, and `queue` remain unaffected.

Output State: **`dist[1]` contains the shortest distances from the initial position, `parent[1]` contains the parent positions, `queue` contains at least 1 reachable position, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`.**
