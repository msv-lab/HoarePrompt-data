The code snippet `queue.append((ncur, 2))` appends a tuple containing `ncur` and the integer `2` to the list `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `queue` are affected by this operation. The previous values of `ncur` and `queue` are preserved, but the contents of `queue` are modified to include the new tuple. None of the other variables are changed.

The output state will reflect the unchanged variables along with the updated `queue` contents.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`, `queue` now includes `(ncur, 2)`**.
