Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `nx` and `ny` are updated based on the selected tuple `(dx, dy)`. If both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid defined by `N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the values of `cur` and `piece`, and the tuple `(ncur, 0)` is appended to `queue`. Otherwise, no changes occur in the state.***
