The code assigns the value of `(cur, piece)` to `parent[2][ncur]`. This means that the `parent` array at index `2` and `ncur` is now set to the value of `cur` and `piece`. Since there are no additional modifications to the other variables, the Output State includes the updated value of `parent[2][ncur]` while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 1, `dist[1]` remains unchanged, `parent[1]` remains unchanged, `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `(cur, piece)`.**
