According to the code, the loop iterates over a list of directional changes represented by the tuples `(-1, 0)`, `(1, 0)`, `(0, -1)`, and `(0, 1)` in order to explore neighboring positions. The loop can execute one more time as long as there are more direction tuples to process. 

At the end of the last iteration, the loop has processed one of the direction tuples. Assuming it started with the first tuple `(-1, 0)`, the loop has likely executed three times already, processing the tuples `(-1, 0)`, `(1, 0)`, and `(0, -1)` respectively. 

If the last executed direction was `(0, -1)`, then for the loop to execute again, it would need to process the last tuple `(0, 1)`. Therefore, the state will indicate that the loop has either completed or is ready to process the last direction.

State: **`dist[1][ncur]` contains the minimum distances from the starting position to all reachable positions, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 1**
