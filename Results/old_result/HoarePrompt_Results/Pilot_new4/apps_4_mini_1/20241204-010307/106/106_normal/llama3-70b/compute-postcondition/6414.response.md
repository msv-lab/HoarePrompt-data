In the provided code snippet, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The variables `nx` and `ny` are given specific values of `-1`. Therefore, `ncur` will now be equal to `A[-1][-1]`. The initial state indicates that `N` is between 3 and 10, and other variables remain unchanged except for the updates to `parent[0]`, which are not directly impacted by this code snippet.

Since `ncur` is defined but we don't have the explicit values of `A`, we cannot specify the exact value of `ncur`. However, we can note that `ncur` is now dependent on the value at the indices `[-1][-1]` of the list `A`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `dist[0]` remains unchanged; `parent[0]` remains unchanged except `parent[0][ncur]` is now equal to `cur, piece`; `dx` is -1; `dy` is -2; `nx` is -1; `ny` is -1; `ncur` is equal to `A[-1][-1]**.
