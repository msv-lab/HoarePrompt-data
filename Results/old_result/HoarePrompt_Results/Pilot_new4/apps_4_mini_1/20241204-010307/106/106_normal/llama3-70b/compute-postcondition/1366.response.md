The values of `nx` and `ny` are updated based on the values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. However, the values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided in the initial state, which means we cannot determine exact values for `nx` and `ny`. Therefore, the output will reflect that `nx` and `ny` are now dependent on `dx` and `dy`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`**
