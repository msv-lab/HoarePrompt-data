Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 0 and `N-1`, `nx = x + dx`, `ny = y + dy`, and at least one of the resulting coordinates `(nx, ny)` is valid. If both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of `N`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and if `piece` equals 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the tuple `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. Otherwise, the program state remains unchanged.***
