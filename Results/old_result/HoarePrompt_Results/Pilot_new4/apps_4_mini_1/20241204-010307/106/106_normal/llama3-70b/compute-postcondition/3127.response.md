Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `piece` is 2, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for each valid `ncur`, `parent[1][ncur]` contains the last valid `(cur, piece)` for each `ncur`, `queue` contains all valid `(ncur, 1)` pairs added during the iterations, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and now `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
