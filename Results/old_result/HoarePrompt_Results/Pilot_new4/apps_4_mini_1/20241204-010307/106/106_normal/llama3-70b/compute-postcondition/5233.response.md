According to the code, the loop iterates over a list of direction deltas represented by `(dx, dy)`. The loop will execute once for each of the four pairs in this list. As the loop iterates, it processes each direction in sequence.

At the end of the last iteration, the values of `dx` and `dy` correspond to the last pair in the list, which is `(0, 1)`. Therefore, for the next iteration of the loop, `dx` and `dy` need to be updated to the next pair in the list, which will wrap back to the first pair `(-1, 0)` after completing the loop.

Since there are no conditions affecting the loop's continuation (like an index or a condition to stop), we simply need to note that the next values of `dx` and `dy` will be `(-1, 0)`.

State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 1 and `N-1`, `nx` is `x + (-1)`, `ny` is `y + 0`, `ncur` is the value at `A[nx][ny]`, and other states remain unchanged.**
