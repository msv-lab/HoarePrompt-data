The variable `queue` is updated by appending a tuple containing the current position `cur` and the piece number `i`. The other variables `dist`, `parent`, and other elements remain unchanged as there is no indication that they are affected by this specific operation. 

Output State: **`dist[1][ncur]` contains the minimum distances from the starting position to all reachable positions; `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to reflect the minimum distance for each position reachable by the piece if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` holds the last position and the piece before reaching `ncur`; `queue` now contains all the tuples of reachable positions and the piece number, including the newly added tuple `(cur, i)`. Additionally, the current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`.**
