`ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` and `ny` are previously defined and valid indices within the boundaries of the grid. The state of other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dist[0]` has been updated for all reachable positions from `(x, y)`, `parent[0]` has been assigned tuples for all reachable positions, `queue` contains tuples for each reachable position from `(x, y)`, `nx` is 0 + `dx`, `ny` is 0 + `dy`, and `ncur` is the value of `A[nx][ny]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dist[0]` has been updated for all reachable positions from `(x, y)`, `parent[0]` has been assigned tuples for all reachable positions, `queue` contains tuples for each reachable position from `(x, y)`, `nx` is 0 + `dx`, `ny` is 0 + `dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`.**
