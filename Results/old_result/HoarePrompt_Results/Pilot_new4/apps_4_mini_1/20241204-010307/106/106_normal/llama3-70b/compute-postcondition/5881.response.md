The value of `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are determined by the expressions `nx = x + dx` and `ny = y + dy`, respectively. Therefore, `ncur` will depend on the computed values of `nx` and `ny` based on `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 0 and 8 (inclusive); `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `piece` is equal to 0; `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1; ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
