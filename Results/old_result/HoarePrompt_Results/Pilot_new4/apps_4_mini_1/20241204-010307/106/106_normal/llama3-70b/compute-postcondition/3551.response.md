Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is within `0` and `N-1`, `y` is within `0` and `N-1`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is `y + 1`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[x - 1][y + 1]`. If `piece` equals 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` has an additional element `(ncur, 1)`. Otherwise, there are no changes to the variables. If the condition is not met, there are no changes made to any variables.***
