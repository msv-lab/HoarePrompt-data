The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` depend on the values of `x` and `y` respectively, but they are not specified in the initial state. Therefore, `nx` is equal to `x + 1` and `ny` is equal to `y`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Since `N` is between 3 and 10, and it does not directly affect the assignment of `ncur`, we keep that information in the output state. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `dx` is 1; `dy` is 0; `nx` is equal to `x + 1`; `ny` is equal to `y; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
