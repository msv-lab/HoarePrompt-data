Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `cur` is unchanged, `dist[0]` contains the updated distances for reachable positions, `parent[0]` reflects the paths taken, `queue` contains tuples of all updated positions and now includes `(ncur, 1)`, `piece` is 1, `nx` is 0, `ny` is 3, `ncur` is `A[0][3]`, and if `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1` and `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`. If the condition `0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N` is not satisfied, no changes are made to the distances or paths.***
