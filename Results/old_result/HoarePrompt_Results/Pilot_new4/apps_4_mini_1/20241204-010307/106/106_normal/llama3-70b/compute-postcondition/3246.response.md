According to the code, the loop iterates over a fixed list of tuples representing the changes in `x` and `y` coordinates. The loop will execute regardless of the values of `N`, `x`, and `y`, as the tuples in the list are predetermined. 

The variables `x` and `y` are initialized but are not used to control the loop execution. The loop will always execute exactly 8 times, once for each tuple. 

Therefore, the states do not need adjustment for the loop to execute. However, we can summarize the current values of `x`, `y`, and `N` to reflect that the loop is ready to execute with the provided state.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1**
