According to the code, the for loop iterates over a list of tuples representing possible movements (dx, dy). Each iteration will update the states based on those movements. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 2 and `y` is 2. The loop has covered the first two tuples in the list, which correspond to the movements `(-2, -1)` and `(-2, 1)`.

For the loop to execute one more time, it will need to process the next tuple in the list. The next tuple is `(-1, -2)`. Since `dx` will be set to -1 and `dy` will be set to -2 in the next iteration, we will calculate `nx` and `ny`:

- `nx` will be calculated as `2 + dx` → `2 - 1 = 1`
- `ny` will be calculated as `2 + dy` → `2 - 2 = 0`

We must also reaffirm that the values of `nx` and `ny` still satisfy the constraints given for N, which are `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`. Since we know that `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, both conditions will hold as long as N is at least 3.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to reflect that `dx` is now -1 and `dy` is now -2, while keeping the other states unchanged.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 0**
