Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is `2 or 3`; `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`; `dist[2][ncur]` is updated based on valid positions around `(x, y)`; `parent[2][ncur]` represents the predecessors for those updated positions; `queue` now includes `(cur, i)`; the current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`.**
