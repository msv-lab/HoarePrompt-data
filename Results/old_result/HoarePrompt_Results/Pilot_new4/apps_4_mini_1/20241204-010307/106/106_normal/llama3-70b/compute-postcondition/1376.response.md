Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, `dist[1][ncur]` reflects the shortest path distances updated based on valid moves, `parent[1][ncur]` contains the corresponding previous positions for reachable states, `queue` contains all reachable tuples from valid moves, `A[2][0]` remains equal to `cur`, `ncur` reflects the positions updated based on valid (nx, ny) coordinates. The current values of `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of 0 and N, inclusive.***
