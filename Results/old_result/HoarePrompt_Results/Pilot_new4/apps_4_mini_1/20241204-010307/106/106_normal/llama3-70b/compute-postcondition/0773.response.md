`dist[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `dist[2][cur] + 1`. The variable `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, but we don't have specific values for `cur`, `A`, or `dist`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is `2 or 3`, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is `2 or 3`, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
