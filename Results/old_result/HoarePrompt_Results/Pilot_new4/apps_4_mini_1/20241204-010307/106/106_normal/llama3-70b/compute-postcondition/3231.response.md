Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0. If `nx` is within the bounds of 0 to N-1 and `ny` is within the bounds of 0 to N-1, and if `piece` is 2 while `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is established for reachable positions, `queue` now includes the previous tuples plus `(ncur, 2)`, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[dx][dy]`, with `parent[2][ncur]` set to `cur, piece`. If the conditions do not hold, there are no changes to `dist[2][ncur]`, `parent[1][ncur]`, or `queue`.***
