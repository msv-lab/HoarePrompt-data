Postcondition: ***`dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices, `queue` contains one element `[(cur, n + 1)]`, `piece` is less than or equal to `n`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and the current values of `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid, specifically `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`.***
