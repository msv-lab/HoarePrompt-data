Postcondition: ***`dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece` is 0. The `queue` contains valid tuples which now includes the newly appended tuple `(ncur, 0)`, and `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1` if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`.***
