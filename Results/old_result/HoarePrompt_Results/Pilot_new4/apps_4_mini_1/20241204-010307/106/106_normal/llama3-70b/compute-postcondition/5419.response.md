The variable `ncur` is calculated as `A[4 + dx][1 + dy]`, but we don't have specific values for `dx` and `dy`, and thus `ncur` remains unspecified in the output. The expression `dist[2][ncur] = dist[2][cur] + 1` assigns a new value to the `dist[2][ncur]`, which is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`. However, we do not have the specific values for `dist` or `cur` either, so we can only state that the value of `dist[2][ncur]` is updated. 

Since we do not change any other variables and the values of `dist[2][cur]` and `ncur` are not specified, the output state will indicate the updates without specific values.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 1, `piece` is 2, `nx` is `4 + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, `ncur` is `A[4 + dx][1 + dy]`, and `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
