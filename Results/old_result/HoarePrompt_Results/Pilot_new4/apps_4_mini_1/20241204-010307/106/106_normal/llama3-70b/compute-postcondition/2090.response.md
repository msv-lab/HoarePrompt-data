The code snippet assigns the values `nx` and `ny` based on the addition of `x` with `dx` and `y` with `dy`, respectively. However, the values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy` are not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine their specific values or how they relate to the existing variables. The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is at least 5, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the most recent parents for all reachable indices, `piece` is equal to 2, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`.**
