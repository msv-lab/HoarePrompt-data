The code assigns a value to `parent[1][ncur]`, which is determined by the values of `cur` and `piece`. The states of other variables remain unaffected by this assignment.

Since `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][0]`, the assignment will depend on the current value of `cur` and `piece`, which are not specified in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine specific values for `parent[1][ncur]`. 

The output state remains as follows, incorporating the changes made by the code while maintaining the previously established conditions:

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `x` is between 1 and `N-2`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][0]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.**
