The statement `parent[0][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the value of `cur` to `parent[0][ncur]`. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `cur`, `ncur`, and `dist[0][ncur]` remain unchanged. 

The variable `parent[0][ncur]` is updated, but without specific values for `cur` or `piece`, they are treated as their respective values in this context.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `cur` is the same as before, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is `cur`, `piece`**.
