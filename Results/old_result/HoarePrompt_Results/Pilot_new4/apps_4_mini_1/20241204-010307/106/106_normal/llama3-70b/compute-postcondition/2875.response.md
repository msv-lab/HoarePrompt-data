The statement `parent[2][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the tuple `(cur, piece)` to the `parent` matrix at the position `[2][ncur]`. The values of the variables `N`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and `dist` are not changed by this assignment, and therefore remain valid. 

The output state indicates that `parent[2][ncur]` now contains the value `(cur, piece)`. The other variables retain their original definitions.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`**.
