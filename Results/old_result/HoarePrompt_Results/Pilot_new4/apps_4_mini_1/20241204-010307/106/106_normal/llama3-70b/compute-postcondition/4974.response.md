The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. Given that `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of `0` to `N-2` or `N-1`, and `N` is between 3 and 10, we can say that `ncur` will take on the value from the 2D array `A` at the specified indices.

The values of the other variables (`N`, `y`, `x`, `nx`, `ny`) remain unchanged, but we have established that `ncur` is now defined.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 1 and `N-2`; `x` is between 1 and `N-2`; `nx` is between 0 and `N-2` or `N-1`; `ny` is between 0 and `N-2` or `N-1`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
