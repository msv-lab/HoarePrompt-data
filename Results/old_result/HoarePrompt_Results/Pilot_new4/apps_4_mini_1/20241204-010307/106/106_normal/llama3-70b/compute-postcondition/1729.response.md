The code updates the value of `dist[2][ncur]` to be equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`. The initial state indicates that the distance from `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, meaning `dist[2][ncur]` must have been greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1` before this line of code is executed. After the execution, the value of `dist[2][ncur]` is no longer greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1` because it is now set to be equal to it.

The other variables remain unchanged, but we now have a new equality established for `dist[2][ncur]`. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `x` is between 1 and `N-2`, `nx` is between 0 and `N-1`, `ny` is between 0 and `N-1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 2, and `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
