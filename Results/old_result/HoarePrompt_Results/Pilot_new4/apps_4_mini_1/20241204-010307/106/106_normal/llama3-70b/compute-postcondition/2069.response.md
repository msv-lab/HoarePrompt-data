Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 5, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is `y - 1`, and if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` equals 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is updated to a combination of `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. Otherwise, if the conditions are not met, no changes are made.***
