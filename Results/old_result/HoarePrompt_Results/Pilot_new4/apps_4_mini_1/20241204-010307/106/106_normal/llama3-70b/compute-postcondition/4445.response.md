Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `4 <= N <= 11`, `y` is equal to `N`, `A` is a valid two-dimensional array, `cur` is a valid position in `A`, `dist[1]` and `parent[1]` may remain unchanged, `queue` contains valid positions, `nx` is equal to `x`, `ny` is equal to `N + 1`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][N + 1]`.**
