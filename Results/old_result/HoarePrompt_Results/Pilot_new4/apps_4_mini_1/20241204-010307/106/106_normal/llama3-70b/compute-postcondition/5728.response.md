The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the list `queue`. The initial state indicates that `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` and `ny` are calculated as `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. This means that the new element being added to the `queue` will contain the current value of `ncur` along with the integer `1`.

The other variables stated in the initial conditions remain unchanged; only `queue` is updated with a new tuple. Therefore, the output state is as follows:

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` contains tuples of (ncur, 0) and now also (ncur, 1), `dist` is updated such that `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent` is updated such that `parent[1][ncur] = (cur, piece)`, `piece` is defined before the loop, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the range of 0 to `N`.**
