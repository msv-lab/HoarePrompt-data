Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `x` is within the bounds of `A`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[2][ncur]` contains the minimum distance from `cur` to each reachable position `ncur` that satisfies the conditions during the loop execution, `parent[2][ncur]` represents all previous positions leading to each updated `ncur`, and `queue` contains all updated reachable positions from `cur` that were appended during the loop executions. If the loop did not execute, `dist` and `parent` remain unchanged, and `queue` would be empty.**
