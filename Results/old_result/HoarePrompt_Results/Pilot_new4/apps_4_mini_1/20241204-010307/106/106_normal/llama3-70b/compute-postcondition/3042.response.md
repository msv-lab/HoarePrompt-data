The statement `parent[2][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the tuple `(cur, piece)` to `parent[2][ncur]`. The values of `cur` and `piece` are being used here, but since the specific values of `cur` and `ncur` are not provided, we can only state that `parent[2][ncur]` will now reflect those specific values.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. The only variable affected by the code is `parent[2][ncur]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `piece` is 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[1]` reflects predecessors for each reachable position, `queue` contains all processed tuples, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]` where both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`.**
