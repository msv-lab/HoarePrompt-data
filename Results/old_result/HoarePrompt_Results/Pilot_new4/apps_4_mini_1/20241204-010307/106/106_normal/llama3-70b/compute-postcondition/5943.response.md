The assignment `ncur = A[nx][ny]` means that `ncur` is assigned the value from the 2D array `A` at the position indexed by `nx` and `ny`. The values of `N`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, and `ny` do not change due to this operation, but we can specify the conditions as follows:

- `N` is between 3 and 10.
- `y` is between 0 and 8 (inclusive).
- `dx` is 0.
- `dy` is -1.
- `nx` is equal to `x`.
- `ny` is between -1 and 7 (inclusive).
- `ncur` takes the value of `A[nx][ny]`, which depends on the specific values of `nx` and `ny`.

Since `nx` is equal to `x` and `ny` can range between -1 and 7 (inclusive), the output will reflect that `ncur` is now assigned a value from the array `A` based on these indices. However, without specific values for `A`, `nx`, or `ny`, we cannot determine the exact value of `ncur`. 

Thus, the Output State remains:

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 0 and 8 (inclusive); `dx` is 0; `dy` is -1; `nx` is equal to `x`; `ny` is between -1 and 7 (inclusive); `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
