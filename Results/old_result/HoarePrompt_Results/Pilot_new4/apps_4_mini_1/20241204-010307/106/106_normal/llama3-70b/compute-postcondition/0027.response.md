The code appends a tuple containing `ncur` and `0` to the `queue`. The variable `ncur` is derived from the previous state, specifically as `A[x - 2][y + 1]`. The state of the other variables remains unaffected. Therefore, the output state preserves all the valid information from the initial state and includes the new entry in the `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, `piece` is 0, `cur` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 2][y + 1]`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value (1, 0), and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`**.
