The code assigns a new value to `dist[0][ncur]`, which is calculated based on the current distance `dist[0][cur]`. The value of `dist[0][ncur]` becomes `dist[0][cur] + 1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is equal to `N`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `N + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x + dx][N + dy]`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged; `dist[0][ncur] = dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
