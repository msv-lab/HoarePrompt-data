Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is adjusted to be between 0 and N-2, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to equal `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. If the conditions for `nx` and `ny` are not met, no actions are performed.***
