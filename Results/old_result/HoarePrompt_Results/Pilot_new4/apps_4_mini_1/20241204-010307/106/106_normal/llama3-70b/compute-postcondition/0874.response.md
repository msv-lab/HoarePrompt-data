The code snippet assigns values to the `parent` array. Specifically, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the tuple `(cur, piece)`. The variables affected by this operation are `parent[2][ncur]`, which will now hold a tuple consisting of `cur` and `piece`. The previous state of `parent[2][ncur]` is not defined but is updated to this new value. The other variables retain their values as they are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 0; `y` is 0; `nx` is 0; `ny` is 0; `ncur` is equal to `A[0][0]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is assigned `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`**.
