The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is equal to `x + dx` and `ny` is equal to `y + dy`. The initial state indicates that `N` is between 3 and 10, `x` and `y` are both between 0 and `N-1`, which means `nx` and `ny` are also valid indices within the bounds of the array `A`.

The values of `ncur` will depend on the specific values of `nx` and `ny`, but they will always fall within the range defined by the array dimensions since `nx` and `ny` are derived from `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 0 and `N-1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
