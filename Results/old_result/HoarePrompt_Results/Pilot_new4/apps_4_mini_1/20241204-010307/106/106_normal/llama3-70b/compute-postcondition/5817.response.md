The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The initial state mentions that `ncur` does not have a valid value due to out-of-bounds access, meaning it could potentially be invalid. The value of `piece` is 1, and the other variables remain unchanged. Since `queue` is being updated with a new tuple, we need to account for that in the output state.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; `queue` now contains all satisfying tuples `(ncur, 0)` and the new tuple `(ncur, 1)`; `dist[0][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur`; `parent[0][ncur]` is updated for each valid `ncur`; `piece` remains 0 for all appended tuples; `dx` is -1; `dy` is -1; `nx` is 0; `ny` is -1; `ncur` is not assigned a valid value due to out-of-bounds access; the current value of `piece` is 1; `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1; parent[1][ncur]` is `(cur, 1)`; `queue` includes the new tuple `(ncur, 1)`.**
