The provided code snippet updates the values of `nx` and `ny` based on the current coordinates `x` and `y` and the offsets `dx` and `dy`. Since these variables are being calculated directly from `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`, the exact values of `nx` and `ny` will depend on the specific values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. 

The conditions for `N`, `piece`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged as they are not impacted by the assignment of `nx` and `ny`. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `piece` is equal to 1, `dist[1]` is updated for all valid `ncur` positions, `parent[1][ncur]` contains associated parent positions, `dist[0][ncur]` remains equal to the minimum distance from `(0, 2)`, `parent[0][ncur]` retains updated parent positions, `queue` contains tuples `(ncur, 0)` and newly appended tuples `(ncur, 1)` for each valid knight move, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, and `ny` is equal to `y + dy`.**
