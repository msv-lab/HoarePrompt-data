Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `piece` is equal to `1`, `dist[0]` holds the updated shortest distances for reachable positions, and `parent[0]` indicates the predecessors for those reachable positions. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and if `piece` is equal to `1` and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. If the condition is not satisfied, there are no updates made to these variables.***
