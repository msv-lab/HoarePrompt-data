Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` is not empty, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `queue` has an additional entry `(ncur, 0)`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece` if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`. If the conditions are not satisfied, there are no changes made to `queue`, `dist`, or `parent`.***
