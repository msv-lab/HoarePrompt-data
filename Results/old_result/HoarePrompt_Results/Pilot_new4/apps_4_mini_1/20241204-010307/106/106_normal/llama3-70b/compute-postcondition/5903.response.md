Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is between 0 and 8 (inclusive), `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `dist[1][cur]` remains unchanged, `dist[0]` has been updated based on valid `(nx, ny)` pairs, `parent[0]` stores tuples of previous indices leading to `ncur`, `queue` now contains tuples of `(ncur, 0)` for each valid move that met the conditions and also includes `(ncur, 1)`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of 0 and N (exclusive), `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 1, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned `(cur, 1)`**
