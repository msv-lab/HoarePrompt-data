In the provided code snippet, `nx` and `ny` are assigned values based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. The initial values for `dx` and `dy` are both -1. Therefore, `nx` will be calculated as `x - 1` and `ny` as `y - 1`. 

The other variables (`dist`, `parent`, and `queue`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y - 1, dist` remains unchanged, `parent` remains unchanged, `queue` remains unchanged.**
