The code `parent[2][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the value of `cur` to the `parent` array at the index `[2][ncur]`, along with the value of `piece`. However, the actual content of `piece` does not affect the assignment since it is included in the assignment operation without affecting the previously mentioned variable states. The other variables retain their previous values. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is at least 4, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices where `parent[2][ncur]` is now updated to `cur`, `piece` is still 2, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, and `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent[2][ncur]` is updated to `cur`, `piece` is still 2, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
