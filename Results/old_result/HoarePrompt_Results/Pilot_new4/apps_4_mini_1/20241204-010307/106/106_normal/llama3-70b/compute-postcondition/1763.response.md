The code appends a tuple containing the value of `ncur` and `0` to the `queue`. The other variables remain unaffected by this operation. The values of `ncur`, `piece`, `dist`, and `parent` remain as defined in the initial state.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 2; `dx` is 2; `dy` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x + 2`; `ny` is 3; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is 0; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur`; `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`**.
