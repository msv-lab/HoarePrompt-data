The code snippet calculates new coordinates `nx` and `ny` by adding `dx` to `x` and `dy` to `y`, respectively. However, the values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided in the initial state. Since `x` is currently `0` and `y` is `1`, the values of `nx` and `ny` will depend on `dx` and `dy`. Hence, the output state must reflect that `nx` and `ny` are defined in terms of `dx` and `dy`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is `0 + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, `dist[1]` reflects the shortest distance relevant to the moves, `parent[1]` reflects the current parent node relevant to the moves, `queue` contains at least one valid `(ncur, 1)` tuple.**
