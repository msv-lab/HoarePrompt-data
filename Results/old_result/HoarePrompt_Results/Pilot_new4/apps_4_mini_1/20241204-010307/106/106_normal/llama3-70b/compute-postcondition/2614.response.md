The `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`. The previous values of the affected variables, `ncur`, is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `cur` remains unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is an integer less than `N - 1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.**
