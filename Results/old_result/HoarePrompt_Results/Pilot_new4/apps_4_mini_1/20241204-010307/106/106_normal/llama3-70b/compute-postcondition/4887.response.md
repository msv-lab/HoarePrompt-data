The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The current direction is given as `(1, 0)`, which indicates that `dx` is `1` and `dy` is `0`. The values of `x` and `y` are unknown, but they will be updated based on this calculation.

Given this, we can express `nx` as `x + 1` and `ny` as `y + 0`, simplifying to `ny = y`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated values for `nx` and `ny` based on the initial values of `x` and `y`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `dist[1]` contains the shortest path distances; `parent[1]` contains the corresponding parent positions; `queue` contains valid `(ncur, 1)` positions; current direction is (1, 0); `nx` is `x + 1`; `ny` is `y`.**
