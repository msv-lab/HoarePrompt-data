The line of code assigns a new value to `dist[1][ncur]`. Specifically, `dist[1][ncur]` is set to the value of `dist[1][cur] + 1`. The values and relationships among the variables are as follows:

- `ncur` is computed as `A[x + dx][y + dy]`, which means it holds the value at the coordinates `(x + dx, y + dy)` in the array `A`.
- `cur` is assumed to be defined previously, and `dist[1][cur]` holds some integer value, which we do not know but is referenced for the calculation.
- The state of `N`, `y`, `nx`, and `ny` remains unchanged.

Since `dist[1][cur]` gets incremented by 1 to update `dist[1][ncur]`, we conclude that `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to the previous value of `dist[1][cur]` plus one.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is the current y-coordinate, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x + dx][y + dy]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
