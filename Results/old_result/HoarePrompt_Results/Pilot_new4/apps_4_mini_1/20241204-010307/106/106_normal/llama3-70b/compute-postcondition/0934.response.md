The line of code `queue.append((ncur, 1))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the variable `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `1` are used directly in the operation. The other variables stay unchanged. Since `ncur` is derived from `A[-1][2]`, it retains whatever value it had prior to this operation. 

Given that the specific values of `ncur`, `dist`, and `parent` are not provided in the initial state, we only note that `ncur` is present and is appended to `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is -1, `ny` is 2, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `ncur` is equal to `A[-1][2]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is updated to `cur, piece`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`**
