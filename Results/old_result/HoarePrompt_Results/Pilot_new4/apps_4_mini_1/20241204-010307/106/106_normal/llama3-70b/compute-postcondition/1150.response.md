The statement `dist[0][ncur] = dist[0][cur] + 1` updates the value of `dist[0][ncur]`. 

Given that:
- `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, which depends on the current values of `nx` and `ny`.
- `nx` is `1 + dx` and `ny` is `1 + dy`, where `dx` and `dy` are indices that correspond to possible movements from `(x, y)`.
- The initial values of `piece` and `dist[0][ncur]` are such that `piece` is set to 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`.

After executing the code, `dist[0][ncur]` will be updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`. This indicates that the distance from the starting point to `ncur` has been adjusted based on the distance to the current point plus one.

The output state would reflect that `dist[0][ncur]` has changed but does not provide specifics on the values since they depend on the indices of `A` and the prior state of `dist`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 1; `A` must have dimensions that allow access to indices from `(x + dx, y + dy)` for each `dx, dy` in the list; `piece` is 0; `nx` is `1 + dx`; `ny` is `1 + dy`; `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`**.
