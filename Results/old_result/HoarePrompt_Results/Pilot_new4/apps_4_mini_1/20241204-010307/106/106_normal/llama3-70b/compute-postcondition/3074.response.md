The line of code `parent[0][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the value of the tuple `(cur, piece)` to the element `parent[0][ncur]`. This means `parent[0][ncur]` now holds the values of `cur` and `piece`. The other variables remain unchanged based on the provided initial conditions.

The values of `cur` and `piece` have not been specified, but `piece` is given as `0`. The value for `cur` is assumed to be pre-existing and valid for the operation. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `piece` is 0, `dx` is 2, `dy` is 1, `ny` is 3, `nx` is equal to `x + 2`, the current value of `nx` is between 0 and `N`, the current value of `ny` is between 0 and `N`, `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, 0)`**.
