The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to the element `parent[0][ncur]`. The values of `ncur`, `cur`, and `piece` are not specified, but `ncur` is derived from `A[nx][ny]`. The other variables retain their previous values. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is within `0` and `N-1`, `y` is within `0` and `N-1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`**.
