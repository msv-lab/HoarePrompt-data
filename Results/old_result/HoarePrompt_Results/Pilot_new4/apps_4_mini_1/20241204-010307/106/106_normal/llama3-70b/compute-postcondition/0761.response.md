The code snippet updates the variables `nx` and `ny` by adding the current values of `x` and `y` to `dx` and `dy` respectively. The previous values of `x` and `y` are within defined constraints, while `dx` and `dy` are unspecified in the initial state. 

Since `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is either `2` or `3`, and `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, the potential new values for `nx` and `ny` depend on the values of `dx` and `dy`.

After the execution, the output can be represented as follows:

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is `2 or 3`, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`.**
