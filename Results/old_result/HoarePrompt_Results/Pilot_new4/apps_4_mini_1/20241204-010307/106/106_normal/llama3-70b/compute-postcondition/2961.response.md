The code updates the values of `nx` and `ny` by adding the corresponding values from the tuples `dx` and `dy` to the current `x` and `y` positions. Since the next movement tuple is one of `[(1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`, we can determine the values for `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x` and `y`.

The previous values of `x` and `y` are not provided, but we know `dx` and `dy` will take values from the next movement tuples. Therefore, for each tuple:

1. If `dx = 1` and `dy = 0`: 
   - `nx = x + 1`
   - `ny = y`
   
2. If `dx = 0` and `dy = -1`: 
   - `nx = x`
   - `ny = y - 1`

3. If `dx = 0` and `dy = 1`: 
   - `nx = x`
   - `ny = y + 1`

For the output state, since `x` and `y` are not explicitly defined, we represent `nx` and `ny` based on the movement tuples while retaining the initial conditions of `N`, `y`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `dist` reflects the shortest distances for all reachable positions, `parent` indicates the predecessors for each reachable position, `queue` still contains at least one tuple of a reachable position processed during the iterations, `nx` is equal to `x + dx` and `ny` is equal to `y + dy` for the respective movement tuples.**
