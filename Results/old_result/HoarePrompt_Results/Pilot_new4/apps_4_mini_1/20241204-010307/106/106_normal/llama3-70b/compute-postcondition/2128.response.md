The code assigns the value of `cur` to `parent[0][ncur]`, and also assigns the value of `piece` to `parent[0][ncur]`. This means that the `parent` array is updated at index `[0][ncur]` to hold a tuple of `(cur, piece)`. The states of the other variables are not affected, so their previous values remain valid. 

Output State: **`dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices; `piece` is 0; `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`**.
