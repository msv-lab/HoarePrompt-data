The code appends a tuple containing `ncur` and `1` to the `queue`. This affects only the `queue` variable, which is updated to include the new tuple. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State includes the existing state of all variables and reflects the updated `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is updated to `dx`, `ny` is updated to `dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[dx][dy]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `piece` is assigned, `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`**
