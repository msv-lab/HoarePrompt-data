The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and the contents of `dist` and `parent` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged values of these variables while noting that the `queue` has been updated.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `nx` is `dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `ncur` is `A[dx][2 + dy]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated based on `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur, piece`, `queue` has appended `(ncur, 2)`**.
