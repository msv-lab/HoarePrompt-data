The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is equal to `x + dx` and `ny` is equal to `y + dy`. Since `nx` and `ny` are confirmed to be within the bounds of `A`, the value of `ncur` is now determined by the elements in the array `A` at the positions `[nx][ny]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `x + dx` is within the bounds of `A`, `y + dy` is within the bounds of `A`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[1][ncur]` contains the minimum distance from `cur` to each reachable position `ncur`, `parent[1][ncur]` represents the previous positions leading to each `ncur`, `queue` contains all updated reachable positions from `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the range 0 to `N - 1` inclusive, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
