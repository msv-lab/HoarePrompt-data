The code assigns a value to `parent[2][ncur]`. This value is a tuple containing `cur` and `piece`. The values of `cur` and `piece` are already defined in the initial state, while other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `parent[2][ncur]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `dist[1][ncur]` contains the updated minimum distances for reachable cells from `cur`, `parent[1][ncur]` contains the corresponding parents for those reachable cells, `queue` contains all reachable cells and their corresponding pieces that were added during the loop iterations, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is `(cur, piece)`**.
