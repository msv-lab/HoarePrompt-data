The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` and `ny` are derived from the initial state. The variable `piece` remains unchanged, as do `dist`, `parent`, and `queue`. The newly assigned value for `ncur` comes from the 2D array `A` at the specified indices `nx` and `ny`. 

Output State: **`dist` contains valid distances for reachable indices, `parent[0][ncur]` initialized for valid `ncur`, `piece` is 0, `queue` contains at least one tuple (ncur, 0), `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]` where nx and ny are within bounds.**
