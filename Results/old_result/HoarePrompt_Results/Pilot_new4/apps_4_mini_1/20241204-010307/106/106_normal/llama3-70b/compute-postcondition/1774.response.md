According to the code, the for loop iterates over a list of tuples representing the changes in the `dx` and `dy` coordinates. The loop will execute once for each tuple in the list. 

At the end of the last iteration, `dx` is -2 and `dy` is -1, which corresponds to the first tuple in the list. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to move to the next tuple in the list.

The next tuple in the list is `(-2, 1)`. Therefore, after this iteration, `dx` will be -2 and `dy` will be 1.

Since all the other states (`N`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `piece`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue`) are unaffected by the loop iteration itself, they remain the same unless the loop body performs an update, which it does not in this case.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is 0, and if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is set to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is updated to `cur, piece`, and `queue` now includes `(ncur, 0)`**.
