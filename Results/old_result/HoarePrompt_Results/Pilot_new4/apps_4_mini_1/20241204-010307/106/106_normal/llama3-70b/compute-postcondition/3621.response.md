The code assigns new values to `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x` and `y`, as well as the values of `dx` and `dy`. The values of `N`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged, but `nx` and `ny` are calculated as follows:

- `nx` becomes `x + dx`.
- `ny` becomes `y + dy`.

Given that `x` is between `0` and `N-1` and `y` is also between `0` and `N-1`, and at least one of the resulting coordinates `(nx, ny)` must be valid, it implies that the new calculated values for `nx` and `ny` respect the bounds set by `N`.

Therefore, the Output State includes the unchanged values of `N`, `x`, and `y`, alongside the new expressions for `nx` and `ny`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and N-1, `y` is between 0 and N-1, `nx = x + dx`, `ny = y + dy`, at least one of the resulting coordinates `(nx, ny)` must be valid, and `ncur` is updated for valid moves.**
