To analyze the impact of the code `nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy`, let's consider the variables involved:

1. `N` is between 3 and 10.
2. `y` is between 1 and N-2.
3. `x` is between 1 and N-2.
4. `piece` is 1.
5. `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively.

Since `dx` and `dy` are not defined in the initial state, we cannot assign specific values to `nx` and `ny`. However, we can express them in terms of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`.

The impact of the code assigns new values to `nx` and `ny`, which depend on the variables `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. 

The output state after executing the code will maintain the relationships and ranges defined previously, with `nx` and `ny` reflecting their new calculated values.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 1 and N-2; `x` is between 1 and N-2; `piece` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`.**
