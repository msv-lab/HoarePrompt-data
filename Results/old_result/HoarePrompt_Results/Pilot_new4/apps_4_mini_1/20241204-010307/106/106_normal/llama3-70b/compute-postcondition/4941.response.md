The statement `parent[1][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the values `cur` and `piece` to the `parent` array at the index `[1][ncur]`. The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged since the assignment does not affect them.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 1 and N-2; `x` is between 1 and N-2; `nx` is `x + dx` where `dx` is within bounds; `ny` is `y + dy` where `dy` is within bounds; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`.**
