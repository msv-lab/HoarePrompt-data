The code assigns a new value to `parent[2][ncur]`, setting it equal to the tuple `(cur, piece)`. The initial state mentions that `ncur` holds the value `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is equal to `x + dx` and `ny` is equal to `y + dy`. The variable `piece` is equal to 2.

The state of `parent[2][ncur]` is updated, but the values of other variables such as `N`, `queue`, `dist`, `parent`, `nx`, `ny`, and `cur` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10; `queue` contains tuples of (A[nx][ny], 0) and (A[nx][ny], 1); `dist[1][ncur]` is updated accordingly; `parent[1][ncur]` holds the corresponding values; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is equal to 2; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; and `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, 2)`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `queue` contains tuples of (A[nx][ny], 0) and (A[nx][ny], 1); `dist[1][ncur]` is updated accordingly; `parent[1][ncur]` holds the corresponding values; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is equal to 2; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, 2)`**.
