The `queue` variable is being modified by appending a new tuple to it, which contains the values of `ncur` and `0`. The other variables remain unchanged, but now `queue` contains an additional element.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is within `0` and `N-1`, `y` is within `0` and `N-1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, the current values of `nx` and `ny` are such that `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `dist[0][cur]` remains unchanged, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` has a new element `(ncur, 0)` appended to it.**
