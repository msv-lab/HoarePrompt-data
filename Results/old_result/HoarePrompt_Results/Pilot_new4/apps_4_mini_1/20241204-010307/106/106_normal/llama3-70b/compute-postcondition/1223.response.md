Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 1; `nx` is 2; `ny` is 1; `dx` is 1; `dy` is 0; `ncur` is equal to `A[2][1]`. If `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
