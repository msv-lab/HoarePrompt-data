Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `dx` is 2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is 2, `ny` is 3, `ncur` is equal to `A[2][3]`. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`, and `(ncur, 0)` is added to `queue`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
