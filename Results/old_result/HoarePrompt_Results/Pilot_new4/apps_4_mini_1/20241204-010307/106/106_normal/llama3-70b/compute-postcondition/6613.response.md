Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `0 + dy`. If the conditions `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` are satisfied, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `queue` includes the element `(ncur, 1)`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the state.***
