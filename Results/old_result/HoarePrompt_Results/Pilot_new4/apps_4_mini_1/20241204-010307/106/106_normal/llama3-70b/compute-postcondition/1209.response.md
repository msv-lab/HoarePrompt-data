According to the code, the loop iterates over a list of tuples representing directional movements (up, down, left, right). The loop will execute one more time for each tuple in the list. At the end of the last iteration, `dx` and `dy` correspond to the current direction being processed.

Since `dx` and `dy` are updated on each iteration of the loop, they will take the values from the list of tuples sequentially. The list `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]` contains four tuples, meaning the loop will execute four times, once for each tuple.

After the last iteration, `dx` and `dy` will be set to `(0, 1)`, which is the last tuple. For the loop to execute one more time, the next tuple must be the first one again, which will reset `dx` and `dy` to `(-1, 0)`, essentially cycling through the list.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are the values of `dx` and `dy`. They will be reset to the start of the list.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 1; `nx` is either 0, 2, or 1; `ny` is either 0, 1, or 2; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 0**
