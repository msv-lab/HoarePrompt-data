The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are defined as `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. We know that `N` is at least 5, and the other variables `dist`, `parent`, and `piece` remain unchanged. Therefore, `ncur` will take the value from the 2D array `A` at the updated indices `nx` and `ny`.

Output State: **`N` is at least 5, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the most recent parents for all reachable indices, `piece` is equal to 2, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
