According to the code, the loop iterates over the list of direction tuples `[(dx, dy)]`, which indicates the possible movements in a grid (up, down, left, right). 

At the end of the last iteration, `y` is 1, and `dx` and `dy` represent the directional movement from the current position `(x, y)`. Specifically, the loop will execute four times, once for each direction. Given that `y` is currently 1, the next iterations for `dy` will represent the movements that correspond to the next `dx, dy` tuples.

The possible tuples are:
1. `(-1, 0)` - moving up to `(x, y - 1)`
2. `(1, 0)` - moving down to `(x, y + 1)`
3. `(0, -1)` - moving left to `(x - 1, y)`
4. `(0, 1)` - moving right to `(x + 1, y)`

Thus, if we are currently on the second iteration of the loop, where `dx` and `dy` correspond to `(1, 0)`, then moving down would yield `ny = y + dy = 1 + 0 = 1`, and `nx = x + dx = x + 1`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, we are on the first `for` loop iteration, which corresponds to direction `(-1, 0)` or moving up. So, after the first iteration, we would be on the second iteration, which corresponds to the direction `(1, 0)`.

In order for the loop to execute one more time:
- The next direction tuple is `(0, -1)`, moving left.
- Therefore, for the next iteration, `dy` will be -1, meaning `y` will remain the same at 1 when moving left.

This means for the next state:
- `y` will be adjusted according to the next directional movement from the current index.
- The index `dx, dy` will be (0, -1), thus the new `y` will be `1 + (-1) = 0` after the next iteration.

Thus, the state needs to reflect that `y` is now 0 and that `dx, dy` corresponds to the new direction being processed.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 0; `nx` is equal to `x + (0)`; `ny` is equal to `y + (-1)` (which is 0)**.
