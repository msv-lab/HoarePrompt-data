The code appends the tuple `(cur, i)` to the `queue`. The initial state indicates that `i` is a value not equal to 2, but doesn't specify `cur`. Since the other variables (`N`, `x`, `y`, `piece`, `dist[2]`, and `parent[2]`) are not affected by this operation, they remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and the updated `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 1, `piece` is 2, `i` is a value not equal to 2, `dist[2]` is updated for each valid `(nx, ny)`, `parent[2]` is updated accordingly, and `queue` now contains all valid moves along with the newly added `(cur, i)`**.
