The code assigns the values `cur` and `piece` to `parent[2][ncur]`. The previous values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `parent[2][ncur]`.

Output State: **`nx` is between 0 and `N-1`, `ny` is between 0 and `N-1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`**.
