Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` has iterated through all values from 0 to `N-1`, `dist` contains the shortest distances for all reachable positions based on the pieces, `parent` reflects the predecessors for each reachable position with their corresponding piece values, and `queue` contains tuples for all reachable positions processed during the iterations. If no conditions were met for any valid moves, `dist` and `parent` remain unchanged for those pieces, and `queue` will be unchanged for any piece that didn't generate new tuples.**
