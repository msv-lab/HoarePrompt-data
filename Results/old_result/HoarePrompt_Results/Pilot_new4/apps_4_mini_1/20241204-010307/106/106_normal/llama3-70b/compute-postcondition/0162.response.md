According to the code, the for loop iterates over the list of direction changes represented by `(dx, dy)`. Since there are 4 directions in the provided list, the loop will execute for each tuple in the list. 

At the end of the last iteration, `dx` and `dy` correspond to the last tuple in the list, which is `(0, 1)` for moving up. The loop will increment to the next tuple, cycling back to the first tuple after the last tuple has been processed.

Currently, `dx` is 0 and `dy` is 1. In the next iteration, the loop will take the next tuple, which is `(-1, 0)`.

State: **`N` is an integer between 3 and 10, `x` is greater than 1 and less than `N - 1`, `y` has been updated to `y + dy`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, and `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0**
