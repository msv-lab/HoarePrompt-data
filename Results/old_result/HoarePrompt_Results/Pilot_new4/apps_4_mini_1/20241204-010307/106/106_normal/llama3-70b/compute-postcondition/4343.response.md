In the initial state, the given variables are:
- `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`
- `y` is equal to `N`
- `nx` is equal to `x + dx`
- `ny` is equal to `N + dy`
- `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`
- `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`
- `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the tuple `(cur, piece)`

The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. This operation modifies the `queue` by adding a new element to it, but it doesn't change any of the previously defined variables.

Therefore, the output state captures the preconditions and highlights the change to the `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is equal to `N`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `N + dy`; `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the tuple `(cur, piece)`; the `queue` now includes `(ncur, 1)`.**
