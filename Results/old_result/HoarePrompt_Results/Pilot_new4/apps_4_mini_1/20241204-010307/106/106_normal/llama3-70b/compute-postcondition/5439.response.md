Postcondition: ***`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 2, `nx` is equal to `4 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, and both `nx` and `ny` are between 0 and N-1. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to equal `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, `piece` is assigned to `parent[0][ncur]`, and the tuple `(ncur, 0)` is appended to `queue`. Otherwise, there are no changes made to the variables.***
