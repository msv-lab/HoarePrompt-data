The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. Given that `y` is equal to `N`, we can update `ny` to `N + dy`. The values of `N`, `y`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged, and only the values of `nx` and `ny` are affected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is equal to `N`, `dist` is updated for valid `ncur` positions, `parent` is updated for valid `ncur` positions, `queue` contains tuples of `(ncur, 0)` for valid positions; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `N + dy`.**
