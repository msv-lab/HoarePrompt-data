Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `dist[0]` remains unchanged; `parent[0]` remains unchanged except `parent[0][ncur]` is now equal to `cur, piece`; `dx` is -1; `dy` is -2; `nx` is -1; `ny` is -1; `ncur` is equal to `A[-1][-1]` and if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `queue` includes the element `(ncur, 0)`; otherwise, all variables retain their original values.***
