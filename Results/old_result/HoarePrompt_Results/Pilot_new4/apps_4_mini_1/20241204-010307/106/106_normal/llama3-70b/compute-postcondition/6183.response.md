Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all valid reachable cells based on the original `dist[1][cur]`, `parent[1][ncur]` contains the corresponding previous cells and pieces for all reachable cells, and `queue` contains tuples for all valid reachable cells and piece 1. If no valid positions were reachable, `dist[1]` and `parent[1]` remain unchanged from their initial state.**
