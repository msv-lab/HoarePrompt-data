The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. From the initial state, we have `nx = x + (-1)` and `ny = y + 1`. The values of `dx` and `dy` are equal to `-1` and `1`, respectively. Therefore, after the assignment, `nx` and `ny` will be updated as follows: 

1. `nx` becomes `x - 1`.
2. `ny` becomes `y + 1`.

The value of `N` remains unchanged, `y` remains 0, and `A[x][0]` remains equal to `cur`. The conditions about the bounds of `nx` and `ny` still hold true.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `cur` is a valid index, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1`, and both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid (0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N).**
