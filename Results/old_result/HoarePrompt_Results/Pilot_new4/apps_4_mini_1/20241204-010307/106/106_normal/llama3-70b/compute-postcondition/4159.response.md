The statement assigns a value to `parent[1][ncur]`, which takes the value of `cur` (undefined in the current context) and the variable `piece`. Since `cur` is undefined, we cannot determine its value or the specific impact on `parent[1][ncur]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged because they are not directly affected by the code. Therefore, the output state lists the unchanged variables and notes the assignment, even though `cur` is undefined.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 0; `y` is 2; `nx` is -1; `ny` is 3; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 1; `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[-1][3]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur` and `piece` (with `cur` being undefined).**
