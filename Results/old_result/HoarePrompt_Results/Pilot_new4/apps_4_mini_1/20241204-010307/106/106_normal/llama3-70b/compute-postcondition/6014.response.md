The code updates the value of `dist[2][ncur]` to be equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`. Given that `dist[2][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, this means that the distance from the current position to `ncur` is now updated to a smaller value, indicating a shorter path has been found. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 9, `y` is 9, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is 9, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur` reachable from the starting position, `parent[1][ncur]` contains the parent relationships for each updated `ncur`, `queue` contains all valid updated `(ncur, 1)` tuples, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0 (for the first iteration), `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]` where `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, the piece is equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
