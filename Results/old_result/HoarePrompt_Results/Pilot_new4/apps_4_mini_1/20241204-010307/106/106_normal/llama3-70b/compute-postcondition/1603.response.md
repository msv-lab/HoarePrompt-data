The values of `nx` and `ny` are computed based on the initial values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. From the initial state, we know that `dx` is -2 and `dy` is 1. Thus, `ny` becomes `y + dy`, which is equal to `0 + 1 = 1`. For `nx`, we have `nx = x + dx`, which simplifies to `nx = x - 2`. The values of `ncur` and the bounds of `A[nx][ny]` are not immediately affected by this assignment.

The output state will reflect the updated values of `nx` and `ny`. The other variables retain their initial conditions.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is 1, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]` (if it were in bounds), `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1.**
