Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` contains tuples of (`ncur`, 0) for each valid (nx, ny) that was within the range [0, N-1] after executing all iterations. `dist[0][ncur]` is the minimum distance from `cur` for each corresponding `ncur`, updated during the loop if `piece` is 0 and the distance condition was met. `parent[0][ncur]` holds the values `(cur, piece)` for each `ncur` that was updated. `x` remains 0, `y` remains 2, and the values of `nx` and `ny` will have been calculated as `dx` and `2 + dy` respectively for all iterations. If none of the conditions were satisfied, `dist` and `parent` remain unchanged for those `ncur`.**
