The code assigns the value of `cur` to `parent[1][ncur]`, and the variable `piece` is also assigned alongside it. The other variables remain unchanged. The output state must reflect that `parent[1][ncur]` is now equal to `cur` along with the value of `piece`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is updated to `dx`, `ny` is updated to `dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[dx][dy]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, and `piece` is assigned.**
