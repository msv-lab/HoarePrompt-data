According to the code, the loop iterates over the tuples in the list `[(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]`. The loop will execute once for each tuple in this list. Since the last values assigned to `dx` and `dy` were `(1, 1)`, it indicates that the last iteration processed the last tuple of the list.

To execute one more time, we have to consider that there are no more tuples left in the list for the loop to process. Thus, the next iteration cannot happen because all tuples have been processed.

Since there is no new state or changes to be made for additional iterations, the current state remains unchanged. However, for clarity, we can state the last processed `dx` and `dy` values.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; if `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds (0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N), then `queue` may contain multiple elements including `(ncur, 1)` which is appended; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]` (where `nx` is 1 and `ny` is 2); `dist[0][ncur]` reflects the minimum distance found from `cur` to `ncur` incremented by the number of valid iterations; `parent[0][ncur]` holds the last valid parent value of `(cur, piece)`; if `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`; `dx` is 1, `dy` is 1**
