The values of `nx` and `ny` are updated based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. Specifically, `nx` becomes `x + dx`, and `ny` becomes `y + dy`. Given that `dx` is 1 and `dy` is -1, we can express the updated values as `nx = x + 1` and `ny = y - 1`. 

The other variables remain unchanged. The condition `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` will determine whether `ncur` is assigned a value from `A[nx][ny]`, but since we do not have specific values for `x`, `y`, or `A`, we cannot specify the value of `ncur`. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `dx` is 1, `dy` is -1, `piece` is either 0 or 1, `nx` is equal to `x + 1`, `ny` is equal to `y - 1`.**
