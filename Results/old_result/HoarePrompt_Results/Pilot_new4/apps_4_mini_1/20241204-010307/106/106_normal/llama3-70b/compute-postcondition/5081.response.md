Postcondition: ***`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 3, `y` is 0. If `A[x][y]` equals `cur`, then `dist` contains the shortest distances from (3, 0) to all reachable positions, `parent` reflects the parent tuples for those positions that were updated, `queue` contains its previous valid tuples plus the new tuple `(cur, i)`, and the current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`. If `piece` equals `i`, then `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initial values.***
