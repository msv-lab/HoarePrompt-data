After executing the code snippet, the variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. Given that `nx` is equal to `x + dx` and `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and that the current values of `nx` and `ny` are both within the range [0, N-1], `ncur` takes on the value contained in the 2D list `A` at the indices `[nx][ny]`. 

The states of the other variables remain unchanged, but `ncur` is now defined based on the value extracted from the matrix `A`. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `dist[1][ncur]` represents the shortest distance from `cur` to each valid `ncur`; `parent[1][ncur]` contains the previous state `(cur, piece)`; `queue` contains valid `(ncur, 1)` tuples; values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, and `A[0][0]` remain unchanged; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
