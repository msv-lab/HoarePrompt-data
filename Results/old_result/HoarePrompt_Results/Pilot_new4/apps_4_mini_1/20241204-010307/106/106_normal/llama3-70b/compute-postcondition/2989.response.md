The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the list `queue`. The variables `N`, `y`, `dist`, `parent`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` remain unchanged, but the `queue` variable is updated to include a new tuple.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dist` reflects the shortest distances for all reachable positions, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, 0)`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `queue` now contains the previous elements plus the new tuple `(ncur, 0)`**.
