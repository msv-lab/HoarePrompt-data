The code assigns the value of `dist[2][cur] + 1` to `dist[2][ncur]`. Given that `dist[2][ncur]` is currently greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, this means that after the assignment, `dist[2][ncur]` will now be equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`. 

The states of the other variables (`N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `dist[1]`, `parent[1]`, `queue`, and `piece`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is `0 + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, `dist[1]` remains unchanged, `parent[1]` remains unchanged, `queue` may contain tuples of positions that were explored, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 2, and `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
