Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is either `x-1`, `x+1`, or `x`, `ny` is either `1`, `0`, or `2` depending on the iteration of `(dx, dy)`. The current values of `nx` and `ny` satisfy the conditions `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`.***
