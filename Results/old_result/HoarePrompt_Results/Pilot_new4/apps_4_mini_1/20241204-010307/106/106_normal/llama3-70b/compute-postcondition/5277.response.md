The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned new values based on the calculations using `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. The specific values are computed as follows: 

- `nx` becomes `x + dx`, which is `4 + (-2)` = `2`. 
- `ny` becomes `y + dy`, which is `0 + 1` = `1`.

The range of `N` remains the same (between 4 and 10), and the values of `A[x][0]`, `A[4][0]`, `cur`, `dx`, and `dy` are unaffected by this operation. 

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 0, `nx` is 2, `ny` is 1, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `A[4][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1**.
