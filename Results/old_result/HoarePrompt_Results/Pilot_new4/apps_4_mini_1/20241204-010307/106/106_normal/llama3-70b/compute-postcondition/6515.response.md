Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 0 and `N-1`, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `dist[0]` reflects the shortest distances relevant to valid moves, `parent[0]` reflects the parent nodes relevant to valid moves, `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 1, and if `dist[1][ncur]` was greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1` and `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `cur`.***
