The code assigns the values of `cur` and `piece` to the `parent[0][ncur]` variable. The previous state of `parent[0][ncur]` is unknown, but it will now hold the tuple `(cur, piece)`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `0 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, the value of `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the range of 0 to `N`, `piece` is equal to 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur]`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is updated to `(cur, piece)`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `0 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, the value of `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the range of 0 to `N`, `piece` is equal to 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur]`, `parent[0][ncur]` is updated to `(cur, piece)`**.
