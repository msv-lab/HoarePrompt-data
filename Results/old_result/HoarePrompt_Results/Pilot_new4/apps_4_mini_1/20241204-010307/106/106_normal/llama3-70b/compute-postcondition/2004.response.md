The values of `nx` and `ny` are updated based on the expressions `nx = x + dx` and `ny = y + dy`. Given that `dx` is -1 and `dy` is 0, this means `nx` becomes `x - 1` and `ny` remains `y`. The states of the other variables are not affected, so the output state reflects these changes.

Output State: **`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent[2][ncur]` is updated to `cur`, `piece` remains 2, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is `y`, and `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1` if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`.**
