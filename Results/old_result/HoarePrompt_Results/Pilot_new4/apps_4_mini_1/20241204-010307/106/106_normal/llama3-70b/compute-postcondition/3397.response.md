The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, `nx` and `ny` will depend on the current values of `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy`. Since no specific values for these variables are provided, we cannot determine exact values for `nx` and `ny`, but we know they are calculated as described.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `piece` remains equal to 2; `dist` and `parent` are unchanged; `queue` retains its current entries; `ncur` is unchanged; `dist[2][ncur]` and `parent[2][ncur]` remain as they were at the end of the last iteration; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`.**
