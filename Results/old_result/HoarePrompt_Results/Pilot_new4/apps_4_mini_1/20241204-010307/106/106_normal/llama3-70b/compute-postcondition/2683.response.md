The expression `dist[1][ncur] = dist[1][cur] + 1` updates the `dist` array at the index `[1][ncur]`. The calculation involves adding 1 to the value of `dist[1][cur]`. The values of `N`, `y`, `A[x][y]`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, and `ny` remain unchanged. The value of `ncur` is derived from `A[nx][-2]`, but since its specific value is not provided, we will keep it as is.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is -1, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is 1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is -2, `ncur` is `A[nx][-2]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
