Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[0]` contains parent information, `queue` is empty, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]` where `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, `piece` is equal to 1, `dist[1][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[1][cur]`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur, piece`.**
