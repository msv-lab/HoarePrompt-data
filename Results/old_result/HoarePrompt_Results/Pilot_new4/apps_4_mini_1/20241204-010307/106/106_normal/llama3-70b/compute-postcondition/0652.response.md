The value of `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to be equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`. The current value of `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than that of `dist[1][cur] + 1`, which indicates that the update is valid and results in a decrease of the distance for node `ncur`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is valid.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `dist[0][ncur]` is valid, `parent[0][ncur]` is valid, `queue` contains valid `(ncur, 0)` entries, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, and `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` satisfy the conditions `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and `ncur = A[nx][ny]`, and `piece` is equal to 1.**
