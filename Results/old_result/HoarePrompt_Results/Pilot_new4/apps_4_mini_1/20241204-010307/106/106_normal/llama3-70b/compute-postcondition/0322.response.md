The code assigns the value `cur` to `parent[1][ncur]`, where `ncur` is equal to `A[x + 1][1]`. The states of the other variables are not affected, except for updating `parent[1][ncur]`. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `cur` is a valid index, `ncur` is equal to `A[x + 1][1]`, `nx` is equal to `x + 1`, `ny` is 1, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur`.**
