The values of `nx` and `ny` are assigned based on the expressions `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The value of `y` is equal to `N`, which is an integer in the range of 3 to 10. However, the variables `x` and `dx` are not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine the value of `nx`. The output state reflects the updates to `ny` while noting that `nx` remains undefined due to the lack of information about `x` and `dx`. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is equal to `N`, `ny` is equal to `N + dy`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx` (undefined due to undefined `x` and `dx`).**
