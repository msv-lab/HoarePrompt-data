The code assigns a new value to `dist[1][ncur]`, which is calculated based on the previous value of `dist[1][cur]` and a constant addition of 1. The initial state indicates that `ncur` is determined by the value at `A[nx][ny]`, but does not affect `dist` directly. We do not have specific values for `cur`, `ncur`, or the contents of the `dist` array, but we know how they relate.

Given that:
- `N` is between 3 and 10,
- `y` is 1,
- `nx` is equal to `x + dx - 1`,
- `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`,
- `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.

The code updates `dist[1][ncur]` to be `dist[1][cur] + 1`. 

Since `ncur` references an index in the `dist` array, we can conclude that `dist[1][ncur]` is now one more than its previous value, while `dist[1][cur]` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x + dx - 1`; `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
