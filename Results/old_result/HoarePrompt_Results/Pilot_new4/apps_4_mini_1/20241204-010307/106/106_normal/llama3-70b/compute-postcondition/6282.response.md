The statement `ncur = A[nx][ny]` assigns a value to `ncur` based on the 2D array `A` using the indices `nx` and `ny`. The previous values of `nx` and `ny` are known, where `nx` is equal to `x + dx` and `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`. The value of `N` is between 3 and 10, and other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `x` is defined and within bounds, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` remains unchanged, `parent[2][ncur]` remains unchanged, and `queue` remains unchanged.**
