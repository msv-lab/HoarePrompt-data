The code updates the value of `dist[0][ncur]` based on the current distance `dist[0][cur]`. Specifically, the new value for `dist[0][ncur]` is calculated by adding 1 to the current value of `dist[0][cur]`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

The previous states are:
- `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`
- `x` is 0
- `y` is 1
- `nx` is equal to `0 + dx`
- `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`
- `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`

After running the code, `dist[0][ncur]` will be updated, but we do not have specific values for `dist[0][cur]` and `ncur`. Therefore, we can only state that `dist[0][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `0 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
