The statement `dist[2][ncur] = dist[2][cur] + 1` updates the value of `dist[2][ncur]` based on the value of `dist[2][cur]`. Given that `dist[2][ncur]` was initially greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, this means the condition leading to this assignment holds true and the value of `dist[2][ncur]` changes as follows:

1. `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `queue` initially contains at least one tuple of the form `(ncur, 1)`, `piece` is 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is 2, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is A[2][0]**
