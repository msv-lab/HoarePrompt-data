Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 3 <= `N` <= 10. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and `piece` is 1 while `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to (1, 1), and `ncur` is added to the `queue`. Otherwise, there is no change to the variables.***
