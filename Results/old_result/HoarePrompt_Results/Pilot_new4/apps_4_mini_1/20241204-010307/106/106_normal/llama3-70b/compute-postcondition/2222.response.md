The value of `ncur` is assigned the value from the 2D list `A` at the position `[nx][ny]`. The variables `nx` and `ny` are already defined as being equal to `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively, and they are confirmed to be within the bounds of the defined limits for the index. The states of the other variables (`piece`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`piece` is 0; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` reflect the initial state; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of 0 and N.**
