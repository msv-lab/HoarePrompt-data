The code snippet `queue.append((ncur, 2))` adds a tuple containing the value of `ncur` and the integer `2` to the `queue`. The values of `N`, `y`, `x`, `nx`, `ny`, `dx`, `dy`, `dist`, `parent`, and the tuple being appended to `queue` remain unchanged aside from the addition to `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 1; `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`; `nx` is equal to `x`; `ny` is 2; `dx` is 0; `dy` is 1; `ncur` is equal to `A[x][2]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`; `queue` has the tuple `(ncur, 2)` appended to it.**
