The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` depend on the previous values of `x` and `y`, as `nx` is equal to `x + dx` and `ny` is equal to `y + dy`. The current values of `N`, `y`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 0; `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 0; `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
