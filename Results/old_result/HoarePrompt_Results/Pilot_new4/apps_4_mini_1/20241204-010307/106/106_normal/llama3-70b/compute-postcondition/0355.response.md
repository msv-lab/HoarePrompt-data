The code appends a tuple `(cur, i)` to the `queue`. The values of `cur` and `i` are not changed by this action, but `queue` now contains an additional entry. The states of other mentioned variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[2][ncur]` remains unchanged, `parent[2][ncur]` remains unchanged, `queue` now includes the tuple `(cur, i)`, and the current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`.**
