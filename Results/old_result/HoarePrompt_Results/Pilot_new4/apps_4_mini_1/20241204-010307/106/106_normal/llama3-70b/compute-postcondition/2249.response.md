Output State: **`piece` is 1, `dist[1]` reflects the shortest path distances from `cur` for all reachable indices, `parent[1]` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices, `queue` contains all updated elements based on valid moves, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]` where `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid (0 ≤ `nx` < `N` and 0 ≤ `ny` < `N`).**
