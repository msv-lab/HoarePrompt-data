The line of code `dist[2][ncur] = dist[2][cur] + 1` assigns a new value to `dist[2][ncur]`. The previous state indicates that `dist[2][ncur]` was greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, meaning `dist[2][ncur]` is being updated to a smaller value, which now becomes equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`. 

Since `ncur` was previously assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, we can assume it is a specific value derived from those coordinates. The other variables are not directly impacted by this line of code and maintain their previous states.

After executing the code, the following updates occur:
- `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.

Thus, the output state will reflect these changes, maintaining all other precondition information.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and the value of `dist[2][ncur]` is now less than or equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
