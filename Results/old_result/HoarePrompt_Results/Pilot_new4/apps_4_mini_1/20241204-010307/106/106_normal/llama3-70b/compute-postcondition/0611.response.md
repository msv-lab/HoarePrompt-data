The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `piece` are used in this operation, but they are not changed by this code. The states of the other variables remain unaffected as well. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `piece` is 2, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is `A[nx][0]`, `parent[2][ncur]` is `(cur, 2)`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`.**
