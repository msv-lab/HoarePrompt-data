The value of `ncur` is assigned from the matrix `A` at the position determined by `nx` and `ny`. Given that `nx` is `1 + dx` and `ny` is `2 + dy`, the specific values of `nx` and `ny` ensure that they are within the bounds of `0` and `N-1`, since `N` is between `3` and `10`. However, the specific value of `ncur` depends on the elements in the array `A` at those indices.

The states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `cur` is the same as before, `dist` is updated for all reachable positions based on conditions, `parent` reflects the paths taken for those positions, `queue` contains tuples for all updated positions that met the conditions, including the tuple `(cur, i)` if `piece` is not equal to `i`, and `ncur` is now equal to `A[nx][ny]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `cur` is the same as before, `dist` is updated for all reachable positions based on conditions, `parent` reflects the paths taken for those positions, `queue` contains tuples for all updated positions that met the conditions, including the tuple `(cur, i)` if `piece` is not equal to `i`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]**.
