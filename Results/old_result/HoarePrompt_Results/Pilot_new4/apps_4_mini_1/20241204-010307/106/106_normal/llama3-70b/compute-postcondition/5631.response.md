The code `queue.append((ncur, 0))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The initial state indicates that `queue` is not empty, and we have the value of `ncur` determined from previous assignments. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `queue` is not empty, now includes `(ncur, 0)`; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `nx` is equal to `dx`; `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`.**
