The code `queue.append((ncur, 1))` adds a tuple containing `ncur` and `1` to the `queue`. The state of `queue` is affected by this operation. Other variables remain unchanged. 

The `ncur` variable is equal to `A[nx][ny]` and `piece` is equal to `1`, which has been used in the tuple added to `queue`. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 1, `y` is `N - 1`, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `N - 1 + dy`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[0]` contains the respective parent information for each reachable point, `queue` now contains the previous contents plus the tuple `(ncur, 1)`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`, and the value of `piece` is 1.**
