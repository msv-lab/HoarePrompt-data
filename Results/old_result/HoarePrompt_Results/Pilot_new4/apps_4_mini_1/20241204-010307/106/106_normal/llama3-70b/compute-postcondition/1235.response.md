Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `cur` is the same as before, `dist` is updated for all reachable positions based on conditions, `parent` reflects the paths taken for those positions, `queue` contains tuples for all updated positions that met the conditions, including the tuple `(cur, i)` if `piece` is not equal to `i`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. The current value of `piece` is 0, and the current value of `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`.***
