According to the code, the loop iterates over the pairs of `(dx, dy)` with the values `(-1, -1)`, `(-1, 1)`, `(1, -1)`, and `(1, 1)`. Since the loop has already executed for one of these pairs in the previous iteration, it will iterate over the next pair in the list on the next execution. 

Given that `dx` is currently `-1` and `dy` is `-1`, it implies that the first pair has already been processed. 

For the loop to execute one more time, it needs to move to the next pair, which is `(-1, 1)`. 

The state at the end of the previous iteration has `dx` and `dy` both being `-1`. As we change to the next pair in the iteration, `dx` will become `-1` and `dy` will become `1`. There are no updates to the other variables (like `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `piece`, `dist`, `parent`, `queue`) that are needed to be adjusted for the loop to execute again. 

Therefore, the updated state reflects the change in `dx` and `dy`:

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 1 and N-2; `x` is between 1 and N-2; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is equal to `y - 1`**.
