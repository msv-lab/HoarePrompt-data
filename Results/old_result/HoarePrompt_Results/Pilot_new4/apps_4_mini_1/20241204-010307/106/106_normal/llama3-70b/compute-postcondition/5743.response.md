The code assigns the value of `cur` to `parent[1][ncur]`, effectively linking the current node to its parent in some structure, along with a `piece` which is presumably some additional information. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` contains tuples of (ncur, 0) and (ncur, 1), `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is `y - 1`, `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is now `cur`, and `piece` is assigned to `parent[1][ncur]`.**
