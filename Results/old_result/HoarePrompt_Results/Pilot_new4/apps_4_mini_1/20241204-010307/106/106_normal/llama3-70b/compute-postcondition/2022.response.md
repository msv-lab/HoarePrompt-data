In the given code, the statement `dist[0][ncur] = dist[0][cur] + 1` updates the value at `dist[0][ncur]`. The code only affects the `dist` variable, while the other variables remain unchanged. 

Since `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to be equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and we know the condition `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1` before the execution, this means the previous value of `dist[0][ncur]` was greater and is now being lowered to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.

The values of `N`, `dist`, `parent`, `piece`, `queue`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` remain unaffected except for the `dist` array.

Output State: **`N` is at least 5; `dist` contains updated minimum distances with `dist[0][ncur]` equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent` reflects corresponding parents; `piece` remains unchanged at 2; `queue` contains (cur, i) if A[x][y] equals cur and piece is not equal to i; `dx` and `dy` will iterate through the 8 tuples in the list; `nx` is updated to `x + dx` and `ny` is updated to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; additionally, `piece` is equal to 0 and the current value of `dist[0][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
