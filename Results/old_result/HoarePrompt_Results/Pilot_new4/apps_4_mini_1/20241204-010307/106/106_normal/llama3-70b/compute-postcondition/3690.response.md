Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 2; `y` is 0; if `piece` is 0 and the distance `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `cur` and `piece`; the tuple `(ncur, 0)` is appended to `queue`; the value of `A[x][y]` remains equal to `cur`; `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; and `x + dx` and `y + dy` are within valid bounds of A.***
