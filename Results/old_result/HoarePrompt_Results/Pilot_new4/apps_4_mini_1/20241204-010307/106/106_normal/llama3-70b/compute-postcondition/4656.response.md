Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is 3, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the values of `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` is appended with the element `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
