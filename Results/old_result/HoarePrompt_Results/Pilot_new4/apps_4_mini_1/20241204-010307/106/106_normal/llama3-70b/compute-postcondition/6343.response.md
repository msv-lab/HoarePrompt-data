Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is `dx`, `ny` is `dy`, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[0]` contains the distances from `cur` to other reachable nodes, `parent[0]` contains the parent nodes for the reachable distances, `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` is updated to include the tuple `(ncur, 1)`.***
