In the provided code, the execution of the for loop depends on the iterable `[(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]`. This iterable is static, meaning the loop will execute exactly 4 times, once for each coordinate pair.

The relevant states before the loop starts include:
- `N`, which is an integer between 3 and 10 (this is not directly impacting the loop iterations).
- `x` and `y`, which are both initialized to 0.
- `dist[0]` and `parent[0]`, which contain distance and parent information, but their values do not affect the loop execution.
- `queue`, which is empty, indicating no reachable positions have been added yet.

Since the loop is guaranteed to execute 4 times, the states that need to be adjusted are primarily the values of `x` and `y`, which will change with each iteration of the loop based on the coordinates provided in the iterable.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dist[0]` contains the minimum distances, `parent[0]` contains parent information, `queue` is empty; the loop will iterate 4 times with (dx, dy) taking values from the list.**
