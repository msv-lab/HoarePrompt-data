The value of `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The variables `nx` and `ny` are defined as follows: `nx` is `1 + dx` and `ny` is `N - 1 + dy`. The values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided, but `N` is an integer within the range of 3 to 10, meaning `ny` can vary from 2 to 9. The other variables `dist[1]`, `parent[1]`, and `queue` remain unchanged. 

Since there's no direct value provided for `A`, `nx`, or `ny`, we can express the state of `ncur` in terms of the known variables. The output state can thus be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 1, `y` is `N - 1`, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `N - 1 + dy`, and `ncur = A[1 + dx][N - 1 + dy]`. `dist[1]` remains unchanged, `parent[1]` remains unchanged, and `queue` remains unchanged.**
