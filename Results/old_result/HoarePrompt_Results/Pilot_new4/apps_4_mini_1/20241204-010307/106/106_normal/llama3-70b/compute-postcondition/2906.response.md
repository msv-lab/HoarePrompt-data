According to the code, the loop iterates over a list of tuples representing directions: `(-2, -1), (-2, 1), (-1, -2), (-1, 2), (1, -2), (1, 2), (2, -1), (2, 1)`. In each iteration, the values `dx` and `dy` will take on the corresponding values from these tuples. 

Since there are 8 tuples in the list, the loop will execute exactly 8 times. At the end of the last iteration, I need to determine the states for the next iteration. 

However, since the loop has already executed for all tuples, it is clear that it will not execute again unless there are changes to the elements of the list or the range it is iterating over.

Given that each `dx` and `dy` is being taken from the tuples, after the last iteration (when the last tuple `(2, 1)` has been processed), there won't be another tuple left to iterate over in this specific loop.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, we can say that the next iteration would require the loop to be called again with the same or new tuples in the list, keeping everything else the same.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `dist` contains the shortest distances for all reachable positions, `parent` reflects the predecessors for each reachable position, and `queue` contains tuples for all reachable positions processed during the iterations with the tuples list reset to [(-2, -1), (-2, 1), (-1, -2), (-1, 2), (1, -2), (1, 2), (2, -1), (2, 1)]**
