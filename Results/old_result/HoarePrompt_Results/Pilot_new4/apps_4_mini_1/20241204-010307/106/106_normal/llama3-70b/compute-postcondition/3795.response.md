To determine the state adjustments necessary for the loop to execute, we must consider the conditions that affect the validity of each iteration in the loop based on the provided code context.

Given:
- The grid is defined by `N`, which must satisfy `3 <= N <= 10`.
- The variables `x` and `y` are initialized to `2` and `1`, respectively.
- The loop iterates through the list of tuples `[(dx, dy)]`, which defines the direction of movement.

For each tuple `(dx, dy)`, we need to check the following:
1. Calculate the new positions `nx` and `ny` based on `x + dx` and `y + dy`.
2. Ensure that both `nx` and `ny` remain within the grid bounds defined by `N`. Specifically, `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` must hold true.
3. If both `nx` and `ny` are valid, we can then proceed to check further conditions related to `ncur`, `piece`, `dist`, and `parent`.

Given the initialization of `x` and `y`, we can derive `nx` and `ny` for each `(dx, dy)` combination:
- For `(-1, -1)`: `nx = 1` (2 - 1), `ny = 0` (1 - 1)
- For `(-1, 1)`: `nx = 1` (2 - 1), `ny = 2` (1 + 1)
- For `(1, -1)`: `nx = 3` (2 + 1), `ny = 0` (1 - 1)
- For `(1, 1)`: `nx = 3` (2 + 1), `ny = 2` (1 + 1)

Now, we need to check if these new positions are within bounds:
- For `N = 3`: Valid positions for `(dx, dy)` would be limited. Specifically, `nx` must be less than `3`, so both the `(-1, -1)` and `(-1, 1)` combinations would be valid, while the `(1, -1)` and `(1, 1)` would not.
- For higher values of `N`, the conditions would shift accordingly.

However, to ensure that we can execute the loop regardless of `N`, we need to specify that `nx` and `ny` must be derived and checked as per the grid bounds within the loop's context.

Thus, for the loop to execute:
- `N` must be within the bounds of 3 to 10.
- Initialize `nx` and `ny` based on `x` and `y` for each `(dx, dy)`.
- Ensure that derived positions for `nx` and `ny` remain valid for the current value of `N`.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `nx` and `ny` are calculated as `nx = x + dx`, `ny = y + dy`, with bounds checks `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` for each `(dx, dy)` combination.**
