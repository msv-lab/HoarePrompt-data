The line of code `parent[0][ncur] = cur, piece` updates the `parent` array at the specified indices. Here, `ncur` is derived from `nx` and `ny`, which are calculated as `2 + dx` and `0 + dy`, respectively. The variable `cur` is also used in this assignment.

The values of other variables in the initial state are not affected by this line, so we need to keep their states unchanged. The variable `parent[0][ncur]` is now set to the combination of the values of `cur` and `piece`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 2; `y` is 0; `nx` is `2 + dx`; `ny` is `0 + dy`; `piece` is 0; `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to be `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is now equal to `cur, piece`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 2; `y` is 0; `nx` is `2 + dx`; `ny` is `0 + dy`; `piece` is 0; `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to be `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is now equal to `cur, piece`.**
