The values of `nx` and `ny` are updated as follows: `nx` is assigned the value of `x + dx` and `ny` is assigned the value of `y + dy`. The previous values of `x` and `y` are `4` and `2`, respectively. Since `dx` and `dy` are not defined in this context, we cannot calculate specific values for `nx` and `ny`. However, we know that `nx` and `ny` will be updated based on whatever values `dx` and `dy` take.

Since `N` is at least `6`, and `(nx, ny)` are valid indices within the range [0, 5], it indicates that the calculations will keep them in a valid index range, but we cannot specify the exact values of `nx` and `ny`.

The states of `N`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is at least 6, `x` is 4, `y` is 2, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, and `ny` is equal to `y + dy`.

Output State: **`N` is at least 6, `x` is 4, `y` is 2, `nx` is equal to `4 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`**.
