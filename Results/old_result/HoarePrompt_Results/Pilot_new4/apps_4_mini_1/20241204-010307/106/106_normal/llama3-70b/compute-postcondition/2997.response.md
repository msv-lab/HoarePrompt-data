Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dist` reflects the shortest distances for all reachable positions, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `queue` contains the previous elements plus the new tuple `(ncur, 0)`, `nx` is `x - 2`, `ny` is 0; `ncur` is `A[x - 2][0]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is now equal to `cur`, and the new tuple `(ncur, 0)` has been appended to `queue`.**
