The values of `nx` and `ny` are assigned based on the expressions `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. However, the values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided, so we cannot determine the specific values of `nx` and `ny`. The values of `N`, `queue`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the fact that `nx` and `ny` are defined but their specific values are unknown.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` is not empty, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`.**
