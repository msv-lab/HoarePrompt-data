Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 1, `y` is `N - 1`, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `(N - 1) + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, and the tuple `(ncur, 2)` is added to `queue`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
