The code assigns a value to the `parent` array based on the values of `cur` and `piece`. Specifically, it sets `parent[0][ncur]` to a tuple containing `cur` and `piece`. The values of `cur` and `piece` are not explicitly defined in the initial state, but they are retained in the output state. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 0; `y` is 0; `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`; `nx` is equal to `dx`; `ny` is equal to `dy`; `piece` is equal to 0; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to (cur, piece)**
