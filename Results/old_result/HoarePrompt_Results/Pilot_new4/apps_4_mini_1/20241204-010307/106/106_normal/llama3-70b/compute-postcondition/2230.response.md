The code assigns the values of `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy`. The previous values of `nx` and `ny` are updated to `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The other variables remain unchanged.

The Output State is: `piece` is 0, `ncur` satisfies the conditions for updating `dist` and `parent`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` reflect the initial state; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`.

Output State: **`piece` is 0, `ncur` satisfies the conditions for updating `dist` and `parent`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` reflect the initial state; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`.**
