The statement `queue.append((ncur, 2))` appends a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the existing `queue`. The previous values of the impacted variables are not changed by this operation; instead, it modifies the `queue` to include a new entry. The other variables retain their previous states.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is `0 + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, `dist[1]` reflects the shortest distance relevant to the moves, `parent[1]` reflects the current parent node relevant to the moves, `queue` now contains at least one valid `(ncur, 1)` tuple and the new tuple `(ncur, 2)`, `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`.**
