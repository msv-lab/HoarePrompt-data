Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 3 and 10; `x` is greater than 1 and less than `N - 1`; `piece` is 1; `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1` for at least some valid `ncur`; `nx` is `x + dx`; `ny` is `y + dy`; the current values of `nx` and `ny` are such that 0 is less than or equal to `nx` and `ny` and both are less than `N`; `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`; and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`.***
