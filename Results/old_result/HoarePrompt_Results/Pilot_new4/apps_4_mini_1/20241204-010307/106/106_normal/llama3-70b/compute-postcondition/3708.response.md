Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 2; `y` is 0; `piece` is 0; `dist[0][ncur]` is updated for each valid `(nx, ny)` within the bounds of the array `A` based on the movement rules, reflecting the minimum distances from the start position; `parent[0][ncur]` holds the last piece and current value used to reach `ncur`; `queue` contains all valid `(ncur, 0)` pairs generated during the loop iterations; the final values of `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` depend on how many valid positions were reachable from the initial position `(2, 0)` using the defined movement offsets. If no valid positions were encountered, `dist` and `parent` remain unchanged from their initial states while `queue` would be empty.**
