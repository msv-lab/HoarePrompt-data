The line of code `parent[1][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns `cur` and `piece` to the `parent` array at the position `[1][ncur]`. The values of `cur` and `piece` are not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine exact values for them within the output. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and the updated `dist` remain valid. Here is the output state reflecting the changes:

Output State: **`N` is at least 6, `x` is 4, `y` is 2, `nx` is equal to `4 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `ncur = A[4 + dx][2 + dy]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the values of `cur` and `piece`.**
