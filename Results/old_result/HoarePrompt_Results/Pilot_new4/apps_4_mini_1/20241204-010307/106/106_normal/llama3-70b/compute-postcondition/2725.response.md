Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is the current y-coordinate, `piece` is not equal to the value represented by `i`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. Additionally, `piece` is 0, and the distance from the starting point to `ncur` is greater than the distance from the starting point to `cur` plus 1.***
