The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned new values based on the calculations involving `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy`. The initial values are as follows: `dx` is -1 and `dy` is -2, and since `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, we can express `nx` in terms of `x`. The updated values are:

- `nx` becomes `x + dx`, which is equal to `x - 1` (because `dx` is -1).
- `ny` becomes `y + dy`, which is equal to `1 - 2 = -1` (because `y` is initially 1 and `dy` is -2).

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -2, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, and `ny` is -1.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -2, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, and `ny` is -1.**
