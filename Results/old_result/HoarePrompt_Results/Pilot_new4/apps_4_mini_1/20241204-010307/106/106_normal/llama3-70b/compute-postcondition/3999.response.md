Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dist[1][ncur]` contains the updated minimum distances from the starting point to all reachable points based on the conditions within the loop, `parent[1][ncur]` contains the respective parent information for each reachable point, and `queue` contains all tuples of reachable positions that were added during the iterations. If the loop did not execute, `dist[1][ncur]` and `parent[1][ncur]` remain unchanged for unreachable points, while `queue` remains empty.**
