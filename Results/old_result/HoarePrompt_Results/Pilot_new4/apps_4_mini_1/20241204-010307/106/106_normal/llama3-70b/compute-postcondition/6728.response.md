The values of `nx` and `ny` are computed by adding `dx` to `x` and `dy` to `y`, respectively. Since `dx` and `dy` can take values from the set `(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)`, the values of `nx` and `ny` will depend on the specific values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. However, we know that `N` remains between 3 and 10. The conditions regarding the ranges of `dx` and `dy` do not change, and thus the output state will reflect the updated calculations of `nx` and `ny`, while keeping `N`, `x`, and `y` unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `nx` is calculated as `x + dx`; `ny` is calculated as `y + dy`.**
