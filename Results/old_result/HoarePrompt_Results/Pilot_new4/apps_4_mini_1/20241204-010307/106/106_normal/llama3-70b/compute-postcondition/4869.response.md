The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The initial state indicates that `nx` is equal to `x + dx` and `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and that the conditions `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` still hold true. Therefore, `ncur` takes on the value from the 2D array `A` at the indices `[nx][ny]`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
