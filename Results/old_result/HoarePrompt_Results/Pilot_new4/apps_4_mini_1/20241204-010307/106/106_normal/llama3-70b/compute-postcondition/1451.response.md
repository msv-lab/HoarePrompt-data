According to the code, the loop will execute for each pair of `(dx, dy)` in the list `[(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]`. At the end of the last iteration, the current values of `dx` and `dy` must be considered to determine the next state.

The loop iterates over four pairs of `(dx, dy)`, starting from `(-1, -1)`, then moving to `(-1, 1)`, followed by `(1, -1)`, and finally `(1, 1)`. If the loop has completed with `dx` and `dy` set to `(1, 1)`, the next iteration would correspond to an index beyond the current list of pairs, which means the loop cannot execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `dx` and `dy` are set to `(1, 1)`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, we need to reset to the next pair or ensure that there are more pairs to process.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 2; `y` is 1; `nx` is 3; `ny` is 0; `dx` is -1; `dy` is -1** (resetting to the first pair in the list).
