The line of code assigns `cur` and `piece` as the values for the `parent[2][ncur]` array at the index `ncur`. The other values and states of the program remain unchanged. Therefore, `parent[2][ncur]` is now set to the tuple `(cur, piece)`, which is `(cur, 2)`, since `piece` is 2.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dist[0]` remains unchanged, `parent[0]` remains unchanged, `queue` contains at least one tuple of (ncur, 1), `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `nx` is between 0 and N-1, `ny` is between 0 and N-1, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is now `(cur, 2)`.**
