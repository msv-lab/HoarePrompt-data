The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The previous values of `ncur` and `2` remain unchanged, but `queue` is modified to include this new tuple. The values of other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `piece` is 2; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, 2)`; `queue` is updated to include `(ncur, 2)`.**
