Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 0; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; if `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is set to the tuple `(cur, piece)`; and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. Otherwise, there are no changes to the variables.***
