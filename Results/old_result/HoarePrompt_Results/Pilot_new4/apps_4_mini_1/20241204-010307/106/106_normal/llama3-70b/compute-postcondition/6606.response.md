According to the code, the for loop will iterate over the list of tuples representing the changes in coordinates (`dx, dy`). The loop will execute four times, once for each tuple in the list. Since the loop does not depend on any condition that changes with each iteration, the values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` will remain the same throughout the loop iterations. 

At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 1 and `y` is 0. This means that `piece` is equal to 1, and the checks for changes in `dist` and `parent` will be based on the current `cur` position. However, the loop indices `(dx, dy)` are the only values that are being iterated, meaning they will change with each iteration, but `x` and `y` will still refer to the same positions unless updated inside the loop body (which is omitted).

As the loop continues to execute, there are four iterations corresponding to the four tuples in the list. After the fourth iteration, the loop will not execute again.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `dist` and `parent` are initialized, and `queue` contains reachable positions, and the loop has executed 4 times.**
