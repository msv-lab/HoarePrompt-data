According to the code, the loop iterates over a list of tuples representing directions `(dx, dy)` for movement within a grid. Each iteration allows for checking the next positions based on current coordinates and the direction specified by `dx` and `dy`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `nx` is equal to `dx` and `ny` is equal to `dy`. This means that in the next iteration, `dx` and `dy` will take on the values from the next tuple in the direction list. 

Since the loop iterates over four specific directions, and since it has already processed one direction in the last iteration, it will process the next one in the next iteration. The first tuple `(-1, 0)` corresponds to moving up, the second `(1, 0)` corresponds to moving down, the third `(0, -1)` corresponds to moving left, and the fourth `(0, 1)` corresponds to moving right. 

At the end of the last iteration, we can assume one of the first two tuples has been processed. If the last processed tuple was `(-1, 0)`, then the next tuple `(1, 0)` will be processed next, which means `dx` will now be `1` and `dy` will be `0`. 

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are as follows:

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur`, `parent[1][ncur]` is established for those reachable positions, `queue` contains tuples `(ncur, 1)` for each valid `ncur` that met the conditions, `nx` is equal to `1`, `ny` is equal to `0`**
