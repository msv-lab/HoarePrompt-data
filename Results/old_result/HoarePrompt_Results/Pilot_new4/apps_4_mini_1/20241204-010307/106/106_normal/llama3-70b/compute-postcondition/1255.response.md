Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 2; `nx` is equal to `1 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`; `cur` remains unchanged; `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`; if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to the values of `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
