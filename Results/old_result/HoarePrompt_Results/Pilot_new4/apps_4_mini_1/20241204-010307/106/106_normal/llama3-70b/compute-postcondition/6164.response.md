The code appends a tuple containing the values of `ncur` and `1` to the `queue`. In this case, the value of `ncur` is derived from `A[nx][0]`, where `nx` is equal to `x - 1`. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

The initial state indicates that `N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, and `ny` is 0. The value of `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][0]`, and `piece` is equal to 1. The specific values of `A[nx][0]`, `x`, and `queue` were not defined in the initial state.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][0]`, `piece` is equal to 1, `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`**.
