The code snippet assigns the value of `ncur` based on the 2D array `A` at the coordinates specified by `nx` and `ny`. Given that `nx` is equal to `x - 1` and `ny` is equal to `y`, where `y` is equal to `N`, we can summarize the changes.

The previous values are:
- `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`
- `y` is equal to `N`
- `nx` is equal to `x - 1`
- `ny` is equal to `y` (which is `N`)

The variable `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`, but we do not know the specific values of `A`, `x`, or the resulting value of `ncur`. 

Thus, while `ncur` will be equal to some value in the array `A`, the exact result is not determinable without specific values.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is equal to `N`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `N`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][N]`.**
