According to the code, the loop iterates over a list of tuples that represent directional movements (up, down, left, right). The loop will execute for each tuple in that list. At the end of the last iteration, the values for `dx` and `dy` are 0 and 1 respectively, indicating the last direction was to the right.

The next iteration will take the next tuple in the list of directions. The list has four tuples, so the next tuple to be processed will be (-1, 0) for the first iteration, (1, 0) for the second, (0, -1) for the third, and (0, 1) for the fourth.

Since the `dy` is currently 1, the loop is on the last tuple (0, 1). To execute one more time, `dx` and `dy` will be updated to the first tuple in the list which is (-1, 0).

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 2; `piece` is 2; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 0; `nx` is equal to `x`; `ny` is 3; if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` holds true, then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
