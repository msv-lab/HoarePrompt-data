The code assigns `dist[0][ncur]` the value of `dist[0][cur] + 1`. Since it is given that the current value of `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, this means the value of `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to a new value that is exactly `dist[0][cur] + 1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and the current value of `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than the previous value `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
