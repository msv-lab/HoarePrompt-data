The code assigns values to `nx` and `ny` based on the current coordinates `x` and `y`, along with the movement defined by `dx` and `dy`. The values of `dx` and `dy` are `(1, 0)`, which means that `nx` will be `x + 1` and `ny` will be equal to `y`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`dist[1]` contains the shortest distances based on valid moves, `parent[1]` indicates the relationship for each reachable position, `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`, piece is set to 2, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x + 1`, `ny` is equal to `y`.**
