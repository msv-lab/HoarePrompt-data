Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is -2, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[-2][0]`, if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`.***
