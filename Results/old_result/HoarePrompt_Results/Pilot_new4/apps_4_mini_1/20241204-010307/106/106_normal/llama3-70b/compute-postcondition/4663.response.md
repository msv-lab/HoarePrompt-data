The code `queue.append((ncur, 0))` appends a tuple containing the value of `ncur` and `0` to the `queue`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Since `ncur` is defined as equal to `A[x - 1][0]`, we can note that this expression is valid in the output state. However, the exact value of `ncur` and the contents of `queue` are not specified in the initial state, and we can't calculate the value of `ncur` without knowing `A` and `x`. 

Given this, the output state reflects that we have modified the `queue` by appending a tuple. The rest of the states remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -2, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][0]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, `piece` is assigned, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`**.
