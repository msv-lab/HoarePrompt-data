Initial State: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `piece` remains equal to 2, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0

```
nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
```

Now, let's analyze the impact of the code:

1. The code assigns new values to `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x` and `y`, modified by `dx` and `dy`.
2. `nx` is calculated as `x + dx`, which means it will be `x - 1`.
3. `ny` is calculated as `y + dy`, which means it will be `y + 0`, leaving `ny` unchanged as `y`.

Since we don't have specific values for `x` and `y`, we cannot update them directly, but we understand that `nx` will depend on `x` reduced by 1 and `ny` will be equal to the current value of `y`.

Thus, the output state remains consistent with the initial conditions, but we include the new expressions for `nx` and `ny`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `piece` remains equal to 2, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y`.**
