Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `4 <= N <= 11`, `y` is equal to `N`, `A` is a valid two-dimensional array, `cur` is defined, `dist[0]` contains updated distances from the starting point, `parent[0]` contains the parent nodes for each valid move, `queue` contains all valid positions `(ncur, 0)`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, and `ny` is equal to `y + dy`. The current values of `nx` and `ny` satisfy the conditions `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`.***
