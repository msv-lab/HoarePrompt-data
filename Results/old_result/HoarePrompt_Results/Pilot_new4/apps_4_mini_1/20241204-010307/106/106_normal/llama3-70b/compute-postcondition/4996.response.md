Postcondition: ***`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 3, `y` is 0, `dist` contains the shortest distances from (x, y) to all reachable positions based on the logic defined in the loop, `parent` contains the parent tuples for all reachable positions, `queue` contains all valid tuples that were appended during the loop execution. The current value of `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`.***
