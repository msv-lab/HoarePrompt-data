The code `dist[2][ncur] = dist[2][cur] + 1` updates the `dist` array at the position `[2][ncur]` by assigning it the value of `dist[2][cur] + 1`. The values of `ncur` and `cur` are based on previous assignments, and the initialization of `dist` implies that it has been appropriately set up prior to this operation.

In the context of the initial state, `dist[2][cur]` is a known value, and after executing this line, `dist[2][ncur]` will be one unit greater than that value. The states of the other variables remain unchanged as they are not modified by this statement.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is between 0 and N-1, `y` is between 0 and N-1, `dist` is appropriately initialized, `parent` reflects valid parent tuples, `queue` contains valid tuples, `piece` is greater than 0, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
