Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is -2, and `ny` is 0. If the conditions `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` hold true, then `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, and if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `(ncur, 0)` is added to `queue`. Otherwise, if the conditions are not met, no changes occur.***
