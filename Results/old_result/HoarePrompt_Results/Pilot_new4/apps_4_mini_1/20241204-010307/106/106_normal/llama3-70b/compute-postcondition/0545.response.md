The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned new values based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are calculated as:
- `nx = x + dx`
- `ny = y + dy`

Since `dx` and `dy` can no longer provide valid tuples, the new values of `nx` and `ny` will be determined based on the last valid values of `dx` and `dy`. The initial state provides that `y` is 0, and `x` is an integer within the range defined in the initial state.

The output state will reflect the updated values of `nx` and `ny`, while keeping the other variables unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 0; `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`.**
