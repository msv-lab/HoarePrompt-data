Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 2; `y` is 0; `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`; if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, 2)`, and the tuple `(ncur, 2)` is added to `queue`; `A[2][0]` remains equal to `cur`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.***
