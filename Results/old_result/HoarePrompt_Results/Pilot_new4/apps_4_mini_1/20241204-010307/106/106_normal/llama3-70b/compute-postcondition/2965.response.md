The line of code `queue.append((ncur, 2))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `2` are used directly without any changes to the other variables. The `queue` will now contain one additional tuple, but the values of `N`, `y`, `dist`, `parent[2][ncur]`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 0; `dist` reflects the shortest distances for all reachable positions; `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`; `queue` contains at least one tuple of a reachable position, and now contains an additional tuple `(ncur, 2)`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
