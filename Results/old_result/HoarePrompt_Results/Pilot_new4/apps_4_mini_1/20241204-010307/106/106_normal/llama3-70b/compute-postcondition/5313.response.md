The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned new values based on the current values of `x`, `y`, and the values taken from the tuples `dx` and `dy`. The values of `x` and `y` are currently 4 and 0, respectively. The specific values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided, but they will be some valid integers from the list of tuples.

After executing the code, the updated values will be:
- `nx` is equal to `4 + dx`
- `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`

The states of the other variables are not affected, and the presence of `N`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is 4; `y` is 0; `nx` is equal to `4 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`; `dist[1][ncur]` contains updated distances based on valid `ncur`; `parent[1][ncur]` contains path information for valid `ncur`; `queue` contains all applicable tuples of `(ncur, 1)` for valid moves where `piece` is 1; `dx` and `dy` will take values from the list of tuples during iterations.**
