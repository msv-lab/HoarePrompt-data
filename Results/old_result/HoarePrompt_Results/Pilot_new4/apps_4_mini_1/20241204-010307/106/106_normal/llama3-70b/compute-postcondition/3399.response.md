The value at `dist[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `dist[2][cur] + 1`. The value of `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, and `ny` is equal to `y + dy`. The variables `N`, `piece`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged. 

Thus, the output state reflects the updated value of `dist[2][ncur]`, which is now `dist[2][cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `piece` remains equal to 2; `dist` is updated as `dist[2][ncur] = dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent` is unchanged; `queue` retains its current entries; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is equal to `x + dx` and `ny` is equal to `y + dy`.**
