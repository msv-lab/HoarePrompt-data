The values of `nx` and `ny` become derived from the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. Specifically, `nx` is assigned the value of `x + dx` and `ny` is assigned the value of `y + dy`. The states of the other variables are not affected, and since `N` is constrained between 3 and 10, its value remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is the current y-coordinate, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, and `ny` is equal to `y + dy`.**
