According to the code, the loop iterates over the pairs of `(dx, dy)` in the list `[(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]`. Since there are four pairs in this list, the loop will execute for each of them in sequence based on the current index of iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, the loop has completed processing one pair of `(dx, dy)`. If the loop has executed for the first three pairs, `(-1, -1)`, `(-1, 1)`, and `(1, -1)`, the next pair to be processed would be `(1, 1)`. The loop continues executing as long as there are more pairs to iterate over.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration:
- If the last executed pair was `(1, -1)`, then the next pair will be `(1, 1)`.
- There are no additional constraints or variables that need to be modified for the next iteration beyond simply moving to the next pair in the list.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted to reflect that the next pair is being processed. 

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `piece` is equal to 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated if necessary, `parent[1][ncur]` is set as needed, `queue` contains the necessary elements if updates occur, `(dx, dy)` is (1, 1)**
