Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `queue` now contains both `(ncur, 1)` and `(ncur, 2)`, `piece` is 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is 2, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is `A[2][0]`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)` if the conditions of the if statement are met. Otherwise, the program state remains unchanged.***
