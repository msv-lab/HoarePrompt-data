The assignment `parent[1][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[1][ncur]`. The values of `ncur`, `cur`, and `piece` are not explicitly defined in the initial state, but `ncur` is dependent on the value of `x` (specifically `ncur` is `A[x - 1][0]`), and `cur` and `piece` are expected to be defined elsewhere in the program. The other variables in the state remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is `A[x - 1][0]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur, piece`.**
