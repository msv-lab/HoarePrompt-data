The code assigns a new value to the `dist` array at the index `[2][ncur]`. The value assigned is the current value of `dist[2][cur]` incremented by 1. The variables that are directly affected are `dist` and `ncur`. The value of `ncur` is determined by the expression `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is `x + dx` and `ny` is `y + dy`.

Since `N` is an integer within the range 3 to 10, `y` is 0, and `dist` reflects the shortest distances for all reachable positions, we can specify that the operation modifies the `dist` array without impacting other variables.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
