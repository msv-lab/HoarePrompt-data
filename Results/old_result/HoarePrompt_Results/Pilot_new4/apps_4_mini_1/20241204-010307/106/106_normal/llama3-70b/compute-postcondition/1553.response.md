The code appends the tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. This operation affects the `queue` variable by adding a new element, while all other variables retain their previous values. 

The values of the affected variables are:
- `queue` now contains the previously existing tuples along with the new tuple `(ncur, 2)`.

All other variables remain unchanged, so the output state includes the previous conditions that are still valid.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `ncur` is assigned `A[nx][ny]`, `A[x][y]` is defined, `cur` has a valid value, `dist[0]` is updated for each valid `ncur`, `parent[0]` is updated for each corresponding `ncur`, `queue` now contains all previous tuples and the new tuple `(ncur, 2)`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur` where `piece` is 1, and `dist[1][ncur]` was greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is now equal to `cur` and `piece`.**
