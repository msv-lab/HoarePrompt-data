The statement `dist[2][ncur] = dist[2][cur] + 1` implies that the value at the position `dist[2][ncur]` is being updated to be equal to the value currently at `dist[2][cur]` plus one. The initial state indicates that the distance from `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, meaning that following this assignment, `dist[2][ncur]` now equals `dist[2][cur] + 1`, which means it will no longer satisfy the condition of being greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`.

Therefore, after executing this code, the state of the program is updated as follows:

- The value of `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is 1, `ncur` is `A[x - 1][1]`, `piece` is 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and the distance from `dist[2][ncur]` is no longer greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
