According to the code, the for loop iterates over a list of tuples `[(dx, dy)]` which contains the values `(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)`. The loop will execute for each tuple in this list. The state before the loop starts indicates that `dx` and `dy` are initialized to values from a different set, while the loop iterates specifically over the tuples provided in the list.

For the loop to execute properly, we need to ensure that the variables `dx` and `dy` are set to the values they will take during the iterations of the loop. Since the loop will iterate through all four tuples in the list, we can adjust `dx` and `dy` to represent the first tuple in the iteration.

In addition, since the loop is defined to iterate over specific values, we can establish that the values of `dx` and `dy` will change during each iteration of the loop, starting from the first tuple.

Therefore, for the loop to be executed, we adjust the state to represent that `dx` and `dy` are initially set to the first tuple values: `(-1, -1)` for the first iteration and also confirm that `N` is still an integer within the range provided. 

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1**
