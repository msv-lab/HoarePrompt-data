Postcondition: ***`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 2, `nx` can be 3, 5, or 4, and `ny` can be 1, 2, or 3. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to be equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` now includes `(ncur, 2)`. If the conditions are not met, no changes occur.***
