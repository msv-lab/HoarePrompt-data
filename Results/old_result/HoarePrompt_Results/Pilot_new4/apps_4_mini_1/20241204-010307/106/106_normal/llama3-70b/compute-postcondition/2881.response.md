The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The variables `nx` and `ny` are defined as `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. As the values of `A`, `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy` are not provided, we cannot determine the specific value of `ncur`. However, the impact on the state is that `ncur` is now defined based on the elements of matrix `A` at the indices calculated from `nx` and `ny`. The other stated variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `piece` is equal to 2, `cur` is unchanged, `dist` remains as it is, `parent` is unchanged, `queue` is unchanged, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
