Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 2; `piece` is 2; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; if `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dist[2][cur]` is less than `dist[2][ncur]`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, 2)`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`.***
