The code snippet `queue.append((ncur, 2))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the list `queue`. The values of `ncur` and the integer `2` are combined into a tuple and stored in the queue. Other variables remain unchanged. 

Thus, the output state maintains the initial conditions and reflects the addition to the `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, the tuple `(ncur, 2)` has been appended to `queue`.**
