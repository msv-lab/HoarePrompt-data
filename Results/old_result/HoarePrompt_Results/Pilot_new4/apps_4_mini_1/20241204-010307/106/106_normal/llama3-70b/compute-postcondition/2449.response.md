The code modifies the `dist` array based on the current and next values in the array `A`. The variable `ncur` is equal to `A[x + 1][0]`, and `cur` is equal to `A[x][y]`. Therefore, `dist[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `dist[2][cur] + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 0; `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`; `nx` is `x + 1`; `ny` is 0; `piece` remains equal to 2; the next (dx, dy) is (1, 0); `ncur` is equal to `A[x + 1][0]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`**.
