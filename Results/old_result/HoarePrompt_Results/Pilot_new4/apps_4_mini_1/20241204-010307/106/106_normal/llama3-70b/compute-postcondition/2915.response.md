In the given code, `nx` is assigned the value of `x + dx`, and `ny` is assigned the value of `y + dy`. Here, `dx` is -2 and `dy` is -1. The variables `x` and `y` are not provided in the initial state, but we can infer that they hold certain values based on the context.

1. `nx` will be calculated as `x - 2` since `dx` is -2.
2. `ny` will be calculated as `y - 1` since `dy` is -1. 

Given that `y` is currently 0, `ny` will become -1.

The values of `N`, `dist`, and `parent` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the output state reflects the new values of `nx` and `ny`, while maintaining the existing values of the other variables.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `dist` contains the shortest distances for all reachable positions, `parent` reflects the predecessors for each reachable position, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is -1**.
