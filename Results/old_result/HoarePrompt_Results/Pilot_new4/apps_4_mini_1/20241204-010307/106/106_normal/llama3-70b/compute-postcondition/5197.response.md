The code assigns new values to `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x` and `y`, along with the changes defined by `dx` and `dy`. The variables `x` and `y` remain unchanged, while `nx` and `ny` will represent the new positions after the update.

The values of `N`, `x`, and `y` are still valid based on the constraints provided. However, `nx` and `ny` are computed by adding `dx` to `x` and `dy` to `y`, respectively. The specific values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided, so `nx` and `ny` will remain as expressions.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is between 0 and N-1; `y` is between 1 and N-1; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`.**
