Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 5; `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices; `parent` reflects the most recent parents for all reachable indices; `piece` remains unchanged at 2; `queue` contains all new entries generated during the iterations; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; the current values of `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid, meaning 0 is less than or equal to `nx` and `ny` and both are less than `N`.***
