The code `queue.append((ncur, 0))` appends a tuple containing the value of `ncur` and `0` to the `queue`. The initial state indicates that `ncur` has a specific value based on the array `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` and `ny` are calculated from the current position `(1,0)` and the values from `dx` and `dy`. Other variables in the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `dist` arrays are initialized, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, 0)`, `queue` now contains valid moves processed during the loop and also the tuple `(ncur, 0)`, `current value of A[1][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` and `dy` are set for 8 iterations; `nx` is `1 + dx[i]`, `ny` is `0 + dy[i]` for each iteration `i`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
