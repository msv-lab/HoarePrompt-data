In this code snippet, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur` (which is not explicitly defined in the initial state but is assumed to be valid in the context of the program), and `piece` (also assumed to be valid). The values of `ncur` and `piece` are updated with the assignment. The previously defined variables such as `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, and `dist` are not affected by this assignment.

The output state reflects these assignments:

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 1, `y` is `N - 1`, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `N - 1 + dy`, `ncur = A[1 + dx][N - 1 + dy]`, `dist[2][ncur] = dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur] = cur, piece`**
