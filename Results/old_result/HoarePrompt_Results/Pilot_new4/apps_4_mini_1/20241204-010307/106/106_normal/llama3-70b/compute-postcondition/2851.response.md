Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `piece` is equal to `1`, `dist[0]` holds the updated shortest distances for reachable positions, `parent[0]` indicates the predecessors for those reachable positions, `nx` is `x - 1`, and `ny` is `y + 1`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is equal to `1` and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and the `queue` now includes `(ncur, 1)`. Otherwise, there are no changes made to `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.***
