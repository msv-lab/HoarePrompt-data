The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[2][ncur]`. The state of `N`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and `dist` remains unchanged since they are not affected by this assignment. The only modification occurs in the `parent` array.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`.**
