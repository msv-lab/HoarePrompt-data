Postcondition: ***`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 3, `y` is 0, `dist` is reflective of reachable positions, `parent` corresponds to those reachable positions, `queue` contains valid tuples based on knight's moves from (x, y), `nx` is 3 + dx, `ny` is 0 + dy, and the current values of `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid, specifically 0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N.***
