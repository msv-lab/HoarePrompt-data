Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is equal to `x + 2`, `ny` is equal to 3, `dx` is 2, `dy` is 1, and `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`; otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
