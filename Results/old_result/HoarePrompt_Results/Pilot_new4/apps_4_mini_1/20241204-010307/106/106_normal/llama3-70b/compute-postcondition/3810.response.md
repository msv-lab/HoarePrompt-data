The code appends the tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `1` are added as a new entry in the `queue`. The states of all other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 2; `y` is 1; `nx` is `2 + dx`; `ny` is `1 + dy`; `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the values of `cur` and `piece`; `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`.**
