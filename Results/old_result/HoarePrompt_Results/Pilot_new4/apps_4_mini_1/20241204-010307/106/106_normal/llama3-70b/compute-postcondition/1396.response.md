In the provided code snippet, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur`, which implies that the variable `parent` at the indices `[2][ncur]` is now associated with the value of `cur`. The other variables remain unchanged in their current states. 

Given that `ncur` is equal to `A[2][1]`, the output state should reflect this assignment without altering the values of the other variables.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `nx` is 2, `ny` is 1, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 1, `ncur` is equal to `A[2][1]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is now updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur`.**
