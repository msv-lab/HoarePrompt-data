According to the code, the loop iterates over the list of direction tuples `[(dx, dy)]`, which are used to update the current position `(nx, ny)` while checking for valid movements. The loop will execute once for each tuple in the list. At the end of the last iteration, the loop has processed one of the direction tuples. Since there are four tuples in total, for the loop to execute one more time, the next direction tuple is needed.

If the last direction tuple processed was the first one `(-1, 0)`, then in the next iteration, the loop will process the second tuple `(1, 0)`. After that, the third and finally the fourth tuples `(0, -1)` and `(0, 1)` will be processed sequentially.

State: **`dist` contains valid distances for reachable indices, `parent[1][ncur]` reflects the parent tracking for each updated index, `piece` is 2, (dx, dy) will be the second tuple `(1, 0)`**
