The code assigns the values `cur` and `piece` to `parent[0][ncur]`. The values of `cur` and `piece` are not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine their specific values. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 2, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 4, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the values of `cur` and `piece`.**
