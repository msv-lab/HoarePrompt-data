The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `1` are added to the queue, but no other variables are affected by this operation. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is `A[x - 1][0]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur, piece`, and `queue` now contains `(ncur, 1)`**.
