Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, and `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`. If `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, then `dist[2]` contains updated distance values for all valid positions reachable with piece 2, `parent[2]` stores the last positions and pieces for those valid positions, and `queue` now contains an additional tuple `(cur, i)` if the value of `piece` is not equal to `i`. If `A[x][y]` is not equal to `cur`, there are no updates made to `dist[2]`, `parent[2]`, or `queue` and they remain unchanged from their initial states.***
