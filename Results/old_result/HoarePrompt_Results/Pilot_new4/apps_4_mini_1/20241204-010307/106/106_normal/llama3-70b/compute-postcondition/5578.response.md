Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `dist[1][ncur]` represents the shortest distance from `cur` to each valid `ncur`; `parent[1][ncur]` contains the previous state `(cur, piece)`; `queue` contains valid `(ncur, 1)` tuples; values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, and `A[0][0]` remain unchanged; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; the current value of `nx` is between 0 and N-1, and the current value of `ny` is between 0 and N-1.***
