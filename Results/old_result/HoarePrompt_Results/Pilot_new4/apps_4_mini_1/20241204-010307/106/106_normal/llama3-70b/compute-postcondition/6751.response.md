To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the information provided:

1. The loop iterates over a list of tuples representing directional movements. Each iteration processes one of these tuples, modifying positions based on `(dx, dy)`.

2. The current state indicates that `N` is between 3 and 10, which gives a range for valid coordinates. The variables `x` and `y` indicate the current position, which is (1, 1).

3. The loop body involves checking conditions on new potential positions `(nx, ny)` calculated based on the current position `(x, y)` adjusted by `(dx, dy)`. The conditions ensure that the new positions must remain within bounds (0 to N-1) and that certain criteria related to `piece`, `dist`, and `parent` are satisfied.

4. Each iteration of the loop corresponds to checking one of the directions. In the context of `dx` and `dy`, the loop will execute for each of the 8 possible movements, processing each direction represented by the tuples.

5. Since the loop is not relying on a counter that changes outside of the provided state, we will focus on the necessary states after the current iteration to prepare for the next iteration.

After the last iteration, the values of `dx` and `dy` would have been processed for one specific direction. To continue looping for the next direction, we need to update our state accordingly. 

Considering the nature of the loop and the states involved:

- The values of `dx` and `dy` will change as the loop iterates to the next tuple.
- No changes to `N`, `x`, `y`, `dist`, or `parent` are mentioned, so we will keep these values as is.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we expect to have processed the first direction and will now proceed to the second direction in the list.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `dist[1]` contains updated distances for valid positions reachable from (1, 1), `parent[1]` contains predecessors for valid positions reachable from (1, 1), `dx` and `dy` are the next direction in the iteration**.
