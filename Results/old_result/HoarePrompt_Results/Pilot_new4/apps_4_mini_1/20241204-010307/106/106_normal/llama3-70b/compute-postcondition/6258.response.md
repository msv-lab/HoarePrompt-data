The impact of the code on the program is that the tuple `(ncur, 1)` is appended to the `queue`. The previous values of the affected variables are unchanged aside from the addition to the `queue`. The states of the other variables remain intact.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `x` is defined and within bounds, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 0 or 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is updated to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` now includes `(ncur, 1)`.**
