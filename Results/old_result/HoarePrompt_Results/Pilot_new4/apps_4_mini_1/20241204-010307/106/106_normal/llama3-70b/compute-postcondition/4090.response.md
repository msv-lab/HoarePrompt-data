Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is one of [-1, 1, 0, 0], `ny` is one of [1, 1, 0, 2] depending on the values of `dx` and `dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. The value of `piece` is 2, and the distance `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`.***
