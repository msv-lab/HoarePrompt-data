The code `queue.append((ncur, 0))` adds a tuple containing the current value of `ncur` and `0` to the `queue`. The previous values of the variables remain unchanged, and the variable `queue` will now contain this new tuple.

Given the initial state:
- `N` is between 3 and 10
- `x` is 0
- `y` is 0
- `nx` is equal to `dx`
- `ny` is equal to `dy`
- `ncur` is equal to `A[dx][dy]`
- `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`
- `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`

The value of `queue` has been updated to include the tuple `(ncur, 0)`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[dx][dy]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`**.
