The statement `parent[1][ncur] = cur, piece` indicates that the value at the index `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the tuple `(cur, piece)`. The variables `cur` and `piece` are not defined in the initial state provided, so we cannot determine their specific values. However, the assignment indicates that `parent[1][ncur]` is being updated.

The other variables (`N`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `dist`) remain unchanged, as the assignment affects only the `parent` variable. 

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`**.
