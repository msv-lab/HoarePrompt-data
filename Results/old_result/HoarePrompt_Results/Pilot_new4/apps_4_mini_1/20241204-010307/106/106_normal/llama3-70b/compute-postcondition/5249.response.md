Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is between 0 and `N-1`; `y` is between 1 and `N-1`; `dist[2]` reflects the updated distances based on valid moves; `parent[2]` contains the relationships for valid positions; `queue` contains tuples generated from valid updates based on the conditions met during the loop execution. If the loop did not execute, then `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initial states.**
