The code assigns `cur` and `piece` as a tuple to `parent[1][ncur]`. The values of `cur` and `piece` were not provided in the initial state, but `parent[1][ncur]` now contains these values. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 0 and `N-1`, `nx = x + dx`, `ny = y + dy`, at least one of the resulting coordinates `(nx, ny)` is valid, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `dist[1][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the tuple `(cur, piece)`.**
