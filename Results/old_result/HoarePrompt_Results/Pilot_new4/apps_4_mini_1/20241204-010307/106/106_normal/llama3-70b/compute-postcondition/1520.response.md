The values of `nx` and `ny` are calculated based on the current values of `x`, `y`, and the deltas `dx` and `dy`. The variable `x` is currently 2, and `y` is also 2. The variables `dx` and `dy` must be defined and valid for this operation to be performed.

After the execution of the code, `nx` becomes `2 + dx` and `ny` becomes `2 + dy`. The specific values of `nx` and `ny` will depend on the values of `dx` and `dy`.

The states of the other variables (`N`, `A[x][y]`, `cur`, `dist[0]`, `parent[0]`, and `queue`) remain unchanged. Thus, the output state reflects the updated values of `nx` and `ny`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `A[x][y]` is defined, `cur` has a valid value, `dist[0]` is updated for each valid `ncur`, `parent[0]` is updated for each corresponding `ncur`, `queue` contains tuples of all valid `ncur` values with the associated piece 0, `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, and `x` and `y` must be such that `0 <= x + dx < N` and `0 <= y + dy < N` for each `(dx, dy)`.**
