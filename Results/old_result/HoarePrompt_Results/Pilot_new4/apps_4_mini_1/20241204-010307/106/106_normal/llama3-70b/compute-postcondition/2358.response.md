Output State: **`dist[1]` contains the shortest distances from the initial position to each reachable position; `parent[1]` contains the parent positions used to reach each position; `queue` contains all reachable positions that were updated during the execution of the loop based on valid moves from `(x, y)`; if `piece` is 2, `dist[2]` contains the shortest distances to the positions reachable from the starting position, and `parent[2]` contains the parent positions used to reach those positions. If no valid moves occurred, `dist[1]`, `parent[1]`, and `queue` remain unchanged.**
