The code executes by appending a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the existing `queue` variable. The initial values of `N`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `dist`, and `parent` are not altered, and the only change happens to the `queue` variable. Since `ncur` has been defined as `A[nx][ny]`, and the values of `dist` and `parent` have been updated accordingly, we maintain all that information. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the values of `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` now contains `(ncur, 0)`.**
