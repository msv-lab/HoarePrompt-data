The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and the tuple itself are now added to the `queue`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is `cur, piece`, and `queue` now includes `(ncur, 0)`.**
