Postcondition: ***`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is between 0 and N-1; `y` is between 1 and N-1; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; the current values of `nx` and `ny` are such that 0 is less than or equal to `nx` and `nx` is less than `N`, and 0 is less than or equal to `ny` and `ny` is less than `N`.***
