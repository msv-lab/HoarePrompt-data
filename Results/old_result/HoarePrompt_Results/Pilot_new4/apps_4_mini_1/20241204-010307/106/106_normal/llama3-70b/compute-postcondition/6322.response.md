The statement `parent[0][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the value of `cur` to `parent[0][ncur]`. The value of `piece` is also present in the statement, but it is not assigned to any variable in this context, so it does not affect the program state. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Given that `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `cur` is equal to `A[0][0]`, the output state remains valid with the updated value of `parent[0][ncur]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `piece` is equal to 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur`.**
