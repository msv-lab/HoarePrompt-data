The code `queue.append((ncur, 0))` appends a tuple containing `ncur` and 0 to the `queue`. This modifies the state of the `queue` variable without affecting the values of other variables mentioned.

The values of `ncur`, which is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, is used in the tuple being appended. Other variables in the initial state remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is adjusted to be between 0 and N-2, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `piece` is still 0 if not modified, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `queue` now includes `(ncur, 0)`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
