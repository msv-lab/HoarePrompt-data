According to the code, the execution of the loop relies on the ability to iterate through the defined moves `dx` and `dy`, which are specified as pairs in the list `[(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]`. The loop will iterate through these pairs, and during each iteration, it will evaluate the `nx` and `ny` coordinates derived from these movements.

Before the loop starts, the relevant states are as follows:
- `N` is at least 4, which indicates that there is a sufficient grid size for movement.
- `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` are initialized but may not be relevant to the loop execution directly.
- The variables `cur`, `piece`, and `y` have been set, and `A[x][y]` equals `cur`.

For the loop to execute correctly:
1. The variables `ncur`, `nx`, and `ny` must be derived correctly from `cur`, `dx`, and `dy` during each iteration.
2. The loop will run four times, once for each pair of `(dx, dy)`, which means the loop itself can execute without any changes to its state.

However, we should also ensure that upon entering the loop, `nx` and `ny` must be within the bounds of the grid, which implies:
- `nx` (derived from `cur` and `dx`) must be a valid index in the distance array.
- `ny` (derived from `y` and `dy`) must also be a valid index.

Assuming `cur` is a valid index, the `dist` and `parent` arrays must be set up such that their lengths can accommodate the indices calculated from `nx` and `ny`.

Given that the loop and its conditions depend on the validity of moves, let's adjust the state:

State: **`N` is at least 4, `dist` is valid for reachable indices, `parent` is valid for reachable indices, `queue` contains valid tuples of `(ncur, 0)`, `piece` is set according to loop conditions, `cur` is valid for index calculations, `x` and `y` are valid indices, `nx` and `ny` are derived from `cur` and must be within bounds of `dist` and `parent`.**
