Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `dist` reflects updated shortest distances for valid moves, `parent` reflects updated parent references for valid moves, `queue` contains at least one valid position, `nx` is `2 + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 2, and the current distance `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`.***
