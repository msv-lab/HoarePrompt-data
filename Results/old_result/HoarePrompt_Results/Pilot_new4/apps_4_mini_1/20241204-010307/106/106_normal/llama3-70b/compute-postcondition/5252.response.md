Postcondition: ***`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is between 0 and `N-1`; `y` is between 1 and `N-1`; if the value of `piece` is not equal to `i`, then `dist[2]` reflects the updated distances based on valid moves, `parent[2]` contains the relationships for valid positions, and `queue` now contains tuples generated from valid updates, including the new tuple `(cur, i)`. If the loop did not execute, then `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initial states.***
