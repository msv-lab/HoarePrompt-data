The variable `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to be equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`. Given that the current value of `dist[2][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, this condition indicates that the update will reduce the value of `dist[2][ncur]`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected, so we will retain their previous conditions.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` and `y` are within `0` and `N-1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `A[1][0]` equals `cur`, `dist[0]` has been updated for valid positions, `parent[0]` is set accordingly, `queue` contains valid tuples from previous executions, both `nx` and `ny` are within the range `0` to `N-1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `piece` equals `2`; `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
