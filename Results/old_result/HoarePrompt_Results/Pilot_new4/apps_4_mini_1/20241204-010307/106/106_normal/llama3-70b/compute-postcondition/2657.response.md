The code assigns a value to `parent[0][ncur]`, where `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][-3]` and `cur` is a previously defined variable. The rest of the variables remain unchanged in the output state.

Given the initial conditions:
- `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`
- `y` is -1
- `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`
- `dx` is -1
- `dy` is -2
- `nx` is `x - 1`
- `ny` is -3
- `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][-3]`
- `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`

After executing the code:
- `parent[0][ncur]` is now assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.

The output state reflects these changes while retaining the values of the other variables.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is -1, `A[x][-1]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -2, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is -3, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][-3]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`.**
