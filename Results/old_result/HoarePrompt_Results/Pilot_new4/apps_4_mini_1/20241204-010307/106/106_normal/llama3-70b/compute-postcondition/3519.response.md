The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is calculated as `x + dx` and `ny` is calculated as `y + dy`. Since `x` and `y` are within the range of `0` to `N-1`, the computed values `nx` and `ny` will also fall within the valid indices for the array `A` given that `dx` and `dy` are not specified but must be chosen such that they keep `nx` and `ny` within the bounds of the array dimensions.

The output state will reflect the assignment of `ncur` without changing the values of the other variables. Thus, we include all relevant information while updating `ncur`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is within `0` and `N-1`, `y` is within `0` and `N-1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
