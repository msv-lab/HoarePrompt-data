The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to the `parent` array at the position `[1][ncur]`. The variables `cur` and `piece` are not specified in the initial state, but they are used in the assignment. The other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the output state should reflect this change along with the relevant preconditions that are still valid.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is 2, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, `piece`.**
