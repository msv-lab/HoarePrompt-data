The code `queue.append((ncur, 0))` appends a tuple consisting of `ncur` and `0` to the `queue`. The previous values of `ncur` and `queue` are not provided, but the impact of the code on the program is that `ncur` is included in the `queue` along with the constant `0`. The other states of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is -1, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is `x - 2`, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 2][0]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur and piece`, `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`**.
