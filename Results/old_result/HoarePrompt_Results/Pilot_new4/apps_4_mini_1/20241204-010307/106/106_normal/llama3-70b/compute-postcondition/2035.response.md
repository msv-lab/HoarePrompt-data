According to the code, the for loop iterates over a list of tuples representing the possible (dx, dy) movements. The loop will execute for each tuple in the list. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know:
- `N` is at least 5, meaning the values of `nx` and `ny` must be valid indices (within the range of 0 to N-1).
- The loop continues to execute as long as there are tuples left in the list of movement directions.

Since each iteration of the loop processes one tuple, we need to consider the current state of `dx` and `dy`. Assuming the loop has executed for `i` number of times so far, after the last iteration, `dx` and `dy` would correspond to the last tuple processed.

To determine the state for the next iteration:
- We need to know the next tuple to be processed. If `i` is the index of the current tuple, then for the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
- The next tuple would be accessed using the updated index.

The list of directions has 8 tuples. If the loop has processed all of them, then `i` should be equal to 8 after the last iteration, and the loop would not execute again. 

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be less than 8. If it has processed `i` tuples, it will process the tuple indexed by `i`, and the next `dx` and `dy` values will be from that tuple.

State: **`N` is at least 5, `dx` and `dy` must correspond to the next tuple in the list of movement directions, `i` must be less than 8**
