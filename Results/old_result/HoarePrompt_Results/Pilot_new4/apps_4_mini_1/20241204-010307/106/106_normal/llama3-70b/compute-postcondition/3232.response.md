According to the code, the loop iterates over the list of direction tuples `[(dx, dy)]`, which contains 4 elements. The loop will execute for each of these tuples. 

At the end of the last iteration, the values of `dx` and `dy` will correspond to the last tuple in the list, which is `(0, 1)`. After the last iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, the loop will start over and take the first tuple again, which is `(-1, 0)`. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted accordingly.

The current state includes `N` being an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, and `y` is 0. Since the loop does not modify these values directly, they remain unchanged.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0**
