The line of code updates the value of `dist[2][ncur]` to be `dist[2][cur] + 1`. Given that `dist[2][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, this implies that the value of `dist[2][cur] + 1` is now set as the new value for `dist[2][ncur]`. The other variable states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 1 and N-2; `x` is between 1 and N-2; `piece` is 2; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; the current value of `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `dist[2][cur]` remains unchanged.**
