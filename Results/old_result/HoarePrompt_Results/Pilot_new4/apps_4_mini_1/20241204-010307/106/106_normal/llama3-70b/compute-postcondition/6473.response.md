Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is 0, `ny` is 2, `ncur` is `A[0][2]`, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 1. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, and `queue` has the tuple `(ncur, 2)` appended. Otherwise, the program maintains its initial state without any changes.***
