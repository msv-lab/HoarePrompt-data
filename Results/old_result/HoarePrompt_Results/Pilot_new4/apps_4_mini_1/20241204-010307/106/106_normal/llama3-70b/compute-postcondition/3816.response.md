The code assigns a new value to the element `dist[1][ncur]`. The value is calculated as `dist[1][cur] + 1`. The previous states of the other variables are not directly affected, but we need to acknowledge the values of `dist`, `ncur`, and `cur`. 

Since `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]` and `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`, and `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, the specific values of `ncur` depend on the values of `dx` and `dy` as well as the array `A`.

However, since we do not have specific values for `dist`, `cur`, `dx`, `dy`, or `A`, we can only express the changes regarding `dist[1][ncur]` while recognizing that `dist[1][cur]` is an existing state.

The output state will then capture this assignment and the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `4 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
