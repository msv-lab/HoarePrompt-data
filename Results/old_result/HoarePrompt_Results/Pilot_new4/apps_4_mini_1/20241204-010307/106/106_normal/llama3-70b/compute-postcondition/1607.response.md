The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the list `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `0` do not change, but `queue` is modified to include the new tuple. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is 1, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`, and the `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`**.
