To analyze the provided code snippet, we need to consider the implications of the code on the variables involved.

1. The code `nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy` assigns new values to `nx` and `ny`.
2. The variables `dx` and `dy` are derived from the first tuple in the `queue`, which is `(-2, -1)`. Therefore, `dx` is `-2` and `dy` is `-1`.
3. We do not have the current values of `x` and `y`, but we know that `nx` will be computed as `x - 2` and `ny` as `y - 1`.

Since we have not been given specific values for `x` and `y`, we can express the new values of `nx` and `ny` in terms of `x` and `y`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `piece` is equal to `0`, `dist[2]` holds the shortest distances, `parent[2]` indicates the predecessors, `queue` holds the relevant tuples including `(ncur, 0)`, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, and `ny` is equal to `y - 1`**.
