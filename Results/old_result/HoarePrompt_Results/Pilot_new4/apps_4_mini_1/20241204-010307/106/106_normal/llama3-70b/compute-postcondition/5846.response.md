Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; `queue` initially contains at least one tuple of the form `(ncur, 1)`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and if `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, the queue now also contains `(ncur, 2)`; `piece` is 2; `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur, piece`. If the condition is not met, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
