The code assigns `cur` and `piece` as the values for `parent[0][ncur]`. The previous state of `parent[0][ncur]` is not specified, but it is updated to hold these new values. The other variables' states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `nx` is `2 + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is updated to `cur, piece`.**
