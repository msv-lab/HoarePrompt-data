The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `0` are added to `queue`, but no other variables are modified by this line of code. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `cur` is unchanged, `dist[1]` remains unchanged, `parent[1]` remains unchanged, `piece` is equal to 0, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to the minimum distance from `(0, 2)`, `parent[2][ncur]` contains the updated parent positions, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the values of `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`.**
