The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[1][ncur]`. The initial state provides that `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, but the values for `cur` and `piece` are not defined in the initial state. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is at least 6, `x` is 4, `y` is 2, `nx` is equal to `4 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`.**
