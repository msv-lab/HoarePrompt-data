The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are defined as `nx = 1 + dx` and `ny = 1 + dy`, and they satisfy the condition `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, which means they are valid indices for accessing the two-dimensional list `A`. The other variables retain their previous values, and no other variables are changed.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 1; `A` must have dimensions that allow access to indices from `(x + dx, y + dy)` for each `dx, dy` in the list; `piece` is 2; `nx` is `1 + dx`; `ny` is `1 + dy`; `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`.**
