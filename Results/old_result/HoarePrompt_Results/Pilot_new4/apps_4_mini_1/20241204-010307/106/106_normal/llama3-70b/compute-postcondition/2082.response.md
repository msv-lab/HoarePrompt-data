To analyze the given code snippet, we have the following initial states: 

- `N` is at least 5. 
- `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices. 
- `parent` reflects the most recent parents for all reachable indices.
- `piece` is equal to 2. 
- `nx`, `ny`, `ncur` remain unchanged.
- `dx` and `dy` indicate the last processed values `(0, 1)`.

The code executes the assignment:
```
nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
```

Here, `nx` is updated to the value of `x + dx`, and `ny` is updated to the value of `y + dy`. Since the values of `x` and `y` are not provided in the initial state, we cannot specify the exact new values for `nx` and `ny`. However, we do know that the assignment will change `nx` and `ny` based on their previous values and the respective increments.

Since `dx` is `0` and `dy` is `1`, we can summarize the updates:
- `nx` becomes `x + 0`, which simplifies to `nx = x`.
- `ny` becomes `y + 1`, which means `ny` is increased by 1.

The information about other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is at least 5, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the most recent parents for all reachable indices, `piece` is equal to 2, `nx` is equal to `x`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1`, `ncur` remains unchanged.**
