According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the values provided in the list of tuples `[(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]`. The variables `dx` and `dy` are iterated over these tuples, therefore they can take on the values from this list.

To ensure that the loop can execute, we need to confirm that conditions have already been established that allow `nx` and `ny` to be calculated based on `x`, `dx`, and `y`, `dy`. However, since there's no explicit information given about the values of `x` and `y`, we can't specify their states. 

Furthermore, `N` being at least 4 indicates that there are enough indices to work with, as well as the fact that `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` are prepared to potentially be updated based on the conditions met during the loop execution. The current state does not specify changes to `dist`, `parent`, and `queue`, so we assume they remain unchanged until conditions are met.

Thus, the key adjustments for the loop to execute involve ensuring that `dx` and `dy` are appropriately set by the loop, allowing `nx` and `ny` to be calculated for the reachable indices.

State: **`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices, `queue` may contain tuples of reachable indices and associated pieces, `piece` remains unchanged at 0, `y` is 4, `nx` and `ny` are determined as `nx = x + dx`, `ny = y + dy` for each tuple of `dx` and `dy`**
