Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `dist[2][ncur]` reflects the minimum distances from `cur` for all updated `ncur` where `piece` is 2; `parent[2][ncur]` holds the values `(cur, piece)` for each updated `ncur`; `queue` contains tuples of (ncur, 2) for all valid `ncur` that met the distance condition; the current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`; `queue` now includes the tuple `(cur, i)`**
