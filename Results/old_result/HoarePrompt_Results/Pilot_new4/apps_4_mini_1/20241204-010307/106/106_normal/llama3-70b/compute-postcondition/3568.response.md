The code appends a tuple containing the values of `ncur` and `2` to the `queue`. None of the other variables or their values are impacted by this operation. Therefore, the Output State reflects the unchanged values of the relevant variables, along with the new entry in the `queue`.

Output State: **`dist[1][ncur]` contains the minimum distances from the starting position to all reachable positions, `parent[1][ncur]` reflects the last piece and position before reaching `ncur`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the range [0, N), `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is now equal to `(cur, piece)`, `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`**.
