To determine the necessary adjustments for the for loop to execute, we need to consider the variables involved and their initial states based on the context provided.

The loop iterates over the pairs `(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)`. For the loop to execute:

1. We need to ensure that `dx` and `dy` are updated for each iteration.
2. The loop will always execute four times since there are four pairs in the list.
3. There are no additional conditions that would prevent the loop from executing as long as the for loop itself is syntactically correct.

The state before the loop starts will need to reflect that `dx` and `dy` will be assigned the values from the pairs in the list. Therefore, we need to initialize `dx` and `dy` such that they will take on the values from the list during the iterations.

State: **`dx` is -1, `dy` is -1 (first iteration), `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged**. 

This means, at the start of the loop, the state reflects the first pair to be iterated over. After the first iteration, `dx` and `dy` will change to the next pair, and so forth, until all pairs have been processed.
