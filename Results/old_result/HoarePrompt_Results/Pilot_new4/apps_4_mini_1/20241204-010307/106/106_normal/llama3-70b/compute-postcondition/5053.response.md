Postcondition: ***`dist` contains the shortest distances from (3, 0) to all reachable positions, `parent` reflects the parent tuples for those positions, `queue` must contain at least one valid tuple, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and the current values of `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of 0 and N, inclusive for 0 and exclusive for N.***
