The operation `queue.append((ncur, 1))` adds a tuple containing `ncur` and `1` to the `queue`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the state of the `queue` variable is updated to include a new element.

The values of the other variables in the initial state are still valid. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 3, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is 4, `ncur` is `A[x + 1][4]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is now `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned `cur, piece`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`**.
