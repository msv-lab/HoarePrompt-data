The code appends the tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the list `queue`. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `dist[1][ncur]`, and `parent[1][ncur]` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the `append` operation. Therefore, the output state retains all the previous values, along with the information that the tuple has been added to the `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is -1, `nx` is 1, `ny` is -1, `ncur` is equal to `A[1][-1]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`, and `(ncur, 1)` has been appended to `queue`.**
