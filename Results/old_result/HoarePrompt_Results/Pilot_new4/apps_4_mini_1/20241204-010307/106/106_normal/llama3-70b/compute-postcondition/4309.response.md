Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is equal to `N`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `N + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x + dx][N + dy]`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged. If `piece` is equal to 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `ncur` has been appended to `queue` along with `0`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
