According to the code, the for loop iterates over the list of tuples `[(dx, dy)]`, which contains directional changes. The loop will execute 4 times, once for each tuple in the list.

At the end of the last iteration, the variables `dx` and `dy` will have taken on the values of the last tuple, which is `(1, 1)`. After the last iteration, the next update will take `dx` and `dy` to the next tuple, which does not exist, therefore the loop will not execute again.

Thus, to make the loop execute again, we can consider resetting or re-initializing the loop. However, since there's no further condition or change in state that allows it to execute again without specific modifications or reinitialization, the loop cannot proceed.

State: **`N` is at least 4, `dist` is valid for reachable indices, and the values of `cur`, `ncur`, `nx`, and `ny` remain valid for index calculations. `dx` and `dy` must be reset to the first tuple (-1, -1) for the loop to start again.**
