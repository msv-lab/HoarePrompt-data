Given the initial state and the code snippet provided, let's analyze the impact step by step:

1. `N` is between 3 and 10, which means `nx` (which is `x + 1`) could take values depending on the value of `x`.
2. `y` is initialized to 1, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x + 1`, and `ny` is also 1.
3. The code `ncur = A[nx][ny]` assigns the value from the 2D array `A` to `ncur` based on the indices `nx` and `ny`.

Now, since `ny` is fixed at 1 and `nx` is dependent on the value of `x`, `ncur` will take the value of `A[nx][1]` where `nx` is equal to `x + 1`. The state of all other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is 1, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][1]`.**
