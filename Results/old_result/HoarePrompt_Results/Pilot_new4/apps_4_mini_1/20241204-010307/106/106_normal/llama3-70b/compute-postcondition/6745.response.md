Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `dist[1]` contains updated distances for valid positions reachable from (1, 1), `parent[1]` contains predecessors for valid positions reachable from (1, 1), `queue` contains tuples of all reachable positions from (1, 1) that had their distances updated during the loop, `piece` must not equal `i` for `(cur, 2)` to be added to `queue`, `nx` is equal to `1 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. Additionally, `piece` is equal to 0, and the current value of `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`.***
