Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 5, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, and `parent` reflects the most recent parents for all reachable indices. If `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, 2)`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `queue` contains the tuple `(A[x][y + 1], 2)`. Otherwise, no changes occur to `parent`, `dist`, or `queue`.***
