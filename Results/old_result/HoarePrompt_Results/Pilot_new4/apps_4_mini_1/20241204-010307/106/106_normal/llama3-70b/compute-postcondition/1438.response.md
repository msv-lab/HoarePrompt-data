The statement `dist[1][ncur] = dist[1][cur] + 1` updates the value of `dist[1][ncur]`. It assigns to `dist[1][ncur]` the value of `dist[1][cur] + 1`. Given that the current value of `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, this means that `dist[1][cur]` must have been less than `dist[1][ncur] - 1` prior to the assignment.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `nx` is 2 + `dx`, `ny` is 1 + `dy`, `dist[0]` contains the minimum distances from the starting position to each reachable cell in the grid, `parent[0]` contains the parent information for each reachable cell, `queue` is empty, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `dist[1][ncur]` is less than or equal to its previous value.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `nx` is 2 + `dx`, `ny` is 1 + `dy`, `dist[0]` contains the minimum distances from the starting position to each reachable cell in the grid, `parent[0]` contains the parent information for each reachable cell, `queue` is empty, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1` and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur]`.**
