The values of `nx` and `ny` are assigned based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. Specifically, `nx` becomes `x + dx`, which is `0 + 1 = 1`, and `ny` becomes `y + dy`, which is `2 + 2 = 4`. The other variables, `N`, `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`, remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 2, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 4.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 2, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 4.**
