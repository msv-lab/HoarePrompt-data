The code updates the value of `dist[0][ncur]` to be equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`. The previous state mentions that `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and other variables remain unchanged. The value of `dist[0][ncur]` will now depend on the specific values of `dist[0][cur]` and `ncur`. 

Thus, the Output State reflects the changes made to `dist[0][ncur]` based on the existing values of `dist[0][cur]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 0; `y` is 0; `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`; `nx` is equal to `dx`; `ny` is equal to `dy`; `piece` is equal to 0; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
