Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `piece` is equal to `1`, `dist[0]` holds the updated shortest distances for reachable positions, `parent[0]` indicates the predecessors for those reachable positions, `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is `y - 1`, and if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then if `piece` equals 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is updated to `cur`, `piece` remains unchanged, and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. If the condition is not satisfied, there are no changes to the variables.***
