The code `queue.append((ncur, 2))` appends a tuple containing the values of `ncur` and `2` to the `queue`. Based on the initial state, the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dist[2][ncur]` is now less than or equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is now equal to `cur`, `queue` now includes `(ncur, 2)`.**
