The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. Given that `nx` and `ny` are within the range of 0 to N-1 (inclusive), and `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, the values of `A[nx][ny]` depend on the specific values of `nx` and `ny`. However, since `A` is not defined in more detail, we cannot specify what `ncur` will be specifically. 

Thus, the states of the other variables remain unchanged, and since `ncur` is dependent on the values in `A` at the indices `nx` and `ny`, we can only state that `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is `dx`, `ny` is `dy`, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[0]` contains the distances from `cur` to other reachable nodes, `parent[0]` contains the parent nodes for the reachable distances, `queue` contains tuples representing reachable nodes that correspond to the `dx` and `dy` movements, `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`.**
