The code snippet calculates new values for `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x` and `y`, along with the changes defined by `dx` and `dy`. The values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine specific values for `nx` and `ny`. 

However, `nx` is assigned the value of `x + dx`, and `ny` is assigned the value of `y + dy`. The states of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is `0 + dx`, `ny` is `0 + dy`, `dist[0]` and `parent[0]` are updated for all valid `ncur` values, `queue` contains valid tuples of `(ncur, 0)` for valid moves; if there are no valid moves, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged**.
