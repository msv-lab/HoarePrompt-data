The code updates the `dist` array at indices `[0][ncur]`, setting it equal to the value of `dist[0][cur] + 1`. The variable `ncur` is defined as `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is equal to `x + dx` and `ny` is equal to `y + dy`. The values of `N`, `y`, `piece`, `nx`, and `ny` remain unchanged in this execution.

Since `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, the state of `dist[0][ncur]` now reflects that the distance associated with the coordinate `ncur` has increased by 1 compared to the distance associated with `cur`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is the current y-coordinate; `piece` is not equal to the value represented by `i`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
