The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[0][ncur]`. The values of `cur` and `piece` are not explicitly defined in the initial state, but `cur` is implied to be a current index and `piece` is a specific value of 0. 

The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the values of `cur` and `piece`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the values of `cur` and `piece`.**
