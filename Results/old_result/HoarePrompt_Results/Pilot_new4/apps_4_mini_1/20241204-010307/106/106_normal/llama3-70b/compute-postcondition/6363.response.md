The values of `nx` and `ny` are calculated by adding `dx` to `x` and `dy` to `y`, respectively. The values of `x` and `y` are both 0, so:

- `nx = 0 + dx`
- `ny = 0 + dy`

Thus, `nx` will be equal to `dx` and `ny` will be equal to `dy`. Other variables remain unchanged, and the ranges of `N`, `dist[0]`, and `parent[0]` are not affected.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dist[0]` remains unchanged, `parent[0]` remains unchanged, `queue` must contain at least one tuple of (ncur, 1), `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`.**
