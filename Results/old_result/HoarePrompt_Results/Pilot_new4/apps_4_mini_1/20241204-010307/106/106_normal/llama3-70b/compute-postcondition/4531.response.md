Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur` positions based on the knight's moves, `parent[1][ncur]` contains tuples of `cur` and `piece` for those valid positions if `piece` is 1, `queue` contains all valid `(ncur, 1)` tuples for all valid knight moves from the starting position. If the coordinates `(nx, ny)` are valid (within bounds), then `dist[2][ncur]` is set to `dist[2][cur] + 1` and `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)` if `piece` equals 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`.***
