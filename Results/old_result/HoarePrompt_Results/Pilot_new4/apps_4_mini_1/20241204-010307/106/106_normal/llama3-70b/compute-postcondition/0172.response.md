The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The value of `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, and the value of `ny` is equal to `y + dy`. Therefore, the value of `ncur` depends on the contents of the array `A` at the index positions `[nx][ny]`. 

The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 3 and 10; `x` is greater than 1 and less than `N - 1`; `y` has been updated to `y + dy`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 3 and 10; `x` is greater than 1 and less than `N - 1`; `y` has been updated to `y + dy`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
