The code `queue.append((ncur, 0))` appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `0` are added to the `queue`, but no other variables in the initial state are modified. 

The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 2, `nx` is equal to `4 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, and the tuple `(ncur, 0)` has been added to `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 2, `nx` is equal to `4 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, and `(ncur, 0)` has been added to `queue`.**
