The code `queue.append((ncur, 0))` appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The variables being affected by this operation are `queue`, `ncur`, and the structure of the tuple being appended. The values of `N`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `piece`, `dist`, and `parent` remain unchanged.

1. The value of `ncur` is defined as `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is `x - 2` and `ny` is 0. The value of `ncur` is determined from the value in the array `A` at indices determined by `nx` and `ny`.
2. The `queue` will now contain an additional entry, which is the tuple `(ncur, 0)`.

Since we do not know the current state of `queue`, we just note that it has had a new tuple added to it.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is `x - 2`, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1` which is greater than its previous value, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`**.
