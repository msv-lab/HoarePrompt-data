Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 5; `dx` and `dy` correspond to the next tuple in the list of movement directions; `i` is less than 8; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`. If the coordinates `(nx, ny)` are within bounds (i.e., `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`), then `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`; if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. If the coordinates are out of bounds, there are no changes made to `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.***
