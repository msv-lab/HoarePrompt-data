Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `piece` is 1, `dist[1]` stores the shortest distances based on the updates made during the iterations, `parent[1]` reflects the predecessors for each reachable position as per the updates, and `queue` contains all tuples of reachable positions that were processed during the iterations. If no updates occurred during the loop, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initial state.**
