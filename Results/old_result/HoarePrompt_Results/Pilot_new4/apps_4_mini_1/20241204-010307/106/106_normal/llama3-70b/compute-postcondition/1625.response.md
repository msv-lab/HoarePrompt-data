The code assigns the value of `cur` to `parent[1][ncur]`, while the other variables remain unchanged. We know that `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, which depends on the values of `nx` and `ny`. The value of `parent[1][ncur]` is now updated to `cur`. 

Since `N` is between 3 and 10 and `y` remains 0, we can state that the other variables are unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 0; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur`; `queue` remains unchanged; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
