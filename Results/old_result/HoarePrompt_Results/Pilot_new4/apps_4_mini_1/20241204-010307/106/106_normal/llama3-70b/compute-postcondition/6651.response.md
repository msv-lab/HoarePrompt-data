Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; `dist` contains updated distances for valid positions reachable from `(1, 0)` if at least one valid position exists; `parent` contains predecessors for valid positions reachable from `(1, 0)` if at least one valid position exists; `queue` contains tuples of all reachable positions from `(1, 0)` and an additional tuple `(cur, i)` has been appended to it; the current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`.**
