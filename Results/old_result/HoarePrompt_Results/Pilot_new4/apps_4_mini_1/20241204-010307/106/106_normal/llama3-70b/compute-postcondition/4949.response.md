The variable `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur` combined with `piece`. The specific values of `ncur` and `cur` depend on the previous context, where `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y - 1]`. However, the values of `cur` and `piece` are not defined in the initial state provided.

Since `N`, `y`, `x`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` still maintain their previous relationships and constraints, the output state must reflect the unchanged variables while updating the affected one.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 1 and N-2; `x` is between 1 and N-2; `dx` is -1; `dy` is -1; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is equal to `y - 1`; `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y - 1]; dist[1][ncur] is equal to dist[1][cur] + 1; parent[1][ncur] is equal to `cur`, `piece`.**
