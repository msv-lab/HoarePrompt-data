The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned values based on the expressions `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. Here, `y` is 2, so `ny` will be equal to `2 + dy`. The previous values of `x` and `y` are still valid, while `nx` is determined by the current value of `x` and the direction `dx`. 

The output state will reflect the updates made to `nx` and `ny`, while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `dist[1]` reflects the minimum distances updated based on valid moves from the initial state, `parent[1]` contains the connections made for valid moves, `queue` must contain at least one tuple representing a valid move (a node).**
