Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `nx` is `0 + dx`; `ny` is `1 + dy`; `ncur` is `A[0 + dx][1 + dy]`. If `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `cur, piece`, and `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. Otherwise, no changes occur in the relevant variables.***
