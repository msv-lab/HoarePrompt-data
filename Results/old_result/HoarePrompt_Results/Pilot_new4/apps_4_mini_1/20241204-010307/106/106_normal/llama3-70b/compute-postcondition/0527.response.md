The operation `queue.append((cur, i))` will add a tuple `(cur, i)` to the `queue`. The variables `cur` and `i` are not explicitly defined in the initial state, but the operation modifies the `queue` by appending a new tuple. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `dist[2]` reflects the updated minimum distances after checking all valid moves, `parent[2]` contains the updated connections for valid moves corresponding to the final state of `dist[2]`, `queue` now includes the tuple `(cur, i)`, and the current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`.**
