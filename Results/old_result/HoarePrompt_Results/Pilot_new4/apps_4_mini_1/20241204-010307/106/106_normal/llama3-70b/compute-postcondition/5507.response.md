The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The variables affected by this code are `queue`, which is updated to include the new element. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Hence, the output state will include the specific values that have been updated.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is 4; `y` is 2; `dx` is 1; `dy` is 0; `nx` is 5; `ny` is 2; `ncur` is A[5][2]; `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is (cur, piece); `queue` has been updated to include the tuple `(ncur, 2)`**
