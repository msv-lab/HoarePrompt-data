Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to (cur, 1), and `queue` now contains `(ncur, 1)`; otherwise, no changes are made. If the condition `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` is not satisfied, no changes are made to any variables.***
