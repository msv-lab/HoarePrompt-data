The code appends a tuple `(cur, i)` to the `queue`. The current state of `piece` is not equal to `i`, but the values of `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initialized states if no valid moves were possible. Since `cur` and `i` are not defined in the initial state, we only focus on the action of appending to `queue`.

The output state reflects that `queue` has been updated to include the new tuple, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `piece` is 2, `dist[2][ncur]` contains the shortest distances for all reachable `ncur` values from the starting point, `parent[2][ncur]` holds the corresponding previous positions from which `ncur` was reached, `queue` now includes the tuple `(cur, i)` along with all previously existing elements, and the current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`.**
