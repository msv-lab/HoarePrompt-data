The values of `nx` and `ny` are updated based on the expressions `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The values of `N`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged, and their original constraints still apply. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is between `0` and `N-1`, `y` is between `0` and `N-2`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, and `ny` is equal to `y + dy`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is between `0` and `N-1`, `y` is between `0` and `N-2`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`.**
