The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`, which means that the contents of the `queue` are updated to include this new element. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `dist`, and `parent` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the queue operation.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` and `y` are within `0` and `N-1`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur`; `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`**.
