The code snippet appends a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Thus, the output state will reflect that `queue` now contains the new entry while maintaining the previous states of other variables.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `nx` is equal to `dx`; `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`; `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`.**
