The assignment `parent[0][ncur] = cur, piece` updates the `parent` array at the position `[0][ncur]` with the values of `cur` and `piece`. The values of `cur` and `piece` are not explicitly given in the initial state, but we know that `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `N`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and `dist[0][ncur]` remain unchanged after this operation.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 4`, `ny` is 3, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `cur, piece`.**
