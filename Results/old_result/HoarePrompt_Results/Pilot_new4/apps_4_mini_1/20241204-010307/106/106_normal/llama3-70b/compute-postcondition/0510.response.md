The values of `nx` and `ny` are assigned based on the expressions `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The value of `y` is already given as `2`. The variables `x`, `dx`, and `dy` are not specified, but we know from the initial conditions that `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N` and `N` is an integer between `3` and `10`. Therefore, the values of `nx` and `ny` can be expressed as `nx = x + dx` and `ny = 2 + dy`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`.**
