The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The index `nx` is equal to `x + 1`, and `ny` is equal to `y - 1`. The values of `N` (between 3 and 10), `y` (between 0 and 8 inclusive), `dx`, and `dy` remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 0 and 8 (inclusive); `dx` is 1; `dy` is -1; `nx` is equal to `x + 1`; `ny` is equal to `y - 1; `ncur` is equal to `A[x + 1][y - 1]`.**
