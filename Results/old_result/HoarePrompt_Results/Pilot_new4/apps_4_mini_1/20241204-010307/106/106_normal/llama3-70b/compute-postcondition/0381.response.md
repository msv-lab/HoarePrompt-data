The variable `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, as well as the value of `piece`. The values of `ncur` and `cur` are thus crucial for this assignment but are not provided directly. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -2, `nx` is `x - 1 - 1`, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][0]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -2, `nx` is `x - 1 - 1`, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][0]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.**
