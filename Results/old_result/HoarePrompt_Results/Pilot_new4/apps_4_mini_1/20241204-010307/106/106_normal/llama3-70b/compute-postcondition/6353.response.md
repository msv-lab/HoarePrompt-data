According to the code, the loop iterates over a list of tuples representing the changes in `x` and `y` coordinates (`dx` and `dy`). There are four pairs of changes to iterate through in the specified order. The loop begins with the first tuple `(-1, -1)` and continues through the list.

At the end of the last iteration, `dx` is equal to `nx` and `dy` is equal to `ny`, which were both initialized to 0. Since the loop starts with the first tuple, we can deduce the following from the end of the last iteration:

1. Since the loop is currently processing the first iteration with `dx` and `dy` equal to `-1`, `dx = -1` and `dy = -1`.
2. For the loop to execute one more time, `dx` and `dy` need to be updated to the next tuple, which is `(-1, 1)`.

Thus, we need to modify the values of `dx` and `dy` to reflect what they would be in the next iteration of the loop. 

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `-1`, `ny` is equal to `1`, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, if `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `queue` is updated to include `(ncur, 1)`. The distances in `dist[0]` and the parent nodes in `parent[0]` remain unchanged.**
