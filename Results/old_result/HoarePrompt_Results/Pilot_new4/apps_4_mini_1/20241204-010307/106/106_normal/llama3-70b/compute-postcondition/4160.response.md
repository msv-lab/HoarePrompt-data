The code `queue.append((ncur, 1))` appends a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the list `queue`. The state of the other variables is not affected by this operation. The value of `ncur` has already been assigned from `A[-1][3]`, and since `cur` is undefined, we cannot determine its value in relation to `parent[1][ncur]`.

The output state will reflect the unchanged information along with the effect of appending to the queue.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 0; `y` is 2; `nx` is -1; `ny` is 3; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 1; `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[-1][3]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur`; `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)` appended to it.**
