The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `dist`, and `parent` remain unchanged. Therefore, the state of the other variables is still valid. The only change is the addition of the tuple to the `queue`. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 1; `nx` is equal to `1 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`; `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`**.
