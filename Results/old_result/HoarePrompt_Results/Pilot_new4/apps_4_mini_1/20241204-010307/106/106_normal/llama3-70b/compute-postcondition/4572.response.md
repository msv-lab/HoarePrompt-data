According to the code, the loop iterates over a list of tuples for the variables `dx` and `dy`. Each iteration will set new values for `dx` and `dy` from the list `[(−2,−1), (−2,1), (−1,−2), (−1,2), (1,−2), (1,2), (2,−1), (2,1)]`.

At the end of the last iteration, `dy` is 1, implying that the last executed tuple is `(-2, 1)`. The next tuple in the list for the loop will be `(-1, -2)` for the next iteration.

The loop will continue executing as long as there are tuples to iterate over. Since there are 8 tuples in total, and one iteration has already completed, the next state will reflect the new values of `dx` and `dy`.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -2, `nx` is equal to `x - 4`, and `ny` is 2**
