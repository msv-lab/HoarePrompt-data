According to the code, the loop will execute a fixed number of times regardless of the values of `N`, `y`, and `piece`, since it iterates over a predefined list of tuples representing (dx, dy) pairs. The loop can execute as long as it reaches the iteration condition unfettered by any additional constraints.

At the end of the last iteration, the variables `dx` and `dy` will hold the values of the last tuple from the list, which is `(2, 1)`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, no adjustments are necessary for `N`, `y`, and `piece`, but we need to specify the final values of `dx` and `dy` post loop execution.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `piece` is 2, `dx` is 2, `dy` is 1**
