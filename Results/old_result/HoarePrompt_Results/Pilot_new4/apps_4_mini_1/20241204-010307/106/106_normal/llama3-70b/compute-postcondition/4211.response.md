Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 1, `y` is `N-1`, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `N - 1 + dy`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dist` contains the updated minimum distances, `parent` contains parent information, `queue` contains tuples representing reachable points, `nx` and `ny` satisfy `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 0, and the current value of `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`.***
