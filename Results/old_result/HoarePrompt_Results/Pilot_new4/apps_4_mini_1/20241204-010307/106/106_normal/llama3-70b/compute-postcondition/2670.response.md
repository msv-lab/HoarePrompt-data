Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is -1, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`. If `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `queue` is updated to include the new tuple `(ncur, 1)` for the valid `ncur`. Additionally, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, both of which remain within the bounds of the grid, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.***
