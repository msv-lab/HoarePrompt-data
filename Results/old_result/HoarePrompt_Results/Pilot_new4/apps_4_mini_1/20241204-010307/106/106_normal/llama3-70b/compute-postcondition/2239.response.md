The code assigns the value of `A[nx][ny]` to the variable `ncur`. The variables `nx` and `ny` are calculated based on the values of `x` and `y`, leading to `nx` being `x - 1` and `ny` being `y - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`piece` is 0, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is `y - 1, ncur is A[x - 1][y - 1]**
