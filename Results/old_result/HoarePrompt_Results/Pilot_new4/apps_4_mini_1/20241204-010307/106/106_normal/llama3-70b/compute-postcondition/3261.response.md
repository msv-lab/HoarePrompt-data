The variable `queue` is modified by appending a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to it. The other variables maintain their previous values, and the conditions regarding them remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables as well as the new state of `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `0 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`.**
