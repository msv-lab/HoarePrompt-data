The code `nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy` modifies the values of `nx` and `ny`. 

Given that the initial state includes:
- `x` is 2
- `y` is 2
- `nx` is `2 + 1`, which equals 3
- `ny` is `2 + 1`, which equals 3

The new values for `nx` and `ny` will depend on the values of `dx` and `dy`, which are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine their exact values after execution without knowing `dx` and `dy`. 

The output state will reflect the new calculations of `nx` and `ny` based on the unknown values of `dx` and `dy`, while retaining the other variable values.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, and `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]` (with the next tuple being (1, 1))**.
