In the provided code snippet, the variable `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of the tuple `(cur, piece)`. The variables `cur` and `piece` are involved in this assignment, and since the initial state mentions that `piece` remains unchanged at 0, we can conclude the following:

- `parent[0][ncur]` now holds the tuple `(cur, 0)`.
- The other variables, `N`, `dist`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `queue`, and `dist[0][ncur]` are not affected by this assignment.

Final output state reflects these changes while maintaining the unchanged state of the other variables.

Output State: **`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `piece` remains unchanged at 0, `y` is 4, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to 5, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, 0)`**.
