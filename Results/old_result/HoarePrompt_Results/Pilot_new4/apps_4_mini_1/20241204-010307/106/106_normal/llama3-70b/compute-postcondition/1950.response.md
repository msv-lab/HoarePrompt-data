The values of `nx` and `ny` are updated according to the expressions provided in the code. Since `nx` is calculated as `x + dx` and `ny` is updated to `y + dy`, their new values will depend on the specific values of `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy`. However, the exact values of `x`, `dx`, and `dy` are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we can only specify the relationship for `nx` and `ny`.

The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged, and since `N`, `dist`, `piece`, `y`, and `ncur` are not directly affected by this assignment, they will retain their values.

Output State: **`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `piece` remains unchanged at 0, `y` is 4, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
