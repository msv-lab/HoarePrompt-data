The variable `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` and `ny` are indices that fall within the bounds of the 2D array `A`. Since `nx` is equal to `x + dx` and `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and based on the given conditions that `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, we can conclude that `ncur` is now determined by the values of `nx` and `ny` within the 2D array `A`.

The other variables remain unchanged in this context. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment that occurred.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dist[1]` reflects updated distances based on valid moves, `parent[1]` contains updated parent relationships for valid moves, `queue` must contain potential next states based on valid moves from the initial position, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
