The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The state of the `parent` variable remains unchanged except for the specific update that `parent[1][ncur]` has been set to `cur`. The variable `piece` is noted to remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updates to `parent` and the addition to `queue`.

Output State: **`parent[1][ncur]` is updated to `cur`, `piece` remains unchanged, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`**.
