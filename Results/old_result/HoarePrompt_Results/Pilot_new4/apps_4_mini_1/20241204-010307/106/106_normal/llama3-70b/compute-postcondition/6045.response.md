The values of `nx` and `ny` are assigned based on the calculations `x + dx` and `y + dy`. The initial state indicates that `x` and `y` must remain within the bounds defined by `A`, and the values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided, leaving them as variables that can be any number. The other variables, `N`, `A`, and `cur`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `x + dx` must be within the bounds of `A`, `y + dy` must also be within the bounds of `A`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, and `ny` is equal to `y + dy`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `x + dx` must be within the bounds of `A`, `y + dy` must also be within the bounds of `A`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`.**
