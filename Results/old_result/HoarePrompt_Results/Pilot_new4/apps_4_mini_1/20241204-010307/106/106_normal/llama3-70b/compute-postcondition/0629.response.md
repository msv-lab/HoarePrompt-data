Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is `x - 2`, and `ny` is 0. If both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of 0 and N, and if `piece` is 0 with `dist[0][ncur]` being greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, and `(ncur, 0)` is added to `queue`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
