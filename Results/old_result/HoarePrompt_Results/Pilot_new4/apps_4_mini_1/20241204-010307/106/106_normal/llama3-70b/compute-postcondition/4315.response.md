The assignment `parent[0][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the tuple `(cur, piece)` to `parent[0][ncur]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Since `ncur` is used as an index, the specific value of `ncur` is determined by its previous assignment to `A[x + dx][N + dy]`. The specifics of `cur` and `piece` are unchanged and could represent any values provided in the context of the program.

Thus, the Output State will reflect that `parent[0][ncur]` is now assigned a tuple of `(cur, piece)`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is equal to `N`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `N + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x + dx][N + dy]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`**.
