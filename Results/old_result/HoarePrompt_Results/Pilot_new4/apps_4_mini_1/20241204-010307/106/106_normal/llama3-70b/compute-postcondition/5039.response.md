The code `queue.append((ncur, 1))` attempts to append a tuple containing `ncur` and `1` to the `queue`. However, since `ncur` is not assigned a valid value, it defaults to `None` in Python. Therefore, the tuple `(ncur, 1)` will be `(None, 1)`, and this tuple will be added to the `queue`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **If `N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 3, `y` is 0, `0 <= nx < N`, `nx` is 2, `ny` is -1; `ncur` is not assigned a valid value, `queue` now contains `(None, 1)`.**
