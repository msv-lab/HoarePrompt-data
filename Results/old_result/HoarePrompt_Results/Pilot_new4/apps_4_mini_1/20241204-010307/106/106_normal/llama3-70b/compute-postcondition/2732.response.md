The values of `nx` and `ny` are updated based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. The new values for `nx` and `ny` are calculated as follows: `nx = x + dx` and `ny = y + dy`. The previous values of `nx` and `ny` are `x - 2` and `y - 1`, respectively, which are no longer relevant after the assignment. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is the current y-coordinate, `piece` is not equal to the value represented by `i`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and if `nx` and `ny` are within bounds (0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N), then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
