The assignment `parent[2][ncur] = cur, piece` affects the values in the `parent` array at the index `2` and `ncur`. The variable `ncur` has been previously calculated based on `A[nx][ny]`. The output does not change the states of `N`, `nx`, `ny`, `dist`, or `cur`, but it updates the `parent` structure.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `nx` is calculated as `x + dx`; `ny` is calculated as `y + dy`; `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur`, `piece`.**
