The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[0][ncur]`. The initial states of other variables remain unchanged, but now `parent[0][ncur]` contains the tuple `(cur, piece)`. The other variables retain their initial constraints and values.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`**
