Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `A[1][0]` equals `cur`, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `dy`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[1 + dx][dy]`. If `piece` is 0 and the distance from `dist[0]` to `ncur` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `cur`, `piece`, and `queue` is updated to contain the tuple `(ncur, 0)`; otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
