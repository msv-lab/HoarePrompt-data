In the code snippet provided, we see that `parent[1][ncur]` is being assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`. This means that the specific values for `cur` and `piece` will determine what `parent[1][ncur]` becomes, but we do not have direct values for them in the initial state. The other variables (`N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and `dist`) remain unchanged.

Since `ncur` is defined as `A[x - 1][y + 1]`, it will take on a value based on the values of `x` and `y` but we do not know the exact value due to the unknown nature of `A`. The `parent[1][ncur]` now contains a reference to `cur` and `piece`.

The output state thus reflects that `parent[1][ncur]` has been updated but does not provide specific values for `cur`, `piece`, or `ncur` because they are based on other unspecified inputs.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is between 0 and `N-1`; `y` is between 1 and `N-1`; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is equal to `y + 1`; `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y + 1]; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1; `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `piece`.**
