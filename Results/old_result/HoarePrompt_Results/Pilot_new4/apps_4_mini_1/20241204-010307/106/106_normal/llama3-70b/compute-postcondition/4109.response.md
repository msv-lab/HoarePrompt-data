The `queue` is updated by appending a tuple consisting of `ncur` and `2`. The values of `ncur` and `2` remain unchanged from their previous state. Other variables remain unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `nx` is `dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is `cur`, `piece`, and `queue` is updated to append the tuple `(ncur, 2)`**.
