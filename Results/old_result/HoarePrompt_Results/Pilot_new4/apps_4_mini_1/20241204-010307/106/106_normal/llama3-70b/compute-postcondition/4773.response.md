According to the code, the loop iterates over a list of tuples representing directional movements. The loop will execute four times, once for each tuple in the list [(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]. At the end of the last iteration, the loop will have processed the last tuple (1, 1).

Since `dx` and `dy` are derived from each tuple in the list during each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, it would need to start from the beginning again. However, as there are no more tuples to iterate over in the provided list, the loop cannot execute again.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration of the loop, the state remains unchanged but the loop cannot continue. Therefore, the states will not change because the loop has completed all its iterations based on the provided list.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `dist[0]` has been updated for reachable positions, `parent[0]` has been assigned tuples for reachable positions, and `queue` contains tuples for each reachable position from `(x, y)` (the loop has completed its iterations)**
