Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 2; `piece` is 2; `dist[2]` reflects the minimum distances from the starting position to all reachable positions based on the conditions of the loop; `parent[2]` contains the parent positions corresponding to the updates made in `dist[2]`; `queue` contains all the valid `(ncur, 2)` tuples corresponding to reachable positions from the starting point. The current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`. If no updates were made, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initial states.***
