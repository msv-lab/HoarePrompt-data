The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned new values based on the current values of `x`, `y`, and the pairs in `dx` and `dy`. The variable `y` is fixed at 0, and `x` can take values between 2 and `N-1`. The pairs in `dx` and `dy` will result in four different combinations to calculate the potential new positions for `nx` and `ny`. Depending on the values of `x` and the pairs in `dx` and `dy`, `nx` and `ny` can take different values.

Given the variable constraints:
- `N` is between 3 and 10 (hence `x` can be between 2 and 9).
- `y` is 0.

1. For `dx = -1, dy = -1`:  
   `nx = x - 1`, `ny = 0 - 1 = -1`
  
2. For `dx = -1, dy = 1`:  
   `nx = x - 1`, `ny = 0 + 1 = 1`
  
3. For `dx = 1, dy = -1`:  
   `nx = x + 1`, `ny = 0 - 1 = -1`
  
4. For `dx = 1, dy = 1`:  
   `nx = x + 1`, `ny = 0 + 1 = 1`

The output will reflect that `nx` and `ny` can take multiple values depending on the combinations of `dx` and `dy`. The state of other variables remains unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is:  
Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 0; `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`; `x` is between 2 and N-1; `nx` can be `x - 1` or `x + 1`; `ny` can be -1 or 1 based on the pairs in `dx` and `dy`.**
