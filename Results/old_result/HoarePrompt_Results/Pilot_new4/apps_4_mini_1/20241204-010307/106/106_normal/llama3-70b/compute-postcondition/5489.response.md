The statement `dist[2][ncur] = dist[2][cur] + 1` assigns the value `dist[2][cur] + 1` to `dist[2][ncur]`. The initial conditions indicate that `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`. This means that the assignment will bring `dist[2][ncur]` to a value that is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, thus making it no longer greater.

The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and `piece` are unaffected by this assignment. However, it is important to note the change to `dist[2][ncur]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 2, `nx` can be 3, 5, or 4, `ny` can be 1, 2, or 3 depending on the selected `dx` and `dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 2, and `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, making it no longer greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
