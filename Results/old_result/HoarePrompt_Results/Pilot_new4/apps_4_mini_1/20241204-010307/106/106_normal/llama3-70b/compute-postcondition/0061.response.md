The code assigns `cur` and `piece` to `parent[1][ncur]`. The previous values of `cur` and `piece` are not specified, but we know `ncur` is the value at the position defined by `A[nx][ny]`. The other variables in the initial state are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= `N` <= 10; `piece` is the value of `piece`; `nx` is `x + dx`; `ny` is `y + dy`; `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.**
