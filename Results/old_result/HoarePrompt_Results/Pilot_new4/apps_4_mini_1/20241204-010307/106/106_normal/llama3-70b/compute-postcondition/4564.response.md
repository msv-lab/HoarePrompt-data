According to the code, the for loop iterates over a list of tuples representing changes in coordinates (dx, dy). The loop will execute once for each tuple in the list. At the end of the last iteration, `dx` is -2 and `dy` is -1. For the loop to execute one more time, it will proceed to the next tuple in the list.

The tuples provided are:
1. (-2, -1)
2. (-2, 1)
3. (-1, -2)
4. (-1, 2)
5. (1, -2)
6. (1, 2)
7. (2, -1)
8. (2, 1)

After the last execution, which used the first tuple (-2, -1), the next tuple to use is (-2, 1). Therefore, `dx` will be updated to -2 and `dy` will be updated to 1.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is `x - 2`, `ny` is 0, and if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]` and if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`; otherwise, no changes occur.**
