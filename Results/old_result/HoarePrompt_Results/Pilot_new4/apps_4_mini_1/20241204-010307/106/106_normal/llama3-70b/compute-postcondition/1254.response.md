The code appends a tuple containing the values of `ncur` and `0` to the list `queue`. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `cur`, `ncur`, `dist`, and `parent` remain unchanged in this operation; only `queue` is affected.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 2; `nx` is equal to `1 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`; `cur` remains unchanged; `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[1 + dx][2 + dy]; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the values of `cur` and `piece`; `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`.**
