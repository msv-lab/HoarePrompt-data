`nx` and `ny` are assigned the values `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. Given that `x` and `y` are within the range `[0, N-1]` and the conditions ensure that `x + dx` and `y + dy` remain within the bounds, `nx` will also be valid within the range `[0, N-1]`, and similarly for `ny`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is within `0` and `N-1`, `y` is within `0` and `N-1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is within `0` and `N-1`, `y` is within `0` and `N-1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`.**
