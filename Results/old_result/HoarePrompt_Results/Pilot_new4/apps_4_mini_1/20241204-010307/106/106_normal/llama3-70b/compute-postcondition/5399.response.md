The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. However, the values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided, so we cannot determine specific numerical values for `nx` and `ny`. The variable `x` is currently 4 and `y` is currently 1. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 1, `piece` is 1, `dist[1]` contains updated distances, `parent[1]` contains path information, `queue` includes valid moves from `(cur, 0)`, `nx` is 4 + `dx`, `ny` is 1 + `dy`**
