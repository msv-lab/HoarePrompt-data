The code `queue.append((ncur, 0))` adds a tuple containing the value of `ncur` and 0 to the `queue`. The value of `ncur` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but we know it is equal to `cur` which is 1, based on the earlier section of the preconditions. Therefore, the operation effectively adds the tuple `(1, 0)` to the `queue`.

The other variables remain unchanged after this operation.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, `i` is 0, `x` is 0, `cur` is 1, `piece` is 0, `dist[0][1]` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent` is a 2D list with 3 rows and (N * N + 1) columns initialized to None, `queue` contains the tuple (1, 0), `y` is 0, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur` (which is 1), `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` (which is 1) and `piece` (which is 0)**.
