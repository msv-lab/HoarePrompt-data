According to the code, the loop iterates over a list of tuples representing changes in `dx` and `dy`. The loop will execute for each of these tuples. At the end of the last iteration, `dx` is -2 and `dy` is 1, which indicates that this was the last executed tuple. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to move to the next tuple in the list.

The list of tuples is:
1. (-2, -1)
2. (-2, 1)  <- current state
3. (-1, -2)
4. (-1, 2)
5. (1, -2)
6. (1, 2)
7. (2, -1)
8. (2, 1)

The next tuple after `(-2, 1)` is `(-1, -2)`. 

There will be no changes made to `N`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `piece`, `dist`, `parent`, or `queue` as these variables are not impacted by the iteration of the loop itself; they remain the same unless modified within the loop body, which we are not considering here.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration of the loop, the states will be:
State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 2; `dx` is -1; `dy` is -2; `nx` is equal to `x - 2; `ny` is 3; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]` if conditions are met; `piece` is 0; `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1` if conditions are met; `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)` if conditions are met; `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)` if conditions are met.**
