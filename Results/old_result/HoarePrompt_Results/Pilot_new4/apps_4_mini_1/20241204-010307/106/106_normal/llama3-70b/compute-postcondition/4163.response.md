According to the code, the loop iterates over a list of direction tuples `[(dx, dy), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]`, which means it will execute a total of 4 times, once for each pair of directions. Since the loop has already executed once, we need to adjust the values of `dx` and `dy` for the next iteration.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `dx` is -1 and `dy` is 1, which corresponds to the second pair of directions.
- For the loop to execute again, it will take the next direction pair, which is `(1, -1)`.

This means `dx` will be updated to `1`, and `dy` will be updated to `-1`. The next iteration will check the next pair of directions.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `nx` is -1, `ny` is 3, `dx` is 1, `dy` is -1**
