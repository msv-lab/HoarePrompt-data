Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `dist[0][ncur]` and `parent[0][ncur]` are valid, `queue` contains valid `(ncur, 0)` entries, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, and `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` satisfy the conditions `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and `ncur = A[nx][ny]`. The variable `piece` is equal to 1, and the current value of `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`.***
