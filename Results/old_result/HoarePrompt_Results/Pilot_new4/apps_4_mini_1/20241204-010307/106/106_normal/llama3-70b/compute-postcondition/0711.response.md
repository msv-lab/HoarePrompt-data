The code assigns the value `dist[0][cur] + 1` to `dist[0][ncur]`. The previous state indicates that the current value of `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, which implies that the assignment will reduce the value of `dist[0][ncur]`. The states of other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` equals `x + dx`, `ny` equals `2 + dy`, value of `piece` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `dist[0][ncur]` is no longer greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
