Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is equal to `N`, `dist` may have been updated for valid `ncur` positions, `parent` may have been updated for valid `ncur` positions, and `queue` may contain tuples of `(ncur, 0)` for valid positions based on the conditions. The state of `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remains unchanged if no valid updates occurred.**
