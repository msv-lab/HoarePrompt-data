The line of code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to the `parent` array at the position `[0][ncur]`. The initial state provides that `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged, and we have established the values for `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` based on previous computations.

Since we are updating only the `parent` variable, we leave the other variables unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `parent[0][ncur]` is now set to the combination of `cur` and `piece`.

Output State: **`dist`, `parent`, and `queue` are unchanged; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`.**
