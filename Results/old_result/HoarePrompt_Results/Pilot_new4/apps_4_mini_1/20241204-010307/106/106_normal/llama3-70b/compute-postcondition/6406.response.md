To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet. The code assigns a value to `ncur` based on the values of `nx` and `ny`, which are `-2` and `2`, respectively.

1. `N` is between 3 and 10, so we don't have specific values for `A[nx][ny]` since `nx = -2` and `ny = 2`. The behavior of this indexing (negative index) will depend on the implementation of `A` and its dimensions, which we do not know. However, we note that `ncur` is being assigned a value from the 2D list `A`.

2. Variables `x`, `y`, `dist[0]`, `parent[0]`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, and `ny` remain unchanged as they aren't modified by the code snippet.

3. `ncur` is now defined as `A[-2][2]`. Since specific values for `A` are not provided, we can only note that `ncur` will take on the value at that index.

Given these considerations, the output state reflects that `ncur` is now defined, but we cannot specify its value without knowing the contents of `A`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `dist[0]` remains unchanged; `parent[0]` remains unchanged; `dx` is -2; `dy` is 1; `nx` is -2; `ny` is 2; `ncur` is defined as `A[-2][2]`.**
