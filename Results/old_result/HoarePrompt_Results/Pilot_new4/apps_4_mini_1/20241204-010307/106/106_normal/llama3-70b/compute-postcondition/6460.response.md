The value of `ncur` is assigned the value from the matrix `A` at the indices `[nx][ny]`. The previous values for `nx` and `ny` are `0` and `2`, respectively. Therefore, `ncur` will be equal to `A[0][2]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is 0, `ny` is 2, `ncur` is `A[0][2]`, `dist[1]` reflects the shortest distance relevant to the moves, `parent[1]` reflects the current parent node relevant to the moves, and `queue` contains at least one valid `(ncur, 1)` tuple.**
