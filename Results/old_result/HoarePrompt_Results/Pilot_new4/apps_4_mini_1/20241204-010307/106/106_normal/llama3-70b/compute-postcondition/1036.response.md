To determine the output state, we analyze the provided code snippet `ncur = A[nx][ny]` in relation to the initial state.

### Initial State:
- `N` is between 3 and 10
- `x` is 0
- `y` is 2
- `piece` is now 2
- `dx` is 1
- `dy` is 0
- `nx` is 1
- `ny` is 2

### Impact of the Code:
The code assigns the value of `A[nx][ny]` to `ncur`. The variables `nx` and `ny` are currently set to 1 and 2, respectively. However, we don't have information about the contents of the matrix `A`, so we cannot determine the specific value that `ncur` will hold. Other variables remain unaffected by this assignment.

### Output State:
Thus, after executing the code, we can state that `ncur` is assigned a value based on the matrix `A` at the position `[1][2]`, while all other variables retain their values. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `piece` is now 2, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 2, `ncur` is equal to `A[1][2]`.**
