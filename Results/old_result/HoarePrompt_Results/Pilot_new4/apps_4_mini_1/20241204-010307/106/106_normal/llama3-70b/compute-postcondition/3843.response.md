The variable `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to be the value of `dist[2][cur] + 1`. Here, `dist[1]` contains the shortest distances based on valid moves, and `parent[1]` indicates the relationship for each reachable position. The `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`, and `piece` is set to 2, with `dx` being 1, `dy` being 0, and `ncur` representing `A[x + 1][y]`.

Since `cur` has not been defined in the initial state, we assume it holds a value that was set previously, allowing for the calculation of `dist[2][ncur]`. 

Output State: **`dist[1]` contains the shortest distances based on valid moves, `parent[1]` indicates the relationship for each reachable position, `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`, `piece` is set to 2, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0, `ncur` is A[x + 1][y], and `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
