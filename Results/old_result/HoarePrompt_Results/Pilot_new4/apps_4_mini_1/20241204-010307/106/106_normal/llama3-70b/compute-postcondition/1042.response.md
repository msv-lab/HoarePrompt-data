According to the code, the loop iterates over the directional changes represented by `dx` and `dy`. In each iteration, it will take one pair from the list `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`. The loop will execute four times in total, once for each direction.

At the end of the last iteration, `dx` is 1 and `dy` is 0 which corresponds to the second direction `(1, 0)`. After this iteration, the loop will proceed to the next pair which is `(0, -1)`.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, the variables need to be set to reflect the next iteration. Since the loop uses the next pair of `dx` and `dy`, in the next iteration `dx` will be 0 and `dy` will be -1.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `piece` is 2, `dx` is 0, `dy` is -1, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 2, and if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[1][2]` and if `dist[2][ncur] > dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `queue` now includes `(ncur, 2)`; otherwise, the state remains unchanged.**
