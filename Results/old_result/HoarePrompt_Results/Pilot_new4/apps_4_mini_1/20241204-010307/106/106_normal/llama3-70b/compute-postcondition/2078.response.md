The code appends a tuple containing `ncur` and `2` to the `queue`. The values of `N`, `dist`, `parent`, `piece`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` remain unchanged. The output state reflects this change in the `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is at least 5; `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, with `dist[2][ncur] = dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, 2)`; `piece` remains unchanged at 2; `queue` contains all new entries generated during the iterations plus the entry `(ncur, 2)`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
