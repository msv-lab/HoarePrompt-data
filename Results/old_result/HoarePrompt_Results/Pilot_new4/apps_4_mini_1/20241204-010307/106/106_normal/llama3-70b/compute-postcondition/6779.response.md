The values of `nx` and `ny` are updated to `x + dx` and `y + dy` respectively. The values of `x` and `y` are currently 1 and 2. Therefore, `nx` will be updated to `1 + dx` and `ny` will be updated to `2 + dy`. 

The values of `dx` and `dy` are not specified in the initial state, so the output state will reflect the updated values of `nx` and `ny` while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `piece` is the same, `dist[0]`, `parent[0]`, and `ncur` are updated during the loop execution.**
