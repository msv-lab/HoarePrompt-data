The code assigns a new value to `dist[1][ncur]`. The previous value of `dist[1][cur]` is used to calculate this new value, which increments it by 1. The states of other variables remain unchanged. Since `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][1]`, the output state will reflect this change.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dist` and `parent` are valid and updated based on knight's moves, `queue` contains valid `(ncur, 0)` tuples and potentially now includes `(ncur, 1)`, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is 1, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][1]`, and `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
