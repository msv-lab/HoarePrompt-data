Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is the current y-coordinate, `piece` is not equal to the value represented by `i`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`. If `nx` and `ny` are within bounds (0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N) and `piece == 0` and `dist[0][ncur] > dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is updated to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.***
