The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. This operation does not change the values of any other variables, but it modifies the `queue` to now include the new state represented by `ncur` and `2`. The other variables retain their previous states as described in the initial setup.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dist[1]` reflects updated distances based on valid moves, `parent[1]` contains updated parent relationships for valid moves, `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)` in addition to its previous contents, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][2]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.**
