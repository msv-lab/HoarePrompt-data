The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The values for `nx` and `ny` are derived from `x + dx` and `-1 + dy` respectively. We know that `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, but the exact values for `x`, `dx`, `dy`, and the contents of the array `A` are not specified. However, the output state must account for the new assignment of `ncur`. 

Since `ncur` is assigned based on the grid `A`, the value of `ncur` will depend on the specific values of `nx` and `ny` (which are based on `x`, `dx`, and `dy`). The other variables remain unchanged because the code snippet directly assigns a new value to `ncur` from the array.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 0; `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`; `nx` is `x + dx`; `ny` is `-1 + dy`; `piece` remains equal to 2; `dist[2][ncur]` is updated based on conditions; `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur`; `queue` has appended the tuple `(ncur, 2)`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
