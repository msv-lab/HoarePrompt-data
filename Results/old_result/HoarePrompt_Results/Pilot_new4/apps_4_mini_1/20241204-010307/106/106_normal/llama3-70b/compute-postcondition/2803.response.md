The `queue` is modified by appending a tuple containing `(cur, i)`, where `cur` is a current position and `i` is the piece value. This means that the `queue` now contains one additional reachable position represented by the tuple `(cur, i)`. The other variables remain unchanged since the code only modifies the `queue`. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is the current y-coordinate, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2]` holds the shortest distances from the starting position to reachable positions in the grid, `parent[2]` indicates the predecessors of each reachable position with their corresponding piece values, and `queue` now contains the previous tuples of reachable positions with piece value 2 plus the new tuple `(cur, i)`**.
