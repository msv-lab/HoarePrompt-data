According to the code, the loop iterates over the pairs of directional changes `(-1, -1)`, `(-1, 1)`, `(1, -1)`, and `(1, 1)`. For the loop to execute, the variables `dx` and `dy` will take on these values in each iteration. The other variables such as `N`, `x`, `y`, `dist[0]`, `parent[0]`, and `queue` do not impact the execution of the loop directly but rather represent the state before the loop begins.

Since the state indicates that `dist[0]` and `parent[0]` may change during the loop execution based on conditions that are checked within the loop body, they do not need to be adjusted before the loop starts. However, to ensure that the loop can execute its body successfully, it's important to maintain the initial conditions of `x` and `y` since they may be utilized in the loop body.

Thus, the required states that need to be maintained are:
- `x` is 0
- `y` is 2
- N remains in the range of 3 to 10, as specified.

The loop will execute with the values of `dx` and `dy` being assigned as the loop iterates.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `dx` and `dy` will take values from [(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)] during iterations**.
