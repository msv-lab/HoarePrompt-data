The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values based on the expressions `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. Given that the next direction is (-1, 0), it follows that `dx` is -1 and `dy` is 0. Thus, `ny` will remain equal to `y`, which is 2, while `nx` will be equal to `x - 1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged, and `N` continues to be between 3 and 10.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `x` is defined and within bounds, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is 2.**
