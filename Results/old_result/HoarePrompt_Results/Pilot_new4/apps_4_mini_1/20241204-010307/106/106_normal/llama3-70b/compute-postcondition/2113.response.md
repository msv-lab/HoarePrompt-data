The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The initial state indicates that `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, which, combined with the value of `piece` being `0`, indicates that `queue` will now contain the new tuple based on the current values.

Since `queue` was already containing valid tuples, the output state will reflect the existing contents of `queue` with the newly appended tuple. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`, `piece` is 0, `queue` contains valid tuples and the newly appended tuple `(ncur, 0)`, `N` is greater than 0, `y` is 0, the current value of `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
