The code `queue.append((ncur, 0))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the list `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `0` (which is a constant) are being added, but they do not affect the other variables. The previous values of the affected variables are still valid and unchanged. 

The output state reflects that `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `queue` now contains the new tuple `(ncur, 0)`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is the current y-coordinate, `piece` is not equal to the value represented by `i`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is updated to `(cur, piece)`, `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`**.
