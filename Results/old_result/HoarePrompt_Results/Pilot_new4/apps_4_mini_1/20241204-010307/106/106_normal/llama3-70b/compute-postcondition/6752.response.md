The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The value of `x` is 1, and the value of `y` is 2. The values of `dx` and `dy` are not specified in the initial state, so `nx` and `ny` will depend on those values. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `dist[1]` contains updated distances for valid positions reachable from (1, 1), `parent[1]` contains predecessors for valid positions reachable from (1, 1)**
