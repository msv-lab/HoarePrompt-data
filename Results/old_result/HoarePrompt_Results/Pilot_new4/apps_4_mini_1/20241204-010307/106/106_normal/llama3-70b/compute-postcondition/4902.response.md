Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `dist[1]` contains the shortest path distances; `parent[1]` contains the corresponding parent positions; `dist[2]` may have been updated based on the conditions met during the loop execution; `parent[2]` contains the parent positions corresponding to the updated `dist[2]`; `queue` contains all valid `(ncur, 2)` positions that were appended during the loop iterations, or remains unchanged if no conditions were met.**
