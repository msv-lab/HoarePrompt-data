The variables `nx` and `ny` are updated based on the provided code snippet `nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy`. The values of `dx` and `dy` are given as `-2` and `-1`, respectively. 

From the initial state:
- `nx` is equal to `x - 2 + dx`, which means `nx = x - 2 - 2 = x - 4`.
- `ny` is equal to `1 - 1 + dy`, which means `ny = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1`.

Now applying the code:
- `nx` will be updated to `x + dx = x - 2 + (-2) = x - 4`.
- `ny` will be updated to `y + dy = 1 + (-1) = 0`.

The output state will reflect the updated values of `nx` and `ny`, while keeping the information about the ranges of `N`, `y`, and the expressions for `nx` and `ny`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 4`, `ny` is 0**.
