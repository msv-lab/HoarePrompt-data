The variable `dist[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `dist[1][cur] + 1`. The condition indicates that `dist[1][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, which means the new assignment has now changed it to be equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `piece` is 1, `nx` is `2 + dx`, `ny` is `0 + dy`, `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent`, and `queue` allow for movements from position (2, 0) within the bounds of array `A`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and the value of `dist[1][ncur]` is now less than or equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
