The value of `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The variables `nx` and `ny` have specific values based on the expressions provided: `nx` is equal to `x - 1` and `ny` is equal to `y + 1`. The value of `A[nx][ny]` corresponds to the element in the array `A` at the position defined by `nx` and `ny`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dist` contains valid distances for reachable indices, `piece` is equal to 1, `index` in directions is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y + 1]**
