Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `4 <= N <= 11`; `y` is equal to `N`; `A` is a valid two-dimensional array; `cur` is defined; `dist[0]` contains updated distances from the starting point; `parent[0]` contains the parent nodes for each valid move; `queue` contains all valid positions `(ncur, 0)`; if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, if `piece` equals 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `queue` now contains all valid positions including `(ncur, 1)`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `cur`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged. If the condition is not satisfied, the state remains unchanged.***
