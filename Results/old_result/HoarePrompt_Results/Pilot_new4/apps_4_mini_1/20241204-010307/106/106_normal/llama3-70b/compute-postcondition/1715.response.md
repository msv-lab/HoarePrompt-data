According to the code, the for loop iterates over a list of direction vectors `(dx, dy)`. Since the loop has a fixed number of iterations (4 in this case), the state at the end of the previous iteration must indicate which iteration was the last. 

Here, `dx` and `dy` are used to determine the direction of movement. In the previous iteration, `dx` was -1 and `dy` was -1, which corresponds to the first element in the list of direction vectors. After this iteration, the loop will proceed to the next tuple in the list.

Since there are 4 tuples in total, after the next iteration, `dx` and `dy` will take on the values of the second tuple in the list, which is `(-1, 1)`. 

Thus, to allow for the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust `dx` and `dy` to reflect the next values in the sequence.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `x` is between 1 and `N-2`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1**
