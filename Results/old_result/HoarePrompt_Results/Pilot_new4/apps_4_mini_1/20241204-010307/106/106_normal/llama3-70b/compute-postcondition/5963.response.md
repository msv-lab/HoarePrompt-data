Postcondition: ***`N` is greater than or equal to 9, `y` is 9, `dx` is the current first element of the tuple, `dy` is the current second element of the tuple, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `9 + dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is equal to 0 and the distance from the start to `ncur` is greater than the distance from the start to `cur` plus 1, then the distance from the start to `ncur` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, the parent of `ncur` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and the queue is updated to include `(ncur, 0)`.***
