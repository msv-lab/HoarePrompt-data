Postcondition: ***If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `nx` is 1 + `dx`, `ny` is 2 + `dy`, `dist[1]` is updated for valid positions, `parent[1]` is set for valid positions, and `queue` contains valid positions. If `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` was greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1` and `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `cur, piece`. Otherwise, `dist[2][ncur]` remains unchanged. If the condition is not satisfied, no updates are made to `dist` or `parent` for the second case.***
