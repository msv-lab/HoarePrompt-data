The code updates the `dist` array at the position `[1][ncur]`. The value being assigned to `dist[1][ncur]` is calculated as `dist[1][cur] + 1`. However, since the value of `cur` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact value it holds and therefore cannot specify the new value of `dist[1][ncur]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged as their values are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `piece` is 1, `nx` is `2 + dx`, `ny` is `0 + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
