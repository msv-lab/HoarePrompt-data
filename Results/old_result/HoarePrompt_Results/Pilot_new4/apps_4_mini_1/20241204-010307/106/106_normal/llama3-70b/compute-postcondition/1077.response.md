According to the code, the loop iterates over a list of tuples representing the changes in coordinates `(dx, dy)`. At the end of the last iteration, we have `N` between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `nx` is `1 + dx`, and `ny` is `0 + dy`. The loop can execute multiple times, once for each tuple in the list.

Since `dx` and `dy` will take on the values from the tuples in order, at the start of the next iteration, the first tuple will be processed, and we will need to consider how many tuples have already been processed.

The initial state for the first iteration would have `dx` and `dy` set to `-2` and `-1`, respectively. The logic checks if the new coordinates `nx` and `ny` fall within the bounds defined by `N`. For the loop to execute again, it will continue through the tuples until all are processed.

Since there are 8 tuples total, if the loop has executed `k` times, the next iteration will correspond to the `(k+1)`-th tuple. If `k` is 0 after the last execution, the next `dx` and `dy` will be set to the first tuple's values.

For the next iteration, `dx` and `dy` will take on the next tuple in the list for the loop to continue. Therefore, if `k` is 0 for the first execution, the next values will be `dx = -2` and `dy = -1`. 

In summary, we need to specify the states for the next iteration of the loop:

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `0 + dy`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1**.
