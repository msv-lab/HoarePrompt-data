The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[2][ncur]`. The previous values of `dist[2][ncur]` was updated to be equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and it was previously greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, indicating that there is an update happening to `parent[2][ncur]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `nx` is 1 + `dx`, `ny` is 2 + `dy`, `dist[1]` is updated for valid positions, `parent[1]` is set for valid positions, `queue` can be empty or contain valid positions that were reachable, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dist[2][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `cur, piece`.**
