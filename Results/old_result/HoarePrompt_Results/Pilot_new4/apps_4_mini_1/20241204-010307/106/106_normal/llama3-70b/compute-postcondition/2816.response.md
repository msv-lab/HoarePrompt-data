Postcondition: ***If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `piece` is equal to `0`, `dist[2]` holds the shortest distances, `parent[2]` indicates the predecessors, and `queue` holds the relevant tuples including `(ncur, 0)`, where `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is `0` and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1` and `parent[0][ncur]` is updated to `(cur, piece)`. Otherwise, there are no changes in the distances or predecessors. If the condition is not met, no changes occur.***
