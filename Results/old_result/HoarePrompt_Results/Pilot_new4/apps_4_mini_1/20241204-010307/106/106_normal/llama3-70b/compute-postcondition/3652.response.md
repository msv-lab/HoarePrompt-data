The code assigns a new value to `dist[2][ncur]`. It will now be equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`. The previous state indicates that `dist[2][ncur]` was greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, so after this assignment, `dist[2][ncur]` will now equal `dist[2][cur] + 1`, which means its value has changed. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 0 and `N-1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `queue` must contain valid tuples `(ncur, 1)`, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
