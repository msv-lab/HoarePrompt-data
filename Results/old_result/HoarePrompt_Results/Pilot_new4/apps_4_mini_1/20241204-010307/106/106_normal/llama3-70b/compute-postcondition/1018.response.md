The statement `dist[1][ncur] = dist[1][cur] + 1` implies that the element at the second row and the `ncur`-th column of the `dist` matrix is being updated based on the value at the same row and `cur`-th column, incremented by 1. However, the current values of `dist`, `cur`, and the potential index `ncur` are not provided in the initial state. 

Given that `ncur` is equal to `A[-1][1]`, we do not have specific values for `dist`, `cur`, or the exact value of `ncur` because `A` is undefined in this context. Therefore, the precise impact on the output state can't be calculated as `dist`, `cur`, and `ncur` can take on various values based on the context in which this code is executed.

The state of the other variables remains unchanged, so the output state would acknowledge that the operation is performed but cannot specify the resulting values.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is -1, `ny` is 1, `ncur` is equal to `A[-1][1]`, and `dist[1][ncur]` is updated based on `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
