The values of `nx` and `ny` are assigned based on the calculations of `x + dx` and `y + dy`. Given that `x` is 2 and `y` is 2, and for the first iteration, the values of `dx` and `dy` are `-1` and `0` respectively, we can compute:

- `nx = x + dx = 2 + (-1) = 1`
- `ny = y + dy = 2 + 0 = 2`

Thus, the new values of `nx` and `ny` are `1` and `2`. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 2.**
