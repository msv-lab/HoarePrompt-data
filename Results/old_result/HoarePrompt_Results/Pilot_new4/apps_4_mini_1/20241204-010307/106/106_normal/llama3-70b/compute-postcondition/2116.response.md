According to the code, the loop iterates over a list of tuples representing the possible movements (dx, dy). The loop will execute for each tuple in the list, adjusting `nx` and `ny` based on these movements to check if they are within bounds. At the end of the last iteration, the loop has processed one of the tuples, and now it needs to process the next one.

Since there are eight tuples in the list, and we don't know which tuple was processed last, we assume that the loop has executed for one of the tuples and is ready to move on to the next tuple in the list. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to know which tuple was last processed.

Assuming the last processed tuple was the first one (-2, -1), the next tuple to be processed will be (-2, 1). The loop will execute again provided that there are still tuples left in the list.

State: **`dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to the value of `cur`, `piece` is set to 0, the `queue` includes the newly appended tuple `(ncur, 0)`, and `dist[0][ncur]` is updated, for the next iteration the current tuple will be (-2, 1)**.
