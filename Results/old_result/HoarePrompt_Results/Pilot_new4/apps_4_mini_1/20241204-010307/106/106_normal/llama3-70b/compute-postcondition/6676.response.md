In the given code, `dist[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `dist[0][cur] + 1`. The variables `ncur`, `dist`, and `cur` are involved in this operation. The initial state indicates that `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, which is dependent on the values of `nx` and `ny`. While we do not know the specific values of `dist[0][cur]`, `A[nx][ny]`, or `cur`, we can say that `dist[0][ncur]` will now be one greater than `dist[0][cur]`. 

The state of the other variables remains unchanged, so the output state will reflect the updated value of `dist[0][ncur]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is -1; `y` is 2; `nx` is equal to `-1 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is 0; `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` must be set accordingly; `queue` may include a new tuple if conditions are met; `ncur` is now equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
