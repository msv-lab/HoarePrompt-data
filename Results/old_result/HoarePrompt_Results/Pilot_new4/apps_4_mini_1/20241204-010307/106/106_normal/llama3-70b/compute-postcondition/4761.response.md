Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is -2, `ny` is -1, and `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then if `piece` is equal to 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, the conditions regarding `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, and `A[0][0]` remain unchanged, indicating that an out-of-bounds access was attempted for `ncur`. Otherwise, the conditions remain unchanged.***
