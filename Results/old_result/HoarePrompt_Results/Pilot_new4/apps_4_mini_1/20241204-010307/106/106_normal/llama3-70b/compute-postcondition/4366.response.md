The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values based on the calculations involving `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. The variable `y` is equal to `N`, which is constrained between 3 and 10. The value of `dx` is -1, and `dy` is 0. The calculations for `nx` and `ny` are as follows:

- `nx` is calculated as `x + dx`, which is `x - 1`.
- `ny` is calculated as `y + dy`, which is `y + 0` or just `y`.

The state of `N` remains unchanged during this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the calculations for `nx` and `ny`, while maintaining the original constraints for `N`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is equal to `N`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y` (which is `N`).**
