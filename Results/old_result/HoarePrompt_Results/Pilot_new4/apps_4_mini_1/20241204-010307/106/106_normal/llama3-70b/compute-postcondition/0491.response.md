To analyze the code snippet provided, we will first evaluate the impact of the line `nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy` on the variables in the initial state.

1. `dx` is -1, so `x + dx` updates `nx` to `x - 1`.
2. `dy` is 1, so `y + dy` updates `ny` to `y + 1`, which is 3.

Now we check the updated values:
- `nx` becomes `x - 1`
- `ny` becomes `3`

Next, we retain all the other variables as they are since they are unaffected by this line of code. The output state only needs to reflect the modified variables.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is 3.**
