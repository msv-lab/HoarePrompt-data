The variable `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`. The values of `cur`, `piece`, and `ncur` are relevant for this assignment, but the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices, `queue` contains one element `[(cur, n + 1)]`, `piece` is less than or equal to `n`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the values of `cur` and `piece`.**
