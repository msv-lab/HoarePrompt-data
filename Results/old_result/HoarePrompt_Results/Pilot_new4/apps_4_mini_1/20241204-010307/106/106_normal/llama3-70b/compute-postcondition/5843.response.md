The code assigns the values of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[2][ncur]`. The variables `ncur` and `piece` are already defined prior to this assignment, with `ncur` being the value from the `A` array at the indices `nx` and `ny`, and `piece` has been set to `2`. The variable `parent[2][ncur]` is updated with the new values. 

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; `queue` contains at least one tuple of the form `(ncur, 1)`; `piece` is 2; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`.**
