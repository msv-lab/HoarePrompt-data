According to the code, the loop will execute `N` times, where `N` is an integer that is already defined to be between 3 and 10. Since `N` is in this range, the loop can execute. 

The variable `x` will start at 0 during the first iteration and will increment by 1 with each iteration until it reaches `N-1`. Therefore, at the start of the loop, `x` should be initialized to 0.

Additionally, the other variables mentioned (`dist`, `parent`, `queue`, `cur`, and `piece`) do not affect the ability of the loop itself to execute, but they might influence the operations within the loop in its body.

So, for the loop to be executed correctly, it is appropriate to indicate that `x` starts at 0.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0**
