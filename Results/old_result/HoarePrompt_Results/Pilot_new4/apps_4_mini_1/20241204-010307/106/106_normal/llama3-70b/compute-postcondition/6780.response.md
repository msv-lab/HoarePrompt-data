The value of `ncur` is assigned the value from `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are defined as `1 + dx` and `2 + dy`, respectively. The other variables remain unaffected. The specific values of `nx` and `ny` depend on the values of `dx` and `dy`. Since `N` is between 3 and 10, the specific values of `A[nx][ny]` depend on `nx` and `ny`, which in turn depend on `dx` and `dy`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `piece` is the same, `dist[0]`, `parent[0]`, and `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`.**
