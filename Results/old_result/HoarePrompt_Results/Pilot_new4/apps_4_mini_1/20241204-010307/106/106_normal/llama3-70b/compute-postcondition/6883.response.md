Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is updated based on the reachable cells from `(x, y)`; `dist[1][ncur]` contains the minimum distance from `cur` to each reachable cell, `parent[1][ncur]` contains the previous cell and piece for each reachable cell, `queue` contains tuples of all reachable cells along with their corresponding piece value. If no cells were reachable, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged.**
