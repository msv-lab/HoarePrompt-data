Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` and `y` can be any values; `piece` is 2 if conditions were met at least once, else it remains 0; `dist[2][ncur]` contains the final distances from `cur` for all valid `ncur`; `parent[2][ncur]` reflects the last position and state of `piece` for each valid `ncur`; `queue` contains all tuples `(ncur, 2)` where conditions were met, along with any initial tuples of the form `(ncur, 1)`; the current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`.***
