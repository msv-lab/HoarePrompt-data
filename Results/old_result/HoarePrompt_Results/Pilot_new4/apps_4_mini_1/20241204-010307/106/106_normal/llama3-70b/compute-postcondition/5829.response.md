The code assigns new values to `nx` and `ny`. The value of `nx` is computed as `x + dx`, which becomes `1 + 1 = 2`. The value of `ny` is computed as `y + dy`, which becomes `0 + (-1) = -1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; `queue` contains all satisfying tuples `(ncur, 0)` and possibly also `(ncur, 1)`; `piece` is set to 0; `dx` is 1; `dy` is -1; `nx` is 2; `ny` is -1; and `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.**
