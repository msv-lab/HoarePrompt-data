Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 0; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is 0; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`. Otherwise, no changes are made to these variables.***
