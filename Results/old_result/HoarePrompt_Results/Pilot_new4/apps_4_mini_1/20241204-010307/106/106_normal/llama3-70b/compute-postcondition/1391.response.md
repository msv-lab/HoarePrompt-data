Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 0. If `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `cur`, `A[2][0]` remains equal to `cur`, `ncur` is equal to `A[1][0]`, and `queue` contains `(ncur, 2)`. If the condition is not met, the values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `dist`, `parent`, `A[2][0]`, `ncur`, and `queue` remain unchanged.***
