The `queue` variable is updated by appending the tuple `(ncur, 0)` to it. The previous state of `queue` contained valid tuples, and now it will contain all previous tuples plus the new tuple. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 3, `y` is 1, `nx` is 3 + `dx`, `ny` is 1 + `dy`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to (cur, piece), `queue` contains previous valid tuples plus the new tuple (ncur, 0), current value of `piece` is 0, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]` where `nx` and `ny` satisfy the conditions 0 <= `nx` < `N` and 0 <= `ny` < `N`.**
