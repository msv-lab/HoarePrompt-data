The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[2][ncur]`. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and `dist[2]` remain unchanged. The updated state indicates that `parent[2][ncur]` now holds the values of `cur` and `piece`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` and `y` are within `0` and `N-1`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `piece`.**
