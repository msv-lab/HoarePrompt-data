Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `x` is defined and within bounds. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and if `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is updated to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` now includes `(ncur, 1)`. If these conditions are not met, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
