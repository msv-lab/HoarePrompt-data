The code snippet involves appending a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The initial state provides various details about the variables involved, but the primary change results from the action of the code.

In this case, the `queue` variable is being modified by adding a new element, which is a tuple consisting of `ncur` and `0`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Thus, the output state reflects that `queue` now contains the new tuple along with the previous states of the other variables.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is the current y-coordinate; `piece` is not equal to the value represented by `i`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`; `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`.**
