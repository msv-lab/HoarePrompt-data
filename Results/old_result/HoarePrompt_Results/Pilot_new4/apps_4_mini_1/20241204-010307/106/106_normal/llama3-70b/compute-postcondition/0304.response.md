Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `cur` is a valid index, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid (0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N). The value of `piece` is 1, and the current value of `ncur` has a distance greater than the distance from `cur` plus 1 (`dist[1][ncur] > dist[1][cur] + 1`).***
