Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` was greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dist[2][ncur]` is less than or equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `queue` includes `(ncur, 2)`; otherwise, no changes occur.***
