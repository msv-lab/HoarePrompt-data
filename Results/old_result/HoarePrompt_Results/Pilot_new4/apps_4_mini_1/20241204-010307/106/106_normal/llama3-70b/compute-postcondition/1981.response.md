The code `queue.append((ncur, 1))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The variables `ncur` and `1` (a constant) are used here, but they do not modify any existing values in the initial state directly. Therefore, the values of all other variables remain unchanged except for the `queue`, which now includes a new element.

Output State: **`N` is at least 4; `piece` remains unchanged; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent` states remain as they are; `nx` is equal to `x + 1`; `ny` is equal to `y - 1`; `ncur` is equal to `A[x + 1][y - 1]; `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur`; `queue` includes the element `(ncur, 1)`**.
