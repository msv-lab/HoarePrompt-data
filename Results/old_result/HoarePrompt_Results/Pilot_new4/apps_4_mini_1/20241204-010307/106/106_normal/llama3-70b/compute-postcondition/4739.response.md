In this case, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are such that they are both valid indices for the array `A`, and they satisfy the conditions given in the initial state. The variable `ncur` now holds the value from the array at the position determined by `nx` and `ny`.

The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `A[0][0]`, and `cur` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `cur` is defined, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and 0 is less than or equal to `nx` and `ny` and both `nx` and `ny` are less than `N`.**
