The statement `parent[0][ncur] = cur, piece` is assigning the value of `cur` and `piece` to the `parent` array at the index `[0][ncur]`. The values of the other variables are not affected by this assignment. 

1. **Variables Before Execution**:
   - `N` is between 3 and 10
   - `x` is 1
   - `y` is 0
   - `index` is 1
   - `nx` is `1 + dx`
   - `ny` is `0 + dy`
   - `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`
   - `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`
   
2. **Variables After Execution**:
   - `parent[0][ncur]` is now equal to `cur`, and it also holds a reference to `piece`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; `index` is 1; `nx` is `1 + dx`; `ny` is `0 + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; `index` is 1; `nx` is `1 + dx`; `ny` is `0 + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`.**
