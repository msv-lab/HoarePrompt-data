The code assigns new values to `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x` and `y`, and the changes are determined by `dx` and `dy`, which represent the increments for `x` and `y` respectively. The initial conditions state that `x` and `y` are both 0, meaning `nx` and `ny` will be assigned the values of `dx` and `dy`, respectively.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `dist[0]` has been updated for reachable positions, `parent[0]` has been assigned tuples for reachable positions, `queue` contains tuples for each reachable position from `(x, y)`**.
