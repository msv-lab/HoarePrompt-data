Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `dist[0]` is in a state that allows updates, `parent[0]` reflects potential connections, and `queue` now contains the previous elements along with the new tuple `(ncur, 1)` if `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`.***
