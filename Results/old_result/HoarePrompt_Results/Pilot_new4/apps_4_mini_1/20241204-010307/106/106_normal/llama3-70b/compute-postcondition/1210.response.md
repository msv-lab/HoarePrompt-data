The values of `nx` and `ny` are updated based on the expressions provided. Here, `nx` is assigned the value of `x + dx`, and `ny` is assigned the value of `y + dy`. 

Given:
- `x` is 1
- `dx` is -1
- `y` is 1
- `dy` is 0

Calculating:
- `nx = x + dx = 1 + (-1) = 0`
- `ny = y + dy = 1 + 0 = 1`

The other variables remain unchanged. The values of `nx` and `ny` have been specifically determined as follows:
- `nx` is now 0
- `ny` is now 1

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 1; `nx` is 0; `ny` is 1; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 0.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 1; `nx` is 0; `ny` is 1; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 0.**
