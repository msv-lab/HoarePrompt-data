Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `piece` is 1, `dist` captures the minimum distances from the start position to reachable positions according to the movement rules, `parent` reflects the tracking of the paths taken to reach those positions, and `queue` contains all valid `(ncur, 1)` pairs generated during the iterations, which indicates the positions that were successfully updated based on the conditions of the loop. If no valid positions were reachable, `dist` and `parent` would remain unchanged from their initial states, while `queue` would be empty.**
