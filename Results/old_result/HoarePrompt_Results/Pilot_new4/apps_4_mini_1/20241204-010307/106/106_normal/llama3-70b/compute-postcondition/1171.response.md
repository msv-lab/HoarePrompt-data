Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 1; `A` must have dimensions that allow access to indices from `(nx, ny)` for all valid `(dx, dy)` pairs; `dist[0][ncur]` reflects the shortest path distances for all valid `ncur` positions reachable from `(x, y)`; `parent[0][ncur]` holds the corresponding previous positions and piece types for those reachable `ncur`; `queue` contains tuples `(ncur, 0)` for all reachable `ncur` positions.**
