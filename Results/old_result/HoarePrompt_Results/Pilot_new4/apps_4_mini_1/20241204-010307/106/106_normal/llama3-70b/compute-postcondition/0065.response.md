Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= `N` <= 10, `piece` is 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all reachable `ncur` values based on the knight's movements if the conditions are satisfied, `parent[1][ncur]` holds the corresponding values, and `queue` contains all reachable `ncur` values along with the value 1. If no valid moves are possible, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initialized states.**
