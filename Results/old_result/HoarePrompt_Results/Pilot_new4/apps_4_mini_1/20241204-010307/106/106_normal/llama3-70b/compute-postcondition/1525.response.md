The code assigns the values of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[1][ncur]`. The values of `ncur`, `cur`, and `piece` are relevant as they affect `parent[1][ncur]`. The initial state specifies that `N` is between 3 and 10, and `cur` has a valid value.

Since `cur` is valid and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `parent[1][ncur]` is updated to reference the current state of `cur` and `piece`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `A[x][y]` is defined, `cur` has a valid value, `dist[0]` is updated for each valid `ncur`, `parent[0]` is updated for each corresponding `ncur`, `queue` contains tuples of all valid `ncur` values with the associated piece 0, `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is updated to `cur` and `piece`.**
