Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 4`, `ny` is 2, and `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 4][2]`. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is set to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned `cur, piece`, and `queue` now includes `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
