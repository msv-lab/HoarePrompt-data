The variable `ncur` is assigned the value from the two-dimensional array `A` at the position determined by `nx` and `ny`. Since `nx` is equal to `x + dx` and `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, both satisfy the conditions `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, ensuring that `A[nx][ny]` is a valid access within the bounds of the array. The values of `N`, `y`, `A`, `cur`, `dist[0]`, `parent[0]`, and `queue` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `4 <= N <= 11`, `y` is equal to `N`, `A` is a valid two-dimensional array, `cur` is defined, `dist[0]` contains updated distances from the starting point, `parent[0]` contains the parent nodes for each valid move, `queue` contains all valid positions `(ncur, 0)`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
