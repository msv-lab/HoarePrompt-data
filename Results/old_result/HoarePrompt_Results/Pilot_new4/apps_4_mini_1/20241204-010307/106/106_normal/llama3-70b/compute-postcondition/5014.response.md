Postcondition: ***`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is 3; `y` is 0; `nx` is 1; `ny` is -1. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
