The variable `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`. The initial state includes the variables `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and an update to the array `dist`. However, the specific values of `cur`, `piece`, and `ncur` are not given in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine exact numerical values for these variables after the assignment. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `nx` is -1; `ny` is 0; `ncur` is assigned the value `A[-1][0]; `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, `piece`.**
