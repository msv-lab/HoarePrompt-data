The impact of the code is that `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`. The values of `ncur`, `cur`, and `piece` are involved in this assignment, but no other variables are affected. The initial state of the variables remains unchanged except for the update of the `parent` array.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is 2, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`.**
