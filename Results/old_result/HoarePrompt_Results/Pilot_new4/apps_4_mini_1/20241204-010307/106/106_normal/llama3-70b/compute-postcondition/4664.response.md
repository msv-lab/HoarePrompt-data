Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -2, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][0]`. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, `piece` is assigned, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the program state.***
