Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `dist` indicates at least one reachable position, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `piece` is equal to 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `0 + 1`, and if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then if `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. If the condition is not met, no changes are made to `dist` or `queue`.***
