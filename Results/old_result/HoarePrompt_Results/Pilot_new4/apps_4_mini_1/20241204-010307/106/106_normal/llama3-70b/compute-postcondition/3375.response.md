Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; if `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `(cur, 1)`, and `queue` contains the additional tuple `(ncur, 1)` alongside `(ncur, 0)`. Meanwhile, `piece` remains equal to 1, `dist[0][ncur]` still represents the minimum distance from `(0, 2)`, and `parent[0][ncur]` continues to hold updated parent positions, with `dx` and `dy` both equal to 1 for the last iteration, and `ncur` is now equal to `A[nx][ny]` where `nx` is `x + 1` and `ny` is `y + 1`.***
