To determine the output state after executing the given code snippet, we start by analyzing the initial conditions and the operation performed by the code.

Initial State:
- `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`
- `y` is 2
- `dx` is -1
- `dy` is -2
- `nx` is equal to `x - 2`
- `ny` is 3
- If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.
- If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the values of `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` is appended with the element `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, no changes occur.

Now we execute the code:
```
nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
```

Calculating the new values:
- `nx = x + dx` 
- `ny = y + dy` 
- Since `dx` is -1 and `y` is 2, we have `ny = 2 + (-2) = 0`.

Thus, we can express `nx` as:
- `nx = x - 1` (because `dx` is -1)

Now we have:
- `ny` becomes `0`
- `nx` becomes `x - 1`

Next, we check if the conditions for `ncur` and the subsequent logic apply:
1. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then:
   - `0 <= x - 1 < N` (this condition depends on the value of `x`)
   - `0 <= 0 < N` which is always true since `N >= 3`.

If both conditions above are true:
- `ncur` would be assigned `A[nx][ny]`, which needs the specific values of `nx` and `ny`.

If the conditions for updating `dist` are met (`piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur] > dist[0][cur] + 1`), then the respective updates occur.

However, since `x` is not defined in the initial state, we can only express the output state in terms of `x`:
- `nx` is `x - 1`
- `ny` is `0`

Given that `ncur`'s assignment and subsequent operations may or may not occur based on values not provided, we cannot determine any further changes without knowing `x`, `cur`, and how they relate to `dist`.

Thus, we report what we know:
- `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`
- `y` is 2
- `dx` is -1
- `dy` is -2
- `nx` is equal to `x - 1`
- `ny` is 0

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -2, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is 0**.
