The values of `nx` and `ny` are assigned based on the current values of `x` and `y`, along with the increments defined by `dx` and `dy`. The previous values of `x` and `y` are not provided, but we know that `y` is 0. Thus, `ny` will be calculated as `y + dy`, which will either be `dy` (if `y` is 0) or `dy + 0`, and `nx` will be `x + dx`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` and `dy` will take values from the list of tuples in each iteration.**
