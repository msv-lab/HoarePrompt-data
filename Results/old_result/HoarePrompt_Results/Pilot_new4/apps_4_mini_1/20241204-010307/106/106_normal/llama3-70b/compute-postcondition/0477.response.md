The value of `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to be equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`. Since it is given that `dist[1][ncur]` was greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1` before the assignment, after this operation, `dist[1][ncur]` will now equal `dist[1][cur] + 1`, which indicates a valid update according to the conditions specified.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `dist[0]` is in a state that allows updates based on valid moves, `parent[0]` is in a state that reflects potential connections, `queue` contains tuples of nodes that will be manipulated according to the loop's execution, `nx = x + dx`, `ny = 2 + dy`, `ncur = A[nx][ny]` where `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, the current value of `piece` is 1, and now `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
