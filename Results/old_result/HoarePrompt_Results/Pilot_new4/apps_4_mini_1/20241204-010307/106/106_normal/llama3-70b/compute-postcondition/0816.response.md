According to the code, the loop iterates over a list of tuples representing changes to `x` and `y` coordinates. Each tuple corresponds to a potential movement. Since the loop contains eight defined movements, it will go through each of these movements one by one.

At the end of the last iteration, the variables are as follows:
- `N` is between 3 and 10, indicating that the bounds for `nx` and `ny` must be within the range of the grid defined by `N`.
- `x` is 0, which is the initial position in the x-coordinate.
- `y` is 0, which is the initial position in the y-coordinate.
- Both `nx` and `ny` are currently equal to `dx` and `dy`, which means they will take on the respective values from the current tuple during the loop execution.
- The condition checks for valid bounds for `nx` and `ny` to ensure they do not exceed the grid limits.

Since the loop is set to execute once for each tuple, we need to consider the next tuple in the list to determine the states at the start of the next iteration. 

Since the last provided movement was one of the eight tuples, we can expect that in the next iteration, the loop will take the next `(dx, dy)` pair. If the last executed pair was the first one (i.e., `(-2, -1)`), the next pair would be `(-2, 1)`.

Thus, we can adjust the state accordingly to reflect the next dx, dy values:

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to -2, `ny` is equal to 1, and if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
