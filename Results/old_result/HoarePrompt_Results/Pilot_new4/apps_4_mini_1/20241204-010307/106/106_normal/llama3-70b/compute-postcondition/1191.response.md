The values of `nx` and `ny` are updated based on the current values of `x` and `y` with the addition of `dx` and `dy`, respectively. However, the specific values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact values of `nx` and `ny` after the operation. We know that `nx` becomes `x + dx` and `ny` becomes `y + dy`. The values of `N`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 1, `nx` is 1 + dx, `ny` is 1 + dy**
