The code assigns new values to `nx` and `ny`. 

- `nx` is updated to `x + dx`. 
- `ny` is updated to `y + dy`. 

Given that `dx` is `-2` and `dy` is `1`, we can express the updates as:
- `nx` becomes `x - 2` (because `dx` is `-2`).
- `ny` becomes `1 + 1` (since `y` is `1` and `dy` is `1`).

Thus, `ny` will now be `2`.

The values of `N`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy` remain unchanged and valid as specified: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is still `1`, `dx` is `-2`, and `dy` is `1`. 

Therefore, the output state captures the updated values of `nx` and `ny`, while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is `x - 2`, `ny` is 2**.
