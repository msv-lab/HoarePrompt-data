Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is between `0` and `N-1`, `y` is between `0` and `N-2` (inclusive), `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, and `ny` is equal to `y + dy`. If `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds (i.e., `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`), then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is equal to `0` and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and the tuple `(ncur, 0)` is appended to `queue`. Otherwise, no changes are made. If the condition is not satisfied, no actions are performed, and the variables remain unchanged.***
