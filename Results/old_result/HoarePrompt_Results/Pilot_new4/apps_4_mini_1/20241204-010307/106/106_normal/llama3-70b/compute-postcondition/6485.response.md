The value of `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to be equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged, but the specific conditions indicate that `dist[0][ncur]` is now greater than `dist[0][cur]`. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 0 and `N-1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 0, and `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1` with `dist[0][ncur]` greater than `dist[0][cur]`**.
