The code `queue.append((ncur, 2))` appends a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. Since `queue` is being modified by adding a new tuple, this impacts its state. The `ncur` variable is already defined in the initial state as `A[nx][ny]`, but its specific value is not given, so we will retain it as `ncur`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged as per the given initial state.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is -1, `A[x][-1]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[1][ncur]` has been updated for each valid move, `parent[1][ncur]` has been set for each valid `ncur`, `queue` contains an additional tuple `(ncur, 2)`, `dx` and `dy` must be prepared for the next iteration, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is updated to `cur, piece`.**
