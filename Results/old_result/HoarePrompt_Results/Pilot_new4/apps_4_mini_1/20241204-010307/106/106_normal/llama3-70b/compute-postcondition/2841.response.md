The code `queue.append((ncur, 1))` appends a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The `ncur` is derived from the current position in the grid, and the second element of the tuple is `1`, which represents the updated piece value. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `piece` is equal to `1`, `dist[0]` holds the updated shortest distances for reachable positions, `parent[0]` indicates the predecessors for those reachable positions, `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is `y - 1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, the current values of `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid, satisfying `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is now equal to `(cur, piece)`**.
