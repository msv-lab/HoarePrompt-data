The line of code `parent[1][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to the `parent` array at the index `[1][ncur]`. The variables `cur` and `piece` are not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it can be inferred that they hold specific values during the execution of the code.

The output state indicates that the initial conditions related to `N`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` remain unchanged, while `parent` is updated at the specified index. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x + dx - 1`; `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.**
