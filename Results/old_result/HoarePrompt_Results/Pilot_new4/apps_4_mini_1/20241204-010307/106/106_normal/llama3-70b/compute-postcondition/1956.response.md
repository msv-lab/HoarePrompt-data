Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `piece` remains unchanged at 0, `y` is 4, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, `dist` and `parent` remain unchanged, and `queue` does not include `(ncur, 0)`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` is false, no changes are made to `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.***
