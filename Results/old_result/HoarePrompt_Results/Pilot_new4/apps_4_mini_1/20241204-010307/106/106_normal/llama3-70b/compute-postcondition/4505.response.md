According to the code, the loop iterates over a list of tuples representing possible knight's moves. Each time the loop executes, it processes one of these moves. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is 0, and the loop variable `(dx, dy)` will take its next value from the list.

The loop will execute again for the next iteration, which means that it will take the next tuple from `[(dx, dy) in [(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]`. The variable `(dx, dy)` is currently at its first value `(-1, -1)`, which means it will move to the second value `(-1, 1)` for the next iteration.

Thus, to execute one more time, the updated states are:

- `dx` will be `-1`, and `dy` will be `1` for the next iteration of the loop.
- All other variables remain the same because the loop will only affect the `dx` and `dy` values for the next iteration.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dist` and `parent` are valid and updated based on knight's moves, `queue` contains valid `(ncur, 0)` tuples and potentially now includes `(ncur, 1)`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1**
