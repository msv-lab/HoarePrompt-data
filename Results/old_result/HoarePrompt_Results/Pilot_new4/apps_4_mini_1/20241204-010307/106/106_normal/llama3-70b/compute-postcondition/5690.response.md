The `queue` now has a new element appended to it, specifically the tuple `(cur, i)`. This addition indicates that the current state of the `cur` position with respect to the `piece` value `i` has been recorded in the `queue`. The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `queue` now contains the previously appended elements plus the new element `(cur, i)`; `dist[2][ncur]` remains unchanged; `parent[2][ncur]` remains unchanged; the current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`.**
