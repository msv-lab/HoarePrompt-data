The value of `ncur` is assigned the value from the 2D array `A` at the indices `(nx, ny)`, where `nx` is `x + 1` and `ny` is `1`. The values of `N`, `y`, `dist[1]`, `parent[1]`, `queue`, `dx`, and `dy` remain unchanged. The specific value of `ncur` will depend on the current values in the array `A`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dist[1]` reflects updated distances based on valid moves, `parent[1]` contains updated parent relationships for valid moves, `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)` in addition to its previous contents, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is 1, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`**.
