The code assigns the value of `cur` to `parent[2][ncur]`, while the other variables and preconditions remain unchanged. The Output State reflects the updated value of `parent[2][ncur]` while maintaining the information about the other variables.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dist[0]` remains unchanged, `parent[0]` remains unchanged, `queue` contains at least one tuple of (ncur, 1), `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are between 0 and N-1, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`.**
