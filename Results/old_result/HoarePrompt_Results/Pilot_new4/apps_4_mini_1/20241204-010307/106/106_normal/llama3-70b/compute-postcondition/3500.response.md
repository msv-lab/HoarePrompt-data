Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` and `y` are within `0` and `N-1`, `dx` and `dy` correspond to the next direction, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, and `ny` is equal to `y + dy`. If both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid defined by `N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and the queue now contains `(ncur, 2)` appended to it. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
