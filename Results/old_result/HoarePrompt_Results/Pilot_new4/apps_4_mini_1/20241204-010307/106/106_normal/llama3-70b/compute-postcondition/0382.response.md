The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The `ncur` variable was previously assigned the value of `A[nx][0]`, and `0` remains unchanged. The other variables remain unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -2, `nx` is `x - 1 - 1`, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][0]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, `piece`, and `queue` now contains `(ncur, 0)`.**
