The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The value of `ncur` is derived from `A[nx][ny]`, but the contents of `A` are not specified in the initial state. Therefore, the output state will include the current values of all relevant variables while noting that `queue` has been updated.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `piece` is the same, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[0]` is unchanged, `parent[1][ncur]` is `cur`, `piece`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, and `queue` now includes `(ncur, 1)`**.
