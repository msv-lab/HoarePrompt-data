Postcondition: ***`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `4 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, `dist[2][ncur]` and `parent[2][ncur]` are valid, `queue` contains applicable tuples including `(cur, i)` and `(ncur, 2)` if `piece` is not equal to `i`. The current value of `nx` is between 0 and N, and the current value of `ny` is between 0 and N.***
