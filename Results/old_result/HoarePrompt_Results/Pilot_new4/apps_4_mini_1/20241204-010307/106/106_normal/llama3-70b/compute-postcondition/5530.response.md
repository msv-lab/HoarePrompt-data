Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)` if `piece` equals 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`. In this case, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `A[0][0]` equals `cur`, `nx` and `ny` are within the range from 0 to N-1, `dist[0][ncur]` equals `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `piece` equals 0, and `parent[0][ncur]` equals `cur` and `piece`. Otherwise, the values prior to execution remain unchanged.***
