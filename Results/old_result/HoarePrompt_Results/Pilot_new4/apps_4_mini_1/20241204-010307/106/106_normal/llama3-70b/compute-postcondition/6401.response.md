The operation `queue.append((ncur, 0))` appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `0` will be added together as a new entry in the `queue`. There are no changes to the other variables based on this operation, but the state of the `queue` will now include the new tuple.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dist[0]` remains unchanged, `parent[0]` remains unchanged, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is -2, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is undefined, `piece` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` remains greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1, `queue` now includes `(ncur, 0)`**.
