The line of code `queue.append((ncur, 1))` adds a tuple containing `ncur` and the integer `1` to the list `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `1` are appended as a new entry in `queue`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y - 1`, `ncur = A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)` appended to it.**
