Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is 0, `ny` is -1, if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then if `piece` equals 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. Otherwise, no changes are made. If the condition for the if statement is not satisfied, no actions are taken.***
