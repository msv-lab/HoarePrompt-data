The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The values of `dx` and `dy` represent a direction, and since the loop starts with the first direction (-1, 0), it implies `dx = -1` and `dy = 0`. Therefore, `nx` is updated to `x - 1`, and `ny` remains equal to `y`. The state of `dist[1][ncur]` is not directly affected by the code snippet provided. Therefore, the output state reflects the changes to `nx` and `ny`.

Output State: **`dist[1][ncur]` contains the minimum distances from the starting position to all reachable positions; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y`.**
