In the given initial state, we have:
- `N` is between 3 and 10
- `x` is 0
- `y` is 2
- `dx` is -1
- `dy` is -1
- `nx` is -1
- `ny` is 1
- `ncur` is `A[1][3]`

Now, executing the code:
```
ncur = A[nx][ny]
```
Here, `nx` is -1 and `ny` is 1. Therefore, `ncur` will be assigned the value `A[-1][1]`.

The only variable that is updated is `ncur`. The other variables retain their previous values. 

Since `N` is between 3 and 10, we do not have an exact value for `A`, but we acknowledge that `ncur` is now equal to `A[-1][1]`. The information regarding valid preconditions remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is -1, `ny` is 1, and `ncur` is equal to `A[-1][1]`.**
