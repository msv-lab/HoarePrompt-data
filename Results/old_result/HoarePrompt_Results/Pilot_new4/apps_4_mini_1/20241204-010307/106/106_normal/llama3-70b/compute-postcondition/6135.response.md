The variable `dist[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `dist[0][cur] + 1`. The current state indicates that `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, which implies that the condition will now become false after the assignment. The other variables that are not directly affected remain the same. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 0, and `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, making the previous condition false.**
