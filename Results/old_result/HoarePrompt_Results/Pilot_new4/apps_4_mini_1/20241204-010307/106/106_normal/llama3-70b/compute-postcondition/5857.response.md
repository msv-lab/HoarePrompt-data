The code assigns the value of `A[nx][ny]` to `ncur`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are already defined as `2 + dx` and `dy`, respectively. Therefore, `ncur` will take on the value from the array `A` at the specified indices. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `piece` is 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `queue` now contains both `(ncur, 1)` and `(ncur, 2)`, `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
