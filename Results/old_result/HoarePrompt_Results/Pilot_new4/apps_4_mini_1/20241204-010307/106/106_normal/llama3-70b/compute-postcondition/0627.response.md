The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and the integer `0` are specifically added to the `queue`. The other variables remain unchanged and retain their previous values. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is `x - 2`, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is A[nx][ny], `piece` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, and `queue` now includes the value `(ncur, 0)`.**
