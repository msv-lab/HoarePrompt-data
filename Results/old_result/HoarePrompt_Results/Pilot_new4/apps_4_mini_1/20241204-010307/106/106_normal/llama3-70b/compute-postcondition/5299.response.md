The line of code assigns the value `cur` and `piece` to `parent[1][ncur]`. The values of `cur` and `piece` are not specified in the initial state; however, `ncur` is known to be equal to `A[3][1]`. The other variables remain unchanged since they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the assignment of `parent[1][ncur]` while the rest of the state remains the same.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 0, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is 3, `ny` is 1, `ncur` is equal to `A[3][1]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.**
