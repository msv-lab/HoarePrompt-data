Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `dx` is 1; `dy` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x + 1`; `ny` is equal to `y + 1`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[x + 1][y + 1]`. If `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `parent[1][ncur]` is updated to `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` now contains `(ncur, 1)`. Otherwise, there are no changes to the variables or structures involved.***
