Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 1; if `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, then `dist` is updated for all reachable positions based on conditions, `parent` reflects the paths taken for those positions, and `queue` contains tuples for all updated positions that met the conditions, including the tuple `(cur, i)` if `piece` is not equal to `i`.***
