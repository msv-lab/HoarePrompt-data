According to the code, the loop will continue executing as long as the variable `y` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is 0 and `N` is between 3 and 10, meaning the loop can execute again for `y` being 1. 

Thus, for the loop to be executed one more time, `y` must be incremented by 1 to 1 and `N` must remain within the range of 3 to 10. 

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1**
