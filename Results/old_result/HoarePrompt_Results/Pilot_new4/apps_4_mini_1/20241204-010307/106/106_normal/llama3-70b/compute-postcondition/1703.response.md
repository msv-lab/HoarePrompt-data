The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[1][ncur]`. The previous values of `cur` and `piece` remain unchanged, but now there is a relationship established in `parent[1]` at the index `ncur`. The other states of the variables remain valid, but the specific relationship in `parent` is updated.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `x` is between 1 and `N-2`, `dx` is one of the values from the set { -2, -1, 1, 2 }, `dy` is one of the values from the set { -2, -1, 1, 2 }, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`, and the condition `dist[1][ncur] > dist[1][cur]` is no longer valid.**
