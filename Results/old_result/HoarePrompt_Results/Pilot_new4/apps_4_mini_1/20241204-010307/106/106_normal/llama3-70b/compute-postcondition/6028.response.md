The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned new values based on the expressions `x + dx` and `y + dy` respectively. The value of `y` is given as 9, so `ny` will be updated to `9 + dy`. The variable `nx` will be updated based on the current value of `x` plus the value of `dx`. The values of `N`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 9, `y` is 9, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `9 + dy`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur` reachable from the starting position, `parent[1][ncur]` contains the parent relationships for each updated `ncur`, and `queue` contains all valid updated `(ncur, 1)` tuples and also includes `(ncur, 2)`**.
