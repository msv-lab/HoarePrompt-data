To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the loop structure and the variables involved.

1. The loop iterates over a list of tuples containing pairs of `(dx, dy)` values. The loop will execute for each of these pairs, regardless of the values of `N`, `x`, `y`, and `A[0][0]`.

2. The variables `N`, `x`, `y`, and `A[0][0]` do not influence the iteration count or the execution of the loop body directly, as the loop is dependent on the predefined list of tuples. 

3. The variable `cur` (which is equal to `A[0][0]`) might be used in the loop body, but we do not have information about how it affects the loop execution itself.

4. Since `N` is between 3 and 10, `x`, and `y` are both initialized to 0, and `A[0][0]` is initialized to `cur`, we can conclude that these states should remain unchanged for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the adjustments needed are minimal regarding the loopâ€™s execution, as the loop condition is based solely on the predefined pairs.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`**
