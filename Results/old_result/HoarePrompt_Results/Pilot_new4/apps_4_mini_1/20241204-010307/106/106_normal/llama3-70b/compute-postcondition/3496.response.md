The variable `dist[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `dist[2][cur] + 1`. The specific values of `cur` and `ncur` are not provided, but we know that `ncur` corresponds to the value in the array `A` at the position `(nx, ny)`, where `nx` is calculated as `x + dx` and `ny` is calculated as `y + dy`. Consequently, the value of `dist[2][ncur]` will be one more than the value of `dist[2][cur]`. 

As a result, the output state reflects this update, while the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` and `y` are within `0` and `N-1`, `dx` and `dy` correspond to the next direction, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` and `y` are within `0` and `N-1`, `dx` and `dy` correspond to the next direction, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`**.
