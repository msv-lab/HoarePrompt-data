The values of `nx` and `ny` are updated based on the calculations of `x` and `y` with the addition of `dx` and `dy`. The previous values are `x = 1` and `y = 0`, and after executing the code, we have:

- `nx` becomes `1 + dx`
- `ny` becomes `0 + dy`

Since `dx` and `dy` are not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine specific values for `nx` and `ny`. However, we know that `nx` and `ny` will be the result of adding `dx` to `1` and `dy` to `0`, respectively.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged since they are not directly affected by the operation.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; `nx` is equal to `1 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`; `piece` is equal to 2 if the conditions are met; `dist[2][ncur]` must be greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1` if conditions are unmet; `parent[2][ncur]` remains unchanged; `queue` may include the next position accordingly.**
