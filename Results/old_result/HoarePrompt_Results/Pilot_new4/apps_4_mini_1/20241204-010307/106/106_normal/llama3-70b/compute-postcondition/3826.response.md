Postcondition: ***`dist[1]` contains the shortest distances based on valid moves, `parent[1]` indicates the relationship for each reachable position, `queue` holds tuples for positions added during the loop, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, and `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The value of `piece` is 2, and the current value of `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`.***
