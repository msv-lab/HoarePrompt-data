The variable `ncur` is assigned the value from the 2D array `A` at the position defined by `nx` and `ny`. Since `nx` is equal to `2 + dx` and `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are valid indices within the bounds of the grid defined by `N`, which is between 3 and 10. Therefore, `ncur` will have a specific value from array `A` corresponding to those indices.

The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `dist` reflects the updated shortest path distances, `parent` stores the corresponding previous positions for reachable states, `queue` contains all reachable tuples from the valid moves, `A[2][0]` remains equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]` where `nx` and `ny` are valid indices within the bounds of the grid defined by `N`.**
