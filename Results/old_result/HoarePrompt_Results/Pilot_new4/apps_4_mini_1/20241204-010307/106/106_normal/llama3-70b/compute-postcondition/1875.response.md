The value of `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. Given that `nx` and `ny` are calculated with the conditions that they are valid indices within the bounds of the grid, `ncur` will be set to the element of `A` at the position defined by `nx` and `ny`. The states of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is at least 4, `dist` is valid for reachable indices, `parent` is valid for reachable indices, `queue` contains valid tuples of `(ncur, 0)`, `piece` is set according to loop conditions, `cur` is valid for index calculations, `x` is a valid index, `y` is a valid index, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid (0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N), and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
