The statement `parent[0][ncur] = cur, piece` is executed, which assigns the tuple `(cur, piece)` to `parent[0][ncur]`. The value of `cur` is not specified, but `piece` is equal to `0`, so the assignment will contain the current value of `cur` and `0`.

The variables `N`, `x`, `y`, `dist`, `parent`, `queue`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and `piece` remain unchanged in their original state, aside from the modification of `parent[0][ncur]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `dist[1]` contains updated distances for valid positions reachable from (1, 1), `parent[1]` contains predecessors for valid positions reachable from (1, 1), `queue` contains tuples of all reachable positions from (1, 1) that had their distances updated during the loop, `piece` is equal to 0, `parent[0][ncur]` is now equal to `(cur, 0)`**.
