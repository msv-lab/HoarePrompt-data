The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[2][ncur]`. The previous values of `ncur`, `cur`, and `piece` affect the state of `parent`, but the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `parent[2][ncur]` while retaining the original conditions of the other variables.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is equal to `N`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `N + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`, and `dist` has valid prior values.**
