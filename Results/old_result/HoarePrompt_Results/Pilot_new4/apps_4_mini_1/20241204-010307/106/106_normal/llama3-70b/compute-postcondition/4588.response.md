The code `queue.append((ncur, 1))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `piece` (which is the second element, equal to `1`) are used for this operation. There are no variables being changed; only `queue` is updated by appending a new tuple.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[0]` contains parent relationships for valid moves; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; the value of `piece` is 1; `dist[1][ncur]` is now less than or equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1; parent[1][ncur] is now equal to (cur, piece); `queue` contains the previous elements plus the new element `(ncur, 1)`**.
