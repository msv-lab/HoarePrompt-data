The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. Given the initial state, the values of `ncur` is derived from the expression `A[nx][ny]`, and `0` is a constant.

The values of the other variables are unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State includes the unchanged preconditions along with the new information regarding the queue.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is within `0` and `N-1`, `y` is within `0` and `N-1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`, `queue` is updated to include `(ncur, 0)`**.
