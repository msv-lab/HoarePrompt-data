The state of `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to be equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`. Since it is given that `dist[1][ncur]` was greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, it indicates that the previous value of `dist[1][ncur]` was not optimal, and it has now been updated to reflect a shorter distance. The other variables in the context remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `x` is between 1 and `N-2`, `dx` is one of the values from the set { -2, -1, 1, 2 }, `dy` is one of the values from the set { -2, -1, 1, 2 }; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and the previous condition of `dist[1][ncur] > dist[1][cur]` is no longer valid.**
