The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are already defined to be within the bounds of 0 and N, ensuring that `A[nx][ny]` is a valid access. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is between 0 and N-1, `y` is between 0 and N-1, `dist` must be appropriately initialized, `parent` must reflect valid parent tuples, `queue` must contain valid tuples, `piece` is greater than 0, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
