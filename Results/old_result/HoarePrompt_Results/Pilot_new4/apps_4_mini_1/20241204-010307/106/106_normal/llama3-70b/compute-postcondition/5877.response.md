Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 0 and 8 (inclusive); `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; if `piece` is equal to 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is set to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value (cur, piece), and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`; otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
