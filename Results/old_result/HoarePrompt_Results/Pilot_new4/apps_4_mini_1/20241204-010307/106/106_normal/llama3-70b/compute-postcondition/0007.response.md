According to the code, the `while` loop can execute as long as the `queue` is not empty. Before the loop, `queue` is initialized with `deque([(1, 0)])`, which means it contains at least one item. Since the queue is not empty, the loop can indeed execute one time.

Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for any of the provided states, as all conditions for the loop to run are already satisfied.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, `A` is a 2D list of distinct integers based on input with N rows, `dist` has `dist[0][1]` equal to `0`, `dist` is a 2D list with 3 rows and (N * N + 1) columns initialized to float('inf') with `dist[0][1]` updated, `parent` is a 2D list with 3 rows and (N * N + 1) columns initialized to None, `i` is 0, `queue` is deque([(1, 0)])**
