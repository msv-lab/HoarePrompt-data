In the given code snippet, `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The variables `x` and `y` are given specific values of 3 and 1, but the values of `dx` and `dy` are not specified in the initial state. Since `dx` and `dy` will take values from a list of directional changes, we cannot determine their values from the information provided. Therefore, we will express `nx` and `ny` in terms of `dx` and `dy`.

The preconditions that are still valid after executing the code include:
- `N` remains between 4 and 10.
- `x` is 3.
- `y` is 1.
- `dx` and `dy` are variables that will take values from the directional changes list.

Thus, the output state will reflect the new values of `nx` and `ny` in relation to `dx` and `dy`.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 3, `y` is 1, `nx` is 3 + `dx`, `ny` is 1 + `dy`**
