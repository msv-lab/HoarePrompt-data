The code `queue.append((ncur, 0))` adds a new element `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The `queue` variable is modified, but the states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Since `ncur` is still `A[-1][-1]`, the output state will reflect that a new tuple has been added to the `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` has the new element `(ncur, 0)` appended to it, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is -1, `ny` is 1, `ncur` is still `A[-1][-1]`, `piece` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is now `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`**.
