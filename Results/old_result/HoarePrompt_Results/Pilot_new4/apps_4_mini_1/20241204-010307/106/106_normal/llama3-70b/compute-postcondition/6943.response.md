According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the pairs of (`dx`, `dy`) being iterated over, and the conditions involving `nx` and `ny` must be satisfied. The loop has executed 8 times already, meaning it has gone through all combinations of the horizontal and vertical changes allowed by the pairs `(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)`. 

For the loop to execute correctly, we need to ensure that for at least one of the pairs (`dx`, `dy`), the calculated values `nx` and `ny` must remain within the bounds defined by `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`. Given that `N` is between 3 and 10, we also need to ensure the variables `ncur`, `cur`, and `piece` are appropriately defined to allow the conditions inside the loop body to be evaluated.

As such, the necessary states that need to be adjusted are as follows:

- `ncur` must be defined properly as `A[nx][ny]` for at least one valid pair (`dx`, `dy`).
- `cur` must be defined such that `dist[0][ncur]` and `dist[0][cur]` can be compared appropriately.
- `piece` should be confirmed to be 0 to ensure that the relevant conditions for updating `dist` and `parent` can be satisfied.

Thus, the final state should reflect these requirements:

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x + dx` for some valid `dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy` for some valid `dy`, `ncur` must be valid for `A[nx][ny]`, `cur` must be defined, `piece` is 0**
