The code `queue.append((ncur, 2))` appends a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The variable `ncur` is already defined as equal to `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is in the range `0 <= nx < N` and `ny` is in the range `0 <= ny < N`. This means that `ncur` has a specific value based on the current state of the array `A`.

No other variables are affected directly by this operation. The state of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `dist`, `parent`, and `piece` remains unchanged. The only change is that a new entry gets added to `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `nx` is `0 + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, 2)`, `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`, the value of `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is in the range `0 <= nx < N` and `ny` is in the range `0 <= ny < N`, and `piece` is equal to 2.**
