Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `x` is between 1 and `N-2`, `dx` is one of the values from the set { -2, -1, 1, 2 }, `dy` is one of the values from the set { -2, -1, 1, 2 }, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and the condition `dist[1][ncur] > dist[1][cur]` is no longer valid; additionally, the `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`.***
