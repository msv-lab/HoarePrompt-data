The code `queue.append((ncur, 2))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. The output state should reflect the unchanged variables and the impact of the code.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `piece` is 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent` is updated at index `[2][ncur]` to the tuple `(cur, piece)`, `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`, `nx` is equal to `1 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and the value of `dist[2][ncur]` was greater than `dist[2][cur]` before the update.**
