The code `queue.append((ncur, 0))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The values for `ncur` and `0` are being appended, but the state of the other variables remains unaffected. 

Since `ncur` was previously defined as `A[nx][ny]`, its value is based on the current values of `nx` and `ny`. The other variables remain as they were described in the initial state.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `nx` is `2 + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is updated to `cur, piece`, and `queue` now contains `(ncur, 0)` in addition to its prior contents.**
