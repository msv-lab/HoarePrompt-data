The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[0][ncur]`. The previous values of `ncur` is defined as equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `nx` is equal to `x - 2`. The value of `ncur` is dependent on the values of `A[nx][ny]`, but we are not provided the exact values for `A`, `cur`, or `piece`. Therefore, we can note that `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `cur` and `piece`, but the specific value of `ncur` will depend on the values of the surrounding context. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is 3, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the values of `cur` and `piece`.**
