According to the code, the for loop iterates over the directional changes specified in the list `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`. Each iteration will update the variables `dx` and `dy` to the next tuple in the list. At the end of the last iteration, `dx` and `dy` correspond to the last tuple in the list (0, 1). 

After the last iteration, the loop will attempt to execute again, using the next tuple from the list. Since there are only 4 tuples in the list, after iterating through all tuples, the loop will not execute again. Consequently, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the next tuple:

Since `dx` and `dy` will not change anymore, and the loop has already iterated through all available tuples, we need to indicate the state before the loop can no longer execute.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `4 <= N <= 11`, `y` is equal to `N`, `A` is a valid two-dimensional array, `cur` is a valid position in `A`, `dist[1]` and `parent[1]` may remain unchanged, `queue` contains valid positions, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and the last valid `(dx, dy)` was (0, 1); there are no more tuples to process in the list.**
