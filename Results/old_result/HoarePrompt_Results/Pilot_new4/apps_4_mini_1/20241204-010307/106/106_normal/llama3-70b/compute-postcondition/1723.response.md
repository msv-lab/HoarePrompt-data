Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `x` is between 1 and `N-2`, `dist[1][ncur]` will be updated for all valid combinations of `dx` and `dy` if `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` was initially greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1` for valid `ncur`, `parent[1][ncur]` will reflect the last valid `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` will contain all valid tuples of `(ncur, 1)` appended during the iterations. If the loop did not execute, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initial or prior values.**
