The value of `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. Since `nx` is equal to `1 + dx` and `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` satisfy the conditions for accessing the array `A`. Thus, the value of `ncur` is determined by the specific values in the array `A` at the indices `[nx][ny]`, where `nx` and `ny` are calculated based on the initial values of `dx` and `dy`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `piece` is 1, `dist` is initialized, `parent` is initialized, `queue` can potentially be empty or initialized, `nx` is equal to `1 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
