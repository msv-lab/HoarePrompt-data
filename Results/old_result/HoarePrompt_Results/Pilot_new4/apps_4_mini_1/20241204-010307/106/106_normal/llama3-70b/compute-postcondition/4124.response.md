The code assigns the values of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[0][ncur]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The specific values of `cur` and `piece` are not provided in the initial state, so we will note that these variables are the ones being utilized in the assignment.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is -2, `ny` is 1, `ncur` is A[nx][ny], `piece` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the values of `cur` and `piece`.**
