Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `dist` contains the shortest distances for all reachable positions, `parent` reflects the predecessors for each reachable position. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, `parent[0][ncur]` is updated to `cur`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 2][-1]`, and if `piece == 0` and `dist[0][ncur] > dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. If the conditions are not satisfied, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
