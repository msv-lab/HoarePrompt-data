According to the code, the loop iterates over the tuples of `(dx, dy)` from the list `[(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]`. Since the current iteration has already processed the tuple `(-1, -1)`, the next tuples to be processed are `(-1, 1)`, `(1, -1)`, and `(1, 1)`. 

As a result, after processing `(-1, -1)`, the `dx` and `dy` need to be updated to the next tuple in the list. The loop will execute again with the next pair of `(dx, dy)`.

State: **`dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y`, and the values of `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged**
