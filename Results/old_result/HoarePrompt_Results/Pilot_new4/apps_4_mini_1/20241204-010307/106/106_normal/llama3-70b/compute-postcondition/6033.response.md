Postcondition: ***`N` is greater than or equal to 9, `y` is 9, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `9 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` retains the parent relationships for each updated `ncur`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `cur, piece`, and `queue` contains all valid updated `(ncur, 1)` tuples and includes `(ncur, 2)` which has been appended. If the condition is not met, the state remains unchanged.***
