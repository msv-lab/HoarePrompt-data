Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` is not empty, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, and if both conditions 0 <= `nx` < `N` and 0 <= `ny` < `N` are satisfied, then `queue` contains the elements prior to the append operation plus `(ncur, 0)`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `dist[0][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, while `parent[0][ncur]` is (cur, piece). The `queue` is updated to include the tuple `(ncur, 0)` if the condition `piece == 0` and `dist[0][ncur] > dist[0][cur] + 1` holds true. If the conditions are not satisfied, the state remains unchanged.***
