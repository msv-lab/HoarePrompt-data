Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `x` is defined and within bounds, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is 2, and if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][2]`. If `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` is updated to include the element `(ncur, 2)`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
