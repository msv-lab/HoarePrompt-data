Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is an integer less than `N`, `dist[1][ncur]` contains minimum distances from `cur`, `parent[1][ncur]` indicates parents for each `ncur`, `queue` contains reachable tuples `(ncur, 1)`, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 2, and the current value of `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`.***
