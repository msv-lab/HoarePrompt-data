The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the list `queue`. This operation does not affect the values of the other variables, but it updates the `queue` by adding a new element.

The current values of the affected variables are:
- `queue` is updated to include the new tuple `(ncur, 1)`.

Other variables maintain their previous states, including:
- `N` is between 3 and 10,
- `x` is 1,
- `y` is 2,
- `nx` is `1 + dx`,
- `ny` is `2 + dy`,
- `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`,
- `dist[0]` is updated during the loop execution,
- `parent[0]` is updated during the loop execution,
- `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`,
- `piece` is equal to 1,
- `dist[1][ncur]` was greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1` before the update,
- `parent[1][ncur]` is now `cur` and `piece`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `dist[0]` is updated during the loop execution, `parent[0]` is updated during the loop execution, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 1, `dist[1][ncur]` was greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1` before the update, `parent[1][ncur]` is now `cur` and `piece`, `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`**.
