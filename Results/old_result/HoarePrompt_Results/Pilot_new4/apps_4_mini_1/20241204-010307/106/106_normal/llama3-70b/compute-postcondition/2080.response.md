Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 5, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, and `parent` reflects the most recent parents for all reachable indices. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, 2)`, and `queue` includes the entry `(ncur, 2)` along with all new entries generated during the iterations. The values of `piece`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` remain unchanged. If the condition is not satisfied, no changes are made to `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.***
