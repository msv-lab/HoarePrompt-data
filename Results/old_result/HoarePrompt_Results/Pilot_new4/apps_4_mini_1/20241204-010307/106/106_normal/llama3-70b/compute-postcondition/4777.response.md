The statement `parent[1][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the tuple `(cur, piece)` to `parent[1][ncur]`. The initial values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `dist`, `parent`, `queue`, and `ncur` are not directly modified by this code, but the specific element in `parent` does get updated.

Given the initial state, the key points are:
- The value of `ncur` is determined by `A[nx][ny]`, but we do not have specific values for `A`, `cur`, or `piece`.
- `parent[1]` at index `ncur` now holds the tuple `(cur, piece)`.

Since we do not have the specific values of `cur`, `piece`, or how `ncur` is computed, we only know that `parent[1][ncur]` has been updated.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `dist[0]` has been updated for reachable positions, `parent[0]` has been assigned tuples for reachable positions, `queue` contains tuples for each reachable position from `(0, 0)`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `parent[1][ncur]` has been assigned the tuple `(cur, piece)`**.
