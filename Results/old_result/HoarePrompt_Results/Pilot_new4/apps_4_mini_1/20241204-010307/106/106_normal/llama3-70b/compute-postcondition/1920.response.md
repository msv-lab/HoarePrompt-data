The value of `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`. The variables `dist`, `ncur`, and `cur` are relevant for this calculation. However, the initial values of `dist` and `cur` are not provided, so we cannot specify their exact values. The value of `ncur` remains equal to `A[x - 1][y]`. The state of other variables remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices, `piece` is equal to 2, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y]`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
