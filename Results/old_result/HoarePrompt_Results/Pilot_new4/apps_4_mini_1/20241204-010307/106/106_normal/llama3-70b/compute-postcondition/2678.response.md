Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is -1, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is `0`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][0]`. If `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and the tuple `(ncur, 1)` is appended to `queue`. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
