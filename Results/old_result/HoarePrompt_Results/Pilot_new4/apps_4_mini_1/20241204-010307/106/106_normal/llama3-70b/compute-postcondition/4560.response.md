The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to the `parent[0][ncur]` variable. The other variables remain unchanged. The specific values of `cur` and `piece` are not given, but they are used directly in the assignment. Therefore, we still have:

- `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`
- `y` is 1
- `dx` is -2
- `dy` is -1
- `nx` is `x - 2`
- `ny` is 0
- `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, where `0 <= nx < N`
- The current value of `piece` is 0
- `dist[0][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, which is greater than its previous value

The only change is that `parent[0][ncur]` now has the value of `cur` and `piece`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is `x - 2`, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, where `0 <= nx < N`, the current value of `piece` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, which is greater than its previous value, and `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, `piece`.**
