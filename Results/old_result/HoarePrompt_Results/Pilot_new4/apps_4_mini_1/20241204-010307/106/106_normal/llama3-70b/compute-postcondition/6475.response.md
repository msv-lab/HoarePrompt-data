Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dist[1]` reflects the shortest distances relevant to valid moves based on the updates made during the loop executions, `parent[1]` reflects the parent nodes relevant to valid moves as updated during the loop, and `queue` contains all valid `(ncur, 2)` tuples based on the successful updates of distances. If no valid moves were made, `dist[1]` and `parent[1]` remain unchanged from their initial state, while `queue` may be empty or contain previously valid tuples. Additionally, `piece` is not equal to `i`.***
