The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are `x + dx` and `dy`, respectively. Since `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, and `y` is initially 0, the output state will reflect the updated assignment of `ncur`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 0; `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[x + dx][dy]`.**
