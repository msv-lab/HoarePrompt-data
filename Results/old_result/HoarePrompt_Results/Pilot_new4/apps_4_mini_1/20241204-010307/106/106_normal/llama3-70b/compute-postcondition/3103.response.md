Postcondition: ***`N` is greater than 3 and less than or equal to 10, `y` is 2, `piece` is 1, `x` is at least 1, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, if `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `dist[1][ncur]` is no longer greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, 1)`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`.***
