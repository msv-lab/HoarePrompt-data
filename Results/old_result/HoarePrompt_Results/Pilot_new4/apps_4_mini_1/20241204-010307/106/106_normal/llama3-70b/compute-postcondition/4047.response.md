The code snippet `queue.append((ncur, 0))` adds a tuple containing `ncur` and `0` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `0` are added without changing any other variable. The previous values of the affected variables remain the same.

The states of the other variables are not affected, and we don't have the specific value of `ncur`, but we know its position is defined in the initial state.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `dx` is -2; `dy` is 1; `nx` is -2; `ny` is 2; `ncur` is `A[-2][2]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is now `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`; `piece` is unchanged; `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`.**
