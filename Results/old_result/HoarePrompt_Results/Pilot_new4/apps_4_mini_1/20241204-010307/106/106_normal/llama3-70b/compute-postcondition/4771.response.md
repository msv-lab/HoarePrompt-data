Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `dist[0]` has been updated for reachable positions, `parent[0]` has been assigned tuples for reachable positions, `queue` now contains tuples for each reachable position from `(x, y)`. If `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then the new tuple `(ncur, 1)` has been appended to `queue`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
