According to the code, the for loop iterates over the tuples in the list `[(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]`. This means the loop will execute a specific number of times based on the number of tuples in that list, which is 4. Each iteration of the loop will assign `dx` and `dy` values from the tuples sequentially.

At the end of the last iteration, the states are as follows:
- `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`
- `y` is -1
- `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`
- `dx` is -1
- `dy` is 1
- `nx` is `x - 1`
- `ny` is `0`
- If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][0]`
- If `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and the tuple `(ncur, 1)` is appended to `queue`. Otherwise, no changes occur.
- If the conditions for `nx` and `ny` are not met, no actions are performed.

The loop has not yet completed all its iterations. At the end of the previous iteration, the last values assigned to `dx` and `dy` were `-1` and `1`, respectively, corresponding to the second tuple.

To determine the state for the start of the next iteration, we need to move to the next tuple in the list, which is `(1, -1)`. Therefore, the states should reflect this change.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is -1, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is 1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is `0`**
