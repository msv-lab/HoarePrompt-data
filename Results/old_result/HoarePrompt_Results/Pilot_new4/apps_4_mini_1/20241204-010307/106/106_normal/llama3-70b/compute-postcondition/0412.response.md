The loop iterates over all combinations of `dx` and `dy` from the list `[(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]`, and for each combination, it calculates `nx` and `ny`. The state of the variables depends on whether valid indices are found for `nx` and `ny` within the grid defined by size `N`. 

If there are valid moves, the distances and parent references are updated accordingly. If no valid moves are found, the initial state of `dist` and `parent` remains unchanged.

Output State: **If there are valid moves, `dist[1][ncur]` contains updated distance values based on the current position, `parent[1][ncur]` stores the last position and piece, and `queue` contains tuples of valid positions. If no valid moves were found, `dist[1]` and `parent[1]` remain unchanged from their initial states, `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`.**
