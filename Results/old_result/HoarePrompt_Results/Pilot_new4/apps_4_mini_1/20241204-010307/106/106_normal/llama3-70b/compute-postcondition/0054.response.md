The line of code adds a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The previous values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is as follows:

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= `N` <= 10, `piece` is 1, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is (cur, piece), queue contains the tuple (ncur, 1)**
