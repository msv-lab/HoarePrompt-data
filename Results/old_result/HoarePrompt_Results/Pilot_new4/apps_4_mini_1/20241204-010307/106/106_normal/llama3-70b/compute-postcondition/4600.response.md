The values of `nx` and `ny` are updated based on the expressions `nx = x + dx` and `ny = y + dy`. Given that `dx` is `-1` and `dy` is `-1`, we can derive the following:

1. Since `nx` is equal to `x + -1`, it simplifies to `nx = x - 1`.
2. The value of `ny` is calculated as `ny = 1 + -1`, which simplifies to `ny = 0`.

The initial state provided gives us the following information:
- `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`
- `y` is 1
- `nx` is equal to `x - 1`
- `ny` is now equal to 0
- `piece` is 1
- `dx` is -1
- `dy` is -1

Thus, the output state updates the value of `ny` while keeping all other variables the same. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is 0; `piece` is 1; `dx` is -1; `dy` is -1**
