Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `nx` is `2 + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `piece` is 0. If `piece` equals 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` includes the previous entries plus the new tuple `(ncur, 0)`, while `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
