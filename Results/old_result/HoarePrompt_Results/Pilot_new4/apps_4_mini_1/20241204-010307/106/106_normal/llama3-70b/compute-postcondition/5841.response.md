Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; `queue` contains at least one tuple of the form `(ncur, 1)`; `piece` remains 0 for the tuples in `queue`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is equal to 2; the distance `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`.***
