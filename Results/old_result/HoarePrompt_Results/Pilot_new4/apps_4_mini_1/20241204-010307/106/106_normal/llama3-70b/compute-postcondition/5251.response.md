The code `queue.append((cur, i))` adds a tuple `(cur, i)` to the `queue`. The values of `cur` and `i` are presumed to be defined prior to this statement and are not affected by the execution of this code. The other variables remain unchanged as well.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is between 0 and `N-1`; `y` is between 1 and `N-1`; `dist[2]` reflects the updated distances based on valid moves; `parent[2]` contains the relationships for valid positions; `queue` now contains tuples generated from valid updates based on the conditions met during the loop execution, including the new tuple `(cur, i)`; the current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`.**
