To determine the output state, we analyze the given code snippet and the initial state:

Initial State: `dist` contains valid distances for reachable indices, `parent[1][ncur]` reflects the parent tracking for each updated index, `piece` is 2, `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is `y`.

In the code snippet:
```
ncur = A[nx][ny]
```
Here, `ncur` is assigned the value from the two-dimensional array `A` at the position indexed by `nx` and `ny`. The specific values of `nx` and `ny` depend on the previously stated values. 

Since `nx` is defined as `x + 1`, we can express `ncur` as:
```
ncur = A[x + 1][y]
```

The other variables in the initial state (`dist`, `parent[1][ncur]`, `piece`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged after the execution of this line. The main change is that `ncur` now holds a specific value from the array `A`.

Output State: **`dist` contains valid distances for reachable indices, `parent[1][ncur]` reflects the parent tracking for each updated index, `piece` is 2, `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is `y`, `ncur` is the value of A[x + 1][y].**
