The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. Given that `x` is initially 1, `dx` is 1, `y` is initially 0, and `dy` is 0, we can compute the new values as follows:

- `nx = x + dx = 1 + 1 = 2`
- `ny = y + dy = 0 + 0 = 0`

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `queue` initially contains at least one tuple of the form `(ncur, 1)`, `piece` is 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is 2, `ny` is 0.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `queue` initially contains at least one tuple of the form `(ncur, 1)`, `piece` is 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is 2, `ny` is 0**.
