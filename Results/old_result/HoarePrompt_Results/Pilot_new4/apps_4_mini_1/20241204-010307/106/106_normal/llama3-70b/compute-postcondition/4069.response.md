According to the code, the loop iterates over the specified tuples for `dx` and `dy`. The loop will execute once for each of the four tuples in the list: `(-1, -1)`, `(-1, 1)`, `(1, -1)`, and `(1, 1)`. Since the loop has not yet completed, it can execute multiple times.

At the end of the last iteration, the values of `dx` and `dy` are currently `-1` and `-1`, respectively. For the loop to execute one more time, it will need to proceed to the next tuple in the list of directions, which would be `(-1, 1)` for the first subsequent iteration.

The loop will continue until all tuples have been iterated over. Therefore, `dx` and `dy` need to be updated to reflect the next set of tuple values.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is -1, `ny` is 0, and `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`**
