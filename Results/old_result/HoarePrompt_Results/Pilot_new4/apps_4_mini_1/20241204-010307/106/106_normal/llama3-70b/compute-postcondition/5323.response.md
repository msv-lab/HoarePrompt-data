The values of `nx` and `ny` are updated based on the calculations from `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. However, `dx` and `dy` are not provided in the initial state, so their values are unknown. The equation assigns `nx` to `x + dx` and `ny` to `y + dy`. 

Since `x` is 4 and `y` is 0, we can express the new values for `nx` and `ny` in terms of `dx` and `dy`: 
- `nx = 4 + dx`
- `ny = 0 + dy`

Thus, after executing the code, the states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `4 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`.**
