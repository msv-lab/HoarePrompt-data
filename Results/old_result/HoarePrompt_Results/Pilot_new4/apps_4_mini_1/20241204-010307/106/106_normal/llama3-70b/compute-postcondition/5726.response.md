The code updates the value of `dist[1][ncur]` by assigning it the value of `dist[1][cur] + 1`. The existing condition shows that `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, which means the new value of `dist[1][ncur]` will now be `dist[1][cur] + 1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` contains tuples of (ncur, 0), `dist` is updated such that `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent` is initialized for `N` values, `piece` is defined before the loop, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the range of 0 to `N` (inclusive of 0 and exclusive of `N`.**
