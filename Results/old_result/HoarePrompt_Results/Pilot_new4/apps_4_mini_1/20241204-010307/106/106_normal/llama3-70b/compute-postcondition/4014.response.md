The statement `parent[2][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[2][ncur]`. The variables `cur` and `piece` are used here without any prior definitions in this context, but we can conclude that `parent[2][ncur]` is being updated.

The output state remains the same for all other variables since they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output will reflect that the `parent[2][ncur]` variable has changed to hold the value of `cur` and `piece`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x + dx][y + dy]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dist[1][ncur]` contains the updated minimum distances, `parent[1][ncur]` contains the respective parent information, `queue` contains reachable positions, and `parent[2][ncur]` is updated to hold the value of `cur, piece`.**
