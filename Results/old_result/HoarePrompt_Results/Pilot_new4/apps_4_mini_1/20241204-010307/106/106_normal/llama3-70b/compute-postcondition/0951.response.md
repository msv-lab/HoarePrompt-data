To analyze the impact of the provided code snippet, we first establish the initial conditions:

- `N` is between 3 and 10.
- `x` is 0.
- `y` is 1.
- `nx` is -1.
- `ny` is 0.
- `ncur` is assigned the value `A[-1][0]`.

Now, we examine the code:

```
dist[2][ncur] = dist[2][cur] + 1
```

This line of code updates the value of `dist[2][ncur]`. The specific assignments and computations depend on the values of `dist` and `cur`, which are not explicitly given in the initial state. However, we can assert that:

- `ncur` holds the value `A[-1][0]`, which influences the index used in the `dist` array.
- The value at `dist[2][cur]` is incremented by 1 and assigned to `dist[2][ncur]`.

Assuming `dist[2][cur]` contains some integer value `V`, the new value of `dist[2][ncur]` will be `V + 1`. However, since the original state of `dist` and `cur` is unknown, we can only express the output state in a general manner without specific numeric values.

Since the values of other variables (`N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`) are not altered by this operation, they remain in their original state.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `nx` is -1; `ny` is 0; `ncur` is assigned the value `A[-1][0]; `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
