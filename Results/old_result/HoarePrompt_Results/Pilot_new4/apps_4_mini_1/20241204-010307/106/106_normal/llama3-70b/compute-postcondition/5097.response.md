The assignment `parent[0][ncur] = cur, piece` updates the `parent` array at the position `[0][ncur]` with the values `cur` and `piece`. The value of `ncur` is determined by the expression `A[3 + dx][1 + dy]`, but the specific value of `cur` and `piece` is not provided in the initial state, therefore they remain unspecified. The values of `N`, `x`, and `y` are not directly affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 3, `y` is 1, `nx` is 3 + `dx`, `ny` is 1 + `dy`, `ncur` is A[3 + dx][1 + dy], `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1, parent[0][ncur] is updated with (cur, piece)**.
