Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `queue` contains tuples of (A[nx][ny], 0), (A[nx][ny], 1), and (ncur, 2); `dist[1][ncur]` is updated accordingly; `parent[1][ncur]` holds the corresponding values; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is equal to 2; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, 2)`; `queue` now includes (ncur, 2)**.
