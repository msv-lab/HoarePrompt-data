The code assigns the value of `dist[2][cur] + 1` to `dist[2][ncur]`. Given that `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, this assignment indicates that the previous value of `dist[2][ncur]` will be updated to a value that is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`. The values of `N`, `y`, `A[x][-1]`, `dist[1][ncur]`, `parent[1][ncur]`, `queue`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, and `piece` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is -1, `A[x][-1]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[1][ncur]` has been updated for each valid move, `parent[1][ncur]` has been set for each valid `ncur`, `queue` contains tuples for all valid `ncur` reached from the original position `(x, y)`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the range `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 2, and `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is -1, `A[x][-1]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[1][ncur]` has been updated for each valid move, `parent[1][ncur]` has been set for each valid `ncur`, `queue` contains tuples for all valid `ncur` reached from the original position `(x, y)`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the range `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 2, and `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
