The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. Given the initial values, `x` is 1 and `dx` is 0, so `nx` becomes 1 + 0 = 1. For `ny`, `y` is 2 and `dy` is 1, leading to `ny` becoming 2 + 1 = 3. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 1, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 3**
