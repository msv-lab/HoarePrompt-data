The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the list `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `2` are used directly, but no values of the other variables are changed by this operation. The initial state remains valid after the execution of the code, and the only change is that a new element has been added to the `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is the current y-coordinate, `piece` is equal to 2, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][y + 1]`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`**.
