Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` contains tuples of (ncur, 0), `dist` is initialized for `N` values, `parent` is initialized for `N` values, `piece` is defined before the loop, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the range of 0 to `N` (inclusive of 0 and exclusive of `N`, and `piece` is equal to 1, and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`.***
