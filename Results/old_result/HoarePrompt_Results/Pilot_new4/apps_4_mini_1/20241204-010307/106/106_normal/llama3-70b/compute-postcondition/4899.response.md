The statement `queue.append((ncur, 2))` adds a tuple containing the value of `ncur` and the integer 2 to the list `queue`. It does not change the values of any other variables. 

The initial conditions state that `ncur` has been defined as `A[x + 1][y]`, which represents a specific value based on the contents of the array `A` at the position `(x + 1, y)`. The variable `piece` is also mentioned as updated, but its new value is not specified.

Thus, the output state reflects the addition of the tuple to `queue`, while retaining the original conditions:

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `dist[1]` contains the shortest path distances; `parent[1]` contains the corresponding parent positions; `dx` is 1; `dy` is 0; `nx` is `x + 1`; `ny` is `y`; `ncur` is `A[x + 1][y]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is `cur`; `piece` is updated; `queue` now contains `(ncur, 2)`.**
