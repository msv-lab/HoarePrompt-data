The line of code `nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy` updates the values of `nx` and `ny`. The previous values are as follows: `dx` is -2 and `dy` is 1. Thus, `nx` is updated to `x - 2`, and `ny` is updated to `y + 1`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged since they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, we have:

- `nx` changes from `x - 2` to `x + (-2) = x - 2`
- `ny` changes from `-1` to `-1 + 1 = 0`

All other variables are still valid and retain their original values.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is -1, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is `x - 2`, `ny` is 0**.
