The code assigns the value of `cur` to `parent[0][ncur]` along with `piece`. The values of `ncur` and `piece` are determined by the earlier state of the program. The value of `cur` is also used in this assignment, but its initial state is not defined. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `dist`, and `A` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is 4; `y` is 2; `nx` is equal to `4 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`; both `nx` and `ny` are between 0 and `N-1`; `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur`, `piece`.**
