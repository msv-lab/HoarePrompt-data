Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is equal to `N`; `dist` is updated for valid `ncur` positions; `parent` is updated for valid `ncur` positions; `queue` contains tuples of `(ncur, 0)` for valid positions, and now `queue` contains tuples of `(ncur, 0)` and `(ncur, 1)` for valid positions; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `N + dy`; both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`; `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is equal to 1; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur, piece`.**
