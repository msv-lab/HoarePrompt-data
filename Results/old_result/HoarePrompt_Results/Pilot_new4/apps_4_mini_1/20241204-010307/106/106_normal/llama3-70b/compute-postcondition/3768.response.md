According to the code, the for loop iterates over a predetermined list of tuples representing direction changes `(dx, dy)`. The execution of this loop does not depend on the values of `N`, `x`, or `y`. Since the loop will execute for each tuple in the list, no adjustments are required to the state variables `N`, `x`, and `y` for the loop to iterate.

Thus, the only states relevant to the loop execution are the tuples in the list. The variables `x` and `y` will not affect the iteration process itself, but they might be used within the loop body afterward. 

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `dx` and `dy` will take values from the list of tuples: [(-2, -1), (-2, 1), (-1, -2), (-1, 2), (1, -2), (1, 2), (2, -1), (2, 1)]**
