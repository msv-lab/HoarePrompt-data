According to the code, the loop iterates over the possible movements defined by the pairs in the list `[(dx, dy)]`. Each pair represents a potential change in coordinates `(nx, ny)` that will be calculated based on the current state of `y` and the changes defined by `dx` and `dy`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `y` is between 0 and 8 (inclusive), which means that after applying a movement defined by `dy`, the new value of `ny` will be determined by adding `dy` to the current `y`. 

Since `N` is between 3 and 10, we must ensure that after the loop executes again, the new coordinates `(nx, ny)` still satisfy the conditions `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `ny` remains within the valid range by considering the values of `dy`.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider one movement from the pairs. The value of `y` can change based on `dy`, and `ncur` will depend on what `A[nx][ny]` would yield after the movement. After the loop, `y` will be updated according to `dy`, thus if we take a specific `dy` (for example, the first one which is -1), `y` would become `y - 1`. 

However, we must also check to confirm that `ny` is still valid after applying `dy`. We'll assume the first pair `(-2, -1)` is being considered for the next iteration, so:
- `nx` is calculated with the specific logic of the loop, but since `nx` isn't specified in the previous iteration context, we maintain it as is.
- `ny` would be `y - 1`, hence it needs to remain between 0 and 8, confirming that `y` at least needs to be 1 for this movement to be valid.

Thus, the final state to allow for one more execution of the loop could be such that:
- `N` remains between 3 and 10,
- `y` is between 1 and 8 (since we are considering a potential decrement),
- The new `nx` and `ny` conditions would need to validate within the bounds specified.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is between 1 and 8 (inclusive), `nx` remains valid, and `ny` is between 0 and 7 (inclusive)**.
