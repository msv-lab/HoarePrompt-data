Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, and `y` is between 0 and 8 (inclusive). If `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, then if `piece` is not equal to `i`, `dist[2]` is updated for all reachable `ncur` indices from the initial position, `parent[2]` contains tuples of previous indices, and `queue` contains an additional tuple `(cur, i)`. If there are no valid moves, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initial states.***
