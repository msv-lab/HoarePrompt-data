The assignment `parent[2][ncur] = cur, piece` updates the `parent` array at index `[2][ncur]` to hold a tuple consisting of the current value of `cur` and the value of `piece`, which is equal to 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

The output state reflects that the value of `parent[2][ncur]` has been updated, while all other preconditions are still valid.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is between 0 and N-1, `y` is between 0 and N-1, `dist` is appropriately initialized, `parent` reflects valid parent tuples including `parent[2][ncur]` which is now `(cur, 2)`, `queue` contains valid tuples, `piece` is equal to 2, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur]`.**
