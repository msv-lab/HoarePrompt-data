The code updates the `dist` array at the position `[0][ncur]` by assigning it the value of `dist[0][cur] + 1`. The variables affected by this operation are `dist`, `ncur`, and `cur`. 

- `ncur` is determined by the expression `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is calculated as `x + 2` and `ny` as `y + 1`.
- The values of `dist[0][ncur]` and `dist[0][cur]` will depend on the existing values in the `dist` array.

Since `dist[0][ncur]` is being updated with the value of `dist[0][cur] + 1`, the specific change in the state will reflect this update. However, we do not have specific values for `cur`, `dist`, `A`, `x`, or `y`, so we cannot specify exact numerical outputs.

Therefore, the Output State remains general based on the updated variable and conditions provided:

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `piece` is equal to `0`, `nx` is equal to `x + 2`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
