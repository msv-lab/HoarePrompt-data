Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is the final y-coordinate possibly updated based on valid moves, if `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, then `dist[1][ncur]` has been updated for each valid move, `parent[1][ncur]` has been set for each valid `ncur`, `queue` now contains tuples including `(cur, i)` for the valid moves, and the current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`.***
