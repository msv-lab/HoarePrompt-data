According to the code, the loop iterates over a list of tuples representing the changes in `dx` and `dy`. The loop will execute for each tuple in the list. At the end of the last iteration, `dx` is -2 and `dy` is -1. The next tuple in the list is (-2, 1).

The variable `N` is constrained to be between 3 and 10, and the current values of `nx` and `ny` are given as `nx = x - 2` and `ny = 0`. For the loop to execute again, we need to ensure that the next values of `dx` and `dy` can be taken from the list, which they can, as the next pair is (-2, 1).

Therefore, after the current iteration, we will update `dx` and `dy` to the next values in the loop, which are `dx` as -2 and `dy` as 1. The conditions related to `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` do not need adjustment at this moment since we are only iterating through the tuples.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is 0**
