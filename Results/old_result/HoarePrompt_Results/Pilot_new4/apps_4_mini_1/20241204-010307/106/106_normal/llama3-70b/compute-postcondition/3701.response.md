The code snippet assigns new values to `nx` and `ny` based on the values of `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy`. Here, `nx` is computed as `x + dx` and `ny` as `y + dy`. The previous values of `x` and `y` are known: `x` is 2 and `y` is 0. The values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided, but they will affect the new values of `nx` and `ny`.

Since `nx` is calculated as `2 + dx`, its value depends on the specific value of `dx`. Similarly, `ny` is calculated as `0 + dy`, depending on the specific value of `dy`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, `piece` is 0, and queue includes the next pair of (dx, dy).**
