Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `cur` is a valid index, `ncur` is a valid index after applying (dx, dy), `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` are initialized and ready for updates, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid (0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N).***
