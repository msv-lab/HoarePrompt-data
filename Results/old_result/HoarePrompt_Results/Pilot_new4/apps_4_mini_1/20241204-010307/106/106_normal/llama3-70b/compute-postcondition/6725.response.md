Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is 0, `ny` is 1; if `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `queue` now contains `(ncur, 2)` in addition to its previous contents.***
