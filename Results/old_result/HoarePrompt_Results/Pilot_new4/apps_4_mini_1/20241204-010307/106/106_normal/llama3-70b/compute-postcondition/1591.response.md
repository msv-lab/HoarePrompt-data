The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The other variables and their states remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and indicates the updated state of the `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, `A[nx][ny]` is equal to `ncur`, `dx` and `dy` take values from the list of tuples in each iteration, `piece` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`, `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`.**
