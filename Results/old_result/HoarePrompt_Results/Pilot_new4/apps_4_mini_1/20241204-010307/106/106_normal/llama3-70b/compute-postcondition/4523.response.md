The code updates the variables `nx` and `ny` by adding the values of `dx` and `dy` to `x` and `y`, respectively. The values of `x` and `y` are unchanged in this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the new values of `nx` and `ny` while maintaining the existing conditions for `N`, `y`, `A`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur` positions based on the knight's moves, `parent[1][ncur]` contains tuples of `cur` and `piece` for those valid positions if `piece` is 1, `queue` contains all valid `(ncur, 1)` tuples for all valid knight moves from the starting position, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`.**
