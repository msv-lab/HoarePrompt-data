Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is -1, `A[x][-1]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[1][ncur]` has been updated for each valid move, `parent[1][ncur]` has been set for each valid `ncur`, `queue` contains an additional tuple `(ncur, 2)` if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, with `parent[2][ncur]` set to `cur, piece`; otherwise, the state remains unchanged, `dx` and `dy` must be prepared for the next iteration, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
