The code assigns the value of `cur` to `parent[0][ncur]` with an additional value `piece`. The variables `ncur` and `cur` are relevant here, while `parent` is updated. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, and `dist` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `0 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`.**
