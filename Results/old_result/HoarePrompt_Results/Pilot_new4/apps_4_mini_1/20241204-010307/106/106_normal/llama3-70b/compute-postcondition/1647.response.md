Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and if `piece` is equal to 2 while `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`. If the conditions for the if statement are not met, no changes occur to the variables.***
