Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is an integer; `dist` contains the updated shortest distances for valid indices based on the conditions; `parent` contains the updated parent indices for valid nodes; `queue` contains tuples of valid states for indices where the conditions were met. If the conditions were not satisfied, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initial states.**
