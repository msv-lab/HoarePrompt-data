Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is `x - 2`, and `ny` is 2. If both `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` hold true, then `ncur` is assigned the value `A[x - 2][2]`. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
