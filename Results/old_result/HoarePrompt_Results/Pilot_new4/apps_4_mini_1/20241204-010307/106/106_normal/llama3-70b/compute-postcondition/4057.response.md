Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `dx` is -1; `dy` is -2; `nx` is -1; `ny` is -1; if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[-1][-1]`. If `piece` equals 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `piece`, and `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`; otherwise, there are no changes to the state of the variables.***
