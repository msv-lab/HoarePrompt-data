Postcondition: ***`piece` is 1, `(dx, dy)` is (0, -1), `nx` is `x`, `ny` is `y - 1`, and if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is `A[x][y - 1]`. If `piece` equals 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `piece`, and the tuple `(ncur, 2)` is appended to `queue`. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
