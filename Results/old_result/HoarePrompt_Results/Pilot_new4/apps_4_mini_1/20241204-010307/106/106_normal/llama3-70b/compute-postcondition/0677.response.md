The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` and `ny` are within the defined bounds based on their conditions. The current state of `nx` and `ny` is valid and satisfies the constraints `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`. The values of other variables `N`, `y`, `x`, `nx`, and `ny` are not changed by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: 

`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is either `x-1`, `x+1`, or `x`, `ny` is either `1`, `0`, or `2`, and `ncur = A[nx][ny]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is either `x-1`, `x+1`, or `x`, `ny` is either `1`, `0`, or `2`, and `ncur = A[nx][ny]`.**
