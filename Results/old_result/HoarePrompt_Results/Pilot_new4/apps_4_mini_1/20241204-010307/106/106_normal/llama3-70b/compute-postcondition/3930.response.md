The code assigns two values to the `parent` array at the indices `[2][ncur]`. The value `cur` is referenced but not defined in the initial state, so we don't know its value. However, `ncur` has been assigned the value of `A[2][3]`, which is not specified either. Therefore, we can say that `parent[2][ncur]` is updated with the value of `cur`, which is unknown, and `piece`, which is also not defined in the initial state.

The other variables remain unchanged, so the output state will reflect the updates made.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 1, `nx` is 2, `ny` is 3, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[2][3]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is updated with `cur` and `piece`.**
