The statement `dist[0][ncur] = dist[0][cur] + 1` updates the value of `dist[0][ncur]` based on the current value of `dist[0][cur]`. The variable `cur` is set to 1 for the next iteration. Therefore, `dist[0][ncur]` will be assigned the value of `dist[0][1] + 1`.

Since `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 2][y + 1]`, the specific value of `ncur` depends on the values of `x` and `y`, which are not explicitly defined in the given information. However, the preconditions that remain valid after execution include the bounds for `N`, the value of `piece`, and the initial settings for `cur`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, `piece` is 0, `cur` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 2][y + 1]`, and `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][1] + 1`.**
