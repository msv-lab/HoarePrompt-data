The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to the 2D list `parent` at the position `[0][ncur]`. While the other variables remain unchanged, the variable `parent[0][ncur]` is updated.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `piece`.**
