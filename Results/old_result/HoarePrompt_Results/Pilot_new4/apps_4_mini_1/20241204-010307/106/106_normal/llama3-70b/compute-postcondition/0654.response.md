The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The previous values of the variables are not affected, but the `queue` will now include a new entry. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect that the `queue` has been updated.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `dist[0][ncur]` is valid, `parent[0][ncur]` is valid, `queue` contains valid `(ncur, 0)` entries and now includes `(ncur, 1)`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` satisfy the conditions `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, `ncur = A[nx][ny]`, and `piece` is equal to 1; `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`**.
