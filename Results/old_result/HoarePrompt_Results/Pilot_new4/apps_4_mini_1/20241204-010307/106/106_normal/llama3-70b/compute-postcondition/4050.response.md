According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `dx` and `dy`, which are being iterated through the predefined list of tuples. The loop will attempt to execute for each tuple in the list.

At the end of the last iteration, `dx` is -2 and `dy` is 1, which corresponds to the second tuple in the list. The next tuple in the iteration will be (-1, -2). 

The loop will execute again as long as there are more tuples in the list. After processing the tuple (-1, -2), the next values for `dx` and `dy` will be set to the next tuple in the list.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `dx` is -1; `dy` is -2; `nx` is -1; `ny` is -1.**
