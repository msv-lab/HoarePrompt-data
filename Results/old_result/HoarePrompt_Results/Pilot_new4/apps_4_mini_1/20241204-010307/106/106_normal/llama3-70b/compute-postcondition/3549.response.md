The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and the second element `1` are added to the `queue`, but the states of the other variables remain unchanged. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `dist[1][ncur]`, and `parent[1][ncur]` are still valid after the execution. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is within `0` and `N-1`, `y` is within `0` and `N-1`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is `y + 1`, `ncur` is `A[x - 1][y + 1]`, `dist[1][ncur]` has been updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` has an additional element `(ncur, 1)`.**
