The values of `nx` and `ny` are updated based on the values of `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy`. The initial values are `x = 2` and `y = 0`. The values of `dx` and `dy` have not been specified, but they are assumed to be part of the previously defined tuple (-1, 0). Therefore, `dx` is -1 and `dy` is 0.

Calculating the new values:
- `nx = x + dx = 2 + (-1) = 1`
- `ny = y + dy = 0 + 0 = 0`

The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 0, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged, `A[2][0]` remains equal to `cur`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
