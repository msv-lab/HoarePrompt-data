The code snippet assigns new values to `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. The variables `dx` and `dy` are given specific values of -1 and 1, respectively. Since `y` is 0, the new values can be calculated directly.

The updated variables will be:
- `nx` is assigned the value `x - 1` (since `dx` is -1).
- `ny` is assigned the value `y + 1` (since `dy` is 1).

The values of `N`, `dist`, `parent[1][ncur]`, and `piece` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `dist` indicates at least one reachable position, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `piece` is equal to 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `0 + 1`.**
