According to the code, the loop iterates over a list of tuples representing directional changes (`dx`, `dy`). The loop will execute for each tuple in that list, and for the next iteration, `dx` and `dy` will be assigned the next values from the list.

At the end of the last iteration, the following states are known:
- `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`
- `y` is 1
- `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`
- `dx` is -2
- `dy` is -1
- `nx` is `x - 2`
- `ny` is 0

The loop iterates through the specified tuples, and after processing the tuple `(-2, -1)`, it will move to the next tuple in the list. The next tuple for `dx` and `dy` will be `(-2, 1)`. 

No changes are made to `N`, `y`, `x`, `nx`, or `ny` during the loop iteration itself; the adjustments will be reflected in the values of `dx` and `dy` for the next iteration.

Thus, at the beginning of the next iteration of the loop, the values of `dx` and `dy` need to be updated while other parameters will remain the same.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is `x - 2`, and `ny` is 0**
