According to the code, the loop iterates over the list of tuples `[(dx, dy) for each valid direction]`. Each iteration corresponds to a different direction in which `dx` and `dy` will take values of either -1 or 1.

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `dx` and `dy` have been set to the values from the previous tuple being processed. Since the loop is set to iterate over four tuples, and assuming the loop has not yet executed for all tuples, we can determine the current index of the tuple being processed.

If we assume that `dx` and `dy` were last set to the values of the last tuple in the list, then for the loop to execute one more time, the next tuple in the list should be selected.

Given that there are four tuples, if `dx` and `dy` correspond to the last tuple processed, we need to adjust the state accordingly:
- If the last processed tuple was `(-1, 1)`, then the next tuple would be `(1, -1)`.
- The loop will not continue if all tuples have been processed.

Thus, assuming the last processed tuple was `(-1, 1)`, and now we need to prepare for the next iteration with `(1, -1)`.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is within the range `[0, N-1]`, `ny` is within the range `[0, N-1]`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur` reachable from `(x, y)`, `parent[0][ncur]` is established for those reachable positions, and `queue` contains tuples `(ncur, 0)` for each valid `ncur` that met the conditions, `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is now equal to `cur, piece`, and `queue` includes `(ncur, 1)` as a new entry, `dx` is 1, `dy` is -1**
