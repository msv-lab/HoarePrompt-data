Postcondition: ***`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is between 0 and N-1, `y` is between 0 and N-1, if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and if `piece` equals 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`. The values of `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` remain unchanged, with `piece` being greater than 0.***
