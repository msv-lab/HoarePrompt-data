The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[0][ncur]`. The previous values of `parent[0][ncur]` are overwritten, but the values of `N`, `y`, `x`, `nx`, `ny`, `A[x][y]`, `ncur`, `piece`, and `dist[0][ncur]` remain unchanged. The most significant change is in the `parent` array.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 0; `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`; `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is 0; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`.**
