The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned values based on the current values of `x`, `y`, and the variables `dx` and `dy`. However, the values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided in the initial state. Assuming they have undefined values, the calculations for `nx` and `ny` cannot be completed as their resulting values depend on these undefined variables. Since the loop will not execute again if the indices are invalid and we have no information on `dx` and `dy`, we cannot determine the new values for `nx` and `ny`.

Thus, the output state reflects that `nx` and `ny` remain unchanged due to the lack of information about `dx` and `dy`. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `piece` is 1, `nx` is 1, `ny` is -1 (invalid)**.
