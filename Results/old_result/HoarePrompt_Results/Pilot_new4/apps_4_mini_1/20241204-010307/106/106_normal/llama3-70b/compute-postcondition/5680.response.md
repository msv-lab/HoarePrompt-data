According to the code, the for loop iterates over a list of directional changes defined by the tuples `(-1, 0)`, `(1, 0)`, `(0, -1)`, and `(0, 1)`. This means that the loop will execute a total of 4 times, once for each tuple. 

At the end of the last iteration, the values of `dx` and `dy` correspond to the last tuple in the list, which is `(0, 1)`. In order for the loop to execute one more time, it must start again from the first tuple in the list when the loop resets.

Given that `N` is between 3 and 10 and there are no restrictions on the values of `dx` and `dy` for the next iteration beyond those represented by the tuples, the state needs to reflect that the loop is starting from the first tuple again after completing all possible iterations.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0**
