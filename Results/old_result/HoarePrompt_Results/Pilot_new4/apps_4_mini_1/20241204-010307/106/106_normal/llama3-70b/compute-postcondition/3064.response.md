The code `queue.append((cur, i))` adds a new tuple `(cur, i)` to the `queue`. The values of `cur` and `i` are assumed to be defined in the context of the program, but are not provided in the initial state. The addition to the `queue` does not affect the values of `N`, `y`, `piece`, `dist`, or `parent`. Therefore, the output will reflect the unchanged values of these variables along with the updated `queue` which now includes the new tuple.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `piece` is 2, `piece` is not equal to `i`, `dist[2]` is updated based on the shortest distances from the starting position, `parent[2]` reflects the predecessors for each reachable position as per the updates, `queue` now contains the previous tuples plus the new tuple `(cur, i)`**.
