Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `dist` reflects the updated shortest path distances for all valid reachable `ncur` positions derived from the initial position `cur`, based on the conditions of the loop; `parent` stores the corresponding previous positions and piece types for those reachable `ncur`; `queue` contains all reachable tuples derived from the iterations, including tuples for each updated `ncur` based on the piece type conditions, and if `piece` is not equal to `i`, the tuple `(cur, i)` is also included.**
