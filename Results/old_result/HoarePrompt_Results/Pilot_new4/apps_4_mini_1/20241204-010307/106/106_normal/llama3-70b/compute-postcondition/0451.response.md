The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[0][ncur]`. The values of `parent[0][ncur]` are now updated, but the states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, the value of `piece` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, keeping `dist[0][ncur]` greater than `dist[0][cur]`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is now equal to `cur` and `piece`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, the value of `piece` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, keeping `dist[0][ncur]` greater than `dist[0][cur]`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`.**
