In the given loop, the variables `dx` and `dy` will take on the values from the list `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]` one at a time during each iteration. The loop will execute for each pair of `dx` and `dy`.

At the end of the last iteration, the states of the variables were:
- `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`
- `y` is `2 or 3`
- `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`
- `nx` is equal to `x + dx`
- `ny` is equal to `y + dy`
- If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and if `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is set to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `queue` now contains `(ncur, 2)`.

The loop iterates over four pairs of `(dx, dy)`. Since we need to determine the next state at the beginning of the for loop and consider the number of iterations that have been completed:

- If the loop has completed the iterations for `(-1, 0)`, `(1, 0)`, and `(0, -1)`, then the current state is at the start of the last iteration for `(0, 1)`.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time after the current iteration for `(0, 1)`, we need to ensure that the loop can still be executed, meaning there would be no more pairs left to iterate over after this current iteration. 

Since the last pair is `(0, 1)`, this will be the 4th iteration, and after this iteration, there will be no more pairs left. Therefore, the states will remain as follows:

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is `2 or 3`, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is equal to `x + 0`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1`**
