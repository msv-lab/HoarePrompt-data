Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is `0 + dx`, `ny` is `0 + dy`, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur` reachable from `(x, y)`, `parent[0][ncur]` is established for those reachable positions, `queue` contains tuples `(ncur, 0)` for each valid `ncur` that met the conditions. The current value of `nx` is within the range `[0, N-1]` and the current value of `ny` is within the range `[0, N-1]`.***
