The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. However, the values of `dx` and `dy` are not applicable (undefined) in the current context. The values of `nx` and `ny` depend on `dx` and `dy`, which leads to uncertainty about their exact values after execution. 

Since `dx` and `dy` do not contribute any values, we cannot determine specific values for `nx` and `ny`. Therefore, we keep the initial state of the other variable information intact.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is between 0 and N-1, `y` is between 1 and N-1, `nx` is undefined, `ny` is undefined.**
