Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dist[1]` remains unchanged, `parent[1]` remains unchanged, `queue` contains all the tuples of positions that were valid and explored during the loop execution, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to the minimum distance from `(x, y)` considering all valid knight's moves, `parent[2][ncur]` contains the updated parent positions for each reachable position based on the knight's moves. Additionally, `piece` is not equal to `i`. If the loop did not execute, `dist[1]` and `parent[1]` remain unchanged.***
