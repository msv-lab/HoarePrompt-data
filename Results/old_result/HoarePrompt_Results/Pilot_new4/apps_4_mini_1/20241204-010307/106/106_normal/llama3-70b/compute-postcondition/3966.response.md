The variable `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`. Given the initial state, `nx` is -2 and `ny` is -1. This means we are accessing the array `A` at the indices `-2` and `-1`. In Python, negative indices refer to elements counted from the end of the list, but since we don't have the actual values of `A`, we cannot determine the exact value of `ncur`. However, we can state that `ncur` will be equal to `A[-2][-1]`.

The other variables are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is -2, `ny` is -1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `ncur` is equal to `A[-2][-1]**.
