Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `1 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, `dist` is initialized for all valid positions, `parent` is initialized for all valid positions, `queue` is initialized to contain reachable positions from (1, 0). The current values satisfy the condition that both `nx` and `ny` are within the valid range, meaning `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`.***
