Postcondition: ***If `N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 3, `y` is 0, and `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then if `piece` equals 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is updated to `(cur, piece)`, `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`, and `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`. Otherwise, there is no change to the state of the variables.***
