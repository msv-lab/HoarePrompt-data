The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of the element at the specified position in the 2D array `A`, which is determined by the indexes `nx` and `ny`. The values of `nx` and `ny` depend on the values of `x`, `dx`, `N`, and `dy`. 

- Since `y` is equal to `N`, `ny` will be `N + dy`, where `dy` is the change in the y-coordinate.
- The value `nx` is given as `x + dx`, where `dx` is the change in the x-coordinate.
- The value of `ncur` will thus be `A[x + dx][N + dy]`.

The states of the other variables (`dist`, `parent`, and `queue`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State will reflect the assignment to `ncur`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is equal to `N`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `N + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x + dx][N + dy]`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged.**
