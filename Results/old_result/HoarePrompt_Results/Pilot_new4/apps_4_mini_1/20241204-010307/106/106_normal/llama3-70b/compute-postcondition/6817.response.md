The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to the element in the `parent` array at the index `[2][ncur]`. Since `ncur` is equal to `A[1][3]`, the specific value assigned to `parent[2][ncur]` is now determined by the values of `cur` and `piece`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 1, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 3, `ncur` is equal to `A[1][3]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`.**
