The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, which is determined by the values of `nx` and `ny`. Given that `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, and `ny` is equal to `N + 1`, the new value of `ncur` will depend on these specific expressions. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 3 and 10, `y` is equal to `N`, `x` is a valid integer within bounds, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `N + 1`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[x + dx][N + 1`.**
