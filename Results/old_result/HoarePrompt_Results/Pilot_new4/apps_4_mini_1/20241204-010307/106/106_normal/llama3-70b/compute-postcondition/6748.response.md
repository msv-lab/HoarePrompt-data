The code appends the tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The previous state of the variables is maintained, and only the `queue` variable is updated. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `dist`, `parent`, and `piece` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `dist[1]` contains updated distances for valid positions reachable from (1, 1), `parent[1]` contains predecessors for valid positions reachable from (1, 1), `piece` is equal to 0, `parent[0][ncur]` is now equal to `(cur, 0)`, `queue` now contains the previous tuples plus the tuple `(ncur, 0)`**.
