The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. Given the initial values, `x` is 0, `dx` is -1, `y` is 1, and `dy` is -1. 

Calculating:
- `nx = 0 + (-1) = -1`
- `ny = 1 + (-1) = 0`

The states of other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: 
`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is -1, `ny` is 0, `ncur` may have been updated for valid `(nx, ny)` pairs, `dist[0]` may contain updated distances for valid `ncur` values, `parent[0]` may store corresponding parents for those `ncur` values, `queue` may contain tuples of updated `(ncur, 0)` for valid transitions.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is -1, `ny` is 0, `ncur` may have been updated for valid `(nx, ny)` pairs, `dist[0]` may contain updated distances for valid `ncur` values, `parent[0]` may store corresponding parents for those `ncur` values, `queue` may contain tuples of updated `(ncur, 0)` for valid transitions.**
