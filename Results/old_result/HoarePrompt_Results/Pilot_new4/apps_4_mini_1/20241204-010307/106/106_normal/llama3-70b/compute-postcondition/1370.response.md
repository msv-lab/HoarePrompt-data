The code `queue.append((ncur, 1))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The preconditions remain valid, and the value of `ncur` is already established from previous calculations. The `queue` variable will now contain the new tuple. 

Since no other variables are affected or changed by this line of code, the output state reflects the update to the `queue` while maintaining the values of the other variables.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 2; `y` is 0; `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`; `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`.**
