The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are determined by `nx = 4 + dx` and `ny = 2 + dy`. Since `dx` and `dy` are constants that cannot be adjusted further, `nx` and `ny` will have specific values depending on `dx` and `dy`. The initial state of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, and `ny` remains unchanged except for the assignment of `ncur`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is at least 6, `x` is 4, `y` is 2, `nx` is equal to `4 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.

Output State: **`N` is at least 6, `x` is 4, `y` is 2, `nx` is equal to `4 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
