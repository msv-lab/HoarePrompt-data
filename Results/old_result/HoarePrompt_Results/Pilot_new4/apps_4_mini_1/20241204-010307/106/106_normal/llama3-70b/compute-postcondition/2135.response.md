Postcondition: ***`dist` contains valid distances for reachable indices, `parent[0][ncur]` initialized for valid `ncur`, `piece` is 0, `queue` contains at least one tuple (ncur, 0), `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and the values of `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds such that 0 is less than or equal to `nx` and `ny` and both are less than N.***
