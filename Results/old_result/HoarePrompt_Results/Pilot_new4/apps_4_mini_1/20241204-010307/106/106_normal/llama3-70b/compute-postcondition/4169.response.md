Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 1, `dx` is 1, `dy` is -1, `ncur` is `A[1][1]`. If `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur` and `piece`, and the tuple (`ncur`, 1) is appended to `queue`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
