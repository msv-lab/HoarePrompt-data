The code assigns the values of `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x`, `y`, and the lists `dx` and `dy`. The variable `x` is currently `0`, so `nx` will be calculated as `0 + dx` and `ny` as `0 + dy`. The exact values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided, but we can express `nx` and `ny` in terms of those variables.

The states of the other variables remain unaffected by this code.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur`, `parent[1][ncur]` is established for those reachable positions, `queue` contains tuples `(ncur, 1)` for each valid `ncur` that met the conditions, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`.**
