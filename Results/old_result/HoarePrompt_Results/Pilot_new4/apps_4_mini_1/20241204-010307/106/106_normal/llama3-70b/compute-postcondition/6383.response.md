The code updates the value of `dist[2][ncur]` by setting it to `dist[2][cur] + 1`. The previous values of `dist[2][ncur]` and `dist[2][cur]` are not explicitly stated, but we know that `dist[2][cur]` exists and is part of the array. The value of `dist[2][ncur]` is updated based on the value of `dist[2][cur]`. 

As a result, the state of the variables is modified as follows:
- `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.

The other variables remain unchanged, and we maintain all valid conditions from the initial state.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dist[0]` remains unchanged, `parent[0]` remains unchanged, `queue` contains at least one tuple of (ncur, 1), `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
