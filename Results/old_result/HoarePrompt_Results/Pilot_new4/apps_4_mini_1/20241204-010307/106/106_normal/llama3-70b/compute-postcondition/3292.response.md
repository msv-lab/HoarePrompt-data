The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. Given that `x` is 0, `dx` is 1, `y` is 1, and `dy` is 1, we can calculate:

- `nx = 0 + 1 = 1`
- `ny = 1 + 1 = 2`

The values of `N`, `dist[1][ncur]`, `dist[1][cur]`, `parent[1][ncur]`, and `queue` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the output state is: 
`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `nx` is 1; `ny` is 2; `dx` is 1; `dy` is 1; `dist[1][ncur]` and `dist[1][cur]` remain unchanged; `parent[1][ncur]` and `queue` are unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `nx` is 1; `ny` is 2; `dx` is 1; `dy` is 1; `dist[1][ncur]` and `dist[1][cur]` remain unchanged; `parent[1][ncur]` and `queue` are unchanged.**
