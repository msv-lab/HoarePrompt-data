Postcondition: ***`dist`, `parent`, and `queue` are unchanged; if `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, then `dist[1]` contains the shortest distances from the initial position to each reachable position, `parent[1]` contains the parent positions used to reach each position, `queue` contains all reachable positions that were updated during the execution of the loop along with the position `(cur, i)` appended to it; if `piece` is equal to 2, then `dist[2]` contains the shortest distances to the positions reachable from the starting position, and `parent[2]` contains the parent positions used to reach those positions, with the current value of `piece` not equal to `i`.***
