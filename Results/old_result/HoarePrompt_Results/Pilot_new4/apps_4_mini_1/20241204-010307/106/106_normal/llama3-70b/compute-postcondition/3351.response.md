The code `nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy` updates the values of `nx` and `ny`. Since the initial state specifies that `x` is `0` and `y` is `2`, the calculation will be based on these values. The values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided, so we denote them as their respective unknowns.

- `nx` becomes `0 + dx`, which is equal to `dx`.
- `ny` becomes `2 + dy`, which is equal to `2 + dy`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `cur` is unchanged, `dist[1]` remains unchanged, `parent[1]` remains unchanged, `piece` is equal to 0, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to the minimum distance from `(0, 2)`, `parent[2][ncur]` contains the updated parent positions, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`**.
