The code assigns the values of `nx` and `ny` based on the calculations `x + dx` and `y + dy`, where `dx` is `-1` and `dy` is `-1`. This means `nx` will be `x - 1` and `ny` will be `y - 1`. The values of `N`, `y`, `A`, `cur`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged. The states of these variables do not change, but we now have specific values for `nx` and `ny`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `x + dx` is within the bounds of `A`, `y + dy` is within the bounds of `A`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[0][ncur]` contains the minimum distance from `cur` to each reachable position `ncur`, `parent[0][ncur]` represents the previous position leading to `ncur`, `queue` contains reachable positions which can be updated, `queue` must not be empty, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y - 1`, `(dx, dy)` is `(-1, -1)` for the next iteration.**
