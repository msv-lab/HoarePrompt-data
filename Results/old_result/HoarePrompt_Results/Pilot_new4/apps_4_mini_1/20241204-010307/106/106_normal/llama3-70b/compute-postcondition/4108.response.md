The code assigns the value `cur` and `piece` to `parent[2][ncur]`. The values of `ncur` and `parent` have been affected, while the other variables remain unchanged. The previous state of `ncur` is based on the value of `A[nx][ny]`, and `parent[2][ncur]` now references the combination of `cur` and `piece`. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `nx` is `dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is `cur`, `piece`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `nx` is `dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is `cur`, `piece`.**
