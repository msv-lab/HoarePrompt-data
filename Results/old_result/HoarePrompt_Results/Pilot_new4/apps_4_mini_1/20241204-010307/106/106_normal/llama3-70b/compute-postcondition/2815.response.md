Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `piece` is equal to `0`, `dist[2]` holds the shortest distances, `parent[2]` indicates the predecessors, `queue` holds the relevant tuples including (ncur, 0), `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `N` is greater than `y + 1`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of `0` and `N`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, if `piece` is `0` and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1` and `parent[0][ncur]` is updated to `(cur, piece)`. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
