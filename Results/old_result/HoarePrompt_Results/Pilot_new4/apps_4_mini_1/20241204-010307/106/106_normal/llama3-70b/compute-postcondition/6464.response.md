Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is 0, `ny` is 2, `ncur` is `A[0][2]`, if `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` now also contains `(ncur, 2)`. The variables `dist[1]` and `parent[1]` remain unchanged and reflect the shortest distance and current parent node relevant to the moves, respectively.***
