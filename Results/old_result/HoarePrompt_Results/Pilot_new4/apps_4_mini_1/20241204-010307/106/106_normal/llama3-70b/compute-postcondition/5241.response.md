According to the code, the loop iterates over the list of directions defined by `dx` and `dy`. Since the loop is structured to go through four different directions, it will execute once for each direction in the list. At the end of the last iteration, `dx` and `dy` corresponded to one of the directions from the list.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider that the loop will proceed to the next direction in the list. Given that there are four directions, once the loop has executed for all of them, `dx` and `dy` will update accordingly.

If the loop has completed the iteration for the last direction `(0, 1)`, then at the start of the next iteration:
- The next direction to be used will be `(-1, 0)` (if considering a wrap-around, otherwise it would not execute again as the loop would have ended).

Since the loop iterates through the range of the list containing the directions, the first direction will not change, and the loop will iterate for each direction sequentially.

However, if we are at the final direction `(0, 1)`, the loop would be set to start from the first again only if it were a circular loop; otherwise, it would end.

Given the explanation of the states:
- The current `dx` and `dy` need to be updated to the next pair from the list.

Thus, if the last iteration was on `(0, 1)`, then the next iteration will begin with the first direction in sequence.

State: **`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is between 0 and `N-1`; `y` is between 1 and `N-1`; `nx` is `x + dx`; `ny` is `y + dy`; `ncur` is the value at `A[nx][ny]`; `dx` and `dy` are `(-1, 0)` for the next iteration.**
