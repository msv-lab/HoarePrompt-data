The value of `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is equal to `x - 2` and `ny` is -1. Since `nx` is confirmed to be within the ranges of 0 and N-1 and `ny` is specified to be -1, we can infer that `A[nx][ny]` is being accessed with `ny` as -1. This implies that `ncur` will be derived from the first column of array `A` but may lead to an index out of bounds if not handled properly, depending on the dimensions of the array `A`. However, we do not have specific values for `A`, `x`, or `cur`, so we cannot provide a specific value for `ncur`.

Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is now -1, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is -1, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][-1]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is now -1, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is -1, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][-1]`.**
