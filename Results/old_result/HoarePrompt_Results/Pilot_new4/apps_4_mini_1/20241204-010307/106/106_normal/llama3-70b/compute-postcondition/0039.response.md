According to the code, the for loop iterates over the list of tuples representing the knight's possible movements in the chessboard. The loop will execute regardless of the state of the variables `N`, `piece`, `cur`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue`, since the loop is iterating over a fixed list. 

However, for the loop body to execute meaningfully, it's important to note the context that will be applied within the loop. The states of `dx` and `dy` will be set to each of the pairs defined in the list `[(−1, −1), (−1, 1), (1, −1), (1, 1)]` during each iteration. Therefore, no state adjustments are needed specifically for the loop to execute, as the loop will always iterate four times.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= `N` <= 10, `piece` is 0, `cur` is 1, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur`, `parent[0][ncur]` holds corresponding values, `queue` contains reachable `ncur` values**
