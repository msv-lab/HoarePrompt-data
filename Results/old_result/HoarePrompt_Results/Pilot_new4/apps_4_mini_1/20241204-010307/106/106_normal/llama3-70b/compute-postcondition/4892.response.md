Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `dist[1]` contains the shortest path distances; `parent[1]` contains the corresponding parent positions. If `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `queue` contains valid `(ncur, 1)` positions along with `(ncur, 2)`; `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`; otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
