Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `4 <= N <= 11`, `y` is equal to `N`, `A` is a valid two-dimensional array, `cur` is a valid position in `A`, `dist[1]` and `parent[1]` may remain unchanged, `queue` contains valid positions corresponding to updates made during the loop iterations, `dist[2]` contains the updated distances from `cur` for all reachable positions where valid moves occurred, and `parent[2]` contains the corresponding parent states for those positions. If no valid moves were possible, `dist[2]` and `parent[2]` remain unchanged from their initial states, and `queue` is empty.**
