Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 2; `y` is 0; `piece` is 2; `dist` is initialized to valid distances; `parent` is initialized to track valid paths; `queue` contains at least one valid `(ncur, 1)` pair; `nx` is `2 + dx`; `ny` is `0 + dy`; `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`; and the distance `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`.***
