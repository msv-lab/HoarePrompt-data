According to the code, the for loop will execute for each tuple `(dx, dy)` in the list `[(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]`. The loop iterates through these tuples, and since there are 4 tuples, the loop will run 4 times.

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `dx` is -1 and `dy` is 1, indicating that the last tuple processed was `(-1, 1)`. After processing this tuple, the values of `dx` and `dy` will need to be updated to the next pair in the list for the loop to continue executing.

Since the loop has completed executing the last tuple in the list, we can adjust `dx` and `dy` for the next iteration. The next pair in the list after `(-1, 1)` would be `(1, -1)`.

Thus, the state must be adjusted to reflect that the next values of `dx` and `dy` are `1` and `-1`, respectively. The other variables (`N`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `piece`, `dist`, `parent`, `queue`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop iteration.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is between 0 and 8 (inclusive), `dx` is 1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, and `ny` is equal to `y + 1`**
