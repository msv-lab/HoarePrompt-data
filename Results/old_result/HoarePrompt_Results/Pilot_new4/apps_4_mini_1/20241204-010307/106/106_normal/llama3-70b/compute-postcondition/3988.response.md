The code snippet appends a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `1` remain unchanged, and the other variables are unaffected. Therefore, the state of the variables does not change except for the addition to the `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 0; `y` is 0; `dx` is 1; `dy` is 1; `nx` is 1; `ny` is 1; `ncur` is equal to `A[1][1]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`; `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`.**
