The variables `dx` and `dy` are not defined in the initial state, so we cannot ascertain their values. Therefore, the assigned values of `nx` and `ny` will depend on the values of `dx` and `dy`. The current values of `x` and `y` are 4 and 1 respectively. Hence, `nx` will be `4 + dx` and `ny` will be `1 + dy`. 

Since we can't determine the final values of `nx` and `ny` without the definitions of `dx` and `dy`, the output state will reflect the dependency on `dx` and `dy`. 

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 1, `piece` is 2, `nx` is equal to `4 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`.**
