According to the code, the loop iterates over the four possible directions represented by `(dx, dy)`. At the end of the last iteration, `piece` is 1, and the current direction is `(dx, dy)`, which is (1, 0) in this case. 

The loop iterates through the directions in the list `[(dx, dy)]` in the order of `(-1, 0)`, `(1, 0)`, `(0, -1)`, and `(0, 1)`. Since the last iteration used `(1, 0)`, the next direction to use in the loop is `(0, -1)`.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider that the variable `piece` remains the same (it is still 1), and we need to be aware of the bounds for calculating the new coordinates `nx` and `ny` based on the next direction `(0, -1)`.

Thus, after modifying for the next iteration:
- `piece` remains 1.
- The direction will change to `(0, -1)`.
- The new coordinates are calculated as `nx = x` (no change in x) and `ny = y - 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that the bounds check is satisfied, which states that `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`. The value of `ny` must be valid, meaning it must be non-negative and less than `N`.

State: **`piece` is 1, `(dx, dy)` is (0, -1), `nx` is `x`, `ny` is `y - 1`, and if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is `A[x][y - 1]`.**
