The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. Given that `x` is `0`, `y` is `0`, `nx` is equal to `0 + dx'`, and `ny` is equal to `0 + dy'`, the values of `nx` and `ny` will now be equal to `dx` and `dy`, respectively. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`**
