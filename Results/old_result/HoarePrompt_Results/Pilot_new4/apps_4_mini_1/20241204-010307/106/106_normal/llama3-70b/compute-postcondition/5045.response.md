The operation `dist[1][ncur] = dist[1][cur] + 1` assigns a new value to `dist[1][ncur]`, specifically the value that is currently at `dist[1][cur]` incremented by 1. The values of `dist[1][cur]` and `ncur` are not explicitly defined in the initial state, but we know that `dist[1][ncur]` will now be greater than its previous value.

The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged, but we can describe the updated value of `dist[1][ncur]`. 

Output State: **If N is between 4 and 10, `x` is 3, `y` is 0, `0 <= nx < N`, `nx` is 2, `ny` is -1, `piece` is 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[2][-1]`, `queue` contains (None, 1)**.
