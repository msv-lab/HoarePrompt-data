The `queue` variable is updated by appending a tuple containing `ncur` and `1`. The previous states of the other variables remain unchanged. The overall conditions and values in the output state reflect the change in the `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `nx` is between 0 and N-1, `ny` is between 0 and N-1, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `cur` is defined, `piece` is 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is now `(cur, piece)`, `queue` now contains `(ncur, 1)` appended to it.**
