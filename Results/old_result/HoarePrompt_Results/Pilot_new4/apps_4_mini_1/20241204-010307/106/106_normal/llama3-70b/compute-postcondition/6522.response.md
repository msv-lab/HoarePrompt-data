In the provided code snippet, the line `queue.append((ncur, 1))` appends a new tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the list `queue`. The value of `ncur` is derived from the initial state and remains unchanged by the operation of appending to the queue.

Since appending to the queue does not alter any other variables, the output state will include all the relevant details of the precondition that are still valid, including the updated value of `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 0 and `N-1`, `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is `y + 1`, `ncur` is `A[x + 1][y + 1]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[0]` reflects the parent nodes relevant to valid moves, `queue` includes the previous tuples plus the newly added tuple `(ncur, 1)`, `piece` is 1, the next `(dx, dy)` pair being processed is `(1, 1)`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`**.
