Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 1; `nx` is `x - 1`; `ny` is 2; `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][2]`; `cur` is defined; `piece` is 1. If `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `parent[1][ncur]` is set to (cur, 1) and `queue` now contains the tuple (ncur, 1).***
