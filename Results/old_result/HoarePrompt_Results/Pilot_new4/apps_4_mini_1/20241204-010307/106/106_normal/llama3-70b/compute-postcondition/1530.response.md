The values of `dx` and `dy` are both -1, which means `nx` and `ny` will be calculated by subtracting 1 from `x` and `y`, respectively. Given that `x` is 2 and `y` is also 2, the new values will be:

- `nx = x + dx = 2 + (-1) = 1`
- `ny = y + dy = 2 + (-1) = 1`

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 2, `y` is 2; `A[x][y]` is defined; `cur` has a valid value; `dist[0]` is updated for each valid `ncur`; `parent[0]` is updated for each corresponding `ncur`; `queue` contains tuples of all valid `ncur` values with the associated piece 0; `dx` is -1; `dy` is -1; `nx` is 1; `ny` is 1.
