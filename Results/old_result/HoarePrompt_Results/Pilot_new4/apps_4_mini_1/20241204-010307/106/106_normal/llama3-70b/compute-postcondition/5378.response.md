The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. This action modifies the `queue` variable by adding an additional entry. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `piece`, `dist`, `parent`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` remain unchanged based on the information given in the initial state.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 1, `piece` is 1, `dist[0][ncur]` contains valid distances for at least one move, `parent[0][ncur]` contains valid path information, `queue` now includes an additional tuple `(ncur, 1)`, `nx` is equal to `4 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of 0 and N (inclusive of 0 and exclusive of N), `ncur = A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`**.
