The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The values of `dist`, `parent`, `piece`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` remain unchanged. The variable `queue` is modified to include the new tuple.

Output State: **`dist[1]` contains the shortest distances based on valid moves, `parent[1]` indicates the relationship for each reachable position, `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`, `piece` is set to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `parent[2][ncur]` is updated to `cur, piece`.**
