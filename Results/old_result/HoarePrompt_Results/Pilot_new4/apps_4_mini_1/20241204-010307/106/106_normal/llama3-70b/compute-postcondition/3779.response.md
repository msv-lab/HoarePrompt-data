To determine the output state after executing the provided code, we first analyze the impact of the code on the existing variables: `nx` and `ny`.

1. The variables `nx` and `ny` are being assigned new values based on the existing values of `x` and `y`, along with the changes `dx` and `dy` from the next tuple `(dx, dy)`.
2. The initial values are: 
   - `x` is 2
   - `y` is 1
   - `dx` and `dy` will be provided from the tuple.

Assuming `dx` and `dy` have specific values (which would be determined by the next tuple in the list), we can express the output state based on the equations specified.

Since we do not have the exact values of `dx` and `dy`, we will represent the new values of `nx` and `ny` in relation to `x` and `y`:

- `nx` will be calculated as `2 + dx`
- `ny` will be calculated as `1 + dy`

Thus, the output state reflects the change to `nx` and `ny`, while retaining the information about `N`, `x`, and `y`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `nx` is `2 + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`**.
