The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged, but `queue` will now contain this new element.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 0; `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[x + dx][dy]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`; `queue` now contains the element `(ncur, 0)`**.
