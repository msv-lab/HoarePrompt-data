`nx` is assigned the value of `x + dx`, which is `0 + 1`, resulting in `nx` being `1`. `ny` is assigned the value of `y + dy`, which is `2 + 0`, resulting in `ny` being `2`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `piece` is now 2, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 2**
