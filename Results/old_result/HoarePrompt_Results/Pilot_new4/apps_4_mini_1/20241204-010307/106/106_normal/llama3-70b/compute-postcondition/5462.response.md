The code assigns a new value to `dist[1][ncur]`, which is the result of adding `1` to `dist[1][cur]`. The state of other variables remains unchanged. We know that `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[1][ncur]` is initially greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, indicating that the assignment will lead to a decrease in the value of `dist[1][ncur]`.

Output State: **`N` is at least 6, `x` is 4, `y` is 2, `nx` is equal to `4 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `(nx, ny)` are valid indices, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`**.
