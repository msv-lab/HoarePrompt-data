The code assigns the value of `dist[0][cur] + 1` to `dist[0][ncur]`. Given the initial condition that `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, the new value of `dist[0][ncur]` will be equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 0 and 8 (inclusive); `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `piece` is equal to 0; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1; ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
