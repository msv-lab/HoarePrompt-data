The variable `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` and `ny` are within the range of 0 to `N - 1` (inclusive). The initial state does not specify the precise values of `nx`, `ny`, or the contents of array `A`. Hence, the output state will retain the general information about `N`, `x`, `y`, and the conditions about `nx` and `ny`, while indicating that `ncur` is now assigned a specific value from the array `A`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `dist[0]` has been updated for reachable positions, `parent[0]` has been assigned tuples for reachable positions, `queue` contains tuples for each reachable position from `(x, y)`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the range of 0 to `N - 1` (inclusive), and `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`.**
