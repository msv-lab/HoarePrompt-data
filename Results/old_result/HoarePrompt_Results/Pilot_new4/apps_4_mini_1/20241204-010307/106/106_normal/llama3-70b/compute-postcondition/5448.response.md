According to the code, the loop iterates over a list of tuples representing changes in the `x` and `y` coordinates (`dx`, `dy`). For the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the next tuple in the list.

At the end of the last iteration, `dx` is taken from the previous tuple, and we are currently on one of the tuples. The next iteration of the loop will move to the next tuple in the list. Since the loop is iterating over a fixed list of tuples, the next set of values for `dx` and `dy` will be the next pair from the list.

The pairs in the loop are:
1. `(-2, -1)`
2. `(-2, 1)`
3. `(-1, -2)`
4. `(-1, 2)`
5. `(1, -2)`
6. `(1, 2)`
7. `(2, -1)`
8. `(2, 1)`

Since `dx` is currently 4 and `dy` is 2, and considering we start with the first tuple, the loop likely has not yet reached the last tuple based on the current index of iteration. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to account for the next tuple from the list. However, since `dx` and `dy` are defined based on the current iteration, and not on a static range, we don't have explicit values for `dx` and `dy` after the last iteration.

Given that the loop remains within the defined tuple list, we can say that the loop will continue to execute until all tuples have been processed. After the last tuple `(2, 1)` is processed, the loop will terminate.

Hence, for the state to execute one more time, the next pair will be:
- For the last iteration, if `dx` and `dy` are taken from the last tuple `(2, 1)`, the next state will be based on this last tuple being processed.

State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 2, `nx` is equal to `4 + 2`, `ny` is equal to `2 + 1`, and both `nx` and `ny` are between 0 and N-1. If these conditions are met, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
