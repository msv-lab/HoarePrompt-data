The code assigns the value of `cur` to `parent[0][ncur]`, along with a value `piece`. The precondition states that `ncur` is equal to `A[x + dx][N + dy]`, but the specific values of `cur` and `piece` are not provided. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is equal to `N`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `N + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x + dx][N + dy]`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged; `dist[0][ncur] = dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `piece`.**
