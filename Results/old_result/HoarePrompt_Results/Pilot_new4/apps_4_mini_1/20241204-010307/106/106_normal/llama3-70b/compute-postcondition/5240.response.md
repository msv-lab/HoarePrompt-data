Postcondition: ***`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is between 0 and `N-1`; `y` is between 1 and `N-1`; `nx` is `x + dx`; `ny` is `y + dy`; `ncur` is the value at `A[nx][ny]`. If both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the array (0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N), and if `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` paired with `piece`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`. If `nx` or `ny` is out of bounds, no changes are made.***
