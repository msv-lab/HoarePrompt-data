The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of the element in the 2D array `A` at the position `[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are still equal to `dx` and `dy`, respectively, as per the initial state. The value of `N` is between 3 and 10, and the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `dist[0]` has been updated for reachable positions, `parent[0]` has been assigned tuples for reachable positions, `queue` contains tuples for each reachable position from `(0, 0)`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
