The `queue` variable is being modified by the `append` method, which adds a new tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the existing `queue`. The values of `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged except for the updated `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `cur` are not directly affected by this operation, so they will still hold their previous values.

Output State: **`dist`, `parent`, and `queue` are unchanged; `y` is N; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `N + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[x + dx][N + dy]; parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur`; `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`.**
