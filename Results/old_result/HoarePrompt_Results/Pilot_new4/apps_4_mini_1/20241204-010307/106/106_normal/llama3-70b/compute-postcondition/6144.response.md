The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[0][ncur]`, where `ncur` has already been defined as `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `N`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, and `dist` remain unaffected. However, the variable `parent[0][ncur]` is now updated. The values of `cur` and `piece` are not specified, but they are assigned to `parent[0][ncur]`. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the values of `cur` and `piece`.**
