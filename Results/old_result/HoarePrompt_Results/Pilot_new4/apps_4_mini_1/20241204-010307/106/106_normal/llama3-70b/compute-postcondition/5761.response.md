In the given code, `dist[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `dist[2][cur] + 1`. The variable `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, while `ny` is equal to `y`. The variable `cur` is not defined in the initial state, so its previous value is unknown. The updates pertain to the `dist` array at the specified indices.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
