Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `piece` is 2, `dist[2]` reflects the updated shortest path distances for all valid `ncur` positions reachable from `(x, y)`, `parent[2]` stores the corresponding previous positions and piece types for those reachable `ncur`, and `queue` contains all reachable tuples `(ncur, 2)` and now includes `(cur, i)` as well.**
