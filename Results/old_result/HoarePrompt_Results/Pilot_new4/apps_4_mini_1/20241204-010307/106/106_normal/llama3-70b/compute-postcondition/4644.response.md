Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is equal to `1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]` where `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`. The value of `piece` is 0 and the value of `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`.***
