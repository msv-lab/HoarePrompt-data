The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The initial state indicates that `N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, and `x` is between 1 and `N-2`. The values of `dx` and `dy` are not specified, but they are used to compute `nx` and `ny`. Other variables such as `dist` and `parent` are not directly affected by this assignment, but the conditions for their updates are maintained.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `x` is between 1 and `N-2`, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, `dist[1][ncur]` will be updated for valid combinations of `dx` and `dy`, `parent[1][ncur]` will reflect the last valid `cur` and `piece`, `queue` will contain all valid tuples of `(ncur, 1)` appended during the iterations.**
