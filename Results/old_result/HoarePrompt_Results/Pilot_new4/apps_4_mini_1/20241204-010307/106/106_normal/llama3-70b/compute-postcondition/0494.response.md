The code assigns a value to the `parent` variable at the specified index `[1][ncur]`. The variables `cur`, `piece`, and `ncur` are directly referenced in this assignment, but their values are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact new values for `parent[1][ncur]`. However, we recognize that `parent[1][ncur]` is now associated with `cur` and `piece`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the Output State is as follows:

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is 3, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][3]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is now equal to `cur` and `piece`.**
