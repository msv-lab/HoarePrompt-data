Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is the current y-coordinate, `piece` is not equal to the value represented by `i`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to equal `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and the tuple `(ncur, 0)` is appended to `queue`. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
