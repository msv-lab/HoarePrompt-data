The value of `ncur` is assigned the value from the array `A` at the position `[nx][ny]`. Given that `nx` is equal to `x + dx` and `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` now reflects the value of the array `A` at these computed indices. The states of the other variables remain unchanged based on the provided initial state.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x + dx][y + dy]`, `dist[1][ncur]` contains the updated minimum distances, `parent[1][ncur]` contains the respective parent information, and `queue` contains reachable positions.**
