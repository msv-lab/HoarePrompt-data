The code `dist[2][ncur] = dist[2][cur] + 1` updates the value at `dist[2][ncur]` to be equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`. The initial state specifies that `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, indicating that the condition for this assignment is met. 

Thus, the value of `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, which implies it has changed. The other variables remain unaffected. Since `piece` is still 2, we maintain that information along with the state of the `dist`, `parent`, `queue`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur`.

Output State: **`piece` is 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dist[1]` reflects the shortest path distances from `cur`, `parent[1]` reflects the corresponding parents for reachable indices, `queue` contains all updated elements based on valid moves, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]` where `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid (0 ≤ `nx` < `N` and 0 ≤ `ny` < `N`), and the current value of `dist[2][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
