The code assigns values to `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. The variable `nx` is calculated as `x + dx` and `ny` as `y + dy`. The previous values of `x` and `y` are known, but the values of `dx` and `dy` are not specified. Therefore, `nx` and `ny` will be updated accordingly, but we cannot provide their exact values without knowing `dx` and `dy`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `nx` is `2 + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`.**
