Postcondition: ***If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` contains elements appended as `(ncur, 1)` and `(ncur, 2)`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is `dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 2, and if `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1` and `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`.***
