The line of code `queue.append((ncur, 0))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `0` are now included in the `queue`, but there are no changes to the other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects the inclusion of the new tuple in the `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is 2, `ncur` is assigned the value `A[x - 2][2]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is now `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, `piece`, `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`**.
