The code snippet `queue.append((ncur, 1))` adds a new tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The value of `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][1]`, which means that the tuple being added contains the updated value related to the array `A`. The other variables `N`, `y`, `A`, `dist`, and `parent` remain unchanged as the operation does not affect them directly. 

Thus, the output state will reflect the unchanged variables along with the updated information about the queue.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dist` and `parent` are valid and updated based on knight's moves, `queue` now includes `(ncur, 1)`, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is 1, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][1]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur`.**
