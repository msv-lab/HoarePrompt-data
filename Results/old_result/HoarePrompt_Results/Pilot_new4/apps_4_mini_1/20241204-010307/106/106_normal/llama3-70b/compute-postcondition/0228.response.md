Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 3 and 10, `y` is equal to `N`, `x` is a valid integer within bounds, `nx` is equal to `x + 1`, and `ny` is equal to `N + 1`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[x + 1][N + 1]`. If `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. If the condition is not satisfied, no actions are taken.***
