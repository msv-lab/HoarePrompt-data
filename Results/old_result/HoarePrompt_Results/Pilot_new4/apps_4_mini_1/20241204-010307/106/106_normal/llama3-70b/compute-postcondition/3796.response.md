The variables `nx` and `ny` are calculated as `nx = x + dx` and `ny = y + dy`. Given the initial values of `x` and `y`, we have `x` as 2 and `y` as 1. The values of `dx` and `dy` have not been specified, but it is implied that they are chosen such that the resulting `nx` and `ny` satisfy the bounds checks `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`.

Since `N` is an integer in the range `3 <= N <= 10`, we know that the maximum values for `nx` and `ny` can be at most `N-1`. This means that `nx` must be in the range from `0` to `N-1`, and similarly for `ny`.

As `dx` and `dy` are not defined in the problem statement, we cannot assume specific values for them. However, we conclude that the values of `nx` and `ny` will depend on valid adjustments to `x` and `y` such that the resultant `nx` and `ny` remain within the defined bounds.

The output state summarizes the values and constraints for the variables `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, and `ny`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `nx` is `2 + dx` (where `0 <= nx < N`), `ny` is `1 + dy` (where `0 <= ny < N`.**
