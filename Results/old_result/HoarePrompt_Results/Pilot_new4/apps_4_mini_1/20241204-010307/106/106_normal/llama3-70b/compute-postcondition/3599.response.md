The code assigns a value to `parent[0][ncur]`, which updates the `parent` array at the index `[0][ncur]` to be equal to `cur` and `piece`. The other variables retain their previous states. 

The preconditions state that:
- `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`
- `x` is between `0` and `N-1`
- `y` is between `0` and `N-2` (inclusive)
- `nx` is equal to `x + dx`
- `ny` is equal to `y + dy`
- `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`
- `piece` is equal to `0`
- `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1` (previously greater than)

After executing the code, the updated value of `parent[0][ncur]` is now `(cur, piece)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is between `0` and `N-1`, `y` is between `0` and `N-2` (inclusive), `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to `0`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1` (previously greater than), `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`**.
