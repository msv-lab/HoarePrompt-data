Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` and `y` are within `0` and `N-1`; if `piece` is not equal to `i`, then `dist[2][ncur]` reflects the minimum steps required to reach each position from `(1, 0)` for all valid `ncur` positions, `parent[2][ncur]` contains the respective parents for those positions, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(cur, i)`; if no positions were reachable, then `dist[2]` and `parent[2]` remain unchanged, while `dist[0]` and `parent[0]` still reflect the updates made prior to the loop. Otherwise, if `piece` equals `i`, there are no changes made to the state.***
