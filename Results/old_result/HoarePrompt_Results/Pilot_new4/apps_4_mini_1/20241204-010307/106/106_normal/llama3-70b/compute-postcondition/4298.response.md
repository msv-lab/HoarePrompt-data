The statement `dist[0][ncur] = dist[0][cur] + 1` assigns the value of `dist[0][cur] + 1` to `dist[0][ncur]`. The current value of `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1` before this assignment, which means that after the code is executed, `dist[0][ncur]` will now be equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`. The values of `N`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `dist`, `parent`, `queue`, `ncur`, and `piece` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is equal to `N`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `N + dy`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`**.
