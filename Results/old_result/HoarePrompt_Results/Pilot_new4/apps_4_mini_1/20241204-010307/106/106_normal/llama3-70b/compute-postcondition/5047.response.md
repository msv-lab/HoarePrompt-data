The value of `ncur` is assigned earlier as `ncur = A[2][-1]`, which is being appended to the `queue` along with the value `1`. Hence, `queue` will now include the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **If N is between 4 and 10, `x` is 3, `y` is 0, `0 <= nx < N`, `nx` is 2, `ny` is -1, `piece` is 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[2][-1]`, `queue` contains (None, 1), `parent[1][ncur]` is now equal to (cur, 1), and `queue` now contains (ncur, 1)**.
