According to the code, the loop will execute a fixed number of times, specifically 8 times, as it iterates over a predefined list of tuples. The loop variables `dx` and `dy` will receive values from this list, regardless of the values of `N` and `y`. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop variables to execute since the loop is not dependent on `N` or `y`. 

However, it is important to recognize that the loop does not depend on the values of `N` and `y` to start executing, as they do not influence the loop's termination or execution conditions.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1 (for the first iteration)**
