The line of code `queue.append((ncur, 1))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The variable `ncur` is determined by the previous state, specifically as `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is `x - 1` and `ny` is 2. The values of `queue`, `ncur`, `nx`, and `ny` are thus affected by this operation. Importantly, the states of the other variables remain unchanged, as no other calculations or assignments are modified by this line.

Given that `nx = x - 1` and `ny = 2`, the value of `ncur` will be `A[x - 1][2]`. The `queue` is now updated to include the new tuple.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 1; `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 1; `nx` is `x - 1`; `ny` is 2; `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the values of `cur` and `piece`; `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`**.
