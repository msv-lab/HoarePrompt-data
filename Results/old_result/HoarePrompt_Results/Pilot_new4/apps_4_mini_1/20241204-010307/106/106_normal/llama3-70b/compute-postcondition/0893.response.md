Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dx` is the first element of the tuple, `dy` is the second element of the tuple, `nx` is equal to `dx`, and `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`. If both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of `0` and `N`, `ncur` is set to `A[nx][ny]`, and if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, and `piece`, and `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. If the condition is not satisfied, no changes are made to the state of the variables.***
