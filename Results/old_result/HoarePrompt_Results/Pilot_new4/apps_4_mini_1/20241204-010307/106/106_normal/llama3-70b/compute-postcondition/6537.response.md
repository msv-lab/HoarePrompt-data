Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 0 and `N-1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `dist[0]` reflects the shortest distances relevant to valid moves, `parent[0]` reflects the parent nodes relevant to valid moves, `dist[1]` may have been updated based on valid moves, `parent[1]` may have been updated based on valid moves, `queue` contains tuples of valid moves (if any valid moves resulted in updates), both `nx` and `ny` are within the range 0 to N-1 (inclusive), and `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`.**
