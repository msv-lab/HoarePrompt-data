In this scenario, `nx` and `ny` are assigned new values based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. The variables `x` and `y` are known to be 1 and 2, respectively, while `dx` and `dy` are not specified in the initial state. Therefore, we will represent `nx` and `ny` as expressions.

Given that:
- `x` is 1,
- `y` is 2,
- `nx` is equal to `1 + dx`,
- and `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`.

After executing the code, `nx` will be `1 + dx` and `ny` will be `2 + dy`. The values of `N` and `cur` remain unchanged, and there are no further pairs to iterate over.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `cur` is the same as before, and no further pairs exist to iterate over.**
