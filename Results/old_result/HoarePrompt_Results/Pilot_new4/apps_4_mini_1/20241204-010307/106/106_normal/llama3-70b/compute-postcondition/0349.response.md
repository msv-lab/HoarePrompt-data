The assignment `parent[2][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the values of `cur` and `piece` to the 2D array `parent` at the indices `[2][ncur]`. This impacts the state of the `parent` array but does not affect other variables.

The variables `N`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and `dist` are not directly modified by this line of code, so their values remain the same. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x + 1`, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the values of `cur` and `piece`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x + 1`, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the values of `cur` and `piece`.**
