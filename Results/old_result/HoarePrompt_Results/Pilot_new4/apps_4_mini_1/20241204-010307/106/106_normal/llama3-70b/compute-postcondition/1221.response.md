The statement `parent[2][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns a tuple (cur, piece) to the element `parent[2][ncur]`. The values of the other variables are not affected by this assignment. The value of `ncur` is equal to `A[2][1]`, but we do not know the specific value of `cur` or `piece`. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 1; `nx` is 2; `ny` is 1; `dx` is 1; `dy` is 0; `ncur` is equal to `A[2][1]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of (cur, piece)**.
