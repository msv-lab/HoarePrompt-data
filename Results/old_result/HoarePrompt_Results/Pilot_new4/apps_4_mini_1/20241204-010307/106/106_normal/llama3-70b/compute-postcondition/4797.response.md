The statement `queue.append((ncur, 2))` adds the tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. All other variables remain unchanged. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `dist`, `parent`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and `piece` retain their previous states. The only impact is the modification of the `queue` variable by appending a new tuple.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dist[0]` has been updated for all reachable positions from `(x, y)`, `parent[0]` has been assigned tuples for all reachable positions, `queue` now contains one additional tuple `(ncur, 2)`, `nx` is `dx`, `ny` is `dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur]`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`**.
