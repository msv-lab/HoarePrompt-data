The code assigns values to `parent[0][ncur]` based on the current value of `cur` and `piece`. The previous states for the affected variables are as follows:

- `ncur` was assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is `3 + dx` and `ny` is `1 + dy`.
- The initial values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, and `dist` remain unchanged as the assignment does not alter them; however, we record that `parent[0][ncur]` is now set based on the current values of `cur` and `piece`.

Since the specific values of `cur`, `piece`, and `A` are not provided, we specify that `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 3, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `3 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.**
