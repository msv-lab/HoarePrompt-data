Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; `nx` is equal to `1 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`; if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` now includes `(ncur, 2)`. Otherwise, `dist[2][ncur]` remains unchanged, `parent[2][ncur]` remains unchanged, and `queue` may include the next position accordingly.***
