Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `dist[2]` is updated based on reachable nodes from (0, 2) only if `piece` is 2 and the conditions for updating are satisfied, `parent[2]` contains references to those nodes, and `queue` contains tuples of positions and piece states that were added during the loop execution. If none of the conditions are satisfied for any iteration, `dist[2]` remains unchanged from its initial state, `parent[2]` remains unchanged, and `queue` remains empty. The current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`.***
