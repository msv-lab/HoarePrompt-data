Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 4, `dist` is valid for reachable indices, `parent` is valid for reachable indices, `queue` contains valid tuples of `(ncur, 0)`, `piece` is set according to loop conditions, `cur` is valid for index calculations, `x` is a valid index, `y` is a valid index, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid (0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N), `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and the current value of `piece` is 1, while the current value of `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`.***
