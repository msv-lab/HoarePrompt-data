The code `queue.append((ncur, 0))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `0` are appended as a new entry without changing the other variables. Therefore, while `queue` is altered, the other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `4 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `A[4][0]` is equal to `cur`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`.**
