The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` and `ny` are calculated to ensure that `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`. The values of `A[nx][ny]` will depend on the implementation and content of the list `A`, which is not specified. However, since `N` is between 3 and 10, `nx` and `ny` will be valid indices given the constraints. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `dist[1][ncur]` contains the updated minimum distances for reachable cells from `cur`, `parent[1][ncur]` contains the corresponding parents for those reachable cells, `queue` contains all reachable cells and their corresponding pieces that were added during the loop iterations, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
