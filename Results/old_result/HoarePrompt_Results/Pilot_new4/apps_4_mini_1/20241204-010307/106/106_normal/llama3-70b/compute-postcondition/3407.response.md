The operation `dist[2][ncur] = dist[2][cur] + 1` assigns the value `dist[2][cur] + 1` to `dist[2][ncur]`. Here, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, which is determined by the current values of `nx` and `ny`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `piece` remains equal to 2, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
