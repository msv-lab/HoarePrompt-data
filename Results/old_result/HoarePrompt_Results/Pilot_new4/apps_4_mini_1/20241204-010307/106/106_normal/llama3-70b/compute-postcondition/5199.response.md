The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The preconditions state that `nx` is equal to `x + dx` and `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, with constraints on their ranges. Given that `nx` and `ny` must fall within the valid indices for the 2D array `A`, the other variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is between 0 and N-1; `y` is between 1 and N-1; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is between 0 and N-1; `y` is between 1 and N-1; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
