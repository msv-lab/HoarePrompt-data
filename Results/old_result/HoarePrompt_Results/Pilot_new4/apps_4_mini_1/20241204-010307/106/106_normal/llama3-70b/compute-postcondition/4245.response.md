The code snippet assigns new values to `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy`. Specifically, `nx` is assigned the value of `x + dx`, and `ny` is assigned the value of `y + dy`. Given that `x` is 1 and `y` is `N - 1`, we can substitute these values into the equations.

After the execution of the code:
- `nx` will be `1 + dx` (where `dx` is the current value being processed).
- `ny` will be `N - 1 + dy` (where `dy` is the current value being processed).

The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `dist[0]`, `parent[0]`, `A[x][y]`, and `queue` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. 

Thus, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 1, `y` is `N - 1`, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `N - 1 + dy`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[0]` contains the minimum distances from the starting point to all reachable points, `parent[0]` contains the respective parent information for each reachable point, `queue` contains the tuples representing all reachable points and their associated pieces after processing all valid moves defined by the `dx` and `dy` offsets.
