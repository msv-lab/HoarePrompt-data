The operation `queue.append((ncur, 0))` appends a tuple containing the value of `ncur` and `0` to the `queue`. No other variables are modified or affected by this operation. 

Since `ncur` is already defined as `A[-2][1]`, it retains its value in the output state.

Thus, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10; `queue` now contains the previous elements plus the tuple `(ncur, 0)`; `x` is 0; `y` is 2; `nx` is -2; `ny` is 1; `dx` is -2; `dy` is -1; `ncur` is equal to `A[-2][1]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.
