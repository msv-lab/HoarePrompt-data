Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 0; `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`; `nx` is `x + 1`; `ny` is 0; `piece` remains equal to 2; `ncur` is equal to `A[x + 1][0]`. If `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to (cur, 2), and `queue` now contains (ncur, 2).***
