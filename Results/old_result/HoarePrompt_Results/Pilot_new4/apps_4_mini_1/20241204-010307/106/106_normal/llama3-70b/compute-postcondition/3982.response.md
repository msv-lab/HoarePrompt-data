Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)` if `piece` equals 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[1][cur]`. Otherwise, there are no changes to the variables.***
