The operation `queue.append((cur, i))` adds a tuple `(cur, i)` to the list `queue`. Given that the initial state indicates that `queue` contains valid tuples from previous loop executions, the operation modifies `queue` by adding a new element to it. The values of `dist`, `parent`, and the condition about `piece` relative to `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dist` contains the shortest distances from (3, 0) to all reachable positions, `parent` reflects the parent tuples for those positions that were updated, `queue` now contains its previous valid tuples plus the new tuple `(cur, i)`, and the current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`.**
