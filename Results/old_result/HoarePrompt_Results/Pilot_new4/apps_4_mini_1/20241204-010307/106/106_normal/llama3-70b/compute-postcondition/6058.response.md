The code assigns the value of `cur` to `parent[0][ncur]` and associates it with `piece`, but the values of other variables remain unchanged. The precondition states that `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and since `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, this implies that `ncur` will now have a parent linked to `cur`. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `x + dx` is within the bounds of `A`, `y + dy` is within the bounds of `A`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `nx` is within the range of 0 to N, `ny` is within the range of 0 to N, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `piece`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `x + dx` is within the bounds of `A`, `y + dy` is within the bounds of `A`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `nx` is within the range of 0 to N, `ny` is within the range of 0 to N, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `piece`.**
