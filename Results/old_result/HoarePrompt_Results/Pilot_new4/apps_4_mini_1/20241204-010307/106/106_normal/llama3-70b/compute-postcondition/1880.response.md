Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 4, `dist` is valid for reachable indices. If `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `parent[1][ncur]` is updated to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` now includes the valid tuples of `(ncur, 0)` and `(ncur, 1)`. The values of `cur`, `ncur`, `nx`, and `ny` remain valid for index calculations, with `nx` equal to `x + dx` and `ny` equal to `y + dy`, both within the bounds of the grid (0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N).***
