The code `queue.append((ncur, 1))` appends the tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The value of `ncur` is derived from `A[nx][ny]`, but the value of `queue` is not mentioned in the initial state. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 0; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is equal to 1; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; the current value of `dist[1][ncur]` is no longer greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is now the tuple `(cur, piece)`; `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`.**
