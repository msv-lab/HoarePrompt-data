Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is equal to `x + 2`, `ny` is equal to `3`, `dx` is 2, `dy` is 1, and the loop index is 8 (which is out of bounds). If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, no changes are made. If the condition is false, no changes are made.***
