The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The variables `nx` and `ny` have been defined as `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively, and are within the bounds of the array `A`, which is of size `N`. The state of the other variables remains unaffected. The value of `ncur` depends on the specific values in the array `A` at the indices `nx` and `ny`. 

Since `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, we can conclude that while the value of `ncur` is not explicitly defined beyond its assignment, it will reflect the value located at the position given by `nx` and `ny` in `A`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `x + dx` is within the bounds of `A`, `y + dy` is within the bounds of `A`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the range of 0 to N (inclusive of 0 and exclusive of N), and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
