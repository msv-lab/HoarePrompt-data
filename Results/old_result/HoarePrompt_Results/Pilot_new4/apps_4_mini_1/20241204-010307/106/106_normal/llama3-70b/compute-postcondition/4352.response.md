The code assigns a new value to `dist[2][ncur]`, which is the result of `dist[2][cur] + 1`. The previous state indicates that the current value of `dist[2][ncur]` was greater than this new value. Therefore, after execution, `dist[2][ncur]` will now equal `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and all other variables maintain their prior values without any changes.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is equal to `N`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` have valid prior values, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `N + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid such that `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, the value of `piece` is equal to 2, and `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
