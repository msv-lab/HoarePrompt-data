According to the code, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that the values of `nx` and `ny` resulting from the moves defined by `dx` and `dy` are valid coordinates within the bounds of the grid defined by `N`. The loop iterates over the pairs of `dx` and `dy`, which represent diagonal moves on a grid.

Given that `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` and `y` are integers between `0` and `N-1`. The coordinates `(nx, ny)` are calculated using the current values of `x` and `y` as follows:
- For each `(dx, dy)`, compute `nx = x + dx` and `ny = y + dy`.

To ensure that at least one of these resulting coordinates `(nx, ny)` is valid, we need to confirm that:
1. `0 <= nx < N`
2. `0 <= ny < N`

If either coordinate is out of bounds, the loop will not execute as intended.

To summarize, we need:
- At least one of the resulting coordinates `(nx, ny)` for the given `dx` and `dy` pairs must be valid.
- We can set `ncur` accordingly for valid moves.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and N-1, `y` is between 0 and N-1, at least one of the resulting coordinates `(nx, ny)` must be valid, and `ncur` is updated for valid moves.**
