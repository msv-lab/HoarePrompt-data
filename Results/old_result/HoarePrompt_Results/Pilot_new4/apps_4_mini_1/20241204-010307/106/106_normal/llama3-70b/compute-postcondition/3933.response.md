Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 1, `nx` is 2, `ny` is 3, and `ncur` remains unchanged if it was previously defined. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[2][3]`. If `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`,  `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set with `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` now contains (ncur, 2). Otherwise, no changes occur. If the conditions are not met, there are no modifications to any variables.***
