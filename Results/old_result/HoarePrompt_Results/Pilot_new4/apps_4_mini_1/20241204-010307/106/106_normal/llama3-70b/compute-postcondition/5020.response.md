The code `queue.append((ncur, 0))` adds a tuple containing `ncur` and `0` to the `queue`. The previous state of the variables is not directly affected by this operation apart from the addition to the `queue`. The other variables retain their values, and we do not have the specific values of `ncur`, `dist`, `parent`, `dx`, `dy`, or `cur`. Thus, we will keep those in a general form.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is 3; `y` is 0; `nx` is `3 + dx`; `ny` is `dy`; `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`; `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`.**
