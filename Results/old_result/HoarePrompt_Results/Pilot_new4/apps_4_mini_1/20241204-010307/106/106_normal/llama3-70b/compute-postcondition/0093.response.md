Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `piece` is 2, `dist[2][ncur]` contains the shortest distances for all reachable `ncur` values from the starting point, `parent[2][ncur]` holds the corresponding previous positions from which `ncur` was reached, `queue` contains all reachable `ncur` values along with the corresponding piece value of 2. The current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`. If no valid moves were possible, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initialized states.***
