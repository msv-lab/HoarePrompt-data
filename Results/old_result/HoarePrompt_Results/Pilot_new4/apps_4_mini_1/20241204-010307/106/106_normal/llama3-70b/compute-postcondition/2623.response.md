The operation `queue.append((ncur, 2))` appends a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the list `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `2` (a constant) are included in the queue, but the existing values of other variables remain unchanged. 

The previous values and conditions of the variables are as follows:
- `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`.
- `y` is an integer less than `N - 1`.
- `dx` must be (0, 1).
- `dy` must be (0, 1).
- `nx` is either `x` or `x + 1`.
- `ny` is either `y` or `y + 1`.
- `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`.
- `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.
- `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur, piece`.

Since the `queue` variable is not defined in the initial state, it is assumed to be an empty list before the append operation. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is an integer less than `N - 1`, `dx` must be (0, 1), `dy` must be (0, 1), `nx` is either `x` or `x + 1`, `ny` is either `y` or `y + 1`, `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur, piece`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`.**
