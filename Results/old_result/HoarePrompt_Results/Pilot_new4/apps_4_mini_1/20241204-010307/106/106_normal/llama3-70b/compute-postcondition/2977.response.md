Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `dist` reflects the shortest distances for all reachable positions, `parent` indicates the predecessors for each reachable position, and `queue` contains all tuples of reachable positions processed during the iterations. The conditions `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` are satisfied for any reachable positions. `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated based on `dist[2][cur] + 1`, so `dist[2][ncur]` represents the shortest distances, `parent[2][ncur]` points to the predecessors, and `queue` reflects all valid processed positions. Additionally, `piece` is not equal to `i`. If the loop does not execute, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initial values.***
