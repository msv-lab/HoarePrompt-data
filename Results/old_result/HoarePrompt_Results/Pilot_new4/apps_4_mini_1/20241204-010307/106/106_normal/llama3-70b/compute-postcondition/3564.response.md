The variable `ncur` is assigned the value from `A[nx][ny]`. Since `nx` and `ny` are both within the range [0, N), the value of `A[nx][ny]` is accessible and valid. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`dist[1][ncur]` contains the minimum distances from the starting position to all reachable positions, `parent[1][ncur]` reflects the last piece and position before reaching `ncur`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the range [0, N), and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
