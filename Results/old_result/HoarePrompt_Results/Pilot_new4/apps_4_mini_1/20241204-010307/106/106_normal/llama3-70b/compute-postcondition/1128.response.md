The statement `queue.append((ncur, 2))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The variable `ncur` is currently equal to `A[2][0]`, which is not specifically defined in the initial state but is a valid value from the `A` array. The value `piece` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation, and `queue` is assumed to be an existing list. Other variables such as `N`, `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, `dist`, and `parent` are unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `piece` is 2, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is 2, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[2][0]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated by adding 1 to `dist[2][cur]`, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` has an additional element `(ncur, 2)` appended to it.**
