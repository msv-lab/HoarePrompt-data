The code assigns the value of `A[nx][ny]` to `ncur`. Since `nx` is equal to `x + dx` and `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, the specific values of `nx` and `ny` will depend on the values of `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy`. The variable `ncur` now holds the value from the 2D array `A` at the indices calculated. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to the value of `cur`, `piece` is set to 0, `queue` includes the newly appended tuple `(ncur, 0)`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, for the next iteration the current tuple will be (-2, 1)**.
