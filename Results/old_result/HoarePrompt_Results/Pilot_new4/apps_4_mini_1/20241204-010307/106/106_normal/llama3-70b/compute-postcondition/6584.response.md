The code `queue.append((ncur, 0))` adds a tuple containing the value of `ncur` and 0 to the `queue`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The initial state includes several valid conditions involving `N`, `x`, `y`, `index`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `dist`, and `parent`. 

The value of `ncur` is determined by `A[nx][ny]`, which is based on the values of `nx` and `ny`. The tuple `(ncur, 0)` is added to `queue`, but no other variable's value is altered.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `index` is 0, `nx` is equal to `1 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`, `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`**.
