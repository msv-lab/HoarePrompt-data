The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is equal to `x - 1` and `ny` is equal to `y`. Thus, `ncur` takes the value from the 2D array `A` at the indices specified by `nx` and `ny`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is between 0 and `N-1`; `y` is between 0 and `N-1`; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 0; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is equal to `y`; `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is between 0 and `N-1`; `y` is between 0 and `N-1`; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 0; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is equal to `y`; `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y]**.
