The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[2][ncur]`. The current value of `ncur` is defined as `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` and `ny` are derived from `x` and `dx`, `y` and `dy` respectively, ensuring that they are within the valid range defined by `N`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `dist[1]` contains the shortest path distances; `parent[1]` contains the corresponding parent positions; `queue` contains valid `(ncur, 1)` positions; `nx` is equal to `x + dx` for any value in `dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy` for any value in `dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; the current value of `nx` is between 0 and N-1; the current value of `ny` is between 0 and N-1; the current value of `piece` is 2; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the values `(cur, piece)`.**
