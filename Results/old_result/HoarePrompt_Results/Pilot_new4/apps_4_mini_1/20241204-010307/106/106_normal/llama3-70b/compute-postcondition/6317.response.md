Postcondition: ***If `N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, and `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, then if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is equal to 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` condition is not met, no changes occur.***
