The variable `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are `x + 1` and `y + 1`, respectively, but the values of `x` and `y` are not provided in the initial state. The initial state remains unchanged for all other variables. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment that has taken place.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `piece` is equal to 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated if necessary, `parent[1][ncur]` is set as needed, `queue` contains the necessary elements if updates occur, `(dx, dy)` is (1, 1), `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is `y + 1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
