Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `dist` reflects the updated shortest path distances, `dx` is 1, `dy` is -2, `nx` is 3, `ny` is -2, if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `parent[0][ncur]` is updated to (cur, piece), and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
