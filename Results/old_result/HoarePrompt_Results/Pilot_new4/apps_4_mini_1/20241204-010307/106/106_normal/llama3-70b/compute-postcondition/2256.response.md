According to the code, the for loop iterates through the list of directional changes defined by `dx` and `dy`. Each iteration represents a movement in the specified direction. Since the loop processes each direction sequentially, the variable `(dx, dy)` will take on the values of the next tuple in the list during each iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, `piece` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, the next direction tuple must be processed. Since there are four directions in total, if the last processed direction was the first one (i.e., `(-1, 0)`), the next will be `(1, 0)`, then `(0, -1)`, and finally `(0, 1)`. The loop will continue while there are more tuples in the list to process.

Given that there are no changes to `piece`, `dist`, `parent`, or `queue` until a valid `(dx, dy)` is used, the main state alteration is the tuple being processed.

State: **`piece` is 1, `(dx, dy)` is (1, 0)**
