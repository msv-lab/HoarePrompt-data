The statement `dist[1][ncur] = dist[1][cur] + 1` updates the distance from `cur` to `ncur`. Given that the initial state specifies that `dist[0][ncur]` contains the minimum distance from `cur` to each reachable position `ncur`, and assuming `dist[1][cur]` is valid, this means that `dist[1][ncur]` will be incremented by 1 from the value of `dist[1][cur]`. The values of `N`, `y`, `x`, `A`, `dist`, `parent`, `queue`, `nx`, `ny`, and `cur` remain unchanged except for the updated distance in `dist`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 0; `x + dx` is within the bounds of `A`; `y + dy` is within the bounds of `A`; `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`; `dist[0][ncur]` contains the minimum distance from `cur` to each reachable position `ncur`; `parent[0][ncur]` represents the previous position leading to `ncur`; `queue` contains reachable positions which can be updated; `queue` must not be empty; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is equal to `y - 1`; `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y - 1]`; `(dx, dy)` is `(-1, -1)` for the next iteration; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
