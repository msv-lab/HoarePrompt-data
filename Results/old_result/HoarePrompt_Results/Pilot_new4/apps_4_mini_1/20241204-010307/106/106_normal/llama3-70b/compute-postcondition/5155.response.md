According to the code, the loop iterates over the directions specified by the tuples `(-1, 0)`, `(1, 0)`, `(0, -1)`, and `(0, 1)`. This means that for each iteration of the loop, the values of `dx` and `dy` will be updated to the next tuple in the list.

At the end of the last iteration, `dx` and `dy` represent the direction currently being processed. Since there are four tuples in total, after the last iteration, `dx` and `dy` will correspond to the last tuple in the list, which is `(0, 1)`. Therefore, the next values of `dx` and `dy` would be the first tuple again `(-1, 0)` if we consider a wrap-around approach or simply end the loop if we are at the final iteration.

Now we need to ensure that the loop can execute one more time. Since `dx` and `dy` are currently at the last tuple `(0, 1)`, the next index for the loop will be out of bounds. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, we will need to reset to the first tuple. 

State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is between 0 and N-1, `y` is between 0 and N-1, `dist` is appropriately initialized, `parent` reflects valid parent tuples, `queue` contains valid tuples, `piece` is greater than 0, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0**
