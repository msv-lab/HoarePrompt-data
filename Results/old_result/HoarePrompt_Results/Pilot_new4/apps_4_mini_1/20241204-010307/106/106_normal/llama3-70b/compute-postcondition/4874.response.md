Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; and `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`. If these conditions hold true, then if `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `(ncur, 1)` is added to `queue`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
