Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `dist` contains the shortest distances for all reachable positions, `parent` reflects the predecessors for each reachable position including `parent[0][ncur] = cur, piece`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is -1, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 2][-1]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`.**
