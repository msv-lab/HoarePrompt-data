The value of `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are determined by `x` and `y`, specifically `nx` is equal to `x` and `ny` is equal to `y - 1`. The other variables remain unaffected in the state.

Output State: **`piece` is 1, `(dx, dy)` is (0, -1), `nx` is `x`, `ny` is `y - 1, ncur` is A[x][y - 1**.
