According to the code, the loop iterates over a predefined list of tuples representing the directional movements (up, down, left, right). The loop will execute regardless of the values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` as long as it is called. The variables `dx` and `dy` will be assigned the values from the tuples in each iteration.

However, the state of `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` indicates that the loop's body relies on certain conditions for updates to occur. If none of the conditions are satisfied during any iteration, then `dist[0]`, `parent[0]`, and `queue` will remain unchanged. 

For the loop to effectively execute without skipping any iterations, it is not necessary to change the states related to `N`, `x`, or `y`. Instead, we need to acknowledge that the loop will run for each tuple in the list regardless, but the updates to `dist` and `parent` will depend on conditions which are not provided in this context.

Thus, the necessary adjustments can focus on ensuring the conditions that lead to `dist[1][ncur]` being updated and references in `parent[1][ncur]` being established, while recognizing that `queue` is expected to be filled during the execution.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `dist` and `parent` are ready for updates based on the loop conditions, `queue` can be empty initially or filled based on the loop execution.**
