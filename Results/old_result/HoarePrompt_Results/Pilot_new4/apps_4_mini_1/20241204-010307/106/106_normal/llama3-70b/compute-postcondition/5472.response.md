The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `1` are added to `queue`, but no other variables are modified. The prior values of the affected variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is at least 6, `x` is 4, `y` is 2, `nx` is equal to `4 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `ncur = A[4 + dx][2 + dy]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the values of `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`.**
