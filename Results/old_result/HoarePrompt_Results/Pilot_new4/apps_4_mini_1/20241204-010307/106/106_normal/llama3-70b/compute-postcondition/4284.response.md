The code appends a tuple consisting of `ncur` and the integer `2` to the `queue` list. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `dist[2][ncur]`, and `parent[2][ncur]` are not modified by this operation, so their states remain unchanged. The only change is that a new entry is added to the `queue`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 1, `y` is `N - 1`, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `(N - 1) + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)` added to it.**
