The code `queue.append((ncur, 0))` adds the tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The other variables in the initial state are not affected by this operation. Since `ncur` is derived from `A[nx][ny]`, its value remains unchanged in this context. The value of `piece` remains 0, and the structure of `dist` and `parent` is also unchanged. The key update is that the queue now includes the new tuple.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, the value of `piece` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, keeping `dist[0][ncur]` greater than `dist[0][cur]`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`; the queue now contains `(ncur, 0)`**.
