The code attempts to assign the value `cur` and `piece` to `parent[0][ncur]`. However, since `ncur` is undefined, the assignment cannot be performed. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the current state of variables with the information that the assignment could not be completed.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; `A[1][0]` equals `cur`; `dx` is -2; `dy` is 1; `nx` is -1; `ny` is 1; `ncur` is undefined; `dist[0][ncur]` assignment cannot be performed; `parent[0][ncur]` assignment cannot be performed due to `ncur` being undefined.**
