Postcondition: ***If `nx` is between 0 and `N-1` and `ny` is between 0 and `N-1`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `(ncur, 2)` is added to `queue`. Otherwise, there are no changes made to the state of `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.**
