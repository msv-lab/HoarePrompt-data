Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 2; `y` is 1; `nx` is 2; `ny` is 2; if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[2][2]`. If `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, and `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
