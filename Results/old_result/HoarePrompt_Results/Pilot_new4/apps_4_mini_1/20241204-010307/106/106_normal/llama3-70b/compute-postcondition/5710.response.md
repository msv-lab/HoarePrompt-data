Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` has an additional entry `(ncur, 0)`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece` if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`. No changes occur if the condition is not satisfied.***
