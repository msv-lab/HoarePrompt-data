The code assigns new values to `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. Specifically, `nx` is updated to `x + dx`, which is `0 + 1` resulting in `nx = 1`, and `ny` is updated to `y + dy`, which is `2 + (-1)` resulting in `ny = 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 1, `dx` is 1, `dy` is -1**
