According to the code, the loop iterates over a list of tuples representing the changes in coordinates `(dx, dy)`. The `for` loop iterates for each pair of `dx` and `dy`. Since there are 8 pairs in the provided list, if the loop has already executed once, it has processed one of these pairs. 

At the end of the last iteration, `dx` and `dy` represent the last processed pair. Given that there are 8 pairs, the next pair to be processed would be the next one in the list. 

If the previous iteration was the 1st iteration with the first pair `(-2, -1)`, then `dx` and `dy` would become the second pair `(-2, 1)` for the second iteration.

If the loop has executed a total of 8 times, i.e., `dx` and `dy` represent the last pair `(2, 1)`, the loop cannot execute again as there are no more pairs left to process.

Thus, to execute one more time, it must be the case that the loop has processed fewer than 8 pairs. If `dx` and `dy` are the last processed pair, we can state that for the next iteration, they need to be the next pair in the list.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `x + dx` is within the bounds of `A`, `y + dy` is within the bounds of `A`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and both `nx` and `ny` are within the range of 0 to N (inclusive of 0 and exclusive of N), `dx` is the next dx from the list, `dy` is the next dy from the list**.
