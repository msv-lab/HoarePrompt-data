Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is -1, `nx` is 1, `ny` is -1, `ncur` is equal to `A[1][-1]`, if `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`, and `(ncur, 1)` is appended to `queue`. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
