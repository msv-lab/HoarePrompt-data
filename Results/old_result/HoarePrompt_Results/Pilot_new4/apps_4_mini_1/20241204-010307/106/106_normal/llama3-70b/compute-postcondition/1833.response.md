The code snippet appends a tuple containing `ncur` and the value `2` to the list `queue`. The previous values of `parent[2][ncur]` and `dist[2][ncur]` are already defined, but the state of `queue` and its previous contents are unknown. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`parent[2][ncur]` is updated to `cur`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated based on the previous value of `dist[2][cur]`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)` appended to it.**
