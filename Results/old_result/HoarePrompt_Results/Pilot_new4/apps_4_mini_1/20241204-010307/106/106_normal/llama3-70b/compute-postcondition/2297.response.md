The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned new values based on the current values of `x`, `dx`, and `dy`. Specifically, `nx` is calculated as `x + dx` and `ny` as `y + dy`. The values of `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged, and `dx` and `dy` are used to index into the next movement tuple. Therefore, the updated state will reflect the new values of `nx` and `ny` without altering the other variables.

Output State: **`dist`, `parent`, and `queue` are unchanged; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, and `ny` is equal to `y + dy`.**
