The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned new values based on the calculations involving `dx` and `dy`. Specifically, `nx` is updated to `x + dx` and `ny` is updated to `y + dy`. Given that `dx` is 1 and `dy` is 0, `nx` will be `x + 1` (which was already stated as equal to `nx` in the initial state) and `ny` will simply be `y` (which was also stated in the initial state). Therefore, the only changes come from the assignments, but the values of `nx` and `ny` remain the same as previously defined.

The updated output state retains all the information of the precondition while only reflecting that `nx` and `ny` have been recalculated but remain equal to their initial definitions.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x + 1`, `ny` is equal to `y**.
