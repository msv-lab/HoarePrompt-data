Output State: **`dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y - 1`, `dist` remains unchanged except `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is now `(cur, 1)`, `queue` is now `queue` with an additional element `(ncur, 1)`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[1][ncur]` was greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1` before the assignment.**
