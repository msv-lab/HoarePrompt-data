Postcondition: ***If `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `queue` is updated to include `(ncur, 1)`. The distances in `dist[0]` and the parent nodes in `parent[0]` remain unchanged.***
