In the given code, `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The variables `dx` and `dy` are not specified in the initial state, but they typically represent directional changes to the coordinates `x` and `y`. 

Since `x` is not defined in the initial state but is implicitly understood to be the x-coordinate of the current position, the output state will reflect that `nx` and `ny` are determined based on the current values of `x` and `y`, modified by `dx` and `dy`.

The output state will retain all the initial conditions while updating the values of `nx` and `ny`. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is the current y-coordinate, `piece` must be equal to 1, `dist[1][ncur]` contains the shortest distances from the starting position to reachable positions in the grid, `parent[1][ncur]` indicates the predecessors of each position in the path, `queue` contains tuples of reachable positions with their respective piece values (which can be empty if no positions are reachable), `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`.**
