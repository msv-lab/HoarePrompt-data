Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, and `piece` and `dist` remain unchanged. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to (`cur`, `piece`), and `queue` now contains the element `(ncur, 2)`. Otherwise, the variables remain unchanged. If the condition `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` is not met, the variables remain unchanged.***
