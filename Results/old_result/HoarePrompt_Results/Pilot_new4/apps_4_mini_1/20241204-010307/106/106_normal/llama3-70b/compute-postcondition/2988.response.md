The line of code `parent[0][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the tuple `(cur, piece)` to the element at position `[0][ncur]` within the `parent` structure. 

Given that `piece` is equal to `0`, the specific assignment would be `parent[0][ncur] = (cur, 0)`. The other variables and their states remain unchanged, and the condition that `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1` continues to hold true.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dist` reflects the shortest distances for all reachable positions, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, 0)`, `queue` contains all tuples of reachable positions processed during the iterations, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
