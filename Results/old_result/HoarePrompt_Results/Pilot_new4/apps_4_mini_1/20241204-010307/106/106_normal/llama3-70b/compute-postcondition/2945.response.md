The line `parent[1][ncur] = cur, piece` is assigning the value of `cur` to `parent[1][ncur]`. The variable `piece` is not assigned to `parent[1][ncur]`, rather it is mentioned alongside the assignment. The previous state indicates that `parent[1][ncur]` was equal to `cur`, but after this line, it is now explicitly set to the value of `cur`. 

Since `parent[1][ncur]` is updated to `cur` but already was equal to it, the state of `parent[1][ncur]` remains consistent, with no change in its effective value. The variable `piece` remains undefined in terms of changes as it does not affect any other variables and is not changed by this line of code.

Thus, the output state updates only the value of `parent[1][ncur]` explicitly, even though it reflects the same as previously.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `dist` indicates at least one reachable position, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `piece` is equal to 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `0 + 1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
