Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable cells from `cur` based on all valid knight moves, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable cells, `queue` contains all valid tuples of `(ncur, piece)` appended during the iterations, and `piece` has the final value determined by the loop conditions. If no valid moves were found, `dist` and `parent` remain unchanged from their initial states.**
