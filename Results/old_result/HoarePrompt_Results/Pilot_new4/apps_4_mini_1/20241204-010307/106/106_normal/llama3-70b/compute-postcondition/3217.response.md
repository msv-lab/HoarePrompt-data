Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur`, `parent[1][ncur]` is established for those reachable positions, `queue` contains tuples `(ncur, 1)` for each valid `ncur` that met the conditions, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, and both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid such that `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
