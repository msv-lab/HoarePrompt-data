The values of `nx` and `ny` are calculated as follows: 

- `nx` is assigned the value of `x + dx`, which equals `0 + 1 = 1`. 
- `ny` is assigned the value of `y + dy`, which equals `1 + 0 = 1`. 

Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 1, `dist[1]` remains unchanged, `parent[1]` remains unchanged, `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`, `piece` is equal to 2, and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1` if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 1, `dist[1]` remains unchanged, `parent[1]` remains unchanged, `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`, `piece` is equal to 2, and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1` if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0.**
