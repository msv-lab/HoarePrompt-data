The values of `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. Since `x` is 4 and `y` is 2, `nx` becomes `4 + dx` and `ny` becomes `2 + dy`. The values of `dx` and `dy` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is at least 6, `x` is 4, `y` is 2, `nx` is equal to `4 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `dx` and `dy` cannot be adjusted further.

Output State: **`N` is at least 6, `x` is 4, `y` is 2, `nx` is equal to `4 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `dx` and `dy` cannot be adjusted further.**
