The code appends a tuple containing `ncur` and `0` to the `queue`. The values of the variables `ncur` and `queue` are affected, while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is 1, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the values `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`**.
