The code snippet adds a tuple containing `ncur` and `2` to the `queue`. The initial state provides the context for the variables but does not indicate that any values of the variables change except for the state of the `queue`.

Since `ncur` holds the value `A[1][3]`, and `queue` will now include that tuple, the output state will reflect the updated status of `queue`, while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 1, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 3, `ncur` is equal to `A[1][3]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`, `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`**.
