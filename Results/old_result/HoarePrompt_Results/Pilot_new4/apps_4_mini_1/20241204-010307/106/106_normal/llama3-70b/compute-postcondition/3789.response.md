In the given code, we have an array `dist` and we are updating its value at the position `[0][ncur]`. The value assigned to `dist[0][ncur]` is calculated by adding 1 to the current value at `dist[0][cur]`. 

From the initial state:
- `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`
- `x` is `2`
- `y` is `1`
- `nx` is `2 + dx`
- `ny` is `1 + dy`
- `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`

The variable `cur` is not defined in the initial state, so we will leave it as is. The exact value of `dist[0][cur]` is unknown as we don't have the value of `cur`. 

The expression for `dist[0][ncur]` becomes `dist[0][cur] + 1`. Hence, the only change in the state is at the `dist[0][ncur]` position, which now holds the previous value of `dist[0][cur]` incremented by 1.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `nx` is `2 + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[0][ncur]` is `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
