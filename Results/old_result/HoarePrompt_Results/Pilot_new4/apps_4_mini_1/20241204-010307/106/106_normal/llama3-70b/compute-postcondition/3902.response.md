The variable `ncur` is assigned the value from `A[nx][ny]`, and we are updating the value of `dist[1][ncur]`. The variable `cur` has not been defined in the initial state, and its value is unknown. However, we can express the new value of `dist[1][ncur]` in terms of `cur` as follows:

`dist[1][ncur]` is set to `dist[1][cur] + 1`. The exact value of `dist[1][ncur]` depends on the current value of `cur`, but we know it is incremented by 1 compared to `dist[1][cur]`.

Other variables retain their previous state. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `4 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 2; `y` is 2; `nx` is `2 + dx`; `ny` is `2 + dy`; `ncur` is assigned the value from `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is now `dist[1][cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `4 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 2; `y` is 2; `nx` is `2 + dx`; `ny` is `2 + dy`; `ncur` is assigned the value from `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is now `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
