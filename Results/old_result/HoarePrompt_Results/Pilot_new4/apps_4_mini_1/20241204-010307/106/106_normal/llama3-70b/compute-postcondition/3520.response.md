The statement `dist[0][ncur] = dist[0][cur] + 1` updates the value in a two-dimensional array `dist`. The value at `dist[0][ncur]` is set to the value of `dist[0][cur]` plus 1. The variables `ncur`, `cur`, and `dist` are involved, while the other variables (`N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`) remain unchanged.

1. The variable `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, which is the element in the 2D array `A` at position `(nx, ny)`. 
2. The variable `cur` is not defined in the initial state, but it impacts the assignment to `dist[0][ncur]`.
3. The variable `dist[0][cur]` is accessed to get its value, and we add 1 to this value to set the new value of `dist[0][ncur]`.

Since `dist[0][ncur]` is updated based on the value of `dist[0][cur]`, the exact values of `dist[0][ncur]` and `dist[0][cur]` after execution will depend on their initial values.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is within `0` and `N-1`, `y` is within `0` and `N-1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
