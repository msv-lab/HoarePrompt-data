Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; if `piece` is equal to 1, `dist` is updated to reflect the shortest path distances for all valid `ncur` positions reachable from `(x, y)`, `parent` stores the corresponding previous positions and piece types for those reachable `ncur`, and `queue` includes all reachable tuples `(ncur, 1)`. If no valid `(nx, ny)` positions updated `dist`, then `dist` remains unchanged from its initial state, and `queue` could potentially be empty if no tuples were appended during the loop execution.**
