Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `dist[1]` contains updated distances for valid positions reachable from (1, 1), `parent[1]` contains predecessors for valid positions reachable from (1, 1), `queue` contains tuples of all valid positions that had their distances updated during the loop execution. If no valid positions were reachable, `dist[1]` remains unchanged from its initial state, `parent[1]` remains unchanged, and `queue` is empty.**
