In this scenario, we are updating the `dist` array at position `[1][ncur]`. The value at this position is set to the value at `dist[1][cur]` plus 1. 

Given:
- `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y + 1]`. 
- The values of `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged except for the specific update in `dist`.

The variable `cur` is not defined in the initial state provided, but it is referenced in the update to `dist`. Therefore, we denote `dist[1][cur]` as an unknown value, let's call it `V`.

After executing the code:
- The value of `dist[1][ncur]` becomes `V + 1`.

Since `ncur` is derived from `A[x - 1][y + 1]`, we know that the variable `dist` at this specific position is now incremented by 1.

Output State: **`dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y + 1]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and the values of `parent` and `queue` remain unchanged.**
