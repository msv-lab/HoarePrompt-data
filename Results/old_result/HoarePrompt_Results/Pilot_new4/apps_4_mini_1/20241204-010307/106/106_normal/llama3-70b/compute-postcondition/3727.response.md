To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze how the loop operates and the conditions that are involved for it to execute again.

The loop iterates over a list of tuples `[(−1,−1), (−1,1), (1,−1), (1,1)]`. For each iteration, `dx` and `dy` will take on one of these pairs of values. 

1. **Current State Analysis**:
   - `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`.
   - `x` is 2, `y` is 0. 
   - `nx` is calculated as `2 + dx`, and `ny` is `0 + dy`. 
   - The conditions for valid indices are `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`.

2. **Iterations for `dx` and `dy`**:
   - For the first tuple `(-1, -1)`, `nx = 2 + (-1) = 1`, `ny = 0 + (-1) = -1` (invalid since `ny` is out of range).
   - For the second tuple `(-1, 1)`, `nx = 1`, `ny = 1` (valid).
   - For the third tuple `(1, -1)`, `nx = 3`, `ny = -1` (invalid).
   - For the fourth tuple `(1, 1)`, `nx = 3`, `ny = 1` (valid).

So, based on the valid pairs, we assume that the loop will continue executing until all tuples are processed. 

3. **State Adjustment**:
   - The loop will iterate four times, changing `dx` and `dy` each time according to the tuples. 
   - After executing the body of the loop for the last tuple `(1, 1)`, we need to prepare the state for the next iteration.
   - After the last valid iteration, `dx` and `dy` would take on the next values in the list, hence for the next iteration, `dx`, `dy` would be reset to the first tuple since all tuples are processed.

Given that all tuples were processed, on the next iteration, `dx` and `dy` would revert to the first tuple `(-1, -1)`.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `piece` is 1, `nx` is 1, `ny` is -1 (invalid). The loop will not execute again if the indices are invalid.**
