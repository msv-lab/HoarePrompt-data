Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `x + dx` is within the bounds of `A`, `y + dy` is within the bounds of `A`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[0][ncur]` contains the minimum distance from `cur` to each reachable position `ncur`, `parent[0][ncur]` represents the previous position leading to `ncur`, `queue` contains reachable positions which can be updated, `queue` must not be empty, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, and `ny` is equal to `y + dy`. If `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `queue` now includes `(ncur, 1)`.***
