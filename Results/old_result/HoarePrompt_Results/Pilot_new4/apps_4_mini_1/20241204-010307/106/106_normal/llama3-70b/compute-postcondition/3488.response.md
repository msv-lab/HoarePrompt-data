The code updates the `dist` array at the specific indices `[2][ncur]` by assigning it the value of `dist[2][cur] + 1`. The variable `ncur` is derived from the value of `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is calculated as `x + dx` and `ny` as `y + dy`. The other variables (`N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `cur`) remain unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` and `y` are within `0` and `N-1`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
