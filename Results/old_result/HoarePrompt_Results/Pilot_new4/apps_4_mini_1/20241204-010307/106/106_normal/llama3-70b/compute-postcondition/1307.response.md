The variable `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur` and `piece`. The previous values of `ncur` can be either 0, 2, or 1, and `cur` is a variable that has not been specified in the initial state. However, the structure of the code indicates that `parent[2]` at index `ncur` is now updated with the new values.

Since `N` is between 3 and 10, `x`, `y`, and `ncur` can hold several values, but these values remain unchanged in this operation. The assignment does not modify other variables.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 2; `nx` is either 0, 2, or 1; `ny` is either 2, 2, 1, or 3; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is now assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.**
