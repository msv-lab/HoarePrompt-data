The statement `dist[0][ncur] = dist[0][cur] + 1` updates the distance value at the position `[0][ncur]` in the `dist` array. The value assigned is the distance from the first index of `dist` to `cur`, increased by 1. The previous state of `dist[0][cur]` remains valid, and since the distance from the first index of `dist` to `ncur` is greater than this updated value plus one, the precondition regarding `dist` must still hold.

The updated value `dist[0][ncur]` can be expressed as `dist[0][cur] + 1`. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `A`, `cur`, `ncur`, and the conditions regarding `piece`, `nx`, `ny`, and the distances remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `A` is a 2D array where `A[1][0]` equals `cur`, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[1 + dx][dy]`, the current values satisfy `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, the value of `piece` is 0, the distance from the first index of `dist` to `ncur` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `dist[0][ncur] = dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
