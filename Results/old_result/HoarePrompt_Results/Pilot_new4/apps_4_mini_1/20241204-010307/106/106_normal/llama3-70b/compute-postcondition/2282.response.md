Postcondition: ***`dist`, `parent`, and `queue` are unchanged; `y` is N; `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy` for each pair (-2, -1), (-2, 1), (-1, -2), (-1, 2), (1, -2), (1, 2), (2, -1), (2, 1); `ncur` is the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The current value of `piece` is 0, and the value of `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`.***
