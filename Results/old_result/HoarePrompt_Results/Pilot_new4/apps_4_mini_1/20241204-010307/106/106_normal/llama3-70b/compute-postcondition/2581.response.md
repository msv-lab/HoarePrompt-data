Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is an integer less than `N`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and the current values of `nx` and `ny` satisfy `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`. If `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. Otherwise, no changes occur in these variables.***
