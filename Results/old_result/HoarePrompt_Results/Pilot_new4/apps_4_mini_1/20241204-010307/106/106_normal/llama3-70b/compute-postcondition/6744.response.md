The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are both within the bounds of the grid, which means they are valid indices for accessing the `A` array. The specific values of `nx` and `ny` are not provided, but they are derived from `1 + dx` and `2 + dy`, respectively. The state of other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `dist[1]` contains updated distances for valid positions reachable from (1, 1), `parent[1]` contains predecessors for valid positions reachable from (1, 1), `queue` contains tuples of all reachable positions from (1, 1) that had their distances updated during the loop, `piece` must not equal `i` for `(cur, 2)` to be added to `queue`, `nx` is equal to `1 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
