The code updates the value of `dist[0][ncur]` by adding 1 to the value of `dist[0][cur]`. The variable `ncur` has been assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, but without the specific values of `A`, `cur`, or the content of `dist`, we cannot determine the exact new value of `dist[0][ncur]`. However, we know that it will increase by 1 from its previous value. 

The values of `N`, `y`, `piece`, `dx`, `dy`, `ny`, `nx`, and `ncur` remain unchanged since they are not directly affected by this code. 

Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10; `y` is 2; `piece` is 0; `dx` is -2; `dy` is -1; `ny` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x - 2; `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10; `y` is 2; `piece` is 0; `dx` is -2; `dy` is -1; `ny` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x - 2; `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1.**
