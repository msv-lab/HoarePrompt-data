The variable `ncur` is assigned the value from the array `A` at indices `nx` and `ny`, where `nx` is equal to -2 and `ny` is equal to -1. However, since `nx` and `ny` are specified to be within the bounds of `0` and `N-1`, having negative values for `nx` and `ny` indicates that they are out of bounds and will not refer to a valid element in the array `A`. Therefore, the assignment may lead to an error or an undefined state in typical execution. 

Nonetheless, if we treat the code as formally valid (hypothetically assigning a value based on the provided indices), the output state would reflect that the assignment would not change any existing values since accessing `A[nx][ny]` is not valid.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is -2, `ny` is -1; `ncur` assignment is invalid due to out-of-bounds indices**.
