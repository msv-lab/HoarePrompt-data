Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `dist` indicates at least one reachable position, `parent` reflects the predecessor for the updated position, `queue` contains at least one tuple for the processed position, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and the current values of `nx` and `ny` satisfy the condition `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`.***
