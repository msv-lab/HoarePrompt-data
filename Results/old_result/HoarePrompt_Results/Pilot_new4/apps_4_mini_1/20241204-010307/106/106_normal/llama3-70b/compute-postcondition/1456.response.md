The code appends a tuple containing `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The value of `ncur` is unknown as it depends on the value of `A[1][0]`, but it's assigned from there. The rest of the variables remain unaffected by this operation, and the structure `queue` will now contain one additional element, which is the tuple `(ncur, 1)`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 2; `y` is 1; `nx` is 1; `ny` is 0; `dx` is -1; `dy` is -1; `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[1][0]`; `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `cur, piece`; `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`**.
