The code assigns the value of `dist[1][cur] + 1` to `dist[1][ncur]`. Given that `piece` is equal to 1, the code's execution is valid and will update `dist[1][ncur]`. The specific values for `dist[1][cur]` and `ncur` are not provided, but we know `ncur` is valid for updates. 

The impact of the code is that `dist[1][ncur]` will now be equal to the previous value of `dist[1][cur] + 1`. The other preconditions remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `x` is defined and within bounds, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dx` and `dy` are taken from the list of tuples for possible moves, `ncur` is valid for `dist` updates when `piece` is 0, `piece` is equal to 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
