According to the code, the loop iterates over pairs of values `(dx, dy)` representing directional movements in a grid (up, down, left, right). The loop will execute four times, once for each pair in the list.

At the end of the last iteration, `dx` and `dy` would have taken on values from the last pair in the list, which is `(0, 1)`. Therefore, for the next iteration of the loop, the next pair would need to be taken, which in this case is the first pair `(-1, 0)`.

Additionally, the values of the variables `N`, `dist`, `parent`, `piece`, `nx`, `ny`, and the conditions related to them do not change within the loop body based on the provided information, so they remain the same.

State: **`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent[2][ncur]` is updated to `cur`, `piece` remains 2, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, and `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1` if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0**
