The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned values based on the expressions `x + dx` and `y + dy` respectively. The variable `y` is equal to `N`, which is an integer between 3 and 10. Therefore, `ny` takes the value `N + dy`. The initial state of `x` is a valid integer within bounds, and the values of `dx` and `dy` are unknown but will influence the final values of `nx` and `ny`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 3 and 10; `y` is equal to `N`; `x` is a valid integer within bounds; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `N + dy`.**
