The value of `ncur` is assigned the value from the matrix `A` at the position `(nx, ny)`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are directly related to the previously defined values of `x` and `y`, specifically `nx` is equal to `x - 1` and `ny` is equal to `y`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `dist` contains the shortest distances from (3, 0) to all reachable positions, `piece` is equal to 2, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y]`.

Output State: **`dist` contains the shortest distances from (3, 0) to all reachable positions, `piece` is equal to 2, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y]`.**
