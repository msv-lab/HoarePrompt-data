The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The initial values of `x` and `y` are both 0, so `nx` will equal `dx` and `ny` will equal `dy`. The state of other variables remains unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `dist[1][ncur]` contains the updated minimum distances, `parent[1][ncur]` contains the respective parent information, `queue` contains reachable positions (which may be empty).
