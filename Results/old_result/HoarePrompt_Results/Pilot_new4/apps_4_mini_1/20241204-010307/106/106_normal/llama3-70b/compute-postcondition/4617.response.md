Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dist[1]` reflects updated distances based on valid moves, `parent[1]` contains updated parent relationships for valid moves, `queue` must contain potential next states based on valid moves from the initial position, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, if the coordinates `(nx, ny)` are within bounds (0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N), then `queue` includes an additional entry `(ncur, 2)`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and if `piece` equals 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1` and `parent[2][ncur]` becomes `(cur, piece)`; otherwise, no changes are made.***
