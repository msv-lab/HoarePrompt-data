The code line updates the value of `dist[1][ncur]` to be equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`. Given that `dist[1][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, the new value of `dist[1][ncur]` will now equal `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and thus will no longer satisfy the original condition of being greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `nx` is between 0 and N-1, `ny` is between 0 and N-1, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `cur` is defined, `piece` is 1, and `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
