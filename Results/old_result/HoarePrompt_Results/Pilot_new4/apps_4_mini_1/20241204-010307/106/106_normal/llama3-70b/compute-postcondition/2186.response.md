Output State: **`dist[2][...]` contains the shortest path distances for reachable indices from the current position, `parent[2][...]` reflects the parent nodes for each updated index, `queue` contains all reachable indices with their corresponding piece value, and `piece` is 2. If the loop does not execute, `dist` remains unchanged, `parent` retains its original state, and `queue` is empty.**
