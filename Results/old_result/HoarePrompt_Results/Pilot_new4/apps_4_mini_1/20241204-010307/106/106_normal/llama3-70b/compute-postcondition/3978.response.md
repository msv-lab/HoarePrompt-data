The code updates the value of `dist[1][ncur]`. It sets `dist[1][ncur]` to be equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`. Given the preconditions, we know the following:

- `dist[1][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, so after the assignment, it will now be equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, thus satisfying the condition that it was originally greater. 

No other variables are directly affected by this code. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `parent[0]`, `queue`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and `piece` remain unchanged in this context.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[0]` contains parent information, `queue` is empty, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]` where `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, `piece` is equal to 1, and `dist[1][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[1][cur]`.**
