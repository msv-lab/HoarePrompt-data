The code `queue.append((ncur, 0))` adds a new tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `0` are included in the tuple to be appended. None of the other variables in the initial state are affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values and the addition of the new tuple to the `queue`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `cur` is unchanged, `dist[1]` remains unchanged, `parent[1]` remains unchanged, `piece` is equal to 0, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to the minimum distance from `(0, 2)`, `parent[2][ncur]` contains the updated parent positions, `nx` is equal to `0 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`, `queue` contains a new tuple `(ncur, 0)` added.**
