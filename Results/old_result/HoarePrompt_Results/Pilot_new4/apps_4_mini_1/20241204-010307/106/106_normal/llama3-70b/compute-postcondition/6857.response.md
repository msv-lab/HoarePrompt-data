According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the values of `dx` and `dy` being iterated over in the list of tuples. The loop will execute for each tuple in the list, which contains pairs of directional offsets. 

The state before the loop starts indicates that the program is set up to iterate over the directions given in the list. There are no specific conditions related to `N`, `y`, `A`, `dist`, `parent`, or `queue` that would prevent the loop from executing as long as the loop is structured to iterate over the provided pairs. 

Therefore, for the loop to be executed, all that is required is for the loop to start iterating. The variables involved in the loop (`dx` and `dy`) will simply take values from the tuples in the list.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `x` is between 2 and N-1, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` are unchanged, `dx` and `dy` will take values from the pairs in [(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]**
