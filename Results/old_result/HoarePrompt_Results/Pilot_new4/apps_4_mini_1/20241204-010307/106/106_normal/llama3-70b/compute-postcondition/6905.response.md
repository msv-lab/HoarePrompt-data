The statement `dist[2][ncur] = dist[2][cur] + 1` assigns a new value to `dist[2][ncur]`. The variable `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `nx` is equal to `x + 1`. The initial state tells us that `N` is between 3 and 10, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is `y`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. However, we do not have specific values for `cur`, `dist`, `A`, `x`, or `y`.

The code will update `dist[2][ncur]` by adding 1 to the value of `dist[2][cur]`. Since we do not know the specific values of `dist[2][cur]` or `ncur`, we can only express the change in a general manner.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `dx` is 1; `dy` is 0; `nx` is `x + 1`; `ny` is `y`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
