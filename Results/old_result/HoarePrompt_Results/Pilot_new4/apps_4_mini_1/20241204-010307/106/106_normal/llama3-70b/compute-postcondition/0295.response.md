The code assigns the value of `cur` to `parent[0][ncur]` and assigns the value of `piece` to it as well. The other variables remain unchanged. The values of `parent[0][ncur]` now depend on the value of `cur`, and `piece` is also maintained. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `piece`**
