The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to the `parent[2][ncur]`. The values of `cur` and `piece` are not explicitly provided in the initial state but are assumed to have been defined earlier in the program. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `piece` is 2, `dx` is 0, `dy` is -1, `nx` is 0, `ny` is 1, `ncur` is equal to `A[0][1]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `piece`.**
