According to the code, the loop can execute if the variable `x` is less than `N`. Given that at the end of the last iteration, `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, we need to consider the value of `x` at the end of the last iteration to determine the state for the next iteration. 

Since `x` starts at 0 and increments by 1 after each iteration, if the loop executed at least once, we can assume that `x` is now equal to the number of iterations completed. Therefore, if `x` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, it must be less than `N` for the loop to execute again. 

If `N` is, for example, 3, then `x` would be 2 at the end of the previous iteration. If `N` is 10, then `x` would be 9 at the end of the previous iteration. Hence to execute one more time, `x` must be adjusted to `k + 1`.

To summarize, if `x` was `k`, we will adjust it to `k + 1`, and for the loop to be executed one more time, it must hold that `k + 1 < N`. 

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `dist` contains the shortest distances for all reachable `ncur` values from the starting point for each piece type, `parent` holds the corresponding previous positions for each `piece`, `queue` contains all tuples of reachable states based on the pieces and their moves, `x` is incremented to `k + 1` where `k < N - 1`.**
