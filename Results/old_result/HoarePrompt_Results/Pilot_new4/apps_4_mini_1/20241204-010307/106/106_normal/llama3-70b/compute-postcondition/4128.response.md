To analyze the provided information, we must consider the current state and how the for loop will impact it.

The loop iterates over the list of tuples `[(dx, dy), (-2, -1), (-2, 1), (-1, -2), (-1, 2), (1, -2), (1, 2), (2, -1), (2, 1)]`. For each iteration, the variables `dx` and `dy` will take on the values of each tuple in the list sequentially. 

1. At the end of the previous iteration:
    - `x` is 0
    - `y` is 2
    - `dx` is currently set to the last tuple processed, which is likely to be the one before the loop ends. If we assume the last tuple processed was `(-2, 1)`, then `dx` is likely to be `(-2, 1)` before the next iteration begins.
    
2. The loop will now proceed to the next tuple in the sequence, which would be `(1, 2)` in a typical sequential execution, but since we donâ€™t specify which tuple was processed last, we need to keep that general.

3. The loop can execute as long as there are more tuples in the list. With 8 tuples in total, after 7 iterations, the loop will move to the 8th tuple.

However, we don't need to know the value of `dx` and `dy` at the end of the previous iteration to determine the state for the next iteration. We need to focus on how many tuples have been processed and how the state will change. 

The loop will continue processing until it has gone through all tuples. Therefore, the relevant state to update is:

- The state of `dx` and `dy` needs to reflect the next tuple in the sequence.
- There's no direct dependence on the values of `ncur`, `dist`, or `parent` for this specific task of determining the state.

To conclude, assuming the last processed tuple was `(-2, 1)` and we are moving to the next tuple `(1, 2)`:

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 2**
