The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is equal to `x - 2` and `ny` is 2. The value of `nx` depends on the value of `x`, which is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `ncur`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dist` reflects the shortest distances for all reachable positions, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `queue` contains the previous elements plus the new tuple `(ncur, 0)`, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is 2, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
