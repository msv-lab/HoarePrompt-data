The code assigns a value to `parent[0][ncur]`, where `ncur` is previously defined as `A[nx][ny]`. The value assigned is a tuple consisting of `cur` and `piece`. Since `nx` is defined as `1 + dx` and `ny` is defined as `2 + dy`, `ncur` will depend on the values of `dx` and `dy`. However, the specific values of `A`, `cur`, and `piece` are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact value of `parent[0][ncur]` but can note that this value is now set.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State includes all the existing states of the variables.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 2; `nx` is equal to `1 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`**.
