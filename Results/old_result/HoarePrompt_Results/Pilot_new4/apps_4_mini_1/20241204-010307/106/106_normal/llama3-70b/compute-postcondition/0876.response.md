Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is 0, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[0][0]`. If `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is assigned `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` has a new element `(ncur, 2)` appended. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
