According to the code, the for loop iterates over the list of tuples representing `dx` and `dy` changes. The loop will execute for each tuple in the list, which consists of eight pairs. At the end of the last iteration, `dx` is -2 and `dy` is 1, which corresponds to the last tuple processed in the loop. 

To execute one more time, the loop needs to move to the next tuple in the list of changes. The next tuple after (-2, 1) is (-1, -2). 

As such, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- `dx` becomes -1
- `dy` becomes -2

Therefore, the relevant state remains unchanged for `N`, `y`, `A`, `cur`, `nx`, `ny`, `piece`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue`, as those values do not depend on the iteration of the loop itself.

Thus, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is -1, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -2, `nx` is `x - 2`, and `ny` is 0.**
