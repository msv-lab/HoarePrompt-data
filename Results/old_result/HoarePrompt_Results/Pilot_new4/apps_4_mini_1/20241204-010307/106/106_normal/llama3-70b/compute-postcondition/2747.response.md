Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is the current y-coordinate, `piece` is not equal to the value represented by `i`, `dist[0][ncur]` holds the shortest distance from the start to all reachable positions in the grid, `parent[0][ncur]` indicates the predecessor of each position in the path, and `queue` contains the tuples of reachable positions with their respective piece values. If no positions are reachable, `dist` and `parent` remain unmodified for those positions, and `queue` is empty.**
