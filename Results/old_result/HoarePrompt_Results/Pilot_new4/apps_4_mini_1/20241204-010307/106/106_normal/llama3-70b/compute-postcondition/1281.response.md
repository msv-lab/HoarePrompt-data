The `queue` variable is updated by appending the tuple `(ncur, 1)` to it. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ncur` is derived from the expression `A[0][3]`, which is not specified but is valid as part of the precondition. Therefore, the state reflects that `queue` now includes an additional tuple with the current position and a value of `1`, while all other variables retain their previous states.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `cur` is unchanged, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `dist[0]` contains the updated distances for reachable positions, `parent[0]` reflects the paths taken, `piece` is 1, `nx` is 0, `ny` is 3, `ncur` is `A[0][3]`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `parent[1][ncur]` is `(cur, 1)`, `queue` contains tuples of all updated positions plus the tuple `(ncur, 1)`.**
