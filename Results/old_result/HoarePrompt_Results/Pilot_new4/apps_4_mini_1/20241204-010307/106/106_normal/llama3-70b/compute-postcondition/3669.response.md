The code assigns `cur` and `piece` to `parent[2][ncur]`. The value of `ncur` is derived from the initial state, where `ncur = A[x - 1][y]`. The other variables (`N`, `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, `dist[2][ncur]`) remain unchanged in the context of this code. 

Therefore, after executing the code, the updated output state would be:

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is between 0 and `N-1`; `y` is between 0 and `N-1`; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 0; `nx` is `x - 1`; `ny` is `y`; `ncur` is `A[x - 1][y]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur, piece`.**
