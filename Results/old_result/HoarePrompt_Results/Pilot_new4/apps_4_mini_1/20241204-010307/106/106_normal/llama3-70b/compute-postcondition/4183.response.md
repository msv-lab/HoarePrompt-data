The values of `nx` and `ny` are calculated based on the values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. The initial values are `x = 0` and `y = 2`. Since `dx` and `dy` are not defined in the initial state, we cannot assign specific values to `nx` and `ny`. Therefore, we keep them as expressions. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `nx` is `0 + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `dist` and `parent` remain unchanged, `queue` remains unchanged.**
