The code `nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy` assigns new values to `nx` and `ny`. The values of `dx` and `dy` are known: `dx` is 2 and `dy` is 1. So we can compute:

- `nx` becomes `x + 2`.
- `ny` becomes `y + 1`, which is `9 + 1 = 10`.

Now, let's evaluate the output state based on the conditions provided.

- Since `N` is greater than or equal to 9, `nx`, which is `x + 2`, will be within the bounds as long as `x` is at least 0.
- `ny` equals 10, which is not within the bounds (0 <= ny < N) unless `N` is greater than 10.

Assuming `N > 10`, we can proceed to update the output state:

- `nx` is equal to `x + 2`.
- `ny` is equal to `10`.

The values of other variables such as `N`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `ncur`, `dist`, `cur`, `piece`, and the queue remain unchanged.

Thus, the output state reflects the new computed values for `nx` and `ny`:

Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 9, `y` is 9, `dx` is 2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x + 2`, `ny` is equal to 10.**
