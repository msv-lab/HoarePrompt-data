Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `x` is defined and within bounds, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `dx` and `dy` are taken from the list of tuples for possible moves, `ncur` is valid for `dist` updates when `piece` is 0, and the current values satisfy the conditions 0 <= `nx` < `N` and 0 <= `ny` < `N`.***
