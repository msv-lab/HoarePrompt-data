The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` and `ny` have already been defined and their values fall within the bounds of the array `A`. The other variables maintain their previous states. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `dist` indicates at least one reachable position, `parent` reflects the predecessor for the updated position, `queue` contains at least one tuple for the processed position, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, the current values of `nx` and `ny` satisfy the condition `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `dist` indicates at least one reachable position, `parent` reflects the predecessor for the updated position, `queue` contains at least one tuple for the processed position, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `0 <= nx < N`, `0 <= ny < N`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
