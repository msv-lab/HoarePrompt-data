Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` equals `N`, `ny` equals `N + dy`, `nx` equals `x + dx` (undefined), and both `nx` and `ny` are between 0 and N (exclusive). If `piece` is equal to 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to be equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is now equal to `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, there are no changes made to the variables.***
