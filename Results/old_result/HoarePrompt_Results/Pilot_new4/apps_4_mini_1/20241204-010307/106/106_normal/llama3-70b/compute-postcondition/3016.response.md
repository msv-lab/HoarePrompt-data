The operation `queue.append((ncur, 1))` adds a tuple containing `ncur` and the integer `1` to the `queue`. There are no changes to the other variables based on this operation. The `queue` will now contain an additional tuple `(ncur, 1)`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `piece` is 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `dist[1][ncur]` is no longer greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `dist` may be updated based on reachable positions, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `piece`, `queue` contains tuples of reachable positions and now also includes `(ncur, 1)`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
