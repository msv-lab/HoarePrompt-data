The code assigns the values of `nx` and `ny` based on the addition of `dx` and `dy` to `x` and `y`, respectively. The initial state gives the possible values of `dx` and `dy`, but since `x` is not defined in the initial state, `nx` will depend on the value of `x`. Each combination of `dx` and `dy` will yield different possible values for `nx` and `ny`.

However, since the specific value of `x` is unknown, we cannot compute an exact value for `nx` and `ny`. Instead, we can state that they will be dependent on the initial value of `x` and the chosen `dx` and `dy`. The variable `piece` remains unchanged, and `ncur` is defined based on valid combinations of `nx` and `ny`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `dx` and `dy` take on values from [(-2, -1), (-2, 1), (-1, -2), (-1, 2), (1, -2), (1, 2), (2, -1), (2, 1)], `piece` is 0, `x` is such that `nx = x + dx` and `ny = 2 + dy`, and `ncur` is defined based on valid `nx` and `ny`.**
