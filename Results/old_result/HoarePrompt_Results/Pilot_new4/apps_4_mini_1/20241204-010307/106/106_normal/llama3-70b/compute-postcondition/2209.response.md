Postcondition: ***`dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the updated parent at index `0` for `ncur`, which is now `cur`. `queue` contains two elements `[(cur, n + 1), (ncur, 0)]`, with `nx` equal to `x - 2`, `ny` equal to `y + 1`, `ncur` equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, while `parent[0][ncur]` is updated to `cur`, if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`. If the condition `0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N` is not satisfied, no changes are made to `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.***
