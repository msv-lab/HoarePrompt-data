The code assigns `parent[1][ncur]` the tuple `(cur, piece)`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions indicate that `ncur` has a specific value from the array `A` based on the calculated indices `nx` and `ny`. 

Since `piece` is equal to 1 and `cur` represents a value from the array `A[x][y]`, we can state the changes as follows:

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 0; `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`; `x` is between 2 and N-1; `nx` can be `x - 1` or `x + 1`; `ny` can be -1 or 1 based on the pairs in `dx` and `dy`; 0 <= `nx` < `N`; 0 <= `ny` < `N`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is equal to 1; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; distance from `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1; parent[1][ncur] is equal to (cur, 1)**.
