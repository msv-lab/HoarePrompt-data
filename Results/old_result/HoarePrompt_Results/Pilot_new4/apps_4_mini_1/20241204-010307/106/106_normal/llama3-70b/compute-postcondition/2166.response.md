The code assigns a value to `parent[2][ncur]`, where `cur` is the current index. The state of the other variables remains unchanged as the assignment does not affect them. 

Thus, the output state reflects that `parent[2][ncur]` is now assigned a tuple containing `cur` and `piece`.

Output State: **`dist` contains valid distances for reachable indices, `parent[1][ncur]` reflects the parent tracking for each updated index, `queue` contains tuples `(ncur, 1)` for each updated index during the loop, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and the current value of `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to be greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1; parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`**.
