The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[1][ncur]`. The states of the other variables are not directly affected by this assignment. However, we know that `piece` is equal to 1 and that `ncur` is assigned from `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` can be -1 or 1 and `ny` can be 0 or 2. Therefore, `parent[1][ncur]` will now reflect the current position `(cur, piece)`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `queue` may contain multiple elements as a result of appending `(ncur, 0)` for valid `(nx, ny)` positions; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `nx` can be -1 or 1; `ny` can be 0 or 2; `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` reflects the minimum distance found from `cur` to `ncur` incremented by the number of valid iterations; `parent[0][ncur]` holds the last valid parent value of `(cur, piece)`; `piece` is equal to 1; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1; parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`.**
