The code assigns the value of `A[nx][ny]` to `ncur`. The variables `nx` and `ny` are defined as `dx` and `2 + dy` respectively. The value of `A` at the position `[nx][ny]` will determine the new value of `ncur`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `cur` is unchanged, `dist[1]` remains unchanged, `parent[1]` remains unchanged, `piece` is equal to 0, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to the minimum distance from `(0, 2)`, `parent[2][ncur]` contains the updated parent positions, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
