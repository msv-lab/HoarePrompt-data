According to the code, the for loop is iterating over a fixed list of tuples representing directional movements. The loop will execute regardless of the other state variables (`N`, `queue`, `x`, `dist`, `parent`, and `y`) since the loop itself is not dependent on their values. Each iteration will assign new values to `dx` and `dy` based on the tuples in the list.

However, we should consider how the loop interacts with the outer program state. The loop is expected to work with the variables in the body of the loop, which is omitted. Since no preconditions are specified for `dx` and `dy`, they can be initialized to the first values in the list.

To summarize, the state of `dx` and `dy` should be set to the first tuple in the list for the loop to start executing correctly. For the first iteration, `dx` would be -2 and `dy` would be -1.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` is not empty, `x` is 1, `dist` is updated for all valid `ncur`, `parent` is updated for each valid `ncur`, `queue` contains all satisfying tuples `(ncur, piece)`, `y` is 0, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1**
