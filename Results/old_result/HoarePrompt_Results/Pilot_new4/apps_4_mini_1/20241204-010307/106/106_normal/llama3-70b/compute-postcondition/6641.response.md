According to the code, the loop iterates over the list of directions specified by `[(dx, dy)]`. Each iteration will assign new values to `dx` and `dy` from the list. 

At the end of the last iteration, the state is as follows:
- `N` is between 3 and 10,
- `x` is 1,
- `y` is 0,
- `nx` is equal to `1 + dx`,
- `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`.

The list of directions is `[(−1, 0), (1, 0), (0, −1), (0, 1)]`, which means that the loop will iterate four times, once for each of the direction pairs.

In the previous iteration, the loop executed for one of the directions, and we need to determine which direction was last used. The possible pairs are:
1. First iteration: `dx = -1`, `dy = 0`
2. Second iteration: `dx = 1`, `dy = 0`
3. Third iteration: `dx = 0`, `dy = -1`
4. Fourth iteration: `dx = 0`, `dy = 1`

Assuming the last direction used was the first one, `(dx, dy) = (-1, 0)`, then `nx` would be `1 - 1 = 0` and `ny` would be `0 + 0 = 0`. For the next iteration, it will use the second direction pair `(1, 0)`, which gives:
- `nx = 1 + 1 = 2`
- `ny = 0 + 0 = 0`

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, the next values of `dx` and `dy` will be updated accordingly. The next direction pair will be `(0, -1)` in the third iteration. Therefore, we need to set `dx` and `dy` to `0` and `-1`, respectively.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `nx` is 1, `ny` is -1**
