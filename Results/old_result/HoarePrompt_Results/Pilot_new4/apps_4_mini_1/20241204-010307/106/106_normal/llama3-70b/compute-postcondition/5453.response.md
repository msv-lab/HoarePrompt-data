The provided code appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `queue` has been updated, while all other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is 4; `y` is 2; `nx` is equal to `4 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`; both `nx` and `ny` are between 0 and `N-1`; `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value `cur`, `piece`; `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`.**
