The code assigns new values to `nx` and `ny`, calculated by adding `dx` and `dy` to `x` and `y`, respectively. Given that `dx` is -1 and `dy` is 0, the calculations proceed as follows:

1. For `nx`: `nx = x + dx = 2 + (-1) = 1`
2. For `ny`: `ny = y + dy = 0 + 0 = 0`

The other variables (`N`, `queue`) remain unchanged in this context. Therefore, the Output State reflects the new values of `nx` and `ny` while preserving the existing constraints on `N`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 0, and the `queue` contains at least one valid `(ncur, 1)` pair, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0**.
