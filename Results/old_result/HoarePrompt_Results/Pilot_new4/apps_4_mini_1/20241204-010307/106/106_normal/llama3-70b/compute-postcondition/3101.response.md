The variable `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned a tuple `(cur, piece)`. The values of `cur` and `piece` are not specified in the initial state, but `piece` remains 1, so it is assigned the value of `cur` alongside `piece`.

The output state will include the updated value of `parent[1][ncur]` while keeping the other variables unchanged. Since `N`, `y`, `piece`, `x`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and `dist` were not directly altered by this operation, we retain their initial definitions.

Output State: **`N` is greater than 3 and less than or equal to 10, `y` is 2, `piece` is 1, `x` is at least 1, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `dist[1][ncur]` is no longer greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, 1)`**.
