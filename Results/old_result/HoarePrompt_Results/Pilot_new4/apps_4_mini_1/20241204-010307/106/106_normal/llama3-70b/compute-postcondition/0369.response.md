According to the code, the execution of the for loop depends on the tuples `(dx, dy)` that are iterated over. There are 8 pairs of `(dx, dy)`, and each iteration uses one of these pairs. At the end of the last iteration, `dx` is -2 and `dy` is -1.

The next pair in the list is `(-2, 1)`, which will be used for the next iteration of the loop. So, we need to update `dx` and `dy` to reflect this next pair.

There are no other states that need adjustment in this context, as the loop is simply iterating over the predefined list of pairs.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is `x - 2`, and `ny` is 0**
