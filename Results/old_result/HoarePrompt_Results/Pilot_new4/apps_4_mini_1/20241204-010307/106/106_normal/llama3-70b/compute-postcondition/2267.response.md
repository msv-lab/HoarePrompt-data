In the provided code snippet, `dist[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `dist[2][cur] + 1`. The variable `cur` is not defined in the initial state, but we can infer that it would hold a specific value from the previous context. 

Given that:

- `piece` is 1 (not affected)
- `(dx, dy)` is (0, -1) (not affected)
- `nx` is `x` (not affected)
- `ny` is `y - 1` (not affected)
- `ncur` is `A[x][y - 1]` (not affected, but its value depends on `A` and the specific indices)

The main change occurs to `dist[2][ncur]`, which will be updated based on the value of `dist[2][cur]`. 

Since we don't have the value of `cur`, we will denote `dist[2][cur]` as a variable since its specific value is not provided. 

Therefore, the output state will reflect the change made by the assignment without specifying the exact values of `cur` or `dist` beyond their general conditions.

Output State: **`piece` is 1, `(dx, dy)` is (0, -1), `nx` is `x`, `ny` is `y - 1, ncur` is `A[x][y - 1], dist[2][ncur] is updated to dist[2][cur] + 1**
