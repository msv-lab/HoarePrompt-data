The code appends a new tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. The `queue` variable is updated to include this new tuple, while the other variables remain unchanged. 

Since the initial state provides that `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]` and given that `nx` is `x - 1` and `ny` is `y`, this means the specific value for `ncur` will depend on the current values of `A` at that position.

The other elements of the initial state remain valid, and we do not have specific values for `ncur`, `cur`, or other variables. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 0; `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`; `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur` positions based on the knight's moves; `parent[1][ncur]` contains tuples of `cur` and `piece` for those valid positions if `piece` is 1; `queue` now contains all valid `(ncur, 1)` tuples for all valid knight moves from the starting position and the additional tuple `(ncur, 2)`; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 0; `nx` is `x - 1`; `ny` is `y`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`**.
