The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy` are not explicitly given in the initial state, but they are assumed to hold specific integers. Therefore, the values of `nx` and `ny` will be dependent on these calculations. The other variables' states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to the value of `cur`, `piece` is set to 0, `queue` includes the newly appended tuple `(ncur, 0)`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, for the next iteration the current tuple will be (-2, 1)**.
