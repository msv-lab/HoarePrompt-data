Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `dist[1]` is updated at index `ncur`, `parent[1][ncur]` is now equal to `cur`, `piece` is equal to 1, `dist[0][ncur]` remains equal to the minimum distance from `(0, 2)`, `parent[0][ncur]` contains updated parent positions, `queue` contains tuples `(ncur, 0)` and `(ncur, 1)`, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 1 for the last iteration, `ncur` maintains its latest value after processing all relevant conditions, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`.**
