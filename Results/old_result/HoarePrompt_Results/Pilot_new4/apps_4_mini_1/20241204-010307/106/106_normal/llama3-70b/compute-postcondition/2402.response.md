The code assigns `nx` and `ny` the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy` are not specified in the initial state, but based on the context, `y` is currently `0`, and `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Therefore, after the execution of the code:

- `nx` will be equal to `x + dx`, which is the previous value of `x` incremented by `dx`.
- `ny` will be equal to `y + dy`, which is `0` incremented by `dy`.

The updated values of `nx` and `ny` depend on the specific values of `x`, `dx`, and `dy`, which are not provided, but we can describe their relationships.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dist` and `parent` will be updated based on the loop body, `queue` contains all valid `(ncur, 0)` pairs, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`.**
