In the given code snippet, the expression `dist[0][ncur] = dist[0][cur] + 1` updates the value of `dist[0][ncur]` based on the current value of `dist[0][cur]`. The variable `ncur` is derived from an array `A` using the indices `nx` and `ny`. 

1. `N` is established as a value between 3 and 10, which does not change with the execution of this line.
2. `y`, `dx`, `dy`, and `ny` are also unchanged as they are not involved in the calculation.
3. `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, which is unchanged.
4. The value of `ncur` is given as `A[nx][ny]`, which also remains the same as thereâ€™s no modification to `nx` or `ny` in the execution of this line.
5. The expression updates `dist[0][ncur]`, which now has the value of `dist[0][cur] + 1`.

Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `dist[0][ncur]` and retains all unchanged variables.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is 2, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
