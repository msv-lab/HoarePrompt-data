The code appends the tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. This means that a new element is added to the `queue`, which will now include this tuple representing a valid `(ncur, piece)` pair. The states of other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to reflect the shortest distance from `cur` for each valid `ncur`, `parent[1][ncur]` reflects the last piece's position for each updated `ncur`, `queue` contains all valid `(ncur, 1)` tuples and now includes `(ncur, 2)`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur, piece`.**
