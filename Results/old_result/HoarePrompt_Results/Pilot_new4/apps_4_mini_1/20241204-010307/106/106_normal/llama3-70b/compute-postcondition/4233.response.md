Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 1, `y` is `N - 1`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[0]` contains the minimum distances from the starting point to all reachable points, `parent[0]` contains the respective parent information for each reachable point, and `queue` contains the tuples representing all reachable points and their associated pieces after processing all valid moves defined by the `dx` and `dy` offsets. If `piece` is equal to 0, then `dist[0][ncur]` has been updated for all reachable `ncur` based on the conditions met during the iterations. If no valid moves lead to updates, the state of `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remains unchanged from their initial values.**
