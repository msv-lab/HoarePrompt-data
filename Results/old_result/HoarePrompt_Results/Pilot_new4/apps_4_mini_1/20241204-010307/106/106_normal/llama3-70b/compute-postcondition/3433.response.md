To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the impact of the code `ncur = A[nx][ny]` on the initial state.

Initial State: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `A[1][0]` equals `cur`, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `dy`.

1. The variables `nx` and `ny` are calculated as:
   - `nx = 1 + dx`
   - `ny = dy`

2. The code snippet attempts to access the 2D array `A` at the indices `[nx][ny]` and assigns that value to `ncur`.

Since we don't know the exact values of `dx` and `dy`, we need to express the output state in terms of these variables.

Therefore, the output state will include:
- The condition about `N`, which remains unchanged.
- The values of `nx` and `ny`, which are dependent on `dx` and `dy`.
- The new variable `ncur`, which is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `A[1][0]` equals `cur`, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`.**
