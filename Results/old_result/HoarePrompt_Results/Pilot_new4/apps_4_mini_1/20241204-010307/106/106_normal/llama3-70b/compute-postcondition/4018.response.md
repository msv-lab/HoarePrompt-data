According to the code, the loop iterates over the list of direction changes `[(−1, 0), (1, 0), (0, −1), (0, 1)]`, which consists of 4 elements. The variables `dx` and `dy` will take on the values from this list sequentially for each iteration of the loop. 

At the end of the last iteration, since `x` is 0 and `y` is 0, it indicates that the last executed values were likely one of the directions. Given the state was updated only if certain conditions were met, if the loop has already executed, we can ascertain that `dx` and `dy` were set to some values from the list.

The loop will execute again until all pairs in the list have been processed. The iteration will proceed as follows:
- In the first iteration, it processes `(-1, 0)`.
- In the second iteration, it processes `(1, 0)`.
- In the third iteration, it processes `(0, -1)`.
- In the fourth iteration, it processes `(0, 1)`.

After the fourth iteration, there will be no values left in the list to process, hence the variables `dx` and `dy` will be updated to the next pair from the list.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 1**
