The code assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to the `parent[1][ncur]` variable. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Specifically:

- `parent[1][ncur]` is now equal to the tuple `(cur, piece)`, which is `(cur, 1)`.
- The values of `N`, `dist`, `piece`, and the conditions regarding `nx` and `ny` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is at least 4; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `dist[1][cur]` remains unchanged; `piece` is equal to 1; `dist` is valid for reachable indices; if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, 1)`**.
