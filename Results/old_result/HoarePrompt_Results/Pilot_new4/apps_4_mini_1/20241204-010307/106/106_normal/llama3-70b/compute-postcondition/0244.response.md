The code assigns the value `cur` and `piece` to the `parent[2][ncur]`. The previous state indicates that `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. Additionally, `piece` is equal to 2 and the condition mentioned regarding `dist` remains valid after the execution.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 3 and 10, `y` is equal to `N`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `dist[2][ncur]` is less than or equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1; parent[2][ncur] is assigned the value (cur, piece).**
