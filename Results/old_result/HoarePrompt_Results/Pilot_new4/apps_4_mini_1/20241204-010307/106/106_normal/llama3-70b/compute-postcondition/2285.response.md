The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The values of `dist`, `parent`, and other variables remain unchanged. The states of `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `piece`, `dist[0][ncur]`, and `parent[0][ncur]` continue to hold their previously defined relationships and values.

Output State: **`dist`, `parent`, and `queue` are unchanged; `y` is N; `nx` is `x + dx`; `ny` is `y + dy` for each pair (-2, -1), (-2, 1), (-1, -2), (-1, 2), (1, -2), (1, 2), (2, -1), (2, 1); `ncur` is the value of `A[nx][ny]`; the current value of `piece` is 0; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is now equal to `cur`, `piece`; `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`**.
