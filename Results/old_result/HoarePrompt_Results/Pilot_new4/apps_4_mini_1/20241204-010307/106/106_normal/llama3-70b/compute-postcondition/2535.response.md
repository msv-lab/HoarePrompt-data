The value of `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to be equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`. The value of `dist[2][cur]` is unchanged, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, which is not specified but is derived from the current position based on `nx` and `ny`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 0; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `dy`; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `dist[2][cur]` is unchanged; `parent[2][ncur]` is unchanged; `queue` is unchanged; `dx, dy` are at the end of the list of directions; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
