Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 1, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, `dist[1]` contains updated distances for valid positions reachable from (1, 1), `parent[1]` contains predecessors for valid positions reachable from (1, 1), `queue` contains tuples of all reachable positions from (1, 1) that were updated during the loop, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 2, and the current value of `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`.***
