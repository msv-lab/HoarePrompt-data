The code assigns a value to `parent[2][ncur]`, indicating that the position `cur` and `piece` are the previous states leading to `ncur`. The values of `N`, `y`, `x + dx`, `y + dy`, `A[x][y]`, `dist[1][ncur]`, `parent[1][ncur]`, `queue`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and `piece` remain unchanged. The only update is to `parent[2][ncur]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `x + dx` is within the bounds of `A`, `y + dy` is within the bounds of `A`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[1][ncur]` contains the minimum distance from `cur` to each reachable position `ncur`, `parent[1][ncur]` represents the previous positions leading to each `ncur`, `queue` contains all updated reachable positions from `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the range 0 to `N - 1` inclusive, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur] = cur, piece`.**
