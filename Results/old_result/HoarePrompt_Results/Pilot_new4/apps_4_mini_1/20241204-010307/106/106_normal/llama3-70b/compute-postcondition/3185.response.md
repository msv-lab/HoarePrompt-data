Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -2, `nx` is -1, `ny` is -2. If `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid defined by `N`, and if `piece` is 0 with `dist[0][ncur]` greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
