Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 0, and `queue` contains at least one valid `(ncur, 1)` pair. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then the `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[1][0]`, and `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, with `parent[2][ncur]` set to `(cur, piece)` if `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`. If the condition is not satisfied, the state remains unchanged.***
