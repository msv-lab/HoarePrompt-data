Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dist[0]` is updated for valid `ncur` values based on the conditions in the loop, `parent[0]` is updated for valid `ncur` values, and `queue` contains tuples of `(ncur, 0)` for all valid moves; if there were no valid moves, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged.**
