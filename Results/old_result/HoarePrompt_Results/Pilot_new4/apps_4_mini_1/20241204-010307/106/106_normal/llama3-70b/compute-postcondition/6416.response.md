The `parent[0][ncur]` is updated to hold the value of `cur` and `piece`. The other variables remain unchanged, except for `parent[0][ncur]`, which now holds a new value. The values of `N`, `x`, `y`, `dist[0]`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `dist[0]` remains unchanged; `parent[0]` remains unchanged except `parent[0][ncur]` is now equal to `cur, piece`; `dx` is -1; `dy` is -2; `nx` is -1; `ny` is -1; `ncur` is equal to `A[-1][-1]**.
