The code `queue.append((ncur, 1))` appends the tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the list `queue`. The other variables remain unchanged, but we note that `ncur` is computed as `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` and `ny` are derived from the knight's moves based on `dx` and `dy`.

Since `queue` is modified, we need to express its new state succinctly. The output state will reflect that the `queue` now includes the new tuple, and it will still contain valid tuples based on knight's moves.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 3, `y` is 0, `dist` is reflective of reachable positions, `parent[1][ncur]` is now `(cur, piece)`, `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)` along with existing valid tuples, `nx` is 3 + dx, `ny` is 0 + dy, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` equals 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
