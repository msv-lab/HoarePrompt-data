Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, if the coordinates `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid (0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N), then `dist[0][ncur]` is set to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur` (which is 1), `piece` remains 0, and `queue` contains the tuple (1, 0) if the condition `piece == 0 and dist[0][ncur] > dist[0][cur] + 1` is satisfied; otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `nx` and `ny` are out of bounds, there is no change in the state of the variables.***
