The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The initial state defines `y` as 0. Therefore, after the code is executed, `ny` will equal `dy`, while `nx` will equal `x + dx`. The values of `N`, `A[x][0]`, and other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`.**
