The statement `parent[0][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to the two separate elements of the `parent` array at the index `[0][ncur]`. The variables `N`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, and `dist` remain unchanged in this context, but the value at `parent[0][ncur]` is now set.

The specific values of `cur` and `piece` are not provided in the initial state, but they are being assigned to `parent[0][ncur]`. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is now assigned the value of `cur and piece`**.
