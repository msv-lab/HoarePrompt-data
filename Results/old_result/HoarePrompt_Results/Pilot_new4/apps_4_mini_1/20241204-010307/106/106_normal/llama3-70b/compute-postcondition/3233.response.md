The new values for `nx` and `ny` are calculated as follows: 

- `nx` is assigned the value `x + dx`, which evaluates to `0 + (-1) = -1`.
- `ny` is assigned the value `y + dy`, which evaluates to `0 + 0 = 0`.

The state of the other variables (`N`, `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`) remains unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is -1, `ny` is 0.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is -1, `ny` is 0**.
