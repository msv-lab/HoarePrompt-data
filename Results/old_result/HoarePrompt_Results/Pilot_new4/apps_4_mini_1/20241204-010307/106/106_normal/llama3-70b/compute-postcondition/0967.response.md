Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1. If the current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated for all valid neighboring cells reachable from `(0, 1)`, `parent[2][ncur]` reflects the last valid parent node for those updates, and `queue` is updated to include the tuple `(cur, i)`. If no valid moves were found, `dist[2][ncur]` remains unchanged for those cells.***
