The values of `nx` and `ny` are updated based on the expressions `x + dx` and `y + dy`. The variable `x` is currently `0`, and `y` is `1`. Since `dx` is the first element of the first tuple and `dy` is the second element of the first tuple, we can denote these as `dx` and `dy`. Consequently:

- `nx` will be assigned the value of `0 + dx`, which simplifies to `dx`.
- `ny` will be assigned the value of `1 + dy`.

Thus, `nx` and `ny` depend on the values of `dx` and `dy`, which are unknown but defined by the first tuple.

The other variables (`N`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects these updates.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dx` is the first element of the first tuple, `dy` is the second element of the first tuple, `nx` is equal to `dx`, and `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`.**
