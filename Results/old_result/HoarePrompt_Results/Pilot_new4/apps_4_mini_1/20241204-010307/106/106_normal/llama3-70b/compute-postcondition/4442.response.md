Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `4 <= N <= 11`, `y` is equal to `N`, `A` is a valid two-dimensional array, `cur` is a valid position in `A`, `dist[1]` and `parent[1]` may remain unchanged, `queue` contains valid positions, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and if `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the array, `queue` now contains valid positions along with the tuple `(ncur, 2)`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 2, if `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`; otherwise, the state remains unchanged without executing any updates.***
