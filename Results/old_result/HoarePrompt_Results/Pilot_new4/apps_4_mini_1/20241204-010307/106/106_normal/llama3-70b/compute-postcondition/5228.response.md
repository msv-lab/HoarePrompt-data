The code updates the value of `dist[2][ncur]` to be equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`. Given that `dist[2][ncur]` was greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1` before this assignment, it indicates that the new value of `dist[2][ncur]` will now equal `dist[2][cur] + 1`, which means it will no longer be greater than it after the assignment.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 1 and `N-1`, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `ncur` is the value at `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 2, and `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 1 and `N-1`, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `ncur` is the value at `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `dist[2][ncur]` is not greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
