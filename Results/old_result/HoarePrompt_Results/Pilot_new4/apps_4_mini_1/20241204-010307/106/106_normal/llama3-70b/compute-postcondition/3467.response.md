Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` has been updated to `x + dx`, `y` has been updated to `y + dy`; `A[1][0]` equals `cur`; `dist[0]` has been updated for all valid `ncur` positions reachable from `(1, 0)`; `parent[0]` is set accordingly for those positions; `queue` includes the previously valid tuples along with the newly appended tuple `(ncur, 1)`; distances from `dist[0][cur]` reflect the minimum steps required to reach each position from `(1, 0)`; tuples for (dx, dy) are valid for execution; the next tuple to execute is `(-1, 1)` which is the second tuple in the list; `nx` equals `x + dx`, `ny` equals `y + dy`.**
