Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is the original x position; `y` is the original y position + 1; `nx` is `x + dx` and `ny` is `y + dy`. If both `nx` and `ny` are within the range [0, N), and if `piece` is equal to 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`, and the tuple `(ncur, 0)` is appended to `queue`. Otherwise, if the conditions are not met, there are no changes made to `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.***
