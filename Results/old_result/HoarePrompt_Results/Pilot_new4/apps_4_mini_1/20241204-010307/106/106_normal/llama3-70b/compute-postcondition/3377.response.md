According to the code, the loop is designed to iterate over the four possible directions indicated by the tuples in the list `[(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]`. Each iteration of the loop will assign a new value to `dx` and `dy` based on the current tuple being processed.

At the end of the last iteration, `dx` and `dy` were both equal to 1 (the values from the last tuple `(1, 1)`). For the loop to execute one more time, it will need to use the next tuple in the list. Since there are no more tuples left to iterate over after `(1, 1)`, the loop cannot execute again.

Therefore, the values of `N`, `dist`, `parent`, `piece`, and `queue` remain unchanged, as they do not directly influence the loop's iteration process. 

However, we need to document the fact that the loop is at its last state with `dx` and `dy` being equal to 1. After the last iteration with `dx` and `dy` as `(1, 1)`, the loop has no more tuples to process.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `piece` is equal to 1, `dist[0][ncur]` continues to represent the minimum distance from `(0, 2)`, `parent[0][ncur]` holds updated parent positions, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 1.**
