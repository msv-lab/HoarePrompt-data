The code `queue.append((ncur, 1))` adds a tuple containing the values of `ncur` and `1` to the `queue`. Thus, the variable `queue` is modified by adding a new element to it. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Given that `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][2]`, the specific value of `ncur` is dependent on the contents of the array `A` and the value of `x`. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 1; `nx` is `x - 1`; `ny` is 2; `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][2]`; `cur` is defined; `piece` is 1; `parent[1][ncur]` is (cur, 1); `queue` now contains the tuple (ncur, 1).**
