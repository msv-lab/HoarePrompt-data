Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dist[2][ncur]` reflects the minimum distances from the original position for all reachable `ncur`, `parent[2][ncur]` is established for those reachable positions, and `queue` contains tuples `(cur, i)` along with any additional tuples `(ncur, 2)` for each valid `ncur` that met the conditions, where `piece` is not equal to `i`. If no valid moves were possible, `dist[2][ncur]` and `parent[2][ncur]` remain unchanged for unreachable positions.***
