Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 3 <= `N` <= 10; `piece` is 0; `cur` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` now contains `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, no changes occur. If the condition is not met, no actions are taken.***
