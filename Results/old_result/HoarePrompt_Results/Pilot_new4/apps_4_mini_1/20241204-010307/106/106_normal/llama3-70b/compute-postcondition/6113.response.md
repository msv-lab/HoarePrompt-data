The code `queue.append((ncur, 2))` adds a tuple containing `ncur` and the integer `2` to the list `queue`. The previous states of the other variables remain unchanged. The variable `ncur` is defined as `A[x - 1][y]`, so it will take this value when the tuple is appended. The variable `queue` is updated to include the new element.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `x + dx` is within the bounds of `A`, `y + dy` is within the bounds of `A`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[1][ncur]` contains the minimum distance from `cur` to each reachable position `ncur`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is `y`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][y]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`.**
