Postcondition: ***`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 3, `y` is 1, `dist` contains the shortest distances, `parent` reflects the parent tuples, `queue` contains valid tuples, `piece` is 1, `nx` is 3 + `dx`, `ny` is 1 + `dy`, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, and the value of `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than the value of `dist[1][cur] + 1`.***
