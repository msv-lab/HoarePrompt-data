According to the code, the loop iterates over the list of tuples [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], which contains four directional movements. The variable `(dx, dy)` will take on each of these values sequentially during each iteration. 

At the end of the last iteration, it is given that `x` is 0 and `y` is 0. As the loop iterates, `dx` and `dy` will be updated for each tuple. Since there are four tuples, the first three iterations will not modify `x` or `y`, but the state will change on the last iteration.

To execute the loop one more time after iterating through the four tuples, the loop must at least be able to proceed with an additional iteration. However, since the for loop will iterate through all the tuples, after the last iteration, the loop will not run again, as there are no more tuples left.

Therefore, since we know the current iteration state with `dx` and `dy` will be set to the last tuple on the final iteration, for the loop to have executed just before the end of the loop, `dx` must be 0, and `dy` must be 1 for the last tuple, indicating the last direction is right.

After the last execution of the loop with `dx` being 0 and `dy` being 1, if another execution were possible, the values would be reset to loop again.

Since there are no additional iterations possible, the state will remain as is, without modification to the values. 

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dist[0]` remains unchanged, `parent[0]` remains unchanged, `queue` contains at least one tuple of (ncur, 1), `nx` is equal to 0, `ny` is equal to 1, and both `nx` and `ny` are between 0 and N-1.**
