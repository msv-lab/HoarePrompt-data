The variable `dist[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `dist[1][cur] + 1`. We know that `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`. The state of other variables remains unchanged. 

The Output State will reflect the fact that `dist[1][ncur]` has been updated based on the value of `dist[1][cur]`. However, we do not have specific values for `dist` or `cur`, but we can infer that `dist[1][ncur]` now holds the value of `dist[1][cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x + dx - 1`; `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
