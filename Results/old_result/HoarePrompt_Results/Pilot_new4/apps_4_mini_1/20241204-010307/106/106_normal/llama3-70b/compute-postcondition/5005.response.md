Postcondition: ***`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is 3; `y` is 0; `nx` is `3 + dx`; `ny` is `0 + dy`; `dist` contains the shortest distances from (x, y) to all reachable positions; `parent` contains the parent tuples for all reachable positions; `queue` contains all valid tuples. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `parent[0][ncur]` is updated to `(cur, piece)`, `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`, and `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
