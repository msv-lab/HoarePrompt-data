Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 4`, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[x - 4][0]`. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, the values of `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged.***
