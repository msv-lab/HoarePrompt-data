The assignment `parent[2][ncur] = cur, piece` indicates that the `parent` array at index `[2][ncur]` receives a tuple containing the values of `cur` and `piece`. The variable `piece` is equal to `2`, and `ncur` is determined by the previously established conditions. The previous state of `cur` is not defined in the initial state, so it is left as is.

The other variables remain unchanged in terms of their definitions and relationships. Therefore, the output state reflects that `parent[2][ncur]` now holds the values of `cur` and `2`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 3 and 10, `x` is greater than 1 and less than `N - 1`, `y` has been updated to `y + dy`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `nx` and `ny` are within the range 0 to N (inclusive of 0 and exclusive of N), `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is now equal to (cur, 2).**
