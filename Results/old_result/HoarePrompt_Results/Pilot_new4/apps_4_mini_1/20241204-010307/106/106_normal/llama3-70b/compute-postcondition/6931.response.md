The `queue` variable has the `ncur` and `0` values appended to it. Other variables remain unchanged, and the initial state provides the necessary context for `ncur`, which is derived from previous computations. The output state must reflect that `queue` has been updated.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`; `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur`; `queue` contains `(ncur, 0)`**
