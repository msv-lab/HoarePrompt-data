The line of code updates the value of `dist[1][ncur]` based on the current distance `dist[1][cur]`. The specific values of `dist[1][ncur]` and `dist[1][cur]` are not provided, but we know that `dist[1][ncur]` was greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1` before the update. After executing the code, `dist[1][ncur]` will be set to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, meaning it will no longer be greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`. 

The other variables remain unchanged, and the condition on `N`, `y`, `piece`, and the structure of `dist`, `parent`, `queue`, `nx`, `ny`, and `ncur` still hold.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `piece` is 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `dist[1][ncur]` is no longer greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `dist` may be updated based on reachable positions, `parent` may be updated accordingly, `queue` contains tuples of reachable positions, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
