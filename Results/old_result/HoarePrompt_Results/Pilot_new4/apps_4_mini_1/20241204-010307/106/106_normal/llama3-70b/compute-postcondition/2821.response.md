The assignment `parent[0][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the values `cur` and `piece` to `parent[0][ncur]`. The variable `parent[0][ncur]` is updated, while the states of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `piece` is equal to `0`, `dist[0][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `dist[2]` holds the shortest distances, `parent[2]` indicates the predecessors, `queue` holds the relevant tuples including `(ncur, 0)`, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is equal to `y - 1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is now equal to `cur` and `piece`.**
