Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10 and `y` is 0. If `A[x][y]` equals `cur`, then if the current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`, `dist[2][ncur]` contains the minimum distances from `cur` to each reachable cell, `parent[2][ncur]` contains the previous cell and piece for each reachable cell, and `queue` contains the tuple `(cur, i)` along with any previous tuples; if no cells were reachable, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged.***
