The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. Given the initial values, we calculate:

- `nx = x + dx = 2 + (-1) = 1`
- `ny = y + dy = 2 + 0 = 2`

The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 2.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 2**
