Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 0 and `N-1`, `dist[1]` is updated for each valid `ncur` found during the loop, `parent[1]` is set to `(cur, piece)` for each valid `ncur`, and `queue` contains all tuples `(ncur, 1)` corresponding to valid moves. If no valid moves were found, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initial states.**
