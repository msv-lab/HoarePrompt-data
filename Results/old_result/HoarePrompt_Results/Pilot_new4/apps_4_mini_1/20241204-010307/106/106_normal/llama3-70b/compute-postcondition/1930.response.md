According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y` and the value of `N`. The loop will execute again as long as `y` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `N` is at least 4, but we donâ€™t have the exact value of `y` from the previous iteration. 

To determine the next state, if the loop did not execute, `y` would not have been incremented, meaning it must still be the same as before the loop. If `y` were 3 or less, then for the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be incremented to 4. 

Thus, to execute the loop one more time, `y` must be 3 before the next iteration, allowing it to increment to 4 during the iteration. Since `N` is already at least 4, it can accommodate this increase.

State: **`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices, `queue` remains unchanged, `piece` is unchanged, `y` is 4**
