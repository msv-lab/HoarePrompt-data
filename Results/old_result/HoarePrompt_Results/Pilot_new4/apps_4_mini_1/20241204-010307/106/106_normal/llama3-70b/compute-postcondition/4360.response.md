The statement `dist[2][ncur] = dist[2][cur] + 1` updates the value in the `dist` array at the position `[2][ncur]` with the value of `dist[2][cur] + 1`. The variable `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and the values of `dx` and `dy` define the changes to `x` and `N`, respectively, allowing `nx` and `ny` to be calculated.

The previous states of the affected variables are:
- `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`
- `y` is equal to `N`
- `nx` is equal to `x + dx`
- `ny` is equal to `N + dy`
- `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`
- `dist[2][cur]` remains unchanged and is a valid value

After executing the code, `dist[2][ncur]` is assigned a new value, which is `dist[2][cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is equal to `N`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `N + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist` has valid prior values.**
