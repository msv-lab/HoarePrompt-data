Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, and if `nx` is in the range [0, N) and `ny` is in the range [0, N), then if `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `queue` includes `(ncur, 2)`. If the conditions for the if statement are not met, no changes occur to `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.***
