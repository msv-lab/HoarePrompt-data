The values of `nx` and `ny` are updated based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. Here, `nx` becomes `x + dx` and `ny` becomes `y + dy`. Since `x` is 0 and `y` is 0, the new values of `nx` and `ny` will depend on the values of `dx` and `dy` which are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of `nx` and `ny`. However, we can express them in terms of `dx` and `dy`. 

So the output state retains all unchanged variables and updates `nx` and `ny` with their new expressions.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `0 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, `piece` is equal to 0, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]` if conditions are met.**
