Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 1, `y` is `N-1`, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `N - 1 + dy`, and `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`. If `nx` and `ny` satisfy `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `queue` now contains the previous contents plus the tuple `(ncur, 0)`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1` if `piece` is equal to 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
