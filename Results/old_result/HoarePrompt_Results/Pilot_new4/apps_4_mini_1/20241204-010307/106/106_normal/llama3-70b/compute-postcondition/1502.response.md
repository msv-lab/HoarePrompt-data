To analyze the loop and state adjustments, we can break down the provided information step by step:

1. **Loop Structure:** The loop iterates over the list of tuples `[(−2, −1), (−2, 1), (−1, −2), (−1, 2), (1, −2), (1, 2), (2, −1), (2, 1)]`. This list has a total of 8 elements, meaning the loop will execute 8 times.

2. **Current State:** At the end of the previous iteration, the values are:
   - `N` is between 3 and 10 (this means it can take values from 3 to 9).
   - `x` is 2.
   - `y` is 2.
   - `A[x][y]` is defined, confirming that this position in the 2D structure is valid.
   - `cur` has a valid value.
   - `dist[2]`, `parent[2]`, and `queue` are also in a valid state, indicating they have been initialized correctly and are in scope.
   - `nx` is equal to `2 + dx` and `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, meaning these will change based on the current `(dx, dy)` values being iterated over.

3. **Loop Execution:** The loop will proceed through each `(dx, dy)` tuple:
   - The first iteration uses `(-2, -1)`, calculating `nx` and `ny`.
   - The second iteration will use `(-2, 1)` and so on until all tuples are exhausted.

4. **Iteration Completion:** After the last tuple `(2, 1)` has been processed, the loop will have completed all 8 iterations.

5. **State Adjustments for Next Iteration:** Since the loop iterates through the tuples explicitly, after the last iteration of `dx` and `dy`, there will be no further tuples left for the loop to process. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, we would need to consider advancing to the next iteration of `dx` and `dy`, which effectively means having a new set of tuples to iterate over or resetting the iteration.

In conclusion, to allow the loop to execute one more time:
- We can state that `dx` and `dy` need to be reset or cycled through again.
- The tuple list could be redefined or extended if needed.

Thus, the adjusted state at the start of one more iteration of the loop would be:

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `A[x][y]` is defined, `cur` has a valid value, `dist[2]`, `parent[2]`, `queue` are in a valid state, `dx` and `dy` can be reset to iterate over the tuples again.**
