The variable `queue` is updated to include the tuple `(cur, i)`, which means that the current cell `cur` along with the current piece value `i` is added to the list of reachable cells. The values of `dist`, `parent`, and the variable `piece` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10; `dist[2][ncur]` contains the minimum distances from `cur` to each reachable cell based on the given conditions; `parent[2][ncur]` contains the previous cell and piece for each reachable cell; `queue` now contains the new tuple `(cur, i)` in addition to any previous tuples; if no cells were reachable, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged; the current value of `piece` is not equal to `i`.
