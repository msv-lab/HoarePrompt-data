The code assigns the value `cur` and `piece` to `parent[1][ncur]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The previous value of `ncur` is based on the values of `nx` and `ny`, but it is not specifically stated. Therefore, the output reflects that `parent[1][ncur]` is updated with the new values, while the other variables remain as they were defined initially.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the values `cur` and `piece`.**
