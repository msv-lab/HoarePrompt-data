The statement assigns the value of `dist[0][cur] + 1` to `dist[0][ncur]`. Since it is given that `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, this assignment will change the value of `dist[0][ncur]` to a value that is exactly equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, the current value of `piece` is 0, and `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
