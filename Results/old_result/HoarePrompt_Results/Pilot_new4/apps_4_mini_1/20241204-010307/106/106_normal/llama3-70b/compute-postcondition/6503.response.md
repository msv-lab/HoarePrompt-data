The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The value of `ncur` is already defined as `A[nx][ny]`, and the value of `0` is simply a constant. The code does not change any of the other variables' values or conditions.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 0 and `N-1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur and piece`, `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)` appended to it.**
