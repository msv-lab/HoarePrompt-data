The code assigns a value to `dist[2][ncur]`. The expression `dist[2][ncur] = dist[2][cur] + 1` indicates that the value at `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to be equal to the value of `dist[2][cur]` plus 1. 

The variable `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is equal to `x + 1` and `ny` is 0. The values of `N`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, and `ny` remain unchanged. However, the value at `dist[2][ncur]` will now reflect this new calculation.

Since we do not have the specific original values of `dist[2][cur]` and `ncur`, we can only express the changes in terms of the previous values.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x + 1`, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
