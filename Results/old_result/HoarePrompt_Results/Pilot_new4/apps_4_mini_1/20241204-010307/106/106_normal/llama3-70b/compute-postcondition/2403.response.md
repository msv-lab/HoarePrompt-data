Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dist` and `parent` will be updated based on the loop body, `queue` contains all valid `(ncur, 0)` pairs, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, and the current values of `nx` and `ny` satisfy `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`.***
