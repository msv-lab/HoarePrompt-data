The variable `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`, which means it retrieves the element at the coordinates `[nx][ny]` in the matrix or array `A`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are dependent on `x` and `dx`, and the constant `1` added to `dy`, but since their specific values are not provided, we cannot determine `ncur` explicitly. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `piece` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
