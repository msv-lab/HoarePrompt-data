Postcondition: ***`dist` contains the minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices, `piece` is determined by the loop, `queue` contains valid tuples, `N` is greater than 0, `y` is 0, and the current value of `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`.***
