To calculate the new values of `nx` and `ny`, we need to know the values of `dx` and `dy`. However, since the values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided in the initial state or the code snippet, we cannot determine specific numerical outcomes for `nx` and `ny`. 

The only information we have is:
- `nx` is being assigned the value of `x + dx`
- `ny` is being assigned the value of `y + dy`

Given that:
- `x` is 1
- `y` is 1

Thus, the relationships for the new `nx` and `ny` values will depend on the values of `dx` and `dy`.

Therefore, the output state can be described as follows:
Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 1, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`.**
