The value of `ncur` is assigned based on the expression `A[x - 1][2]`, and it is used to append the tuple `(ncur, 2)` to `queue`. Since `queue` is being modified, its state will include the new tuple. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is 2, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][2]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is 2, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][2]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`, `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`**.
