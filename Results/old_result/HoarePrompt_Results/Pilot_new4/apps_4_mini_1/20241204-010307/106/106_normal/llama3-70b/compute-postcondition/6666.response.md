The variables `dx` and `dy` are not defined in the initial state, so we cannot calculate the exact values of `nx` and `ny`. However, we can express the new values in terms of `dx` and `dy`. The value of `N` remains unchanged, and the values of `x` and `y` are also unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is -1; `y` is 2; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`.**
