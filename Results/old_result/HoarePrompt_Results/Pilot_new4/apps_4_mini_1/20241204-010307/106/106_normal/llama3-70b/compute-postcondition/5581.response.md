Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `dist[1][ncur]` represents the shortest distance from `cur` to each valid `ncur`; `parent[1][ncur]` contains the previous state `(cur, piece)`; `queue` contains valid `(ncur, 1)` tuples; values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, and `A[0][0]` remain unchanged; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is equal to 2; `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
