The value of `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The variables `nx` and `ny` have specific values, resulting from the equations `nx = 1 + dx` and `ny = 0 + dy`. Since both `nx` and `ny` satisfy the conditions of being within the valid range, `ncur` will hold the value found in the matrix `A` at the position `(nx, ny)`.

The initial state remains valid, and we only update `ncur`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `1 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, `dist` is initialized for all valid positions, `parent` is initialized for all valid positions, `queue` is initialized to contain reachable positions from (1, 0), `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
