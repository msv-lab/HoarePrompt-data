Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dist[2][ncur]` reflects the minimum distances from the original position for all reachable `ncur`, `parent[2][ncur]` is established for those reachable positions, `queue` now contains `queue` with the additional tuple `(cur, i)`, `piece` is not equal to `i`, and if no valid moves were possible, `dist[2][ncur]` and `parent[2][ncur]` remain unchanged for unreachable positions.**
