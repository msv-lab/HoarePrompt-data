Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is an integer such that `y` is less than `N` and has been incremented to `y + 1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and the current values of `nx` and `ny` satisfy the conditions `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`.***
