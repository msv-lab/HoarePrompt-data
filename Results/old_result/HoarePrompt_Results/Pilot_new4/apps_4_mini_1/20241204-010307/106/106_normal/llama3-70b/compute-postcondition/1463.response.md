The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The value of `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`, and `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`. Given that both `nx` and `ny` are within the range of `0` to `N - 1`, the assignment of `ncur` will depend on the values of `dx` and `dy` and the array `A`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
