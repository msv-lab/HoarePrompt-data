Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `cur` is a valid index, `ncur` is equal to `A[x + 1][1]`, `nx` is equal to `x + 1`, `ny` is 1, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 1. If `piece` is 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `(ncur, 1)` is appended to `queue`.***
