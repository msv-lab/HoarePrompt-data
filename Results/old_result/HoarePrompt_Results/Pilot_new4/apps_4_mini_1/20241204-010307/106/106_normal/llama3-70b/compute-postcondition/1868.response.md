The code `queue.append((ncur, 0))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the list `queue`. The states of other variables are not directly affected by this operation. 

The variable `queue` will now contain the new entry `(ncur, 0)`, while the other variables retain their previous values. 

Output State: **`N` is at least 4, `piece` remains determined by the loop conditions, `y` is still 0, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 0)`.**
