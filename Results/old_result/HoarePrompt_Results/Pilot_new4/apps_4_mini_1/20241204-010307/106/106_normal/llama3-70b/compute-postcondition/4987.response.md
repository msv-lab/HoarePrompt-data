Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 1 and `N-2`; `x` is between 1 and `N-2`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` contains the tuple `(ncur, 2)`. Otherwise, no modifications are made. If the condition is not satisfied, there are no changes made to `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.***
