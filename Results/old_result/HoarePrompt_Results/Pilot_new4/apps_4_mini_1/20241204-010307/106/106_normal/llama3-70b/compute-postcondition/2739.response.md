According to the code, the loop iterates over the list of tuples representing the movements in the x and y directions. The variables `dx` and `dy` take on each pair of values from the list. At the end of the last iteration, we don't have any specific information about the current values of `dx` and `dy`, but we know the list has 8 pairs of movements.

Since the loop will iterate through all 8 pairs, after the last iteration, it would have completed processing the last tuple (2, 1). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the next values of `dx` and `dy` would need to come from the same list, but since all values have already been iterated over, the loop will not execute again.

Thus, we need to adjust the states accordingly. 

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is the current y-coordinate, `piece` is not equal to the value represented by `i`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and `dx`, `dy` are not defined after the loop has completed.**
