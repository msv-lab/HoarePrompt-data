The line of code assigns a new value to `parent[1][ncur]`, specifically `cur` and `piece`. The values of `cur` and `piece` are not provided in the initial state, so we cannot specify their values, but we can assert that `parent[1][ncur]` will now be equal to a tuple `(cur, piece)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `nx` is 1; `ny` is 2; `dx` is 1; `dy` is 1; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `dist[1][cur]` remains unchanged; `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, piece)`; `queue` is unchanged; `ncur` is equal to `A[1][2]`.**
