The expression `dist[1][ncur] = dist[1][cur] + 1` indicates that the value at `dist[1][ncur]` is being updated based on the value at `dist[1][cur]` incremented by 1. However, we don't have explicit values for `dist`, `cur`, or `ncur` in the initial state. The only detail we have is that `ncur` is equal to `A[-1][0]`, but without knowing the structure or values in `A` or `dist`, we cannot determine exact values for these variables.

Given that:
- `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`
- `x` is 0
- `y` is -1
- `nx` is -1
- `ny` is 0
- `dx` is -1
- `dy` is 1
- `ncur` is equal to `A[-1][0]`

The output state can only reflect the unchanged variables and the relationship that `ncur` maintains with `A`. The final output will contain a statement about the operation being performed without specific values because we lack concrete information about `dist`, `cur`, and `A`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is -1, `nx` is -1, `ny` is 0, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `ncur` is equal to `A[-1][0]`, and `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to be `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
