According to the code, the loop iterates over the list of tuples `[(−1,−1), (−1,1), (1,−1), (1,1)]` which represent the changes in `x` and `y` coordinates. The loop can execute as long as there are tuples in the list, which is the case as it contains four tuples.

To evaluate the valid positions `nx` and `ny`, we need to ensure that the current position variables `nx` and `ny` are defined based on the current position of `y` and some initial `x` (which is not explicitly stated but can be inferred).

For the loop to execute correctly, we need to consider the following:

1. The initial values of `nx` and `ny` must be set based on the starting position, which is influenced by `y` (which is currently 1).
2. The loop will perform updates to `dist[0][ncur]` and `parent[0][ncur]` only if the conditions `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N` are satisfied.
3. Therefore, it is essential to establish what the initial positions `nx` and `ny` are so that they can be evaluated correctly during the loop.

Assuming that the current position is `(x, y)` where `y` is 1, we can define `nx` as `x + dx` and `ny` as `1 + dy` for any of the iterations.

Thus, for the loop to execute properly, we need to establish initial conditions for `x` (which is not provided) and ensure that the conditions for valid positions are met.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `x` must be an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, valid positions `nx` and `ny` will be evaluated against the conditions `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`.**
