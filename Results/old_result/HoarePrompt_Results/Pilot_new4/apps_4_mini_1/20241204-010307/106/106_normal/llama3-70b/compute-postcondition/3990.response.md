Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 1, and if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[1][1]`. If `piece` equals 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. Otherwise, there are no changes to the variables. If the condition is not met, no changes are made to any variables.***
