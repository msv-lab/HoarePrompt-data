The code calculates the new coordinates `nx` and `ny` based on the current coordinates `x` and `y` with the offsets defined by `dx` and `dy`. Given that `dx` is -1 and `dy` is 0, `nx` becomes `x - 1` and `ny` remains `y`. The initial state does not specify the values of `x` and `y`, so we will refer to them generically.

The values of other variables in the initial state remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new values of `nx` and `ny`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur` positions based on the knight's moves, `parent[1][ncur]` contains tuples of `cur` and `piece` for those valid positions if `piece` is 1, `queue` contains all valid `(ncur, 1)` tuples for all valid knight moves from the starting position, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is `y`.**
