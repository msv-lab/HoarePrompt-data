The code `queue.append((ncur, 1))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. This impacts the state by updating the `queue` variable, but does not alter any other pre-existing variables.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged, and the `ncur` variable has already been defined based on the state.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `dist[1][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is now assigned the value `(cur, 1)`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)`**.
