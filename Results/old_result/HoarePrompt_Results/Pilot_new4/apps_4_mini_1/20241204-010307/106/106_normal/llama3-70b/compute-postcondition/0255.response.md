Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 3 and 10; `y` is equal to `N`; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `N + dy`; and the iteration count is 4. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[x + dx][N + dy]`. If `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `cur` and `piece`, and `ncur` and `2` are appended to `queue`. Otherwise, no updates occur. If the conditions are not satisfied, no actions are taken.***
