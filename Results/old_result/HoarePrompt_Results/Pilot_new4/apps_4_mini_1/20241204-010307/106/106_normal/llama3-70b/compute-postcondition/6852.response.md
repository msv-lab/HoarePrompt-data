The code assigns the value of `cur` to `parent[0][ncur]` along with the value of `piece`. Since the other variables are not affected by this assignment, we keep their states intact. The important variable that is updated is `parent[0][ncur]`, which now holds the value of `cur`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `x` is between 2 and `N-1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `x` is between 2 and `N-1`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, `piece`.**
