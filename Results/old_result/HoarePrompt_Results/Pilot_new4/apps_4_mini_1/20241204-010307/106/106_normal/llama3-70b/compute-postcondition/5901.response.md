The code assigns a new value to `dist[1][ncur]`, calculated as `dist[1][cur] + 1`. Given the initial state, `dist[1][ncur]` is being updated because the condition `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1` holds true. 

The values of `dist[1][cur]` and `dist[1][ncur]` are affected, but the rest of the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is between 0 and 8 (inclusive), `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `dist[1][cur]` remains unchanged, `dist[0]` has been updated based on valid `(nx, ny)` pairs, `parent[0]` stores tuples of previous indices leading to `ncur`, `queue` contains tuples of `(ncur, 0)` for each valid move that met the conditions, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of 0 and N (exclusive), `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and `piece` is equal to 1.**
