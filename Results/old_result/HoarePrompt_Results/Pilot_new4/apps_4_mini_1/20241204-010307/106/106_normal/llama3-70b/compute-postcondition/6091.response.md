The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is `x - 1` and `ny` is 1. The value of `nx` depends on the value of `x`, but since `x + dx` is within the bounds of `A` and `dx` is -1, `nx` will be `x - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, we still have the following conditions: `N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 0; `x + dx` is within the bounds of `A`; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 1; `nx` is `x - 1`; `ny` is 1. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 0; `x + dx` is within the bounds of `A`; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 1; `nx` is `x - 1`; `ny` is 1; `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`**.
