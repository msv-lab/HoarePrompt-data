According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `y` and `N`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `y` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is 1 and `N` is between 3 and 10. For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be incremented by 1, making it 2. 

Since `N` is at least 3, it will allow the loop to execute with `y` equal to 2. Hence, for the loop to execute another time, `N` must remain between 3 and 10, and `y` is 2.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, if `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, then `dist[2]`, `parent[2]`, and `queue` remain unchanged if `piece` is equal to `i`; otherwise, `queue` contains the previous tuples plus the new tuple `(cur, i)`**
