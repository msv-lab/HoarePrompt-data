Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, and `piece` is 2. If the condition `dist[2][ncur] > dist[2][cur] + 1` holds, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to be `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and the queue includes the new entry `(ncur, 2)`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the state of the program.***
