The tuple `(nx, ny)` is assigned the values `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The value of `x` is currently 0, and `y` is also 0. However, the values of `dx` and `dy` are not specified in the initial state, meaning they can be any integer values. Therefore, `nx` and `ny` will be equal to `dx` and `dy`, respectively. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Thus, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur`, `parent[1][ncur]` is established for those reachable positions, `queue` contains tuples `(ncur, 1)` for each valid `ncur` that met the conditions, `nx` is equal to `dx`, and `ny` is equal to `dy`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur`, `parent[1][ncur]` is established for those reachable positions, `queue` contains tuples `(ncur, 1)` for each valid `ncur` that met the conditions, `nx` is equal to `dx`, `ny` is equal to `dy`.**
