Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, and `dist[0]` and `parent[0]` have been updated for all reachable positions. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, and if `piece` is 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `queue` contains an additional tuple `(ncur, 2)`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur]`, and `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`. If these conditions do not hold, there are no changes to the state.***
