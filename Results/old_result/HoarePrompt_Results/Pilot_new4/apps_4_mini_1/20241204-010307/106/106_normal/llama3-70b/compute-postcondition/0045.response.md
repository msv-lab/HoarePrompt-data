The code assigns a value to `parent[1][ncur]`, which is set to a tuple consisting of `cur` and `piece`. The initial state indicates that `cur` is 1 and `piece` is 1. Therefore, `parent[1][ncur]` will be updated to (1, 1). The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= `N` <= 10; `piece` is 1; `cur` is 1; `dist[0][ncur]` is updated for all valid `ncur`; `parent[0][ncur]` holds corresponding values; `queue` contains reachable `ncur` values; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1; parent[1][ncur] = (1, 1)`**.
