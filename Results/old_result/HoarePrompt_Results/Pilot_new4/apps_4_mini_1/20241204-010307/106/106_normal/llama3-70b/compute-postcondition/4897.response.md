The statement `dist[2][ncur] = dist[2][cur] + 1` updates the distance at the position `[2][ncur]`. Given that `ncur` is defined as `A[nx][ny]`, which depends on the values of `nx` and `ny`. Based on the initial state, `nx` is `x + 1` and `ny` is `y`, thus `ncur` is equal to `A[x + 1][y]`. 

In the code, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to be the value of `dist[2][cur] + 1`. The specific values of `dist[2][ncur]` and `dist[2][cur]` are not provided, but we know that `dist[2][ncur]` will now be an increment of `1` from `dist[2][cur]`. 

Since the other variables (`N`, `dist`, `parent`, `dx`, `dy`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`) remain unchanged except for the specific update to `dist[2][ncur]`, the output state will reflect this.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `dist[1]` contains the shortest path distances; `parent[1]` contains the corresponding parent positions; `dx` is 1; `dy` is 0; `nx` is `x + 1`; `ny` is `y`; `ncur` is `A[x + 1][y]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
