The code assigns the values `cur` and `piece` to `parent[0][ncur]`. The variable `ncur` is already defined as `A[x - 2][y + 1]`. The variables `cur` and `piece` are not explicitly stated to change in this code snippet, so we must keep their previous values.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the new assignment while retaining the precondition variables.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, `piece` is 0, `cur` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 2][y + 1]`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value (1, 0).**
