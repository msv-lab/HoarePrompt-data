Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is `y + 1`, `piece` is equal to 2, `dist[2]` holds the shortest distances, `parent[2]` indicates the predecessors, `queue` holds the relevant tuples, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `N` is greater than `y + 1`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of `0` and `N`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 0, and the current value of `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than the current value of `dist[0][cur] + 1`.***
