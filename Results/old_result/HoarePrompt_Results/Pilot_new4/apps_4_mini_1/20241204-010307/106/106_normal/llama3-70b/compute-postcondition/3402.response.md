Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `piece` remains equal to 2; if `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `cur`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 2)`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is equal to `x + dx` and `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged otherwise.***
