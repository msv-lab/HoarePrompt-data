The code appends a tuple containing `ncur` and `2` to the `queue`. Since `ncur` is equal to `A[3][0]`, we introduce this value into the `queue`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `nx` is 3, `ny` is 0, `queue` now contains at least one valid `(ncur, 1)` pair and the new tuple `(A[3][0], 2)`, `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dist[2][cur]` remains unchanged, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, 2)`, `ncur` is equal to `A[3][0]`.**
