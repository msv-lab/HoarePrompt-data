The code assigns the value of `dist[1][cur] + 1` to `dist[1][ncur]`. Given that the current value of `dist[1][ncur]` is initially greater than this new value, the state of `dist[1][ncur]` will change. The other variables remain unaffected by this specific assignment.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 0; `y` is 0; `nx` is `0 + dx`; `ny` is `0 + dy`; `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[0]` is updated for all valid `ncur` values; `queue` contains valid tuples of `(ncur, 0)` for valid moves; `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is 1; `current value of dist[1][cur]` is still valid.**
