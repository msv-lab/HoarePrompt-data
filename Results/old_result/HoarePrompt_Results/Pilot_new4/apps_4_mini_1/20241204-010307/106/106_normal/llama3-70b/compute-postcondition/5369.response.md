Postcondition: ***`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is 4; `y` is 1; `nx` is equal to `4 + dx`; `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`; if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[4 + dx][1 + dy]`. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 0)`. Otherwise, no changes to the variables are made.***
