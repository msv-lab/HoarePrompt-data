Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `nx` is 1 + `dx`, `ny` is 2 + `dy`, `dist[1]` is updated for valid positions, `parent[1]` is set for valid positions, `queue` can be empty or contain valid positions that were reachable. The current value of `nx` is within the range [0, N) and the current value of `ny` is within the range [0, N).***
