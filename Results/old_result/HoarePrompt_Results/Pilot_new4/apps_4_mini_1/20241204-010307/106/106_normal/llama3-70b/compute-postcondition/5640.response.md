The value of `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to be equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`. Since `dist[1][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, the update will change `dist[1][ncur]` to a potentially smaller value, reflecting a new minimum distance found.

The other variables retain their values, and the constraints on `N`, `queue`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `ncur`, `dist`, `parent`, and `piece` remain valid.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `queue` may contain multiple elements as a result of appending `(ncur, 0)` for valid `(nx, ny)` positions; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `nx` can be -1 or 1; `ny` can be 0 or 2; `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` reflects the minimum distance found from `cur` to `ncur` incremented by the number of valid iterations; `parent[0][ncur]` holds the last valid parent value of `(cur, piece)`; `piece` is equal to 1; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.**
