According to the code, the loop iterates over the list of coordinate changes defined by `dx` and `dy`. The loop will execute for each of the four pairs: `(-1, -1)`, `(-1, 1)`, `(1, -1)`, and `(1, 1)`. 

At the end of the last iteration, the variables `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `N`, `ncur`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` are in a specific state based on previous computations. Given that `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, and `y` is also between 0 and `N-1`, we can analyze the conditions for the loop to execute again.

1. The loop has already processed one of the coordinate changes (dx, dy), and after this iteration, the next pair will be taken from the list.
2. The next values for `dx` and `dy` will be taken in the order defined in the list: for the first iteration, it will process `(-1, -1)`, then `(-1, 1)`, followed by `(1, -1)`, and finally `(1, 1)`.
3. To ensure the loop executes once more, we need to consider that when the loop comes around for the next iteration, the values of `dx` and `dy` will change according to the order in the list.

Assuming the last processed values were the first in the list, after processing `(-1, -1)`, we would next process `(-1, 1)`. 

Thus, for the loop to execute again, the next state would have `dx` and `dy` being `(-1, 1)`, and the variables would need to be adjusted accordingly:

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 0 and `N-1`, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is equal to `y + 1`, and at least one of the resulting coordinates `(nx, ny)` is valid.**
