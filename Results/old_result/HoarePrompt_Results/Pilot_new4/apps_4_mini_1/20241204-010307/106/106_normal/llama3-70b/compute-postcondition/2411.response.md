According to the code, the loop iterates over the tuples in the list `[(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]`, which means it will execute a total of 4 times, once for each tuple in that list. At the end of the last iteration, the variables `dx` and `dy` are associated with the last tuple in the list, which is `(1, 1)`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, it must start again from the first tuple in the list. So, after the last iteration, `dx` should go back to `-1` and `dy` should go back to `-1`, which corresponds to the first element of the list.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1**
