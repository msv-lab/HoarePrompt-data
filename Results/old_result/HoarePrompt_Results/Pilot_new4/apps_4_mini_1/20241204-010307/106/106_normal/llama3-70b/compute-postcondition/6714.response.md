The assignment `dist[2][ncur] = dist[2][cur] + 1` updates the value at `dist[2][ncur]` to be the value at `dist[2][cur]` incremented by 1. The initial state indicates that `dist[2][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, which implies that this assignment will change the value of `dist[2][ncur]` to a value that is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, thus potentially making it less than or equal to its previous value.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged, so the output state reflects the updated value of `dist[2][ncur]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 1, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, `dist[1]` contains updated distances for valid positions reachable from (1, 1), `parent[1]` contains predecessors for valid positions reachable from (1, 1), `queue` contains tuples of all reachable positions from (1, 1) that were updated during the loop, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 2, `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`**.
