The code snippet `queue.append((ncur, 1))` adds the tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the list `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `piece` are previously defined, and the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is between 0 and `N-1`, `y` is between 0 and `N-1`, `nx = x + dx`, `ny = y + dy`, at least one of the resulting coordinates `(nx, ny)` is valid, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `dist[1][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the tuple `(cur, piece)`; `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`.**
