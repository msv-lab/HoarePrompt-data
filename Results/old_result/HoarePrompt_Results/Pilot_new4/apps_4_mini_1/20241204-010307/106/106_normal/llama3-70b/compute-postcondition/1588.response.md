Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, `A[nx][ny]` is equal to `ncur`, `dx` and `dy` take values from the list of tuples in each iteration. The value of `piece` is 0, and the distance from the starting point to `ncur` is greater than the distance from the starting point to `cur` plus 1, indicating that the condition for entering the if statement is satisfied.***
