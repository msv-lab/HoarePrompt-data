Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 1, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the range of 0 and N (inclusive), `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`, if `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the tuple (cur, piece), and `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
