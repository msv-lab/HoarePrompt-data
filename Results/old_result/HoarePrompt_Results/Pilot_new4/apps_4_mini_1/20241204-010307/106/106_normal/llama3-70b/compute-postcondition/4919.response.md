The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned new values based on the calculations involving `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy`. Specifically, `nx` becomes `x + dx` and `ny` becomes `y + dy`. The values of `N`, `y`, `piece`, and the potential modifications to `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged in this execution. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is adjusted to be between 0 and N-2, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `piece` is still 0 if not modified, `dist[0][ncur]` may still need to be compared and potentially updated, and `parent[0][ncur]` and `queue` might be modified based on the next values of `nx` and `ny`.**
