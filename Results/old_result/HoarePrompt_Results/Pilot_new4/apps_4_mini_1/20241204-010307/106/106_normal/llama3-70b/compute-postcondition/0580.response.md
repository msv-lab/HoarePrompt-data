The code assigns values to `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. The variable `nx` is calculated as `x + dx`, which means `nx` will be equal to `x - 1` (since `dx` is -1). The variable `ny` is calculated as `y + dy`, which means `ny` will be equal to `0 + 1 = 1` (since `y` is 0 and `dy` is 1). Thus, the new values for `nx` and `ny` are determined by the values of `x` and `y`.

The states of the other variables (`N`, `y`, `piece`, `dx`, and `dy`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated values for `nx` and `ny`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `piece` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is 1.**
