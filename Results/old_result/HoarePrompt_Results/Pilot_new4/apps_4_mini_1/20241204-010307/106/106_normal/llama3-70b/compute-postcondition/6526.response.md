The code assigns new values to `nx` and `ny`. The new value of `nx` is calculated as `x + dx`, and since `dx` is -1, `nx` will be `x - 1`. The new value of `ny` is calculated as `y + dy`, and since `dy` is 1, `ny` will be `y + 1`. The previous values of `N`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged, but we must consider the constraints on `x` and `y`. After executing the code, `nx` will be one less than `x`, and `ny` will be one more than `y`.

Given the constraints:
- `N` is between 3 and 10,
- `x` is between 0 and `N-1`,
- `y` is between 0 and `N-1`,
- `dx` is -1,
- `dy` is 1.

The new values are:
- `nx` will be between -1 and `N-2`, since `x` is at least 0,
- `ny` will be between 1 and `N`, since `y` is at most `N-1`.

Thus, the Output State is: 
Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is between 0 and `N-1`; `y` is between 0 and `N-1`; `dx` is -1; `dy` is 1; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is equal to `y + 1`.**
