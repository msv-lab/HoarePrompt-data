According to the code, the loop iterates over a fixed set of tuples representing `(dx, dy)` values. The loop will execute for each of the 8 combinations provided in the list. 

At the end of the last iteration, `y` is 1 and `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1. This indicates that the loop has processed the first tuple `(-2, -1)`. The next tuple in the iteration will be `(-2, 1)`.

Given that the loop is simply cycling through pairs of `(dx, dy)`, the states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration are:

- `dx` should be set to -2 and `dy` should be updated to 1 (the next tuple).
- `N` remains between 3 and 10, as it is not modified within the loop.
- `nx` and `ny` must be recalculated based on the new values of `dx` and `dy`.

Since the values of `x` and `cur` are not provided, we can't directly compute `nx` and `ncur` without additional context. However, we know that `nx` will always be `x - 2` and `ny` will be `y + (-1 or 1)` depending on the `dy` value. In this case, since `dy` is changing from -1 to 1, `ny` will change from 0 to 2 for the current `dy`. 

Thus, at the start of the next iteration, the state should reflect the updated `dy`, the unchanged conditions for `N`, and the calculated values for `nx` and `ny`.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is 2**
