According to the code, the loop iterates over a list of tuples `[(dx, dy)]` that represent directional changes. The values of `dx` and `dy` will be updated with each iteration of the loop. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is 9, `N` is greater than or equal to 9, `dx` is the last element of the tuple, and `dy` is the last second element of the tuple.

Given that `dx` and `dy` will take values from the list of tuples, we need to identify which iteration of the loop we are currently on. The last values of `dx` and `dy` from the previous iteration would be `dx = 1` and `dy = 1` after the last iteration. The next values will be the first tuple in the list, which is `dx = -1` and `dy = -1`.

To ensure the loop executes one more time, `dx` and `dy` must take on the next value from the tuples, which would be `(-1, 1)` for the next iteration. 

Therefore, the adjusted states at the start of the next iteration of the loop should reflect that `dx` is now `-1` and `dy` is `1`. The conditions for `nx` and `ny` must still be checked to ensure they are within the range of 0 to `N`.

State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 9, `y` is 9, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, and `ny` is equal to `9 + 1` (i.e., `ny` is 10).**
