Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices, and `piece` is 2. If `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `parent[2][ncur]` is updated to `cur, piece`, and the tuple `(ncur, 2)` is added to `queue`.***
