Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is between 1 and `N-2`; `x` is between 1 and `N-2`; `nx` is between 0 and `N-2` or `N-1`; `ny` is between 0 and `N-2` or `N-1`. If `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds (0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N), then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, and if `piece` equals 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, piece)`, and `queue` is updated to include the tuple `(ncur, 2)`. Otherwise, no actions are taken.***
