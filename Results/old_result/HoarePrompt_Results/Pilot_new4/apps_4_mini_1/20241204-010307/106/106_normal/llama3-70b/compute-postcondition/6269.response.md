Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `x` is defined and within bounds, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated where conditions are met for every valid move defined by `dx` and `dy`; `parent[1][ncur]` is set for each updated `ncur`, and `queue` contains all tuples of updated `ncur` values with `1`. If no conditions are met for any iteration, then `dist[1]`, `parent[1]`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initial states.**
