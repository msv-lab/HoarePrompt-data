The line of code assigns `cur` and `piece` as the values to `parent[1][ncur]`. The states of other variables remain unchanged. The other variables that are still valid after the execution include `N` being between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `x + dx` is within the bounds of `A`, `y + dy` is within the bounds of `A`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[0][ncur]` contains the minimum distance from `cur` to each reachable position `ncur`, `queue` contains reachable positions which can be updated, and `queue` must not be empty; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and `piece` is equal to 1 while `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `x + dx` is within the bounds of `A`, `y + dy` is within the bounds of `A`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[0][ncur]` contains the minimum distance from `cur` to each reachable position `ncur`, `parent[0][ncur]` represents the previous position leading to `ncur`, `queue` contains reachable positions which can be updated, and `queue` must not be empty; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 1 while `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`.**
