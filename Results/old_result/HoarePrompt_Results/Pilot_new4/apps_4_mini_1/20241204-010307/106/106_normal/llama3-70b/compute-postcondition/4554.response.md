According to the code, the for loop will execute a fixed number of times, specifically 8 times, because it iterates over a predefined list of tuples representing the pairs (dx, dy). The values of `N` and `y` do not directly influence whether the loop can execute, but they do represent the state before the loop starts.

At the beginning of the loop, we can state that:
- The loop will start with the first pair (-2, -1), and for each iteration, (dx, dy) will be assigned the respective tuple from the list. 
- The values of `N` and `y` remain unchanged throughout the loop execution.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments to the states can be summarized as follows:

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1 (the first pair from the list)**
