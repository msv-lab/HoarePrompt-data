Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10; if `piece` is not equal to `i`, `dist[2]` reflects the updated distances from `cur` for reachable positions where `piece` is 2, `parent[2]` reflects the paths taken for those positions, and `queue` contains the new tuple `(cur, i)` in addition to previously existing tuples. If `piece` equals `i`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged.***
