The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned values based on the calculations `x + dx` and `y + dy`. The value of `y` is constant at 2. The value of `x` is an integer within the range `0 <= x < N`, and `dx` and `dy` are derived from tuples in a list, but their specific values are not provided in the initial state.

Thus, after executing the code:

- `nx` becomes `x + dx` where `dx` is an unknown value from the tuples.
- `ny` becomes `2 + dy` where `dy` is an unknown value from the tuples.

The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`.**
