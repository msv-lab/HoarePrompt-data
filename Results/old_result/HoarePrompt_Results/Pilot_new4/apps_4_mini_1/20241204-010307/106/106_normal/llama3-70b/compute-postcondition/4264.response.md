The value of `ncur` is assigned the value from the 2D array `A` at the position `[nx][ny]`. The variables `nx` and `ny` are defined such that they depend on the values of `dx` and `dy`, and since `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, `ncur` will be valid as it accesses a defined position in the array `A`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 1, `y` is `N - 1`, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `N - 1 + dy`, `dist[1]` remains unchanged, `parent[1]` remains unchanged, `queue` remains unchanged, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`.**
