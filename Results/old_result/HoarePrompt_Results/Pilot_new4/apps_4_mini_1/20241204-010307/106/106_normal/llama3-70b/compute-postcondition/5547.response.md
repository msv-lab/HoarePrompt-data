Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` contains the original elements plus the tuple `(ncur, 0)` if `piece` equals 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`. If the conditions are met, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `dx`, `dy`, and `A[0][0]` remain unchanged, while `ncur` is equal to `A[-2][1]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, and `parent[0][ncur]` is updated to `cur` and `piece`. If the conditions are not satisfied, the state remains unchanged.***
