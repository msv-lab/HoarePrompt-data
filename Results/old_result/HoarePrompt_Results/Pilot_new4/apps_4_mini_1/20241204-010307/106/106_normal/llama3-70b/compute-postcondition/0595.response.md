The code appends the tuple `(ncur, 2)` to the `queue`. This means that after execution, the `queue` will contain the previous elements plus the new tuple `(ncur, 2)`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `y` is 0; `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`; `piece` is 2; `dist[1]` contains the updated minimum distances; `parent[1]` tracks the previous position; `queue` contains at least one valid `(ncur, 1)` tuple, and now also contains `(ncur, 2)`; `nx` is `x + dx`; `ny` is `0 + dy`; both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds such that `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`; `parent[2][ncur]` is now `(cur, 2)`; `queue` now also contains `(ncur, 2)`**.
