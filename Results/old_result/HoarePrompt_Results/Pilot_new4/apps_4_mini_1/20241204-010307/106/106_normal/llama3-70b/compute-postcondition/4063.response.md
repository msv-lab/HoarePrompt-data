Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is -1, `ny` is 0, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0]` may contain updated distances for valid `ncur` values, `parent[0]` may store corresponding parents for those `ncur` values, `queue` may contain tuples of updated `(ncur, 0)` for valid transitions, the current values of `nx` and `ny` satisfy `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, `piece` is 1, and the current value of `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`.***
