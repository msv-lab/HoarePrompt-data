The code assigns a new value to `dist[0][ncur]`, which is calculated as the distance from the starting position to `cur` plus 1. The initial state indicates that the distance from the starting position to `ncur` is greater than this calculated value. 

As a result, the impact of the code is that `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to be equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10; `x` is 3; `y` is 0; `nx` is `3 + dx`; `ny` is `0 + dy`; `dist` contains the shortest distances from (x, y) to all reachable positions; `parent` contains the parent tuples for all reachable positions; `queue` contains all valid tuples; `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`; the current value of `piece` is 0; `dist[0][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
