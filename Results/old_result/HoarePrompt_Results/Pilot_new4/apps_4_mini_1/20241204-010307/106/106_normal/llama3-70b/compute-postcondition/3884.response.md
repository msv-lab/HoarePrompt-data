The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The current values of `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of 0 and N (with N being an integer between 3 and 10), ensuring that `A[nx][ny]` is accessible and valid. The Initial State indicates that `A` is a 2D array where `nx` and `ny` serve as indices. 

Since the specific value of `A[nx][ny]` is not provided, we will denote it as `A[nx][ny]` in the output state. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `nx` is `2 + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `dist[0]`, `parent[0]`, and `queue` remain unchanged, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`.**
