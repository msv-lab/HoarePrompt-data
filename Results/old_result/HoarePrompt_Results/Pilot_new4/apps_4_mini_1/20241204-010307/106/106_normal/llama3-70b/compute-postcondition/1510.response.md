According to the code, the loop iterates over a list of tuples representing directional changes `(dx, dy)`. Since there are 8 possible direction tuples in the list, the loop will execute a total of 8 times. 

At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 2 and `y` is 2. The loop variable `(dx, dy)` will take on the values from the list in order. If the last value of `(dx, dy)` was `(-2, 1)`, then the next tuple will be `(-1, -2)`. 

After the last iteration, since the 8 tuples are exhausted, and this is the last iteration, the loop won't run again. Thus, to execute one more time, the loop must start fresh. 

However, since we are modifying the state at the end of the last iteration, we consider that the next state should be at the start of the loop with the first tuple again.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `(dx, dy)` is (-2, -1)**
