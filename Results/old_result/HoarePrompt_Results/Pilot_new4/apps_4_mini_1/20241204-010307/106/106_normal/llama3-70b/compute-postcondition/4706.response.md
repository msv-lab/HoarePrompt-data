The variable `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`. The value of `nx` is `x + 1`, and `ny` is `2`. Therefore, `ncur` will be equal to `A[x + 1][2]`. The other variables remain unchanged; thus, the output state will reflect the updated value of `ncur`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 2, `ncur` is equal to `A[x + 1][2]`, `piece` is 2, `dist[1][ncur]` and `parent[1][ncur]` can still be updated, `queue` contains the newly appended tuple `(ncur, 2)`, `nx` is `x + 1`, `ny` is 2, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0.**
