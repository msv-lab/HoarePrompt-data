According to the code, the `for` loop iterates over the list of directional changes represented by the tuples `(-1, 0)`, `(1, 0)`, `(0, -1)`, and `(0, 1)`. The loop will execute once for each tuple in that list. 

At the end of the last iteration, the state indicates that `y` is 1, and `x` is an integer within the range `0 <= x < N`. The loop is designed to iterate through the four possible direction changes. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to know which tuple is currently being processed.

The loop will run four times in total, and if it has already completed the first three iterations (for the first three tuples), it will be on the last tuple `(0, 1)` during the next execution. Consequently, `dx` and `dy` will be updated to `0` and `1`, respectively.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration of the loop:
- `dx` will be `0`.
- `dy` will be `1`.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `x` is an integer such that `0 <= x < N`, `nx` is either `x-1`, `x+1`, or `x`, `ny` is either `1`, `0`, or `2`, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 1**
