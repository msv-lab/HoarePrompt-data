The operation `queue.append((ncur, 1))` adds a tuple containing the current value of `ncur` and the integer `1` to the `queue`. The value of `ncur` is determined by the expression `A[nx][ny]`, and while `N`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `dist[1][ncur]`, `parent[1][ncur]`, and `queue` remain unchanged, the `queue` now contains an additional element. 

The relevant details that can be inferred are:
- `N` is between 3 and 10
- `y` is 0
- `nx` is equal to `x + dx`
- `ny` is equal to `y + dy`
- `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`
- `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur`
- `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`
- The `queue` now has an additional tuple `(ncur, 1)`

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 0; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `queue` includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)` as an additional element.**
