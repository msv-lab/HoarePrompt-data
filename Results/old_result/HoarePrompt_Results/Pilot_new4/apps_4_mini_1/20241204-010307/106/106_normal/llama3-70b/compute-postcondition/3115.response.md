The line of code assigns a value to `ncur` based on the elements of a two-dimensional array `A` at the indices `nx` and `ny`. Given the initial state, we can determine that:

- `nx` is equal to `x - 1`
- `ny` is equal to `3`

Since `N` is greater than 3 and less than or equal to 10, `y` is `2`, `piece` is set to `1`, `x` is at least `1`, and `dx` and `dy` are set to `-1` and `1` respectively, the values of `nx` and `ny` can be explicitly stated as well. 

The value of `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` is `x - 1` and `ny` is `3`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **If `N` is greater than 3 and less than or equal to 10, `y` is 2, `piece` is set to 1, `x` is at least 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 1`, `ny` is 3, and `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][3]`.**
