The values of `nx` and `ny` are assigned based on the expressions `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The value of `y` is already specified as 4 and is used to calculate `ny`. However, the values of `x`, `dx`, and `dy` are not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine specific values for `nx` and `ny` without that information. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is at least 4, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices, `queue` may contain tuples of reachable indices and associated pieces, `piece` remains unchanged at 0, `y` is 4, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `4 + dy`.

Output State: **`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices, `queue` may contain tuples of reachable indices and associated pieces, `piece` remains unchanged at 0, `y` is 4, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `4 + dy`.**
