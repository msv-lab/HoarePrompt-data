Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `x` is 0; `y` is 1; `nx` is `0 + dx`; `ny` is `1 + dy`; `dist[0]` contains the shortest distances from `(x, y)`; `parent[0]` contains the parent positions; `queue` now contains the previous elements plus `(ncur, 1)`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; the value of `piece` is 1; `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `dist[1][ncur]` was previously greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`; `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur, piece`.**
