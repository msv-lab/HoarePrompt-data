The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The value of `x` is 4 and `y` is 1, but the values of `dx` and `dy` are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, `nx` will be equal to `4 + dx` and `ny` will be equal to `1 + dy`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 1, `piece` is 0, `dist[0][ncur]` contains valid distances for at least one move, `parent[0][ncur]` contains valid path information, `queue` must contain valid tuples for the current position and piece, `nx` is equal to `4 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `1 + dy`.**
