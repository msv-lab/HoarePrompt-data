Postcondition: ***If `piece` is 2, then `dist[2]` contains the updated shortest distances for reachable positions, `parent[2]` indicates the predecessors of those positions, and `queue` includes the tuple `(cur, i)`. If `piece` is 1, then `dist[2]` and `parent[2]` remain unchanged, and `queue` retains the tuple `(cur, i)`. In either case, `piece` is not equal to `i`.***
