The code appends the tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. This results in the `queue` now containing an additional pair, specifically the pair of `ncur` and `1`. The other variables and states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dist` and `parent` will be updated based on the loop body, `queue` now contains all valid `(ncur, 0)` pairs plus the new pair `(ncur, 1)`, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 1, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is updated to `cur` with a value of `piece`.**
