Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is `N-1`. If `A[x][y]` equals `cur`, then `dist` will contain the minimum distances to each reachable position based on the piece types, `parent` will indicate the paths taken to those positions, and `queue` will contain all tuples of valid reachable positions and piece types based on the loop execution. If `A[x][y]` does not equal `cur`, then `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` will remain unchanged from their initial states. Each distance in `dist` will accurately reflect the shortest path found, and `parent` will show the relationships formed during the movement process according to the piece type.**
