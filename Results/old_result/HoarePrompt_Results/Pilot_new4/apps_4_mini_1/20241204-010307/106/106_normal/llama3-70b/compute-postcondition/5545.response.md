The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. This means that `queue` will now contain an additional element, which is the tuple consisting of the value of `ncur` (which was previously defined as `A[-2][1]`) and the integer `0`. 

Since the initial state mentions that `queue` is not empty, we can conclude that after the execution of the code, the state of the `queue` will include this new tuple. 

The values of other variables remain unchanged, so the output state will reflect the modified state of the `queue` while keeping all other variables as they were.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` contains the original elements plus the tuple `(ncur, 0)`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is -2, `ny` is 1, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `ncur` is equal to `A[-2][1]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is equal to `cur` and `piece`.**
