Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `nx` is equal to `2 + dx`, `ny` is equal to `0 + dy`; if the coordinates (nx, ny) are within bounds, and if `piece` is equal to 2 and `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, then `dist[2][ncur]` is updated to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, `parent[2][ncur]` is set to `(cur, 2)`, the tuple `(ncur, 2)` is added to `queue`, `A[2][0]` remains equal to `cur`, and `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If the coordinates (nx, ny) are out of bounds, no updates occur in `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`, and the values of other variables remain unchanged.***
