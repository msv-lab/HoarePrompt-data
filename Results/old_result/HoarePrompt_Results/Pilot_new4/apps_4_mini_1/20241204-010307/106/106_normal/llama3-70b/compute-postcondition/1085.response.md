Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 0, `dist` reflects the shortest path distances updated for all valid `ncur` values reachable from `(x, y)` given the conditions in the loop, `parent` stores the corresponding previous positions and piece types for those reachable `ncur`, `queue` includes all reachable tuples derived from the iterations, and `piece` is still 0 if the conditions were met. If no valid `(nx, ny)` positions updated `dist`, then `dist` remains unchanged from its initial state, and `queue` could potentially be empty if no tuples were appended during the loop execution.**
