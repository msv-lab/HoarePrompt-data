The statement `parent[0][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to `parent[0][ncur]`. The variable `parent` is updated to reflect that the position `ncur` now has `cur` and `piece` as its parent information. Other variables remain unaffected by this assignment.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `cur` is the same as before, `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `dist` is updated for all reachable positions based on conditions, `queue` contains tuples for all updated positions that met the conditions, `piece` is 0, `parent[0][ncur]` is `cur, piece`.**
