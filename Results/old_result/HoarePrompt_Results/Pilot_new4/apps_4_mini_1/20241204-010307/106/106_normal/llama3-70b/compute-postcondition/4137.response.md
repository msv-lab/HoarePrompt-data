The values of `nx` and `ny` are reassigned based on the calculations involving `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy`. 

- `nx` is calculated as `x + dx`, which is `0 + (-2)`, resulting in `nx` being `-2`.
- `ny` is calculated as `y + dy`, which is `2 + (-1)`, resulting in `ny` being `1`.

The states of the other variables (`N`, `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`) remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is -2, `ny` is 1.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is -2, `ny` is 1**
