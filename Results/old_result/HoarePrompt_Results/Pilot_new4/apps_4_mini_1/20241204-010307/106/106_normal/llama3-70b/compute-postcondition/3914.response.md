The statement `parent[2][ncur] = cur, piece` assigns the value of `cur` and `piece` to the `parent` array at the position `[2][ncur]`. The value of `ncur` is determined by the previous assignment `ncur = A[nx][ny]`, where `nx` and `ny` are calculated as `2 + dx` and `2 + dy`, respectively. Therefore, `parent` is updated at the specific position defined by `ncur`.

The other variables remain unchanged, so the output state reflects the updates made:

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `dist` reflects updated shortest distances for valid moves, `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the values of `cur` and `piece`, `queue` contains at least one valid position, `nx` is `2 + dx`, `ny` is `2 + dy`, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 2, and `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
