According to the code, the for loop iterates over a fixed list of tuples, `[(−1,−1), (−1,1), (1,−1), (1,1)]`, which contains four pairs of `(dx, dy)`. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 0 and `y` is 0. The loop will execute a total of four times, once for each tuple in the list.

At the start of the next iteration, the iteration variable `(dx, dy)` will take the next tuple from the list. Since the loop has not yet started, we need to determine the next values for `dx` and `dy`.

Based on the current state:
- For the first iteration, `(dx, dy)` will be `(-1, -1)`.
- For the second iteration, `(dx, dy)` will be `(-1, 1)`.
- For the third iteration, `(dx, dy)` will be `(1, -1)`.
- For the fourth iteration, `(dx, dy)` will be `(1, 1)`.

As the loop iterates, `(dx, dy)` will sequentially be assigned these values. After the third iteration, where `(dx, dy)` is `(1, -1)`, the loop will be ready to execute a fourth time with `(dx, dy)` set to `(1, 1)`.

Since the loop has completed its third execution, at the start of the next iteration, we will have:
- `dx` as `1`
- `dy` as `1`

Thus, the state needs to reflect that the loop will execute one more time with these values.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 1**
