The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned new values based on the calculation of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. Given that `N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `x` is defined and within bounds, and `dx` and `dy` are each taken from the list of tuples for possible moves, the updated values will depend on the specific values of `x`, `dx`, and `dy`. The constraints for `nx` and `ny` being within the bounds of the array `A` remain valid.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `x` is defined and within bounds, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `2 + dy`, `dx` and `dy` are taken from the list of tuples for possible moves, `ncur` is valid for `dist` updates when `piece` is 0.**
