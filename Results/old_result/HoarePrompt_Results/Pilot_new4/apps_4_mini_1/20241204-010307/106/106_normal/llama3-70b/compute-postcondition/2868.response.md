The `queue.append((ncur, 2))` statement adds a tuple containing `ncur` and the integer `2` to the `queue`. The previous values of the other variables remain unchanged, while the `queue` now contains an additional element. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`; `piece` is 2; `dist[0]` holds the updated shortest distances for reachable positions; `parent[0]` indicates predecessors for reachable positions; `dist[1]` holds shortest distances for positions reachable with piece value 1; `parent[1]` indicates predecessors for those positions; `queue` now contains an additional element `(ncur, 2)`; `nx` is `x + dx`; `ny` is `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`, which is less than or equal to the previous value of `dist[2][ncur]`; `parent[2][ncur]` is assigned the value `(cur, piece)`**.
