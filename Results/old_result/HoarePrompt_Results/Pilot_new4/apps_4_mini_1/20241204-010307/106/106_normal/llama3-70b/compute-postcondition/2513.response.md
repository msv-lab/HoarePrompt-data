Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 1, `dist` contains the shortest distances for valid indices updated based on the conditions inside the loop, `parent` contains the parent indices for valid nodes, and `queue` contains tuples of new valid states for indices where the conditions were met. If none of the conditions were satisfied during any iteration, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initial states.**
