In this case, the values of `dx` and `dy` are given as the pairs [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], which will allow `nx` and `ny` to take multiple values based on the current values of `x` and `y`. 

The code `nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy` will iterate through each of the `dx` and `dy` pairs independently. 

Since `x` is currently 1 and `y` is currently 1, let's calculate `nx` and `ny` for all combinations of `dx` and `dy`:

1. For `dx = -1` and `dy = 0`: 
   - `nx = 1 + (-1) = 0`
   - `ny = 1 + 0 = 1`
   
2. For `dx = 1` and `dy = 0`: 
   - `nx = 1 + 1 = 2`
   - `ny = 1 + 0 = 1`

3. For `dx = 0` and `dy = -1`: 
   - `nx = 1 + 0 = 1`
   - `ny = 1 + (-1) = 0`
   
4. For `dx = 0` and `dy = 1`: 
   - `nx = 1 + 0 = 1`
   - `ny = 1 + 1 = 2`

The values of `nx` and `ny` will reflect the possible new positions based on the current `x` and `y`. However, since the code itself doesnâ€™t store the outcomes or assign `nx` and `ny` to any variables in a permanent way, we report the possible outcomes of these calculations.

The variables `N`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 1; `nx` is either 0, 2, or 1; `ny` is either 0, 1, or 2.**
