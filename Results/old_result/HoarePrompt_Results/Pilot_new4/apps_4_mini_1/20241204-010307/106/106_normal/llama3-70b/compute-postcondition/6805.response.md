According to the code, the for loop iterates over a list of directional changes defined by the tuples `(-1, 0)`, `(1, 0)`, `(0, -1)`, and `(0, 1)`. The loop will execute once for each tuple in this list, which comprises 4 tuples in total. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that the loop has already processed one tuple from the list. Given that there are a total of 4 tuples, the next execution of the loop will process the next tuple in the list.

Since the loop processes these tuples sequentially, if we denote the current iteration index based on the tuples processed so far, it can be tracked as follows:
- First iteration: `(-1, 0)`
- Second iteration: `(1, 0)`
- Third iteration: `(0, -1)`
- Fourth iteration: `(0, 1)`

If the last processed tuple corresponds to one of the first three iterations, then the next tuple will be processed in the next iteration. 

Given that the current tuple is known to be processed, we can determine which tuple the next iteration will process and the state would need to be adjusted accordingly. Since we don't know which tuple was processed last without further information, we understand the next tuple in sequence will be one of the remaining ones.

Assuming the loop has processed the third tuple `(0, -1)`, then in the next iteration it will process `(0, 1)`.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 1**
