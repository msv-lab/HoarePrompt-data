The value of `nx` is updated to `x + dx`, which means `nx` becomes `x - 2 - 2 = x - 4` (since `dx` is -2). The value of `ny` is updated to `y + dy`, which means `ny` becomes `2 + 1 = 3`. 

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 2, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 4`, `ny` is 3, and if `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`. If `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, then `dist[0][ncur]` is set to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is updated to `cur, piece`, and `queue` now includes `(ncur, 0)`.
