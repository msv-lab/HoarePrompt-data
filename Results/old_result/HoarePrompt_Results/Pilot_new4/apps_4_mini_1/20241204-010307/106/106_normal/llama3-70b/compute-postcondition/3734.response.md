Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `piece` is 1, `nx` is 1, and `ny` is -1 (invalid). If `nx` is within the range [0, N) and `ny` is within the range [0, N), and if `piece` equals 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then a new tuple `(ncur, 1)` is appended to the `queue`. Otherwise, no action is taken since there is no else part.***
