The code snippet `queue.append((ncur, 1))` appends a tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The variable `ncur` is already defined as `A[x - 1][0]`, so its value is based on the current state of the array `A`. The integer `1` is appended as the second element of the tuple. The `queue` variable is assumed to be initialized and its state is updated by appending the new tuple.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is -1, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is `0`, `ncur` is equal to `A[x - 1][0]`, `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `cur`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(ncur, 1)` appended to it.**
