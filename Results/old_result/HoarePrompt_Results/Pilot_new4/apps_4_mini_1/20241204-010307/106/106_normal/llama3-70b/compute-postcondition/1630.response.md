The values of `nx` and `ny` are assigned based on the expressions `x + dx` and `y + dy`. The initial state provides that `ny` is equal to `y + 1`, which means `ny` is `0 + 1`, so `ny` is `1`. The value of `nx` is dependent on the variable `x`, which is not defined in the initial state. However, since `N` is between 3 and 10, it indicates that `x` could be defined within that range, but the impact on `nx` cannot be accurately determined without knowing `dx`.

Thus, the only valid update from the initial state is for `ny`, and the output state retains the information about the variables that are not affected. 

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 0; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is 1.**
