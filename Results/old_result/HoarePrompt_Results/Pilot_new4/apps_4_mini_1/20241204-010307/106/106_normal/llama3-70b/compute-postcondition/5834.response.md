Postcondition: ***If `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `N` is between 3 and 10; `x` is 1; `y` is 0; `queue` now contains all satisfying tuples `(ncur, 0)`, possibly `(ncur, 1)`, along with a new entry `(ncur, 1)`; `piece` is set to 0; `dx` is 1; `dy` is -1; `nx` is 2; `ny` is -1; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; and `parent[1][ncur]` is now equal to `(cur, piece)`.***
