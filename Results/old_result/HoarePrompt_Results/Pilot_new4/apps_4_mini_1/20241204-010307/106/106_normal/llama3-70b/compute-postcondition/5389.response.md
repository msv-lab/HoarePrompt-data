According to the code, the for loop iterates over the tuples `(-1, -1)`, `(-1, 1)`, `(1, -1)`, and `(1, 1)`. At the end of the last iteration, `dx` is 1 and `dy` is 1, which corresponds to the last tuple in the list. For the loop to execute one more time, it needs to start from the first tuple again. The next iteration will have `dx` and `dy` set to -1 and -1, respectively.

Given that `N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 1, and the values for `piece`, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` may or may not change depending on the conditions specified in the loop body, but they do not affect the loop's ability to iterate again.

State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 1, `piece` is 1, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -1, `nx` is 5, `ny` is 2**
