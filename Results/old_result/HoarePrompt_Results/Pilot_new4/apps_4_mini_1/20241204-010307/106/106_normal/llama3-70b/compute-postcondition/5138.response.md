The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The value of `x` is between 0 and N-1, and the value of `y` is also between 0 and N-1. The values of `dx` and `dy` are not specified; therefore, the output state will reflect the update of `nx` and `ny` based on the unknown values of `dx` and `dy`. 

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is between 0 and N-1, `y` is between 0 and N-1, `dist` must be appropriately initialized, `parent` must reflect valid parent tuples, `queue` must contain valid tuples, `piece` should be greater than 0, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`.**
