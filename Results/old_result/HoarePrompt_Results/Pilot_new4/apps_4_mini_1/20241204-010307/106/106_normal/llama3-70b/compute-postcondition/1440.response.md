The value of `queue` is updated to include the tuple `(ncur, 1)`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `nx` is 2 + `dx`, `ny` is 1 + `dy`, `dist[0]` contains the minimum distances from the starting position to each reachable cell in the grid, `parent[0]` contains the parent information for each reachable cell, `queue` now contains the tuple `(ncur, 1)`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 1, `parent[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`.
