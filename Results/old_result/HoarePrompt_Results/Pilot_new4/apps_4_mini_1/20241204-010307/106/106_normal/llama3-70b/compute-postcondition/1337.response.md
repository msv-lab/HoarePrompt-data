Postcondition: ***`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `dist` reflects the updated shortest path distances. If `0 <= nx < N` and `0 <= ny < N`, then if `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is updated to `(cur, piece)`, `queue` now includes `(ncur, 0)` along with its previous elements, `A[2][0]` remains equal to `cur`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is -2, `nx` is 1, `ny` is -2, `ncur` is equal to `A[1][-2]`, and `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
