`nx` is assigned the value `x + dx` and `ny` is assigned the value `y + dy`. The values of `x` and `y` are known as `x` is 1 and `y` is `N - 1`. Therefore, `ny` can be expressed as `N - 1 + dy`. The states of `dist[1]`, `parent[1]`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initial values since no updates are specified for them in this context. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 1, `y` is `N - 1`, `nx` is `1 + dx`, `ny` is `N - 1 + dy`, `dist[1]` remains unchanged, `parent[1]` remains unchanged, `queue` remains unchanged.**
