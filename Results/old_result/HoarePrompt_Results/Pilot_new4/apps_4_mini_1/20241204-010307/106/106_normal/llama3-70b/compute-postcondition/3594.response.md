The variables `nx` and `ny` are assigned the values `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. Given the constraints on `x` and `y`, their new values will depend on the values of `dx` and `dy`. 

Since the specific values for `dx` and `dy` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact values for `nx` and `ny`. However, we can infer that:

- `nx` will be `x + dx`.
- `ny` will be `y + dy`.

The state of the other variables remains unchanged, but we will note that `nx` and `ny` are now dependent on the values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. 

The output state reflects the new assignments for `nx` and `ny` based on the initial conditions:

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is between `0` and `N-1`, `y` is between `0` and `N-2` (inclusive), `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`**
