The code assigns the value of `dist[2][cur] + 1` to `dist[2][ncur]`. Given that `dist[2][ncur]` was previously greater than this calculated value, it will now be updated. The previous values of the relevant variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 1, `piece` is 2, `dist[1]` contains updated distances, `parent[1]` contains path information, `queue` includes valid moves from `(cur, 0)`, `nx` is `4 + dx`, `ny` is `1 + dy`, `ncur` is `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[2][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
