According to the code, the for loop iterates over the list of tuples representing the knight's potential moves. The loop will execute for each valid move defined by the tuples in the list. The loop does not depend on the values of `N`, `y`, `A[x][y]`, `dist[0][ncur]`, `parent[0][ncur]`, or `queue`, but rather on the tuples themselves.

Since the loop will iterate over the four possible moves defined by `dx` and `dy`, the states that need to be acknowledged are the tuples `(-1, -1)`, `(-1, 1)`, `(1, -1)`, and `(1, 1)` which are already defined in the code.

Thus, the states do not need any adjustment regarding `N`, `y`, `A[x][y]`, `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`. However, it's important to note that we should ensure that the loop can iterate through these tuples, which it inherently does since they are already defined.

State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is -1, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[0][ncur]` has been updated for each valid move generated by `dx` and `dy`, `parent[0][ncur]` has been set for each valid `ncur`, `queue` contains tuples for all valid `ncur` reached from the original position `(x, y)`, `dx` and `dy` represent the knight's possible moves**
