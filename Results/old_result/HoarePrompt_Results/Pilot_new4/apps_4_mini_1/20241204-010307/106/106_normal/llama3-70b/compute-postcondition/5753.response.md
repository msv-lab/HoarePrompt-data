The code updates the value of `dist[2][ncur]` to be equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`. Given that `dist[2][ncur]` is greater than `dist[2][cur] + 1`, the previous value of `dist[2][ncur]` must be updated to reflect this new calculation. The other variables remain unchanged, but we note that `dist[2][ncur]` now equals `dist[2][cur] + 1`, which indicates that it has now been updated.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `queue` contains tuples of (A[nx][ny], 0) and (A[nx][ny], 1); `dist[1][ncur]` is updated accordingly; `parent[1][ncur]` holds the corresponding values; `nx` is equal to `x + dx`; `ny` is equal to `y + dy`; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `piece` is equal to 2; `dist[2][ncur]` is equal to `dist[2][cur] + 1`.**
