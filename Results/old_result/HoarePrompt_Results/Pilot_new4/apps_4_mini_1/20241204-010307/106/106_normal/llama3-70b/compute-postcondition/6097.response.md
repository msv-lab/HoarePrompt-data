Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `y` is 0, `x + dx` is within the bounds of `A`, `y + dy` is within the bounds of `A`, `A[x][y]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[1][ncur]` contains the minimum distance from `cur` to each reachable position `ncur` where the update condition was satisfied, and `parent[1][ncur]` represents the previous positions leading to each `ncur` that was updated. `queue` contains all updated reachable positions from `cur`, which can include multiple `(ncur, 1)` tuples, reflecting all valid moves made during the loop executions. If the loop did not execute, `dist` and `parent` remain unchanged, and `queue` would be empty.**
