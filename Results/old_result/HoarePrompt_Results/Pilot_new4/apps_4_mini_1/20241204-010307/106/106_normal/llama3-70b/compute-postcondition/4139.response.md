The variable `dist[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `dist[0][cur] + 1`. The previous value of `ncur` is `A[-2][1]`, but since `cur` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the value of `dist[0][cur]`. Therefore, we can only specify that `dist[0][ncur]` is updated accordingly. 

The other variables remain unchanged during this operation.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is -2, `ny` is 1, `ncur` is assigned the value `A[-2][1]`, and `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1` (where `cur` is undefined).**
