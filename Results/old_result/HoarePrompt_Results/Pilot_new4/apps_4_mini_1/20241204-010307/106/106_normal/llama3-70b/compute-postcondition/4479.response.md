The code assigns new values to `nx` and `ny` based on the calculations `nx = x + dx` and `ny = y + dy`. The initial values are `dx = -2` and `dy = 1`. Therefore:

- `nx` becomes `x - 2`.
- `ny` becomes `y + 1`, which is `0 + 1 = 1`.

The conditions for `ncur` are not relevant here since they depend on the new values of `nx` and `ny`, and the validity of their range with respect to `N`.

The output state contains the updated values of `nx` and `ny`, while all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is 1.**
