Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is between 0 and `N-1`. The `dist` arrays reflect the shortest distances relevant to all valid moves for pieces 0, 1, and 2, based on the updates made during the loop execution. The `parent` arrays reflect the updated parent nodes relevant to the valid moves for each piece. The `queue` contains tuples representing the valid moves processed during the loop, and may include the original tuple `(cur, i)` if `piece` is not equal to `i`. If the loop does not execute, `dist`, `parent`, and `queue` remain unchanged from their initial states.**
