The values of `nx` and `ny` are assigned using the expressions `nx = x + dx` and `ny = y + dy`. The variable `y` equals `N`, so `ny` becomes `N + dy`. The variable `nx` is updated based on the current value of `x` and the value of `dx`. The problem states that both `nx` and `ny` are between 0 and N (exclusive), which means that the sum of `x + dx` must still satisfy that condition for `nx`, and `y + dy` must also satisfy the condition for `ny`.

The other variables (`N`, `piece`) remain unchanged, and since `nx` and `ny` are defined in terms of `x`, `dx`, `N`, and `dy`, the output state must reflect the conditions on `nx` and `ny`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` equals `N`, `ny` equals `N + dy`, `nx` equals `x + dx`, `nx` and `ny` are between 0 and N (exclusive), and `piece` equals 0.**
