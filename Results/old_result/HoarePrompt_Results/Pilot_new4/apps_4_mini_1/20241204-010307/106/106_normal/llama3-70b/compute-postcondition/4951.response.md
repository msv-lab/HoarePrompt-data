Postcondition: ***If `piece` is equal to 1 and `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1`, then `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, `parent[1][ncur]` is set to `cur`, `piece`, and the `queue` contains a tuple `(ncur, 1)` appended. If the condition is not met, no changes occur to `dist`, `parent`, or `queue`.***
