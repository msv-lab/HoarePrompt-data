Postcondition: ***`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 1, `piece` is 2, and `i` is not equal to 2. In this case, `dist[2]` is updated for each valid `(nx, ny)`, `parent[2]` is updated accordingly, and `queue` contains all valid moves along with the newly added `(cur, i)`. If `piece` is equal to `i`, `dist[2]`, `parent[2]`, and `queue` remain unchanged.***
