The code assigns a new value to `dist[1][ncur]` based on the value of `dist[1][cur]`. It updates `dist[1][ncur]` to be equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, meaning that the distance at position `ncur` is incremented by 1 compared to the distance at position `cur`. The states of other variables remain unchanged since the code only modifies `dist[1][ncur]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 2; `dx` and `dy` take on values from [(-2, -1), (-2, 1), (-1, -2), (-1, 2), (1, -2), (1, 2), (2, -1), (2, 1)]; `piece` is 1; `x` is such that `nx = x + dx` and `ny = 2 + dy; `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]` based on valid `nx` and `ny` such that 0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N; the current value of `ncur` satisfies the condition that `dist[1][ncur]` is greater than `dist[1][cur] + 1; dist[1][ncur] is updated to be equal to dist[1][cur] + 1.**
