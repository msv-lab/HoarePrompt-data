The code updates the value of `dist[1][ncur]` based on the current distances. Specifically, `dist[1][ncur]` is assigned the value of `dist[1][cur] + 1`. Given that `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]` and the distance from node 1 to `ncur` is greater than the distance from node 1 to `cur` plus 1, we know that `dist[1][cur] + 1` must be less than `dist[1][ncur]`. Therefore, the distance value at `dist[1][ncur]` is updated to a greater value.

Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:
`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `nx` is `dx`, `ny` is `dy`, `A[0][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dist[0]` contains the distances from `cur` to other reachable nodes, `parent[0]` contains the parent nodes for the reachable distances, `queue` contains tuples representing reachable nodes that correspond to the `dx` and `dy` movements, `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 1, and `dist[1][ncur]` is now equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, reflecting the increase in distance.
