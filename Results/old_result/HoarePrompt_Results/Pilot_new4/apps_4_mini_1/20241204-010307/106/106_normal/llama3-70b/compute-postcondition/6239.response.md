The operation `queue.append((ncur, 0))` adds a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. Since `ncur` is derived from `A[nx][ny]`, it retains its value as an output state but does not change the other variables. The `queue` variable is now updated by appending a new element.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `y` is 2; `dx` is -1; `dy` is -2; `nx` is equal to `x - 1`; `ny` is 0; `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`; `dist[0][ncur]` is equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1; parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`; `queue` contains `(ncur, 0)`**.
