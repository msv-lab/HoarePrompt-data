The values of `nx` and `ny` are assigned new values based on the expressions `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. Given that `dx` is 1 and `dy` is 0, the new values become `nx = x + 1` and `ny = y`. Therefore, the previous values of `nx` and `ny` will be updated.

The initial state holds that `N` is between 3 and 10, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 0, `nx` is equal to `x + 1`, and `ny` is equal to `y`. After the code execution, `nx` will be updated to `x + 1`, while `ny` will remain equal to `y`.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10; `dx` is 1; `dy` is 0; `nx` is `x + 1`; `ny` is `y`**
