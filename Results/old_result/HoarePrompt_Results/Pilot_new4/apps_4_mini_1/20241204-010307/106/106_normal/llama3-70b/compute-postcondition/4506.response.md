The variables `dx` and `dy` have fixed values of -1 and 1, respectively. The code calculates new coordinates `nx` and `ny` based on the current coordinates `x` and `y`. Therefore, `nx` is assigned the value of `x - 1`, and `ny` is assigned the value of `y + 1`.

Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `x` and `y`, we can only express `nx` and `ny` in terms of `x` and `y`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is 0, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dist` and `parent` are valid and updated based on knight's moves, `queue` contains valid `(ncur, 0)` tuples and potentially now includes `(ncur, 1)`, `nx` is `x - 1`, `ny` is `y + 1`, `dx` is -1, `dy` is 1**.
