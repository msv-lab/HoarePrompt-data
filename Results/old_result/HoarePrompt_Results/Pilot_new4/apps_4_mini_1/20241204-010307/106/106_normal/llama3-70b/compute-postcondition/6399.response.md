Given the initial state, the variable `ncur` is undefined due to invalid index access, making the expression `dist[0][ncur]` ambiguous. Therefore, this operation cannot be executed as intended, and no changes can be made to any variables based on the provided code.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `dist[0]` remains unchanged, `parent[0]` remains unchanged, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is -2, `ny` is 0, and `ncur` is undefined due to invalid index access; additionally, `piece` is 0 and `dist[0][ncur]` remains greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`.**
