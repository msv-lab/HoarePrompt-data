The code assigns the value of `dist[0][cur] + 1` to `dist[0][ncur]`. Given that `current value of dist[0][ncur]` is greater than `dist[0][cur] + 1`, this indicates that `dist[0][ncur]` was updated to a smaller value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is at least 4, `dist` contains updated minimum distances for reachable indices with `dist[0][ncur]` now equal to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent` reflects the corresponding parents for those reachable indices, `queue` remains unchanged, `piece` is unchanged, `y` is 4, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is assigned the value of `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is 0.**
