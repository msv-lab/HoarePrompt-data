The code appends a tuple `(ncur, 0)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `0` will be added to `queue`, but no other variables are changed or affected by this operation. The previous states of the variables remain valid. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `y` is an integer that is less than `N`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is -1, `nx` is equal to `x - 2`, `ny` is equal to `y - 1`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `dist[0][ncur]` is updated to `dist[0][cur] + 1`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `cur`, `parent[0][ncur]` is assigned the value of `piece`, and `(ncur, 0)` is appended to `queue`.**
