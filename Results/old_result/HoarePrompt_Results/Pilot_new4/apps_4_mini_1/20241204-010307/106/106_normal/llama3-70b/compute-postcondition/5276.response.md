To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the current state and the loop logic.

1. The loop iterates over the pairs `(dx, dy)` given in the list, one pair at a time. At the end of the last iteration, it has already processed the first pair `(-2, -1)` and will process the next pair.
2. Since there are 8 pairs in total, the loop will execute for each pair until all pairs have been processed.
3. After processing the last pair `(2, 1)`, the loop would terminate.

Given the current state:
- `N` remains unchanged, and is between 4 and 10.
- `x` is currently 4.
- `y` is currently 0.
- `nx` and `ny` are 2 and 1 respectively from the previous execution.
- `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, and `A[4][0]` is equal to `cur`.
- The loop's logic involves checking the conditions based on `nx`, `ny`, `piece`, `dist`, and updating the relevant values if the conditions are met.

In this case, since we are processing the next pair, we will need to modify the values that change for the next iteration of the loop.

After processing the first pair, `dx` and `dy` values will change accordingly. 

So for the next iteration:
- The next pair to process would be `(-2, 1)`.

Thus, the adjusted state for the next iteration would be as follows:

State: **`N` is between 4 and 10, `x` is 4, `y` is 0, `nx` is 2, `ny` is 2, `A[x][0]` is equal to `cur`, `A[4][0]` is equal to `cur`, `dx` is -2, `dy` is 1**
