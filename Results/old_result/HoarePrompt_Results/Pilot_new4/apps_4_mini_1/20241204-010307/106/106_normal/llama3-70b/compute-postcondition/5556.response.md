The code appends the tuple `(ncur, 1)` to the `queue`. The values of `ncur` and `piece` remain unchanged in this context. The state of `dist` and `parent` related to `1` has been updated as indicated, but the `queue` now contains an additional entry.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 10, `queue` now contains the additional tuple `(ncur, 1)`, `dist[1][ncur]` is equal to `dist[1][cur] + 1`, and `parent[1][ncur]` is equal to `(cur, 1)`, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, `ncur` is equal to `A[nx][ny]`, `piece` is equal to 1.**
