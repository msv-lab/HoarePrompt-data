The value of `ncur` is assigned the value from the 2D array `A` at the position `(nx, ny)`. Given that `nx` is equal to `x + dx` and `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, and both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid, the value of `ncur` will depend on the contents of the array `A` at that specific position. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that `3 <= N <= 10`, `piece` is equal to 1, `dist[1]` is updated for all valid `ncur` positions, `parent[1][ncur]` contains associated parent positions, `dist[0][ncur]` remains equal to the minimum distance from `(0, 2)`, `parent[0][ncur]` retains updated parent positions, `queue` contains tuples `(ncur, 0)` and newly appended tuples `(ncur, 1)` for each valid knight move, `nx` is equal to `x + dx`, `ny` is equal to `y + dy`, both `nx` and `ny` are within the bounds of the grid, and `ncur` is assigned the value `A[nx][ny]`.**
