Output State: **`a1` and `a2` are positive integers such that 0 < `a1`, `a2` ≤ 2·10^9; `b1` and `b2` are integers in the range -2·10^9 ≤ `b1`, `b2` ≤ 2·10^9; `L` and `R` are integers such that -2·10^9 ≤ `L` ≤ `R` ≤ 2·10^9; `count` is increased by 1, and if `val` is greater than `R`, then `x0` is incremented by `a2_div_gcd` and `y0` is decremented by `a1_div_gcd`, while `val` is calculated as `a1 * x0 + b1`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
