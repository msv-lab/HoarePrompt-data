The function `func_2` accepts the following parameters:
- `a1`: a positive integer such that 0 < a1 ≤ 2·10^9.
- `b1`: an integer in the range -2·10^9 ≤ b1 ≤ 2·10^9.
- `a2`: a positive integer such that 0 < a2 ≤ 2·10^9.
- `b2`: an integer in the range -2·10^9 ≤ b2 ≤ 2·10^9.
- `L`: an integer such that -2·10^9 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ 2·10^9.
- `R`: an integer such that -2·10^9 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ 2·10^9.

After executing the function body, the function has two possible return outcomes:
- Case_1: If the current value of C is not divisible by gcd, the function returns -1.
- Case_2: If the conditions are met, the function returns the count of all valid 'val' values that were within the range defined by 'L' and 'R', where 'val' is the last calculated value that exceeds 'R' and was updated at least 'n' times.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two positive integers `a1` and `a2`, two integers `b1` and `b2`, and two integers `L` and `R`, and return either -1 if the current value of C is not divisible by gcd, or return the count of valid 'val' values within the specified range if the conditions are satisfied. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters a1, b1, a2, b2, L, and R, and returns -1 if the current value of C is not divisible by gcd; otherwise, it returns the count of valid 'val' values within the range defined by 'L' and 'R'.**
