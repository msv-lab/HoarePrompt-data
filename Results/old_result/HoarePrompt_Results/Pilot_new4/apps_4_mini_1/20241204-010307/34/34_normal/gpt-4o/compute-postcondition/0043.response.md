The value of `x0` is incremented by `a2_div_gcd`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions regarding `val`, `count`, `y0`, and `val` recalculation are still valid but not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State reflects the change to `x0`.

Output State: **`a1` and `a2` are positive integers, `b1` and `b2` are integers, `L` and `R` are integers, and `x0` is increased by `a2_div_gcd`.**
