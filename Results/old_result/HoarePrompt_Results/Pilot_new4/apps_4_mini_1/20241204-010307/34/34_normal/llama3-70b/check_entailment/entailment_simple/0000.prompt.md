You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given two arithmetic progressions: a_1k + b_1 and a_2l + b_2. Find the number of integers x such that L ≤ x ≤ R and x = a_1k' + b_1 = a_2l' + b_2, for some integers k', l' ≥ 0.


-----Input-----

The only line contains six integers a_1, b_1, a_2, b_2, L, R (0 < a_1, a_2 ≤ 2·10^9,  - 2·10^9 ≤ b_1, b_2, L, R ≤ 2·10^9, L ≤ R).


-----Output-----

Print the desired number of integers x.


-----Examples-----

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a_1, a_2 are positive integers such that 0 < a_1, a_2 ≤ 2·10^9; b_1, b_2, L, R are integers such that -2·10^9 ≤ b_1, b_2, L, R ≤ 2·10^9 and L ≤ R.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `b` is 0, `a` is the GCD of the original values of `a_1` and `b` (where `b` is the initial value before the loop started).
    return a
    #The program returns the GCD of the original values of `a_1` and `b`, where `b` is 0

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
