The value of `y0` is decremented by `a1_div_gcd`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a1` and `a2` are positive integers, `b1` and `b2` are integers, `L` and `R` are integers, `x0` is increased by `a2_div_gcd`, and `y0` is decreased by `a1_div_gcd`.

Output State: **`a1` and `a2` are positive integers, `b1` and `b2` are integers, `L` and `R` are integers, `x0` is increased by `a2_div_gcd`, and `y0` is decreased by `a1_div_gcd.**
