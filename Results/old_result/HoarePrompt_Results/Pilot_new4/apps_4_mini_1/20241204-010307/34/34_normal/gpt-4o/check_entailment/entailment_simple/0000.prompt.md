This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a_1, a_2 are positive integers such that 0 < a_1, a_2 ≤ 2·10^9; b_1, b_2, L, R are integers such that -2·10^9 ≤ b_1, b_2, L, R ≤ 2·10^9 and L ≤ R.
def func_1(a, b):
    if (a == 0) :
        return b, 0, 1
        #The program returns b, which is an integer in the range -2·10^9 ≤ b ≤ 2·10^9, along with the values 0 and 1.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a_1`, `a_2` are positive integers such that 0 < `a_1`, `a_2` ≤ 2·10^9; `b_1`, `b_2`, `L`, `R` are integers such that -2·10^9 ≤ `b_1`, `b_2`, `L`, `R` ≤ 2·10^9 and `L` ≤ `R`; `a` is a non-zero integer.
    gcd, x1, y1 = func_1(b % a, a)
    x = y1 - b // a * x1
    y = x1
    return gcd, x, y
    #The program returns gcd, x, and y, where gcd is the greatest common divisor calculated from func_1(b % a, a), x is calculated as y1 - (b // a) * x1, and y is equal to x1.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a1 and a2 are positive integers such that 0 < a1, a2 ≤ 2·10^9, b1 and b2 are integers in the range -2·10^9 ≤ b1, b2 ≤ 2·10^9, and L and R are integers such that -2·10^9 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ 2·10^9.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
