The variable `y` is updated by subtracting the value of `a1_div_gcd`. The values of `a_1`, `a_2`, `b_1`, `b_2`, `L`, `R`, `k`, `x`, and `y` are not directly affected by this operation except for `y`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the change in `y`.

Output State: **`a_1` and `a_2` are positive integers; `b_1` and `b_2` are integers; `L` and `R` are integers; `k` is assigned a value based on the condition of `sign_a1`; `x` is updated to `x + a2_div_gcd`; `y` is updated to `y - a1_div_gcd`.**
