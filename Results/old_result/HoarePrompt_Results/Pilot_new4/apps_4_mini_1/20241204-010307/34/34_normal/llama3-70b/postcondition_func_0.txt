The function accepts a positive integer `a` and an integer `b`, and returns the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. It correctly computes the GCD using the Euclidean algorithm, and since `b` can be zero in the initial call, it can handle this case appropriately by returning `a` if `b` is zero at the beginning of the function.
