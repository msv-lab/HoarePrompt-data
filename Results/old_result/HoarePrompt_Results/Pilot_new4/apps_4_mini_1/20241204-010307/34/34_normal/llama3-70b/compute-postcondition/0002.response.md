According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. The loop will execute as long as `b` is non-zero. At the end of the last iteration, it is given that `b` must be non-zero, which means it could still allow for the next iteration of the loop. 

The state `b` is defined as `a_1 % b`. For the loop to execute again, `b` must have a value that is non-zero. Since `b` is currently not zero, no adjustment is necessary for `b`. However, `a` being equal to the previous value of `b` does not require any changes either as it does not affect the loop's continuation.

Thus, the given states are sufficient for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`a_1` is a positive integer, `a_2` is a positive integer, `b` must be non-zero; `a` is equal to the previous value of `b`, and `b` is equal to `a_1 % b`**
