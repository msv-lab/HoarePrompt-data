To determine the output state, we analyze the provided code and initial conditions:

- `a_1` and `a_2` are positive integers (0 < `a_1`, `a_2` ≤ 2·10^9).
- `b_1` and `b_2` are integers (-2·10^9 ≤ `b_1`, `b_2` ≤ 2·10^9).
- `L` and `R` are integers (-2·10^9 ≤ `L` ≤ `R` ≤ 2·10^9).
- The current value of `sign_a1` is greater than 0.

The code snippet provided is:
```
k = (L - (b1 + a1 * x)) // (a1 * a1_div_gcd)
```
In this line:
- The expression `L - (b1 + a1 * x)` calculates a value based on `L`, `b1`, `a1`, and `x`.
- This value is then divided by `(a1 * a1_div_gcd)` using floor division `//`, which means `k` will take the integer result of this division.
- The variables `L`, `b1`, `a1`, `x`, and `a1_div_gcd` play a crucial role in determining the outcome, but the specific values of `x` and `a1_div_gcd` are unknown, so we cannot compute a specific value for `k`.

Since `k` is assigned a value based on the calculation, it is the only variable affected in the given program. The other variables remain unchanged, and we specify that `k` will be the result of the expression, which is dependent on the values of `L`, `b1`, `a1`, `x`, and `a1_div_gcd`.

Output State: **`a_1` and `a_2` are positive integers; `b_1` and `b_2` are integers; `L` and `R` are integers; current value of `sign_a1` is greater than 0; `k` is assigned the value of (L - (b1 + a1 * x)) // (a1 * a1_div_gcd)**.
