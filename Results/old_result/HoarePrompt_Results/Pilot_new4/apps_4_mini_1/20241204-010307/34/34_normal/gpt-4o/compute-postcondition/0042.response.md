Postcondition: ***`a1` and `a2` are positive integers, `b1` and `b2` are integers, and `L` and `R` are integers. If `val` is within the range [L, R], then `count` is increased by 1. If `val` is greater than `R`, `x0` is incremented by `a2_div_gcd`, `y0` is decremented by `a1_div_gcd`, and `val` is recalculated as `a1 * x0 + b1`, after which the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
