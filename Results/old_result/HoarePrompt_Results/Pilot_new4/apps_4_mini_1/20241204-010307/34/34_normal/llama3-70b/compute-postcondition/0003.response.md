The statement `a, b = b, a % b` performs a simultaneous assignment. 

1. Before execution, we have:
   - `a` is equal to the previous value of `b`.
   - `b` is equal to `a_1 % b`.

2. After execution:
   - The new value of `a` becomes the previous value of `b` (which was `b`).
   - The new value of `b` becomes `a_1 % b`.

Thus, the relevant updates are:
- `a` is now equal to the previous value of `b`.
- `b` is now equal to `a_1 % b`.

The other variables remain unchanged, and we know `a_1` is a positive integer and `b` must be non-zero.

Output State: **`a_1` is a positive integer, `a_2` is a positive integer, `b` is non-zero, `a` is equal to the previous value of `b`, and `b` is equal to `a_1 % b`.**
