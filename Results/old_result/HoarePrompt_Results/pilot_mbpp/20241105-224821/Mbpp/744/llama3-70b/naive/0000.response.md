Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly checks if the given tuple has any `None` value or not by utilizing the `any()` function along with a generator expression. The generator expression checks each element in the tuple `tup` and returns `True` if any element is `None`, otherwise it returns `False`. This logic covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Hence, the program is correct.
