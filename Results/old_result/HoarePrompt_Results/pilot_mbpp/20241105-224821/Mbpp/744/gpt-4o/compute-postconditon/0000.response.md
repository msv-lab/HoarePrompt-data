According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the tuple `tup`. If the tuple has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, we need to ensure that the tuple has at least 1 element. Since the elements of the tuple can be of any data type, including None, we need to adjust the state to `tup` contains at least 1 element.
State: **`tup` contains at least 1 element**
