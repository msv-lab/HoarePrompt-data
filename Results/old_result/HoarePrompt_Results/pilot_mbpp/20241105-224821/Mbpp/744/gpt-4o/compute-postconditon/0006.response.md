According to the code, the loop can execute again if `tup` contains more elements that haven't been iterated over yet. At the end of the last iteration, `tup` contains at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `item` should iterate over the next element in `tup`.
State: **`tup` contains at least 3 elements, `item` is the next element in `tup` to be iterated over.**
