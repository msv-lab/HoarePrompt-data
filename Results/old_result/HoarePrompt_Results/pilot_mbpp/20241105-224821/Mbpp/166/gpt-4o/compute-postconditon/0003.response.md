Example Answer:
`odd_pairs` is calculated by multiplying `odd_count` with `odd_count - 1` and then dividing by 2. The value of `odd_count` is the difference between the length of `lst` and `even_count`. Therefore, the output state is: `lst` is a list of integers, `even_count` holds the count of even numbers in the list, `odd_count` is the difference between the length of `lst` and `even_count`, and `odd_pairs` is calculated as described.
Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `even_count` holds the count of even numbers in the list, `odd_count` is the difference between the length of `lst` and `even_count`, and `odd_pairs` is calculated accordingly**
