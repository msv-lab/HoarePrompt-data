Example Answer: 
The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is unknown, so the new value of `count` is one more than the previous value. The states of other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`nums` has at least 3 elements, `count` is updated based on XOR operations, `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1, `j` is incremented by 1, `count` is one more than the previous value**
