According to the code, the loop can execute if `nums` has at least 3 elements. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` has at least 3 elements. Since the loop covers all possible combinations of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to iterate through the length of `nums` - 2. Additionally, `j` should be initialized to `i + 1` and incremented by 1 in each iteration. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`nums` has at least 3 elements, `i` iterates through the length of `nums` - 2, `j` is initialized to `i + 1`**
