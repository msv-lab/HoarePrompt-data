According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than the length of `nums`. At the end of the last iteration, `i`, `j`, and `count` were updated based on the XOR operations and conditions. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`nums` has at least 3 elements, `count` is updated based on XOR operations, `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1, `j` is incremented by 1**
