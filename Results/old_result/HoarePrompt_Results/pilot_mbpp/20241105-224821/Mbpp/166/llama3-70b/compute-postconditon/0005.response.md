According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and the length of `nums`. If `i` is less than the length of `nums` - 1, the loop can execute one more time. Additionally, `j` is equal to `i + 1`, so for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` needs to be adjusted accordingly. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, and `i` is less than the length of `nums` - 1.

States that need to be adjusted:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to move to the next index.
- `j` needs to be equal to the new value of `i` + 1 to satisfy the loop condition.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is equal to the new value of `i + 1**.
