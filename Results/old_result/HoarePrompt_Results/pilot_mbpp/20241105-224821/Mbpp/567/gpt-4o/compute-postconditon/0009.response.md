According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than the length of the list minus 1. At the end of the last iteration, `lst` is a list of comparable elements with a length of at least 2, `i` is 2. Since the element at index `i` in `lst` is not compared to the element at index `i + 1` and there is no change to the state of the variables, the loop can execute one more time with `i` being incremented by 1.
State: **`lst` is a list of comparable elements with a length of at least 2, `i` is 3**
