Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it only checks if each element is less than the next element. However, the problem description asks to check whether the list is sorted or not, which implies that the elements should be in non-decreasing order. The program should be modified to consider cases where elements are equal as well. 

For example, if the input list is [1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17], the program will incorrectly return True because it only checks if each element is less than the next one, but does not consider the fact that 17 is out of order in this list.
