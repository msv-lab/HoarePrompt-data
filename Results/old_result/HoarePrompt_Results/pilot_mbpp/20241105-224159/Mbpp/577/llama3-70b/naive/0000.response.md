Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly find the last digit in the factorial of a given number for all potential cases. The program only returns specific values for certain inputs (2, 3, 4), and for all other cases it returns 0, which is not the correct last digit of the factorial.

For example, when n = 5, the factorial of 5 is 120, and the last digit is 0. However, the program incorrectly returns 0 for n = 5, which is not the correct last digit.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases, making the correctness **False**.
