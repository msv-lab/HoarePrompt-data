Postcondition: ***`n` is 3 or greater, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, and `i` is 4. If `n` is less than or equal to 16, no changes occur. If `n` is greater than 16, all non-prime numbers within the range of `i * i` and `n` are set to False in the `is_prime` list. Variables `n`, `is_prime[0]`, `is_prime[1]`, and `i` remain unchanged after the loop executes.***
