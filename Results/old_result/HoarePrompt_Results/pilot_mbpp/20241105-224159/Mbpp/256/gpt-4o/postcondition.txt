The function `func` accepts a non-negative integer `n`. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, the function returns 0. For `n` greater than 2, the function iterates through numbers from 2 to the square root of `n`. For each prime number `i`, it marks all multiples of `i` in the range of `i * i` to `n - 1` as False in the `is_prime` list. The function then returns the sum of the `is_prime` list. The code correctly handles identifying prime numbers within the given range of `n`, but it does not handle the scenario where `n` is negative.
