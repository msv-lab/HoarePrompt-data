The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`, which is a non-negative integer. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, the function returns 0. If `n` is greater than 2, the function iterates through all numbers from 2 to the square root of `n`. For each prime number `i`, the function sets all multiples of `i` in the range of `i * i` to `n - 1` to False in the `is_prime` list. If `n` is less than `i * i`, the loop does not execute. After the loop, the values of `n`, `is_prime[0]`, `is_prime[1]`, and `i` are unchanged. The function returns the sum of the `is_prime` list. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return the sum of a list where prime numbers have been identified based on the algorithm described.
