According to the code, the loop can execute again if `n` is greater than or equal to 3 and `i` is less than the square root of `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is 3 or greater, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `i` is 3. If `is_prime[i]` is True, the loop sets all elements in the `is_prime` list to False where the index is a multiple of `i` starting from `i*i` up to `n`. If `n` is less than `i*i`, the loop does not execute. Any elements in the `is_prime` list that were already False remain unchanged. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `n` should remain 3 or greater, `is_prime[0]` should remain False, `is_prime[1]` should remain False, and `i` should be incremented to 4.
State: **`n` is 3 or greater, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `i` is 4**
