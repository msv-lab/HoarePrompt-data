Postcondition: ***`n` is 3 or greater, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `i` is 2. If `is_prime[i]` is True, then after the loop executes, all indices in the `is_prime` list that are multiples of `i` from `i * i` to `n - 1` will be set to False. If `i * i` is greater than or equal to `n`, the loop will not execute.***
