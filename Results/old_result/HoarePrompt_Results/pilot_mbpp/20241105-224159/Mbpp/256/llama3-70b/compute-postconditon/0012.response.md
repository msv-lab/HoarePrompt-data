Output State: **If `num` is less than 2, the loop does not execute and there is no change in the state of the variables. If `num` is 2 or greater, `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is the next integer after the previous iteration, and if `num` is divisible by `i`, the function returns False. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables `n`, `num`, and `i`.**
