According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `num` and `i`. If `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `num`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer, `num` is 2 or greater, `i` is 2. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. There is no change in `n` and `num`.
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `num` is 2 or greater, `i` is 3**
