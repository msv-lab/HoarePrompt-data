Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided defines a function `count_Primes_nums(n: int) -> int` that takes in a non-negative integer `n` and returns the number of prime numbers less than `n`. The code also includes a helper function `is_prime(num: int) -> bool` that checks if a number is prime.

The main function iterates through the range [2, n) and for each number in this range, it calls the `is_prime()` function. If the number is prime, it increments a counter `count` by 1. Finally, the function returns the value of the counter `count`.

The code correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. It correctly counts the number of prime numbers less than the given non-negative number `n`. The `is_prime()` helper function also correctly identifies prime numbers.

Therefore, the code is correct and the correctness is **True**.
