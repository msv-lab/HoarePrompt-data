According to the code, the loop can execute if `num` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `count` is initially 1, and it becomes 2 if `func2(num)` evaluates to true. `n` remains an integer greater than or equal to 3, and `num` is less than n. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the following:
1. If `func2(num)` evaluated to true in the last iteration, then `count` would have been updated to 2. Otherwise, `count` remains 1.
2. Since `num` is less than `n`, we need to increment `num` by 1 to proceed to the next iteration.

Therefore, the adjusted state for the next iteration would be:
State: **`count` is initially 1 or 2 based on `func2(num)` evaluation, `n` remains an integer greater than or equal to 3, and `num` is less than n+1**
