Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code seems to be correct and follows the problem description. The function `noprofit_noloss` simply compares the `cost_price` and `selling_price` and returns True if they are equal, indicating no profit or loss. The code handles this logic correctly for all cases provided in the test assertions. The output hints also confirm that the code is behaving as expected based on the problem description.
