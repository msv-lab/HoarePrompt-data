The function `func` accepts a parameter `c`, which is a complex number. After executing the function body, the function returns the absolute value of `c` and the phase of `c`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept a complex number `c` and return its absolute value and phase. 
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter c, which is a complex number, and returns the absolute value and phase of c.**
