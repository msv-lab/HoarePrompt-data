Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program accurately implements the problem description by using the built-in `count` method of tuples in Python, which counts the occurrences of a specific element in the tuple. The logic is straightforward and handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Since the implementation aligns with the requirements and there are no edge cases where the program fails to produce the correct output, the correctness is deemed to be true.
