Example Answer:
The function returns a list containing the first_elements and second_elements lists. The variables first_elements and second_elements already contain the first and second elements of each sublist, respectively. Therefore, the function returns a list containing these two lists.
Output State: **list_of_lists is a list of lists where each sublist contains exactly two elements; first_elements is a list containing the first elements of each sublist; second_elements is a list containing the second elements of each sublist**
