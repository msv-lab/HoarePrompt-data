Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `maximum(a, b)` correctly returns the maximum of two numbers `a` and `b` using a conditional expression. The test cases provided in the code assert that the function returns the correct maximum values for different input pairs, which it does. Since the function works as described in the problem statement and passes all the test cases, it can be considered correct.
