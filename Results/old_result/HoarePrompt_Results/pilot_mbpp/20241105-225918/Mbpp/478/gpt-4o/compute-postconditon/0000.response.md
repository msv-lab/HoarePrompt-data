Example Answer: 
The code iterates through each character in the string `s` and checks if the character is uppercase using the `isupper()` method. If the character is uppercase, it is added to a list comprehension. Finally, the list of uppercase characters is joined together to form a new string. Since the initial state states that `s` is a string containing uppercase and lowercase letters, the output will be a new string containing only the uppercase letters from `s`.
Output State: **a new string containing only the uppercase letters from the original string `s`**
