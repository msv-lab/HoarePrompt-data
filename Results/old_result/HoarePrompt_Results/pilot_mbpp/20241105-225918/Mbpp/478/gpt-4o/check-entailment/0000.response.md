Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided defines a function called `remove_lowercase` that takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string containing only the uppercase letters from the original string `s`. The function achieves this by using a list comprehension to iterate over each character in the input string `s`, checking if the character is uppercase using the `isupper()` method, and only keeping the uppercase characters in the new string.

After reviewing the code and the problem description, it is evident that the code aligns with the problem statement. The function accurately removes all lowercase substrings from the input string and returns a new string containing only the uppercase letters. The examples provided in the code testing also confirm that the function works as expected. 

Moreover, the output hints further support the correctness of the code by clarifying that the function is designed to return a new string with only the uppercase letters from the original string. Since the code meets the requirements specified in the problem description and the output hints validate its functionality, we can conclude that the code is correct for all potential cases.
