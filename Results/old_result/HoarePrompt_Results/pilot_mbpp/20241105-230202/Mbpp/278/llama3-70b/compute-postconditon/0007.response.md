Example Answer: 
The code returns the index of `elem` in the tuple `tup`. Since `elem` is the third element in `tup`, the index of `elem` in `tup` is 2 (as indexing starts from 0). Therefore, the output state is: `tup` is a tuple containing at least three elements, the next element after `elem` is also a tuple, `elem` is the third element in the tuple, and the function returns 2.
Output State: **`tup` is a tuple containing at least three elements, the next element after `elem` is also a tuple, `elem` is the third element in the tuple, and the function returns 2**
