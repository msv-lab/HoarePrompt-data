Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the tuple contains multiple elements before the tuple element. The program only returns the index of the first tuple element it encounters, which may not be the correct number of elements that occurred before that tuple element in the tuple. 

For example, if the input tuple is `(1, 2, (3, 4), 5, 6, (7, 8))`, the program will return 2 as the output, which is incorrect. The correct output should be 4, as there are 4 elements `(1, 2, 5, 6)` that occur before the tuple element `(7, 8)`.
