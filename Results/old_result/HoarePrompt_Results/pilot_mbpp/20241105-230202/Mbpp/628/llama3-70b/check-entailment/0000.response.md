Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided seems to be correct based on the problem description. The function `replace_spaces` takes a string `s` as input and returns a modified string where spaces are replaced by '%20'. The code uses the built-in `replace` method in Python, which replaces all occurrences of a specified value with another value in a string. Since the code directly implements the required functionality as described in the problem statement, and there are no edge cases mentioned that are not handled by the code, we can conclude that the code is correct. The output hints also align with the code and confirm that it meets the specified requirements.
