The function returns the input string `s` with spaces replaced by '%20'. Since the initial state is `s` is a string, the output state after running the code is `s` is a string, and the function returns the modified string with spaces replaced by '%20'.
Output State: **`s` is a string, and the function returns the modified string with spaces replaced by '%20'**
