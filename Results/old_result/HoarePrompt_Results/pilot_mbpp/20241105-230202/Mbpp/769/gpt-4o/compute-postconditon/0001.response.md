Example Answer:
set2 is assigned the value of set(list2), where list2 is a list of elements. The previous values of list1, list2, and set1 are known, and set1 is a set created from list1. After execution, set2 will now contain the elements of list2. Therefore, the Output State is: list1 and list2 are lists of elements; set1 is a set created from list1; set2 is a set created from list2.
Output State: **list1 and list2 are lists of elements; set1 is a set created from list1; set2 is a set created from list2**
