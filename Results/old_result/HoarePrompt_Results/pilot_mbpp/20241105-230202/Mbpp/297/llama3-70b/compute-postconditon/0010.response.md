Example Answer:
The `func(element)` is applied to the `element`, and the result is extended to the `flat_list`. The `flat_list` now contains the elements returned by `func(element)` if `element` is a list. The `nested_list` remains unchanged, and the `element` is the next element in `nested_list`.
Output State: **`nested_list` has more than 1 element, `element` is the new next element in `nested_list`, `flat_list` contains the elements returned by `func(element)` if `element` is a list; otherwise, `flat_list` contains the `element` from `nested_list` with additional elements added by `func(element)` if applicable**
