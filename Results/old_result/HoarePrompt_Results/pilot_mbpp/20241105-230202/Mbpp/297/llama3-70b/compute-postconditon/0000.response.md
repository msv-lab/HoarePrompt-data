Example Answer:
The variable `flat_list` is initialized as an empty list. This code does not affect any other variables in the program. Therefore, the Output State is: `nested_list` is a nested list structure where each element can be either a list or a non-list element; `flat_list` is an empty list.
Output State: **`nested_list` is a nested list structure where each element can be either a list or a non-list element; `flat_list` is an empty list**
