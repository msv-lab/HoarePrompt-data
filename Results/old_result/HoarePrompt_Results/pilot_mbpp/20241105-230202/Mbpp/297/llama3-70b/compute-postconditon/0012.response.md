Postcondition: ***`nested_list` has more than 1 element, `element` is the new next element in `nested_list`, `flat_list` contains the elements returned by `func(element)` if `element` is a list; otherwise, `flat_list` contains the `element` from `nested_list` with additional elements added by `func(element)` if applicable. If `element` is a list, the elements returned by `func(element)` are appended to `flat_list`. If `element` is not a list, `element` is appended to `flat_list`.***
