According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the nested_list. If the nested_list has at least 1 item, the loop will execute. At the start of the loop, flat_list is an empty list. So for the loop to be executed, the nested_list must have at least 1 item, and item is the first item in the nested_list.
State: **`nested_list` is a list that contains at least 1 item, `flat_list` is an empty list, item is the first item in `nested_list`**
