Example Answer:
The function returns `True` and `index`, where `index` is 1. Therefore, the function returns True and 1. The return statement does not change the state. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of elements with at least 2 elements, `element` is the second element in `arr`, `index` is 1, the function returns True and 1.
Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements with at least 2 elements, `element` is the second element in `arr`, `index` is 1, the function returns True and 1**
