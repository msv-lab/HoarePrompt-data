The function `func` accepts two parameters: `arr`, which is a list of elements, and `element`, which is a single element that can be compared to the elements in `arr`. The function is designed to search for the `element` within the `arr`. 

In Case 1, if the `element` is found in the `arr`, the function will return True along with the index where the element is located. If the `element` is not found in the `arr`, the function will return False. If the `arr` is an empty list, the function will also return False. If the `arr` is not empty but the `element` is not present in the `arr`, the function will return False.

In Case 2, the behavior is the same as in Case 1: if the `element` is found in the `arr`, the function will return True along with the index where the element is located. If the `element` is not found in the `arr`, the function will return False. If the `arr` is an empty list, the function will also return False.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to search for the `element` within the `arr` and return True along with the index where the element is located if it is found. If the `element` is not found in the `arr`, the function returns False. If the `arr` is empty, the function also returns False.
