According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the list `arr`. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop executes. At the beginning of the loop, arr is a list of elements and element is a single element, so the loop needs to adjust to index is 0 and value is the first element in the list.
State: **arr is a list of elements with at least 1 element, element is the first element in arr, index is 0**
