Output State: 
If the element is found in the arr, the loop will return True and the index where the element is located. If the element is not found in the arr, the loop will return False.
If arr is an empty list, the loop won't execute, and it will return False.
If arr is not an empty list but the element is not present in the arr, the loop will return False.
In all cases where the loop doesn't execute, the index value is not defined.
Therefore, the output state is: **If element is found in arr, loop returns True and index. If element is not found in arr, loop returns False. If arr is empty, loop returns False.**
