The function accepts a parameter list_of_lists, iterates through each sublist, calculates the length of the longest sublist, and returns that length. If the input list is empty, it returns 0. The function accurately determines the length of the longest sublist regardless of the initial value of `max_length` mentioned in the annotations.
