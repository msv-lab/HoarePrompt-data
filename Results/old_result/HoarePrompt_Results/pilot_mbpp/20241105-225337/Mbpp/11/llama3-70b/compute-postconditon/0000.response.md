Example Answer:
`first_occ` is assigned the index of the first occurrence of character `c` in string `s`. If `c` is found in `s`, `first_occ` will be the index of the first occurrence, otherwise `-1` is returned. The state of other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: s is a string, c is a single character; first_occ is either the index of the first occurrence of c in s or -1.
Output State: **s is a string, c is a single character; first_occ is either the index of the first occurrence of c in s or -1**
