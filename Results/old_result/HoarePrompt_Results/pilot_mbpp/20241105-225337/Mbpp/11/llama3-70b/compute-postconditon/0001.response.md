Example Answer:
`last_occ` is assigned the value of `s.rfind(c)`, which finds the last occurrence of the character `c` in the string `s`. If `first_occ` is the index of the first occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1, then after executing the code, `last_occ` will hold the index of the last occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1 if `c` is not found in `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: s is a string, c is a single character, `first_occ` is either the index of the first occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1, `last_occ` is either the index of the last occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1.
Output State: **s is a string, c is a single character, `first_occ` is either the index of the first occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1, `last_occ` is either the index of the last occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1**
