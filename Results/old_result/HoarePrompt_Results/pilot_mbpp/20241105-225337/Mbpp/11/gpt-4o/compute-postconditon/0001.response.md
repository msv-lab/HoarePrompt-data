Example Answer:
last_index is assigned the value of the last index where ch is found in s using the rfind method. The value of first_index is either the index where ch is first found in s or -1 if ch is not in s. Therefore, the Output State is: s is a string, ch is a string of length 1, first_index is either the index where ch is first found in s or -1 if ch is not in s, last_index is the last index where ch is found in s.
Output State: **s is a string, ch is a string of length 1, first_index is either the index where ch is first found in s or -1 if ch is not in s, last_index is the last index where ch is found in s**
