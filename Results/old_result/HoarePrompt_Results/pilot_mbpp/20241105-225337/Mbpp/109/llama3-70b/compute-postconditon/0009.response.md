Example Answer:
The variable `temp` is assigned a substring of `s` starting from index 1 and ending at the length of `s`. Since `s` is a binary string, `temp` will be a substring of `s` starting from the second character to the end of the string. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a binary string, `n` is greater than 0, `count` is updated based on the count of '1' in `temp` string modulo 2, `i` is 2, `temp` is a substring of `s` starting from index 1 and ending at the length of `s`.
Output State: **`s` is a binary string, `n` is greater than 0, `count` is updated based on the count of '1' in `temp` string modulo 2, `i` is 2, `temp` is a substring of `s` starting from index 1 and ending at the length of `s`**
