Example Answer:
The value of `count` is increased by 1. The previous value of `count` is 0, so after execution, `count` becomes 1. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `binary_str` is the rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is greater than 0, `count` is 1, `integer_value` is the new integer value of the rotated `binary_str`.
Output State: **`binary_str` is the rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is greater than 0, `count` is 1, `integer_value` is the new integer value of the rotated `binary_str`**
