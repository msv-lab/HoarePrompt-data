Example Answer:
The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `binary_str` is the updated rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is the same, `count` is either incremented by 1 or remains the same based on the `integer_value` after rotation, `integer_value` is the decimal representation of `binary_str`.
Output State: **`binary_str` is the updated rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is the same, `count` is either incremented by 1 or remains the same based on the `integer_value` after rotation, `integer_value` is the decimal representation of `binary_str`**
