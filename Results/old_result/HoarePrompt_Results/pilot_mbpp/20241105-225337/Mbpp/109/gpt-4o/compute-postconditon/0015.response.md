Postcondition: ***`binary_str` is the updated rotated binary string, `num_rotations` remains the same, `count` is either incremented by 1 or remains the same based on the `integer_value` after rotation. `integer_value` is the decimal representation of `binary_str`. If the `integer_value` after rotation is odd, `count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `count` remains unchanged.***
