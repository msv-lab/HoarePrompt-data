Example Answer:
The code rotates the `binary_str` by moving the last character to the beginning. The value of `binary_str` changes based on this rotation. The value of `num_rotations` and `count` remain the same. 
Output State: **`binary_str` is a rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is greater than 0, `count` is 0**
