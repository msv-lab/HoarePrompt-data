Example Answer:
The `binary_str` is rotated by shifting the last character to the beginning. The `integer_value` is the integer value of the `binary_str`, which changes after the rotation. The `num_rotations` remains the same, and the `count` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `binary_str` is the rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is greater than 0, `count` is 0, `integer_value` is the new integer value of the rotated `binary_str`.
Output State: **`binary_str` is the rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is greater than 0, `count` is 0, `integer_value` is the new integer value of the rotated `binary_str`**
