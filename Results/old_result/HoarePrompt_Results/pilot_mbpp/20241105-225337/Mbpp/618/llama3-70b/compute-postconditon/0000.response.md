Example Answer:
The code raises a `ValueError` if the lengths of `list1` and `list2` are not the same. Since it is a `raise` statement, the execution halts at this point. Therefore, the Output State is: `list1` and `list2` are lists of the same length.
Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are lists of the same length**
