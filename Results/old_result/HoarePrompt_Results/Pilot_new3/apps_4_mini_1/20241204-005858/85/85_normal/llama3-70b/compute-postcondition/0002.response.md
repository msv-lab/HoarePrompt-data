According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n // 2 + 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 2 because the minimum value of `n` given is 2 (which makes `n // 2` equal to 1). Therefore, the loop will execute with `i` starting from 1.

At the end of the last iteration, `ans` is 0. Thus, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `n` is in the specified range of 2 to 10^9, and the loop variable `i` will start at 1.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `ans` is 0, `i` is 1**
