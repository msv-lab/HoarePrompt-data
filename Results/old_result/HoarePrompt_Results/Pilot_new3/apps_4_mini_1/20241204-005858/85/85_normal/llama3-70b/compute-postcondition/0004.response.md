`ans` is incremented by 1. The variables `n` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `ans` will be 1 after the increment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `ans` is 1; `i` is 1. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `ans` is 1; `i` is 1.**
