Postcondition: ***If the string `s` contains at least one character in the `alphabet`, `res` will be a string with the appended characters in each iteration, and the length of `res` will be 26. The function will print `res`. If `s` does not contain any character from the `alphabet`, the loop won't execute, leaving `res` as an empty string and `s` unchanged. In this case, the function will print -1. In both scenarios, `s` remains unchanged, `res` will either be a string with 26 characters or an empty string, and `alphabet` will remain defined and not empty.***
