Example Answer:
The character `char` in the string `s` is replaced with the character that comes after it in the alphabet, and only the first occurrence is replaced. The variable `res` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string with the character `char` replaced by the next character in the alphabet, `res` is a string with the appended character, `alphabet` is defined and not empty.
Output State: **`s` is a string with the character `char` replaced by the next character in the alphabet, `res` is a string with the appended character, `alphabet` is defined and not empty**
