Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code correctly follows the problem description. It takes the input string `s` and iterates over it to match the target alphabet sequence "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz". If the entire target sequence is matched, it prints out the target sequence. If not, it prints -1. The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. The output hints also align with the code logic, confirming its correctness.
