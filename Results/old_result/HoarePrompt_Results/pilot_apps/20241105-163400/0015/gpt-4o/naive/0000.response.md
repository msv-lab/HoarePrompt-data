Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly determines whether Vasya's favorite number appears in the sequence or not. It covers all possible cases as described in the problem statement. 
1. If Vasya's favorite number is equal to the first element of the sequence, it prints "YES".
2. If the difference between any two neighboring elements is 0, which means the sequence will be constant and not contain Vasya's favorite number, it prints "NO".
3. For all other cases, it calculates if Vasya's favorite number can be reached by adding multiples of the difference between elements starting from the first element. If it is possible and the number of steps is non-negative, it prints "YES", otherwise "NO".
