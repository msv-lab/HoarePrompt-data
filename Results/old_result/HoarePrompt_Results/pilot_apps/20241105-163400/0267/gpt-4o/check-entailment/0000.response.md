Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code defines a function `contains_at_most_k_unique_digits` that checks if a number contains at most `k` unique digits.
- The code defines a function `sum_of_numbers_with_k_unique_digits` that iterates through the range of numbers from `l` to `r` inclusive, checks if each number contains at most `k` unique digits using the `contains_at_most_k_unique_digits` function, and updates the total sum by adding the number and taking the modulo of `MOD`.
- The code then reads the input, calculates the sum of numbers with at most `k` unique digits, and prints the result.

The code follows the problem description for every potential case. The output hints also align with the code's functionality, which confirms that the code is correct. The program iterates through the range of numbers from `l` to `r`, checks if each number contains at most `k` unique digits, and calculates the sum accordingly. The output will be the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` such that each number contains at most `k` different digits, modulo `998244353`.
