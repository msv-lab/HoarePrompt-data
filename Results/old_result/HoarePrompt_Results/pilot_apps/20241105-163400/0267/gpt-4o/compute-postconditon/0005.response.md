According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r`. Before the loop starts, `total_sum` is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `l` is less than or equal to `r` and `num` is equal to `l`.
State: **`total_sum` is 0, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `num` is equal to `l`**
