The function `func` accepts three parameters `l`, `r`, and `k`. `l`, `r`, and `k` are integers. The function iterates through the range of numbers from `l` to `r`, inclusive. For each number `num` in this range, if the number of unique digits in the string representation of `num` is less than or equal to `k` (evaluated by calling `func(num, k)`), then `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. If `l` is greater than `r`, the loop does not execute, and no changes occur to the variables. The function returns `total_sum`, which is an integer representing the sum of numbers that meet the condition during the iteration.
Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters l, r, and k, iterates through the range of numbers from l to r inclusive, and updates total_sum with the sum of numbers that have unique digits less than or equal to k. The function returns the final total_sum.**
