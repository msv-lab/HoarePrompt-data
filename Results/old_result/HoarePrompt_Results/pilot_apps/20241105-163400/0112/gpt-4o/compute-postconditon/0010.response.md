According to the code, for the loop to execute one more time, the condition in the if statement must not be met in the current iteration. This means that the `i`-th element in `used_cubes` must not be True and `digit` should not be in the `i`-th element of `cube_faces`. At the end of the last iteration, `digits` has at least 1 character, `digit` is the first character in `digits`, `cube_faces` contains unique integers of corresponding cubes, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements with one element set to True, `found` is True, and `n` is at least 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:

State: **`digits` has at least 1 character, `digit` is the first character in `digits`, `cube_faces` contains unique integers of corresponding cubes, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements with the `i`-th element set to True, `found` is True, `n` is at least 1, and the condition specified in the if statement is not met for the `i`-th element**
