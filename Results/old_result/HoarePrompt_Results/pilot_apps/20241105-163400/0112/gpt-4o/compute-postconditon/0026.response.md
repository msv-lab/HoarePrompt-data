According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more characters in the `digits` variable. At the end of the last iteration, `digits` has at least 2 characters and `digit` is the second character in `digits`. To execute the loop one more time, `digits` must have at least 3 characters and the `digit` should be the third character in `digits`. No other states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`digits` has at least 3 characters, `digit` is the third character in `digits`, `cube_faces` contains unique integers of corresponding cubes, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements where some elements may be True based on the conditions met in the loop, `found` is `False`, `n` is at least 1**
