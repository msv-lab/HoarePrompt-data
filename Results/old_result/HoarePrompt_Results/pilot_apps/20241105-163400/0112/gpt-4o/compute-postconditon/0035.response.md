According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the result of `func2(x + 1)`. If `func2(x + 1)` evaluates to `True`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the previous iteration, variable `x` is increased by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `func2(x + 1)` needs to be `True` at the end of the previous iteration. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **variable `x` is increased by 2**
