According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are cubes left in the set `cubes`. At the end of the last iteration, `digits` is a set containing string representations of digits from the cube set, and `cubes` is a set with at least one cube. Since `cubes` has at least one cube, the loop will execute again. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`digits` is a set containing string representations of digits from the cube set, `cubes` is a set with at least one cube**
