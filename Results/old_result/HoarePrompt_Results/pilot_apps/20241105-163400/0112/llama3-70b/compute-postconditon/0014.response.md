Example Answer:
The code prints the value of `max_num`, which is the largest number formed by the digits in the set `digits`. The set `digits` contains string representations of digits from cubes excluding '0', so the largest number formed by these digits would be the highest possible number combination. The previous values of the variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `digits` is a set containing string representations of digits from cubes excluding '0'; `max_num` is the largest number formed by these digits.
Output State: **`digits` is a set containing string representations of digits from cubes excluding '0'; `max_num` is the largest number formed by these digits**
