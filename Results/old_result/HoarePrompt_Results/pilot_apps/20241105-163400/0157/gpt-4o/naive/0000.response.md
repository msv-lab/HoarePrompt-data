Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input values for the number of lemons, apples, and pears. It then calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used based on the condition that there should be 2 apples for each lemon and 4 pears for each lemon. It calculates the total number of fruits used in the compote by multiplying the maximum number of lemons with 1, 2, and 4 respectively. Finally, it prints the total number of fruits used, which is the correct output according to the problem description. 

The program covers all potential cases mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output for each case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is true.
