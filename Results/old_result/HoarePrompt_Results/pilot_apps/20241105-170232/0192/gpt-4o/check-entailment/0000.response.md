Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain an equilateral triangle of side length y from a triangle of side length x as described in the problem. The formula used in the code, which is `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2`, accurately represents the logic mentioned in the problem description. 

The code takes the difference between the starting side length x and the desired side length y, divides it by 2 to get the number of steps needed to decrease two sides in each step, and then adds the remainder of the division to account for any additional steps needed. This approach is valid and works correctly for all potential cases within the given constraints. 

The output hints also confirm that the result of the expression in the code is a non-negative integer, which aligns with the expected output. Therefore, based on the code logic and the agreement with the problem description and output hints, the code can be deemed correct.
