Functionality: ** The function `func` accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`, calculates the `min_sum` value based on `k`, and then generates a sequence of values based on `d` and `k`. The function increments the value at each index by 1 until `remainder` becomes 0. If `remainder` is already 0 or if `k` is 0, the loop does not execute. The function returns the final sequence. If the minimum sum `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. The code handles cases where `n` or `k` are outside the specified range (1 <= n, k <= 10^10) or if `k` is 0, ensuring proper execution and output. **
