According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is within the range of `k - 1` to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `k` are positive integers, `min_sum` is the result of `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is the result of `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is the result of `n - d * min_sum - 1`, `sequence` is a list of values calculated based on `d` and `k`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted to `k - 2` to ensure it is still within the valid range of `k - 1` to 0.

State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers, `min_sum` is the result of `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is the result of `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is the result of `n - d * min_sum - 1`, `sequence` is a list of values calculated based on `d` and `k`, `i` is equal to `k - 2`**.
