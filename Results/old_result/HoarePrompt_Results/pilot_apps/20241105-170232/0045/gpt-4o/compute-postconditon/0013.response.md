Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers, `min_sum` is the result of `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is the result of `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is the result of `n - d * min_sum - 1`, `sequence` is a list of values calculated based on `d` and `k`, `i` is equal to `k - 2`. If `remainder` is equal to 0, the loop breaks. In all other cases, the program continues executing without any changes to the variables.***
