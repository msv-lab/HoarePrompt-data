Example Answer:
The function returns -1. The return statement does not change the state, so the output state is n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^10, and `min_sum` is the result of the calculation `k * (k + 1) // 2`.
Output State: **n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^10, `min_sum` is the result of the calculation `k * (k + 1) // 2**
