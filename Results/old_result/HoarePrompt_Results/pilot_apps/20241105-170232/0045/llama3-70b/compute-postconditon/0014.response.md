Example Answer: 
The value of `i` is appended to the list `seq`, so the value of `i` which is 1 is added to `seq`. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the first integer input, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seq` contains 1, and `i` is 1.
Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seq` contains 1, and `i` is 1**
