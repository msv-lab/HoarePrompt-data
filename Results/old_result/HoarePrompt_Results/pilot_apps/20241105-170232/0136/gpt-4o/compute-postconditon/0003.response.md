Example Answer:
The value of `b` is assigned the value of the element at index 1 of the list `data` with leading zeros stripped. The value of `a` is the value at index 0 of the list `data` with leading zeros stripped. The output state is: `data` is a list containing the input values, `a` is the value at index 0 with leading zeros stripped, `b` is the value at index 1 with leading zeros stripped.
Output State: **`data` is a list containing the input values, `a` is the value at index 0 with leading zeros stripped, `b` is the value at index 1 with leading zeros stripped**
