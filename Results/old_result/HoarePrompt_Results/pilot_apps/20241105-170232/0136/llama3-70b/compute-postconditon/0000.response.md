Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value of `input().lstrip('0')`, where `input` accepts an input and `lstrip('0')` removes any leading zeros from the input. Since `a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings, the leading zeros are removed. Therefore, the output state is `a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings with no leading zeros.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings with no leading zeros**
