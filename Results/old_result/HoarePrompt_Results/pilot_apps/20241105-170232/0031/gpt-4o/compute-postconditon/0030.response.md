Example Answer:
p_shared is assigned the value of (p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD. The values of p_total and p_no_shared are already assigned based on the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: p_no_shared is either assigned the value of numerator if k is greater than 0, or it remains unchanged if k is 0 or lower; p_total is assigned the value of denominator; p_shared is calculated based on the formula.
Output State: **p_no_shared is either assigned the value of numerator if k is greater than 0, or it remains unchanged if k is 0 or lower; p_total is assigned the value of denominator; p_shared is calculated based on the formula**
