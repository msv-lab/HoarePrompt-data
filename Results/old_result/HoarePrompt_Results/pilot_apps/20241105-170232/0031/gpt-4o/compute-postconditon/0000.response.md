Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value of `b` and `b` is assigned the value of `a % b`. The values of `a` and `b` are swapped, and `a % b` is calculated using the previous values of `a` and `b`. Since the initial state is not provided, the output state cannot be determined accurately without knowing the initial values of `a` and `b`.
Output State: **Depends on the initial values of `a` and `b`**
