According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is truthy (not equal to 0), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the state depends on the new values of `a` and `b`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `b` needs to be adjusted to a truthy value. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **Depends on the new values of `a` and `b`, where `b` is truthy**
