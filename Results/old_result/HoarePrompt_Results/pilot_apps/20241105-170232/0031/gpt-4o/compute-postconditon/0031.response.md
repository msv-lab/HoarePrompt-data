Example Answer:
If k is greater than 0, p_no_shared is assigned the value of numerator, otherwise it remains unchanged. p_total is assigned the value of denominator. p_shared is calculated based on the formula A = p_shared.
Output State: **p_no_shared is either assigned the value of numerator if k is greater than 0, or it remains unchanged if k is 0 or lower; p_total is assigned the value of denominator; A is the calculated value of p_shared**
