Output State: **If k is greater than or equal to 0, `numerator` will be the result of multiplying the product of total_days - i for each i in the range of k, `denominator` will be total_days raised to the power of k, `i` will be k, `total_days` is a very large number, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and `denominator`, and then `denominator` will be updated by dividing it by `gcd`. If k is less than 0, `numerator` and `denominator` will remain 1.**
