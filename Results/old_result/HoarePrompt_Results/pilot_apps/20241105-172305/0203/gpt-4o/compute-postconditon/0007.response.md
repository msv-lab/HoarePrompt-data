Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', `d_queue` is a list containing indices of characters 'D' in the `votes` string, `r_queue` is a list containing indices of characters 'R' in the `votes` string, `i` ranges from 0 to n-1, `v` takes the value of each character in the `votes` string. After the execution of the if-else block, `d_queue` contains indices of 'D' characters in `votes`, and `r_queue` contains indices of 'R' characters in `votes`. If 'D' is encountered, the index is appended to `d_queue`, otherwise, the index is appended to `r_queue`.***
