Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer. If `fractions` is an empty list, the loop does not execute, and both `depublicans` and `remocrats` remain 0. If `fractions` contains at least one fraction, `depublicans` is the count of 'D' fractions, and `remocrats` is the count of non-'D' fractions. After the if-else block executes, if `depublicans` is greater than `remocrats`, 'D' is printed. Otherwise, 'R' is printed. This covers all possible scenarios and edge cases.***
