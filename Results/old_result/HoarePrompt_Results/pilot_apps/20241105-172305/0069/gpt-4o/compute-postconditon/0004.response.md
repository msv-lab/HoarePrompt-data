Example Answer:
The code initializes an empty list `results`. The `index` variable is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: IndexError: list index out of range, `index` is 1; `results` is an empty list.
Output State: **IndexError: list index out of range, `index` is 1; `results` is an empty list**
