Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is initialized, `s` is assigned a string value, `balance` is calculated based on `s`, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`, `i` is 2, and `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the given formula where `prefix_balances[i]` is equal to `prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)`**
