Example Answer:
The value of `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the previous value of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and the character at position `i - 1` in string `s`. If the character is '0', 1 is added to `prefix_balances[i]`, otherwise, 1 is subtracted. The value of `i` remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is initialized, `s` is assigned a string value, `balance` is calculated based on `s`, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`, `i` is 1, and `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the given formula.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is initialized, `s` is assigned a string value, `balance` is calculated based on `s`, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`, `i` is 1, and `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the given formula**
