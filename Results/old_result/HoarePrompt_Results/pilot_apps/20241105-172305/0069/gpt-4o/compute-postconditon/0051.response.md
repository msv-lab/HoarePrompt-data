Output State: **The loop calculates the prefix sum of balances based on the values in the string s. If s[i - 1] is '0', 1 is added to the prefix balance, otherwise, -1 is added. The loop will execute at least once if n is at least 1. If n is less than 1, the loop will not execute and prefix_balances will remain initialized to 0.**
