According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `results`. If there are more values in `results`, the loop will execute again. Since there is no change in the state at the end of the last iteration, it can be inferred that `results` still contains values. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the next value in the `results` list needs to be processed.
State: **No change in the state, program prints the value of the next `result` in the list**
