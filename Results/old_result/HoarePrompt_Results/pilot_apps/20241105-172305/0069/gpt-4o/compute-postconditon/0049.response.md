Example Answer:
The value of `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the previous value of `prefix_balances[i-1]` and the condition `(1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is updated, `n` is incremented by 1, `results`, `x`, `s`, `balance`, and `prefix_balances` are adjusted, `prefix_balances[i]` is updated, and `i` is the next value.
Output State: **`T` is updated, `n` is incremented by 1, `results`, `x`, `s`, `balance`, and `prefix_balances` are adjusted, `prefix_balances[i]` is updated, and `i` is the next value**
