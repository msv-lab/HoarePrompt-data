According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `results` list. If there are more elements in the `results` list, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the `results` list contains elements and the loop has been executing. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the `results` list must have at least one more element.
State: **`prefix_balances` and `results` maintain their specified properties, ensuring the integrity of the program state, and `results` has at least one more element**
