Output State: **The loop iterates through the elements in `results` and prints each element. If `results` is empty, the loop does not execute, and no elements are printed. If there are elements in `results`, they are printed sequentially. After each iteration, there is no change in the state of the program, and the loop continues until all elements in `results` have been printed.**
