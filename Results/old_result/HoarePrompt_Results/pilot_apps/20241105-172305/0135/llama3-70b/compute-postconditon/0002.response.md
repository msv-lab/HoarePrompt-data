According to the code, the loop can execute if `k` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from user input, so no adjustment needed for `n` and `k`. Since `seen` is an empty set initially, you don't need to adjust it for the loop to execute. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are just `k` is greater than or equal to 1.
State: **`n` is an integer obtained from user input, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is an empty set**
