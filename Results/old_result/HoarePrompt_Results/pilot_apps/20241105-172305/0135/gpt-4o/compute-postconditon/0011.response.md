Example Answer:
The code calculates the remainder of dividing `n` by `i`, where `i` is `k + 1`. Since `i` is equal to `k + 1`, the remainder is calculated as `n % (k + 1)`. The value of `n` and `k` are unknown, but the initial state specifies that `n` and `k` are integers. Therefore, the output state is: `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is equal to `k + 1`, and `remainder` is the result of `n % (k + 1)`.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is equal to `k + 1`, and `remainder` is the result of `n % (k + 1)`**
