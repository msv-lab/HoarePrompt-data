According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `k + 1`, which means the loop did not execute for the last value of `i`. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `k` and no other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is equal to `k`, and `remainder` is the result of `n % (k + 1)`**
