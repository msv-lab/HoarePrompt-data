You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the program code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output description to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. The output description might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If the description describes certain edge cases thast the code does not cover then the code is incorrect. But for those edge cases you must think of an example where the program does not work correctly. if you can think of an example then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.
I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to check whether the given number can be represented as difference of two squares or not.
Program:
```
import math
def dif_Square(n):
    for i in range(int(math.sqrt(n)), -1, -1):
        for j in range(i, -1, -1):
            if i*i - j*j == n:
                return True
    return False
```

Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.
Code:
```
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = len(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
```

Example answer 4:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 5:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Imp is watching a documentary about cave painting. [Image] 

Some numbers, carved in chaotic order, immediately attracted his attention. Imp rapidly proposed a guess that they are the remainders of division of a number n by all integers i from 1 to k. Unfortunately, there are too many integers to analyze for Imp.

Imp wants you to check whether all these remainders are distinct. Formally, he wants to check, if all $n \text{mod} i$, 1 ≤ i ≤ k, are distinct, i. e. there is no such pair (i, j) that:   1 ≤ i < j ≤ k,  $n \operatorname{mod} i = n \operatorname{mod} j$, where $x \operatorname{mod} y$ is the remainder of division x by y. 


-----Input-----

The only line contains two integers n, k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18).


-----Output-----

Print "Yes", if all the remainders are distinct, and "No" otherwise.

You can print each letter in arbitrary case (lower or upper).


-----Examples-----
Input
4 4

Output
No

Input
5 3

Output
Yes



-----Note-----

In the first sample remainders modulo 1 and 4 coincide.
Program:
```
n, k = map(int, input().split())

def are_remainders_distinct(n, k):
    # For k >= n, there will always be non-distinct remainders
    if k >= n:
        return "No"
    
    # For k < n, we'll check for remainders
    seen_remainders = set()
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        remainder = n % i
        if remainder in seen_remainders:
            return "No"
        seen_remainders.add(remainder)
    
    return "Yes"

print(are_remainders_distinct(n, k))

```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
