Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly calculates the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment based on the given problem description.
- The function `min_time_to_reach` correctly calculates the block, floor, and apartment within the floor for both apartments.
- It then calculates the time for Edward to exit his apartment, walk between blocks, and reach the target floor in Natasha's apartment.
- The code uses the elevator, walking between blocks, and walking within the same block as described in the problem description.
- The code handles the circular nature of the building by considering the minimum time to walk clockwise or counterclockwise around the building.
- The output hints also agree with the code, as the function returns a result based on the input values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`.
