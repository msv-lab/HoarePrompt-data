Example Answer:
The function `func` is called with parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. The values of `a` and `b` are obtained by splitting the input, and their initial values are unknown. The function executes and returns a result. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are assigned the integer values obtained from splitting the input, and the function returns a result.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are assigned the integer values obtained from splitting the input, and the function returns a result**
