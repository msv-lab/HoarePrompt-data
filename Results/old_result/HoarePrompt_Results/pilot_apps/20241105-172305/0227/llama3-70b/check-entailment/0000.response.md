Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. The code first reads the input values where `n` represents the number of integers in the sequence and `a` is a list containing the distinct positive integers in ascending order. Then, it sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The code then initializes a variable `m` to 1 and iterates over the list `a` starting from the second element. For each element, if the current element is not equal to twice the previous element, it increments the variable `m`. This process ensures that the minimum number of variables required to perform the described sequence of operations is calculated correctly. Finally, the code prints the value of `m` if it is less than or equal to 23, else it prints -1. The output hints also align with the code's logic and confirm that it correctly handles the described scenario. Therefore, the code is correct.
