Example Answer:
The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. The previous values of the list `a` are unknown, but after sorting, the list `a` is now in ascending order. Therefore, the Output State is: **`a` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order.**
Output State: **`a` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order.**
