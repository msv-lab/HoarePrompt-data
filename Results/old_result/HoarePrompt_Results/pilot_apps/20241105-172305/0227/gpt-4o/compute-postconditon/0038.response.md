Output State: **`assigned` has a new element `a[i+1]` added to it. If there exists an element `x` in `assigned` such that `a[i] - x` is also in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop is exited. Otherwise, `can_form` remains False, `x` iterates through the elements of `assigned`, and no changes are made to the variables. If `assigned` has only one element (besides `a[i+1]`), the loop does not execute and `can_form` remains False.**
