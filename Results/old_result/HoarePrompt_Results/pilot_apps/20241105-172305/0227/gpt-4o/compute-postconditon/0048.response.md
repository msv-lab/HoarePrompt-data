According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more elements in `assigned` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `assigned` has at least 1 element. So for the loop to execute one more time, there needs to be at least 2 elements in `assigned`. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`assigned` has at least 2 elements, `can_form` is False, `m` remains the same**
