Example Answer: 
The variable `can_form` is assigned the boolean value `False`. If `can_form` is `False`, then `m` will be incremented by 1. The `assigned` list now has a new element `a[i+2]` added to it. Since we do not have the initial values of `m` or `assigned`, the output state is `assigned` has a new element `a[i+2]` added to it, `m` is incremented by 1 if `can_form` is False.
Output State: **`assigned` has a new element `a[i+2]` added to it, `m` is incremented by 1 if `can_form` is False**
