Postcondition: ***`assigned` has a new element `a[i+1]` added to it. If `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`, `can_form` is set to True, and the loop or if statement is broken. In all other cases, the variables retain their initial values: `can_form` remains False, `x` continues to be the first element in the `assigned` list, and no changes are made to `assigned`.***
