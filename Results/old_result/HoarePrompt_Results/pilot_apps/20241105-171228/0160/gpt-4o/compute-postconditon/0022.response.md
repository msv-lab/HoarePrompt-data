Example Answer:
The value of `x` is divided by the incremented value of `i` and added to the set `divisors`. The previous values of `divisors`, `x`, and `i` are not provided, so the output state is: `divisors` contains updated divisors, `x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` has been incremented to the next value satisfying the loop condition.
Output State: **`divisors` contains updated divisors, `x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` has been incremented to the next value satisfying the loop condition**
