According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `divisors` is an empty set, `x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `divisors` contains `x` and the result of `x` divided by `i`. So for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be incremented and added to the divisors set if `x` is divisible by it. Additionally, the loop will need to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `x`. 
State: **`divisors` contains updated divisors, `x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` has been incremented to the next value satisfying the loop condition.**
