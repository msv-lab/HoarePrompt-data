Postcondition: ***`divisors` contains the updated divisors after the execution of the if statement. `i` is the next integer in the range (incremented by 1), and `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))`. If x is divisible by `i`, both `i` and `x // i` are added to `divisors`. This process continues for all valid values of `i` up to `int(math.sqrt(x))`.***
