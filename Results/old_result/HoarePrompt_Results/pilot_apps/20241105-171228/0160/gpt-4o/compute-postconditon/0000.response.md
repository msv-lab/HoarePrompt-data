Example Answer:
N and K are assigned values from the input split by space. The values of N and K are constrained such that 2 <= N <= 500 and 0 <= K <= 10^9. Therefore, the output state is N and K are integers such that 2 <= N <= 500, 0 <= K <= 10^9.
Output State: **N and K are integers such that 2 <= N <= 500, 0 <= K <= 10^9**
