Postcondition: ***`divisors` is a non-empty set of distinct divisors of `sum_A` up to its square root, the divisors are in sorted order in reverse. If all elements `a` in set `A` satisfy the condition `a % d == 0` or `(sum_A - a) % d <= K` for all divisors `d`, then the program prints `d` and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
