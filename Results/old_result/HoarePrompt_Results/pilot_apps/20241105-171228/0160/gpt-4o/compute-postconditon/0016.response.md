According to the code, the loop will execute if the range from 1 to the square root of x (inclusive) is not empty. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `x` must be a positive integer greater than or equal to 1. Before the loop starts, `divisors` is an empty set, so it needs to be adjusted to `x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1.
State: **`divisors` is an empty set, `x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1**
