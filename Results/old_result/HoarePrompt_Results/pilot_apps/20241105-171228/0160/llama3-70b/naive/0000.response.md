Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly calculates the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations. It calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements in A and then iterates through the factors of the gcd to find the maximum divisor. The logic used in the program is correct and covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement. There are no identified edge cases where the program fails to produce the correct output.
