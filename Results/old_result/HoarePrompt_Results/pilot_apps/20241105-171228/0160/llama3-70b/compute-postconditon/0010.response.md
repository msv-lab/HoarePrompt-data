Output State: **If N is greater than 1, the loop calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements in list A and updates the value of gcd accordingly. If N is 1 or less, the loop does not execute and gcd remains as the first element of list A. K is an integer satisfying the preconditions, A is a list of integers.**
