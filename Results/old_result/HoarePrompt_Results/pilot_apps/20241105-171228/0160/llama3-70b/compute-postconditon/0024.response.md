Example Answer:
The value of `max_divisor` is updated based on the comparison between the current `max_divisor` and `gcd // i` where `i` is 3. If `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and `gcd // i`. The value of `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `max_divisor` is updated based on the comparison between the current `max_divisor` and `gcd // 3`.
Output State: **`max_divisor` is updated based on the comparison between the current `max_divisor` and `gcd // 3`**
