Example Answer:
`s` and `d` are assigned values from the input after splitting the input. The values of `s` and `d` depend on the input provided by the user. The variables `n` and `t` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `s` and `d` are assigned values from user input.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `s` and `d` are assigned values from user input**
