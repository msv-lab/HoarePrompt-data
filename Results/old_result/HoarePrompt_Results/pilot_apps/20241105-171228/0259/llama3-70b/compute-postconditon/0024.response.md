Postcondition: ***`min_time` is the minimum value between positive infinity and the result of `(t - s) % d`, `ans` is either 1 or 2, `buses` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `s` is the first value of the second element in `buses`, `d` is the second value of the second element in `buses`. If `time` is less than `min_time`, then `min_time` is updated to the value of `time`, and `ans` is set to 2. All other variables remain unchanged.***
