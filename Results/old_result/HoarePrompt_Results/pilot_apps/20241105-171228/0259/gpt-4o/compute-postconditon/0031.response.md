Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is a positive number representing the minimum wait time. `chosen_route` is either -1 or an integer from 1 to the number of bus routes. `n`, `i` are positive integers. `s_i`, `d_i` hold the values of the route at index 2 in `bus_routes`. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, then `wait_time` is set to `s_i - t`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i` equals 0, then `wait_time` is set to 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. After the execution of the if else block, `min_wait_time` is updated to the minimum of the current `wait_time` and the previous `min_wait_time`. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, `min_wait_time` is set to `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is updated to `i + 1`. The program handles all edge cases, ensuring correct determination of `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` based on the provided conditions.***
