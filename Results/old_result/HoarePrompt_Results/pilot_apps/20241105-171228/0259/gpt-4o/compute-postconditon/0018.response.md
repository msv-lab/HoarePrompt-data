Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[1]`. If s_i >= t, then `wait_time` is calculated as s_i - t. If (t - s_i) % d_i == 0, `wait_time` is set to 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is computed as d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i. This postcondition encompasses all possible outcomes of the if-else block, ensuring the variables maintain their initial values and relationships, while handling edge cases related to `wait_time`.***
