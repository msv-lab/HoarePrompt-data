Example Answer: 
The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value 0. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is either -1 or 2, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `s_i` and `d_i` now hold the values of the route at index 2 in `bus_routes`, `wait_time` is 0.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is either -1 or 2, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `s_i` and `d_i` now hold the values of the route at index 2 in `bus_routes`, `wait_time` is 0**
