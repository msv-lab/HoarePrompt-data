Example Answer:
Variables `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values from `bus_routes[i]`, where `bus_routes` is a list of tuples. Since `i` is 1, `bus_routes[1]` will return the tuple at index 1. Therefore, `s_i` and `d_i` will be assigned the values from that tuple. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[1]`**
