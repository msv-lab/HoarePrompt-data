`n` is greater than 0, `t` is assigned the integer value of the second element in `data`, `bus_routes` contains tuples `(s_i, d_i)` for each iteration of the loop, where `s_i` is assigned the integer value of the element at index 2 + i * 2 in `data`, `d_i` is assigned the integer value of the element at index 2 + i * 2 + 1 in `data`. If `n` is 0 or less, the loop does not execute and `bus_routes` remains an empty list.
