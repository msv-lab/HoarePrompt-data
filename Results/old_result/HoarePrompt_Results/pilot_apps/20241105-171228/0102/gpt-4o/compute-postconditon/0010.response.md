Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 99; the list `ones` contains words representing numbers from zero to nine. If `s` is between 0 and 9, the function returns the word representation of the number `s` from `ones`. If `s` is between 11 and 19, the function returns the word representation of the number in the teens range from `teens[s - 10]`. If `s` is between 10 and 99, the function returns the word representation of the tens place followed by a hyphen and the word representation of the ones place. This is determined by `tens[s // 10] + '-' + ones[s % 10]` if `s` is not divisible by 10. If `s` is exactly 10, the function returns the word representation of 10 from `tens`. All possible edge cases and scenarios within the specified ranges are handled appropriately in the postcondition, ensuring a comprehensive coverage of the program's behavior.***
