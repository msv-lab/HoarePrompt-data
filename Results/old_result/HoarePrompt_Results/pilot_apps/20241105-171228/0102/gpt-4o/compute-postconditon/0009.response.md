Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 99; the list `ones` contains words representing numbers from zero to nine. If `s` is between 11 and 19, the function returns the word representation of the numbers in the teens range, determined by `teens[s - 10]`. If `s` is between 10 and 99, the function either returns the word representation of the tens place, determined by `tens[s // 10]`, if `s` is divisible by 10, or it returns the word representation of the tens place followed by a hyphen and the word representation of the ones place, calculated by `tens[s // 10] + '-' + ones[s % 10]`. All scenarios, including when `s` is exactly 10, are handled appropriately within the postcondition, covering all possible outcomes based on the input conditions.***
