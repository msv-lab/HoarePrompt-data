Functionality: The function `func` takes an integer `s` such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 99 and returns the word representation of the number based on the specific ranges defined by the lists `ones`, `teens`, and `tens`. If `s` is between 0 and 9, it returns the word representation from the `ones` list. For numbers between 11 and 19, it returns the word representation from the `teens` list. If `s` is between 10 and 99, it returns the word representation of the tens place followed by a hyphen and the word representation of the ones place. If `s` is divisible by 10, it returns the word representation of the tens place, otherwise, it combines the tens and ones representations. All possible edge cases and scenarios within the specified ranges are handled appropriately.
