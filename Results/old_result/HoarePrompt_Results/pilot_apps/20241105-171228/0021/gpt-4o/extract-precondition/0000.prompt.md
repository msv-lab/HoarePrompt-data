You are given a programming problem description and a program that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
R = 3
C = 3
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
  res = tuple(set(test_tup1) & set(test_tup2))
  return (res) 
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Program:
```
def count_ways(n):
  A = [0] * (n + 1)
  B = [0] * (n + 1)
  A[0] = 1
  A[1] = 0
  B[0] = 0
  B[1] = 1
  for i in range(2, n+1):
    A[i] = A[i - 2] + 2 * B[i - 1]
    B[i] = A[i - 1] + B[i - 2]
  return A[n] 
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: Nicholas has an array a that contains n distinct integers from 1 to n. In other words, Nicholas has a permutation of size n.

Nicholas want the minimum element (integer 1) and the maximum element (integer n) to be as far as possible from each other. He wants to perform exactly one swap in order to maximize the distance between the minimum and the maximum elements. The distance between two elements is considered to be equal to the absolute difference between their positions.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the size of the permutation.

The second line of the input contains n distinct integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ n), where a_{i} is equal to the element at the i-th position.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the maximum possible distance between the minimum and the maximum elements Nicholas can achieve by performing exactly one swap.


-----Examples-----
Input
5
4 5 1 3 2

Output
3

Input
7
1 6 5 3 4 7 2

Output
6

Input
6
6 5 4 3 2 1

Output
5



-----Note-----

In the first sample, one may obtain the optimal answer by swapping elements 1 and 2.

In the second sample, the minimum and the maximum elements will be located in the opposite ends of the array if we swap 7 and 2.

In the third sample, the distance between the minimum and the maximum elements is already maximum possible, so we just perform some unnecessary swap, for example, one can swap 5 and 2.
Program:
```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Find the initial positions of the minimum and maximum elements
min_pos = a.index(1)
max_pos = a.index(n)

# Calculate possible new distances after performing one swap
# Option 1: Swap the minimum element with the element at the start
dist1 = abs(0 - max_pos)
# Option 2: Swap the minimum element with the element at the end
dist2 = abs((n-1) - max_pos)
# Option 3: Swap the maximum element with the element at the start
dist3 = abs(0 - min_pos)
# Option 4: Swap the maximum element with the element at the end
dist4 = abs((n-1) - min_pos)

# The maximum possible distance after one swap
max_distance = max(dist1, dist2, dist3, dist4)
print(max_distance)

```
