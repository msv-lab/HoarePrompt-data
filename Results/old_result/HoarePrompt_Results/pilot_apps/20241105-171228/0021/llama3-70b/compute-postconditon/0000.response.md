Example Answer: 
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The precondition specifies that `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, so after this assignment, `n` will be within the valid range. The list `a` is not affected by this assignment.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100. The list `a` contains n distinct integers from 1 to n**.
