Example Answer:
The variable `max_dist` is calculated based on the absolute difference between `pos1` and `posn`, then subtracting 1. If the difference is less than or equal to 1, the result is 0. Otherwise, it is the difference between the two indices minus 1. The value of `max_dist` is then compared to `n - 2`, and the greater value is assigned to `max_dist`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `pos1` stores the index of 1 in the list `a`, `posn` stores the index of `n` in the list `a`, and `max_dist` is the maximum distance between 1 and n in the list `a`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `pos1` stores the index of 1 in the list `a`, `posn` stores the index of `n` in the list `a`, and `max_dist` is the maximum distance between 1 and n in the list `a`**
