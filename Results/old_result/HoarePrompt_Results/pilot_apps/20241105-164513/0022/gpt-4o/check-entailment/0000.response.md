Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle the case when the length of the string is odd. According to the problem description, if the length of `s` is odd, the program should always print 'NIE'. However, the code does not check for this condition and simply checks for symmetric characters for strings with even length. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not follow the problem description for all potential cases.
