Example Answer: 
The function returns `False`. The values of `n`, `s`, and `i` are not affected by the return statement. Therefore, the output state is `n` is the length of string `s`, `n // 2` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and the function returns False.
Output State: **`n` is the length of string `s`, `n // 2` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and the function returns False**
