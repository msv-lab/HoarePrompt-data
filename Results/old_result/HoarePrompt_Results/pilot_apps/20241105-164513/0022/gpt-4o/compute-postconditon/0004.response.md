According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is the length of string `s`, `n // 2` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0. This means that the loop executed at least once. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is the length of string `s`, `n // 2` is greater than 0, `i` is 1**
