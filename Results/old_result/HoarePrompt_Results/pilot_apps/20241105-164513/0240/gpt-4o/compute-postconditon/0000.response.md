Example Answer:
`n_len` is assigned the value of the difference between the length of strings `s` and `sub`. The values of `s` and `sub` are not given, so the exact value of `n_len` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: Precondition: `s` and `sub` are strings.
Output State: **Precondition: `s` and `sub` are strings**
