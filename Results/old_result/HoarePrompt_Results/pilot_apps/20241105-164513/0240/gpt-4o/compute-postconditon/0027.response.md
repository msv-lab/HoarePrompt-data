The frequency of the character `char` in `s_counter` is reduced by the frequency of the same character in `sub_counter`. The values of `char`, `s_counter`, and `sub_counter` are affected by this operation. 
Output State: **Updated s_counter after subtracting the frequency of char from sub_counter**
