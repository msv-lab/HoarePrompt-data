Functionality: **The function takes two string parameters, `chars` and `sub`, generates permutations of `chars`, joins them into `candidate`, and then checks if `sub` is present in `candidate` by calling `func2(candidate, sub)`. If the condition is met, it yields `candidate`. If the length of `chars` is 0 or the lengths of `chars` and `sub` are not equal, the loop does not execute and nothing is yielded.**
