Example Answer:
The code yields the value of `candidate` without changing its state. Therefore, the output state is: Next permutation of `chars` is generated, `func2(candidate, sub)` evaluates to true for the new `candidate`.
Output State: **Next permutation of `chars` is generated, `func2(candidate, sub)` evaluates to true for the new `candidate`**
