According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `num_str`, `sub`, `chars`, and the evaluation of `func2(candidate, sub)`. If the evaluation is true, then the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the previous iteration, `num_str`, `sub`, `chars` are strings, and `candidate` is the result of joining `perm`. 

To execute the loop one more time, the `candidate` generated from the next permutation `perm` must satisfy the condition `func2(candidate, sub)`. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are the ones related to the next permutation `perm` and the resulting `candidate` for the next iteration.

State: **`num_str`, `sub`, `chars` are strings, `candidate` is the result of joining the next permutation of `chars`.**
