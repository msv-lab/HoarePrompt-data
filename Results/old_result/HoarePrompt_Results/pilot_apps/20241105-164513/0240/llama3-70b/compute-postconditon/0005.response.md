Example Answer:
The value of `n` is updated by adding the value of `c`. The previous value of `n` is an empty string, and the value of `c` is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a non-empty string of digits, `t` is a substring of `s`, `t_set` is a set containing unique elements of `t`, and `n` is updated by adding an unknown value `c`.
Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of digits, `t` is a substring of `s`, `t_set` is a set containing unique elements of `t`, and `n` is updated by adding an unknown value `c`**
