According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `s` and the characters it contains. If there are more characters left in the string `s`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string of digits, `t` is a substring of `s`, `t_set` is a set containing unique elements of `t`, `n` is a string that contains `c` if `c` is an element of `t_set`, `c` is the next character in `s`. 

To execute the loop one more time, the next character `c` in the string `s` should be added to `n` if it is an element of `t_set`. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `c` is the next character in `s` and `n` is updated by adding `c`.
State: **`s` is a non-empty string of digits, `t` is a substring of `s`, `t_set` is a set containing unique elements of `t`, `n` is a string that contains `c` if `c` is an element of `t_set`, `c` is the next character in `s` and `n` is updated by adding `c`**
