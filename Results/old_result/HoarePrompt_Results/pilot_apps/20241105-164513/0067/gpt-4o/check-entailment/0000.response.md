Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The output hints correctly describe the logic of the code, but there is an edge case that the code does not handle properly.

For example, if `x = 0`, `y = 0`, and `z = 1`, according to the problem description, the result should be uncertain ("?") as there are two possible outcomes (either "+" or "-"). However, the code will incorrectly print "+" in this case.

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
