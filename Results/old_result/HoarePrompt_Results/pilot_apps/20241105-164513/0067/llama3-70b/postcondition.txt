*`x, y, z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. If x > y + z, the program prints '+'. If x < y, the program prints '-'. If x equals y and z is 0, the program prints '0'. If x equals y and z is not 0, the program prints '?'. If none of the above conditions hold, the program prints '?'.
