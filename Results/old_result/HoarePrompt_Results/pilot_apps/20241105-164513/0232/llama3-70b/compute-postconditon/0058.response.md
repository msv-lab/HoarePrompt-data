Postcondition: ***After the if-else block executes, the output state is as follows: `n` is greater than or equal to `i`, `i` is incremented by 1. The `window_counts` dictionary has a key `color` with a value that is either incremented by 1 if `color` was already present or added to `window_counts` with a value of 1 if `color` is new. Additionally, `found` is True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if all count values in `window_counts` match the corresponding target values from the `counts` list.***
