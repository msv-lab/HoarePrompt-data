Example Answer:
`result` is assigned the value of `n - remainder`, where `n` is a non-negative integer and `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by 10. Since `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by 10, it will be a number between 0 and 9. Therefore, `result` will be the subtraction of a non-negative integer value and a value between 0 and 9. 
Output State: **`n` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `remainder` is the remainder of n divided by 10; `result` is the result of n - remainder**
