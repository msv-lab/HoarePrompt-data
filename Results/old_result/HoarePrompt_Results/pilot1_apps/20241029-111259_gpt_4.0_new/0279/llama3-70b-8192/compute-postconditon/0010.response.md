`max_length` is increased by `max_speed`. The previous value of `max_length` was `max_speed` multiplied by `t`, so the new value of `max_length` is `max_speed` multiplied by `t` plus `max_speed`, which is `max_speed` multiplied by (`t` + 1). Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` and `d` are input integers; `v1` and `v2` are input integers such that 1 ≤ v1, v2 ≤ 100; `max_speed` is now the maximum of `max_speed - d` and `min_speed`; `min_speed` is updated to the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`; `max_length` is `max_speed` multiplied by (`t` + 1); `min_length` is `min_speed` multiplied by `t`; `iter_i` is an iterator over the range from `t - 1` to `1`; `i` is the next value in `iter_i`.
