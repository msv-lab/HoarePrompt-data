The values of `v1` and `v2` are assigned from the input, and they are converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The initial constraints specify that `v1` and `v2` are integers such that 1 ≤ v1, v2 ≤ 100. These constraints still hold after the input, but the specific values of `v1` and `v2` now depend on the input. The values of `t` and `d` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100; `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10; `v1` and `v2` are input integers such that 1 ≤ v1, v2 ≤ 100.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100; `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10; `v1` and `v2` are input integers such that 1 ≤ v1, v2 ≤ 100.**
