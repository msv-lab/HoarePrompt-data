The statement `iter_i = iter(range(t - 1, 0, -1))` creates an iterator `iter_i` that iterates over a range starting from `t - 1` down to `1`, decrementing by `1` at each step. The existing variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` and `d` are input integers; `v1` and `v2` are input integers such that 1 ≤ v1, v2 ≤ 100; `max_speed` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2`; `min_speed` is the minimum of `v1` and `v2`; `max_length` is `max_speed` multiplied by `t`; `min_length` is `min_speed` multiplied by `t`; `iter_i` is an iterator over the range from `t - 1` to `1`.
