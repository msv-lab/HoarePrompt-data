Since this is a `while True` loop, it will continue to execute indefinitely unless an external condition or a break statement is met within the loop body. Therefore, there is no need to modify the program state to ensure the loop executes again. The loop can proceed with the same program state as at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **If `next(iter_i)` raises a `StopIteration`, the loop or surrounding block is exited. Otherwise, `i` is the next value in `iter_i`, `max_speed` is updated to the maximum of `max_speed - d` and `min_speed`, `min_speed` is updated to the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`, `max_length` is incremented by `max_speed`, and `min_length` is incremented by `min_speed`.**
