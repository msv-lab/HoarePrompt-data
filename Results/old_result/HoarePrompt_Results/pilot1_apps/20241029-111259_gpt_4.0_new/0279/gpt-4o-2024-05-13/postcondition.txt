If `t <= 1`, the `speeds` list remains unchanged with `speeds[0]` as `v1` and `speeds[-1]` as `v2`. If `t > 1`, `speeds` is a list where `speeds[0]` is `v1`, `speeds[-1]` is `v2`, and for each `i` from 1 to `t-2`, `speeds[i]` is computed as `min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)`. The loop control variable `i` will be `t` after the loop completes. `total_distance` is the sum of all elements in the `speeds` list and is printed.
