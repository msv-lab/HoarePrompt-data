`speeds[i]` is assigned the value `min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)`. Since `i` is 2, `speeds[i - 1]` refers to `speeds[1]`, which is `min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 2) * d)`. Thus, `speeds[i]` is `min(min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 2) * d) + d, v2 + (t - 3) * d)`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `v1` and `v2` are input integers, `t` and `d` are input integers, `speeds` is a list where `speeds[0]` is `v1`, `speeds[-1]` is `v2`, `speeds[1]` is `min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 2) * d)`, `speeds[2]` is `min(min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 2) * d) + d, v2 + (t - 3) * d)`, `i` is 2, `t` is greater than 2.
