You have been assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for simulating the execution of Python code. You will be provided with a function description and a Python function code snippet. You need to provide if the code does what the function description says. Please avoid describing how the program runs. If the code satisfies the description reply CORRECT, otherwise reply INCORRECT with an explanation. You must adhere to the text format: RESULT: **Correct or Incorrect**.

Description: The Fair Nut likes kvass very much. On his birthday parents presented him $n$ kegs of kvass. There are $v_i$ liters of kvass in the $i$-th keg. Each keg has a lever. You can pour your glass by exactly $1$ liter pulling this lever. The Fair Nut likes this drink very much, so he wants to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass. But he wants to do it, so kvass level in the least keg is as much as possible.

Help him find out how much kvass can be in the least keg or define it's not possible to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $s$ ($1 \le n \le 10^3$, $1 \le s \le 10^{12}$) — the number of kegs and glass volume.

The second line contains $n$ integers $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n$ ($1 \le v_i \le 10^9$) — the volume of $i$-th keg.


-----Output-----

If the Fair Nut cannot pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass, print $-1$. Otherwise, print a single integer — how much kvass in the least keg can be.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3
4 3 5

Output
3

Input
3 4
5 3 4

Output
2

Input
3 7
1 2 3

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example, the answer is $3$, the Fair Nut can take $1$ liter from the first keg and $2$ liters from the third keg. There are $3$ liters of kvass in each keg.

In the second example, the answer is $2$, the Fair Nut can take $3$ liters from the first keg and $1$ liter from the second keg.

In the third example, the Fair Nut can't pour his cup by $7$ liters, so the answer is $-1$.
Python Fucntion:
```
# Read input values
n, s = map(int, input().split())
volumes = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Sort the volumes
volumes.sort()

# Calculate the total volume of all kegs
total_volume = sum(volumes)

# Check if we have enough kvass to pour s liters
if total_volume < s:
    print(-1)
else:
    # Calculate the maximum possible volume in the least filled keg
    min_keg_volume = volumes[0]
    remaining_kvass = s

    # Distribute remaining kvass to make each keg as even as possible
    for i in range(n):
        if volumes[i] <= min_keg_volume:
            continue
        else:
            possible_to_take = min(volumes[i] - min_keg_volume, remaining_kvass)
            remaining_kvass -= possible_to_take
        
        if remaining_kvass == 0:
            break
    
    # Calculate the final volume in the least filled keg
    if remaining_kvass > 0:
        min_keg_volume -= (remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n
    
    print(min_keg_volume)

```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Use the format: RESULT: **Correct or Incorrect**.
