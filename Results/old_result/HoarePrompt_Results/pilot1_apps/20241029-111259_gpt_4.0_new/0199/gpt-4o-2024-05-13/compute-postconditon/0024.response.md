The `continue` statement does not change the state of the variables but skips the current iteration of the loop it is inside. The initial state indicates that `i` is increased by 1 and is less than 0, and `a` and `b` are integers with conditions for updating their values. Since no loop information is provided and the `continue` statement does not alter variables, the output state remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: variable `i` is increased by 1 and `i` is less than 0; `a` and `b` are integers with `a` updated to `a - b` if `a` > `b`, otherwise `b` is updated to `b - a`.

Output State: **variable `i` is increased by 1 and `i` is less than 0; `a` and `b` are integers with `a` updated to `a - b` if `a` > `b`, otherwise `b` is updated to `b - a`**
