Postcondition: **variable `i` was initially less than -1 and is increased by 1. If `volumes[i]` is less than or equal to `min_keg_volume`, the execution moves to the next iteration of the most internal loop without further changes. Otherwise, `possible_to_take` is set to the minimum of `volumes[i] - min_keg_volume` and `remaining_kvass`, and `remaining_kvass` is decreased by `possible_to_take`. If `remaining_kvass` is zero, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Now, here's your task:

Precondition: `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer
Program fragment:
```
if a > b:
    a = a - b
else:
    b = b - a

```
Postcondition for if body: `a` is updated to the value of `a - b`
Postcondition for else body: `b` is updated to the value of `b - a`
Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are integers. If `a` is greater than `b`, then `a` is updated to the value of `a - b`. Otherwise, `b` is updated to the value of `b - a`.**
