`r` is printed, where `r` is an integer obtained from input. The print statement does not change the values of the variables, so the output state is `n`, `m`, and `r` are integers obtained from input; `s` is a list of integers obtained from new input; `b` is a list of integers obtained from input using `map(int, input().split())`; `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in the list `s`; `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in the list `b`, and `r` is printed.
