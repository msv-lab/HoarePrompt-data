The statement `s = list(map(int, input().split()))` assigns a new value to the list `s`, which is obtained by converting the input string of space-separated numbers into a list of integers. However, since the initial state already defines `s` as a list of `n` integers, this operation will redefine `s`. The other variables `n`, `m`, and `r` remain unaffected, and `b` is unchanged. The output state will therefore be that `n`, `m`, and `r` are integers obtained from input, `s` is a list of integers obtained from new input, and `b` is a list of `m` integers where each `b_i` satisfies 1 <= `b_i` <= 1000.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are integers obtained from input; `s` is a list of integers obtained from new input; `b` is a list of `m` integers where each `b_i` satisfies 1 <= `b_i` <= 1000**.
