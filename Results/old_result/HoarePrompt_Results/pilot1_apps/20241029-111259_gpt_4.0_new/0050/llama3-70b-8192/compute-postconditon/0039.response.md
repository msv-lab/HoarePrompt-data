`r` is updated by adding the product of `shares` and `b[i]` to its current value. Since `i` is less than 0, `b[i]` accesses an element of `b` from the end. The values of `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `shares`, and `r` remain unchanged except for `r`, which is increased by `shares * b[i]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `b`, `shares` remain unchanged; `r` is increased by `shares * b[i]`. 

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `b`, `shares` remain unchanged; `r` is increased by `shares * b[i]`.**
