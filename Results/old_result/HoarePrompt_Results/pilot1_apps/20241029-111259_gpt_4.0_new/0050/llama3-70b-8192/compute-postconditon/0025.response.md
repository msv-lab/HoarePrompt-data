To determine the output state of the loop, let's analyze the given loop and the conditions under which it executes.

The loop condition is `while i < 0`. This means the loop is only executed if the initial value of `i` is less than 0. However, the initial state specifies that `i` is an integer from input where 1 ≤ i ≤ 30. This implies that the loop will never actually execute because the condition `i < 0` is never satisfied given the constraints on `i`.

Therefore, the loop does not execute, and the initial state of the variables remains unchanged. Let's summarize the output state:

Output State: **The loop does not execute because the condition `i < 0` is never satisfied given the initial constraint of `1 ≤ i ≤ 30`. Therefore, `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `shares`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial values.**
