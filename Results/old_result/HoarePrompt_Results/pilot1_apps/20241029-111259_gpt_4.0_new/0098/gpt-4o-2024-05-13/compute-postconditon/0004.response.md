Postcondition: **`a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, and `b3` are integers with values between 1 and 1000. `possible_orientations` is a list of tuples containing four integer elements each: [(a2, b2, a3, b3), (a2, b2, b3, a3), (b2, a2, a3, b3), (b2, a2, b3, a3)]. `iterator` is an iterator over `possible_orientations`. `w2` is `a2`, `h2` is `b2`, `w3` is `a3`, `h3` is `b3`. If the sum of `w2` and `w3` is less than or equal to `a1` and the maximum of `h2` and `h3` is less than or equal to `b1`, or if the maximum of `w2` and `w3` is less than or equal to `a1` and the sum of `h2` and `h3` is less than or equal to `b1`, then the function returns 'YES'.**
