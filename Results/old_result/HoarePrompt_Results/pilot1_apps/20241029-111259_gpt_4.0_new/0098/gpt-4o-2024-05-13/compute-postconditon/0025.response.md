Output State: **The function accepts six integer parameters representing dimensions and returns 'YES' if two smaller rectangles can fit within a larger rectangle in any orientation, otherwise returns 'NO'. It assumes all dimensions are positive integers within the range of 1 to 1000 and does not handle zero or negative dimensions. The input is read using `sys.stdin.read`, and `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input.**
