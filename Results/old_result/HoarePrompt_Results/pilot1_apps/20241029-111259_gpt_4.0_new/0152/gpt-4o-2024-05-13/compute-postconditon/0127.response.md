`m` is assigned the integer value of the second element in the `data` list, which is `int(data[1])`. The initial state of `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is assigned the integer value of the first element in the `data` list, which is `int(data[0])`; `m` is assigned the integer value of the second element in the `data` list, which is `int(data[1])`.

Output State: **`n` is assigned the integer value of the first element in the `data` list, which is `int(data[0])`; `m` is assigned the integer value of the second element in the `data` list, which is `int(data[1])`**
