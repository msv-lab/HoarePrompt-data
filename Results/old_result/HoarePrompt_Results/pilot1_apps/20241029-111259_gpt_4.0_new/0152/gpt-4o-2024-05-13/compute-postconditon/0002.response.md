Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `s` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^9, 1 ≤ `m`, `k` ≤ 2·10^5, 2 ≤ `x` ≤ 2·10^9, and 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 2·10^9; `a` and `b` are lists of `m` integers where 1 ≤ `a[i]` < `x` and 1 ≤ `b[i]` ≤ 2·10^9; `c` and `d` are lists of `k` integers where 1 ≤ `c[i]` ≤ `n` and 1 ≤ `d[i]` ≤ 2·10^9; the lists `c` and `d` are non-decreasing; `min_time` is an integer calculated as `n * x`; `i` is assigned the value of `k`; `remaining_potions` is assigned the value `max(0, n - c[i])`.**
