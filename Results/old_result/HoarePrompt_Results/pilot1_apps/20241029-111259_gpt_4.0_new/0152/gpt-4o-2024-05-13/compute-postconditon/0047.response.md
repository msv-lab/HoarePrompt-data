According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is less than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` was initially assigned the value of `k` and then incremented by 1. To ensure that the loop can execute again, we need to make sure that `j` is still less than 0 after being incremented. Therefore, `k` must be less than -1 so that after incrementing by 1, `j` is still less than 0. No other states need to be adjusted since they do not affect the loop condition.

State: **`remaining_manapoints` is assigned the value of `s - b[i]`, `k` is less than -1, `j` is initially assigned the value of `k` and then incremented by 1**
