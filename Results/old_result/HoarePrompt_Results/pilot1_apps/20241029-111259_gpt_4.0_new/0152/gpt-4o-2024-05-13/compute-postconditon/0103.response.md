`time_with_both_spells` is assigned the value of `remaining_potions * a[i]`. The initial states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is less than 0; `remaining_manapoints` is `s` minus `b[i]` where `i` is a negative index; `j` is `k + 1` and `k` is less than -1; `remaining_potions` is the maximum of 0 and `n - c[j]`; `time_with_both_spells` is `remaining_potions * a[i]`.
