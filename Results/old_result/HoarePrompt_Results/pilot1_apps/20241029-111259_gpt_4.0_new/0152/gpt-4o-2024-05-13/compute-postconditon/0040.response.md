`j` is assigned the value of `k`. The initial state provides no information about the value of `k`, so `j` is assigned an unknown value. The state of `remaining_manapoints` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `remaining_manapoints` is assigned the value of `s - b[i]`; `j` is assigned the value of `k`. 

Output State: **`remaining_manapoints` is assigned the value of `s - b[i]`; `j` is assigned the value of `k`**.
