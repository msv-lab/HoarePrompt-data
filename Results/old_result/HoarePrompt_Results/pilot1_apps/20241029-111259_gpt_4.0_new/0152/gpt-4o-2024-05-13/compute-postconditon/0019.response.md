According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is increased by 1. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` must currently be less than 0. If `i` was initially a negative value and then increased by 1, it must still be negative for the loop to continue. Therefore, `i` needs to be less than 0.

State: **`i` is less than 0**
