The `while` loop condition depends on two criteria: `j < k` and `s_left >= d[j]`. To ensure that the loop can execute again, both conditions must be satisfied.

1. **Condition `j < k`:**  
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is assigned the value 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `k` must be greater than 1.

2. **Condition `s_left >= d[j]`:**  
   - The state mentions that `s_left` is decreased by `d[0]`. For the next iteration, we need to ensure that `s_left` is greater than or equal to `d[1]` because `j` is currently 1.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can proceed to the next iteration, the following adjustments are necessary:

State: **`j` is assigned the value 1, `s_left` is decreased by `d[0]`, `k` is greater than 1, `s_left` is greater than or equal to `d[1]`**
