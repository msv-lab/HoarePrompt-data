`d[j]` is accessed, where `j` is 0. Since `d` is a list and `j` is within bounds, `d[j]` is a valid access. `s_left` is decreased by the value of `d[j]`. The initial value of `s_left` is not given, so the output state is: `s_left` is decreased by `d[0]`, and other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s_left` is decreased by `d[0]`**
