`j` is incremented by 1, so its new value is 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s_left` is assigned the value of `s - b[i] - d[j] - d[j] - d[j]`; `j` is 3; `k` is greater than 2; `s_left` is greater than or equal to `d[1]` minus `2 * d[j]`.

Output State: **`s_left` is assigned the value of `s - b[i] - d[j] - d[j] - d[j]`; `j` is 3; `k` is greater than 2; `s_left` is greater than or equal to `d[1]` minus `2 * d[j]`**.
