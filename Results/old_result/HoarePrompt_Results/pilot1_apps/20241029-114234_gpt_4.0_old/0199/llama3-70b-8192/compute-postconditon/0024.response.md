Output State: **`n` and `s` are input integers, `v` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `v_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `v_i` ≤ 10^9. After the loop terminates, `low` is equal to `high` or `low` is greater than `high`, and `high` is the maximum value such that the sum of the minimum of `high` and each element in `v` is less than `s`. If `n` is 0 or `s` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `low` remains 0 with `high` being the initial minimum value in `v` or undefined if `n` is 0. `low` is printed.**
