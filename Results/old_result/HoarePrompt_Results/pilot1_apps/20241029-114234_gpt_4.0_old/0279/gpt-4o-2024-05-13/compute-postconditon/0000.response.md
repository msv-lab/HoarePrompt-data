`v1` and `v2` are assigned the values obtained from `input().split()`, which splits the input string into two parts and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are input integers, `t` and `d` are integers such that 2 ≤ `t` ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ `d` ≤ 10**
