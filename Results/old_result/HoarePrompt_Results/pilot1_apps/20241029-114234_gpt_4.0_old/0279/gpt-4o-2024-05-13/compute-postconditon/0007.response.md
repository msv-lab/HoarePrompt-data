i is incremented by 1, and the initial value of i is 1, so after execution, i is 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are input integers, `t` and `d` are new input integers, `speeds` is a list where the first element is `v1`, the second element is `min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 2) * d)`, the last element is `v2`, and the rest are zeros with length `t`, `i` is 2**
