Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are input integers, `t` and `d` are new input integers, `speeds` is a list where the first element is `v1`, the `i`th element is `min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)` for each `i` from 1 to `t-1`, and the last element is `v2`, `i` is `t`. If `t` â‰¤ 1, `speeds` remains unchanged, and `i` is 1, `total_distance` is the sum of elements in `speeds`**.
