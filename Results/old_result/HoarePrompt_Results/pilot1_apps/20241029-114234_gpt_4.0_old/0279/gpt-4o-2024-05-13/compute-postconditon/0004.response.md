`speeds[-1]` is assigned the value of `v2`, replacing the last element of the list `speeds` with `v2`. The initial state specifies that `speeds` is a list where the first element is `v1` and the rest are zeros with length `t`. Therefore, after the code executes, `speeds[-1]` will be `v2`.

Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are input integers, `t` and `d` are new input integers, `speeds` is a list where the first element is `v1`, the last element is `v2`, and the rest are zeros with length `t`**
