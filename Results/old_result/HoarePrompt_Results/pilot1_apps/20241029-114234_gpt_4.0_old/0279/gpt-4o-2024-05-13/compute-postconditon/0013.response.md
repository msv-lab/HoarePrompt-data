`i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value of 3, making its new value 4. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are input integers, `t` and `d` are new input integers, `speeds` is a list where the first element is `v1`, the second element is `min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 2) * d)`, the third element is `min(min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 2) * d) + d, v2 + (t - 3) * d)`, the `i`th element is `min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)`, the last element is `v2`, and the rest are zeros with length `t`, `i` is 4, `t` is greater than 2**
