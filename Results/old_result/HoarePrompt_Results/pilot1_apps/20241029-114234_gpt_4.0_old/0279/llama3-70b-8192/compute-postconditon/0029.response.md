The `StopIteration` exception could be raised at the statement `i = next(iter_i)`. If the iterator `iter_i` is exhausted, meaning there are no more elements to iterate over, a `StopIteration` exception will be triggered, and the `except` block will execute, breaking out of the loop or the if statement containing the `try` block.

Therefore, the program's state after the `try` statement is executed can be summarized as follows:

1. If the iterator `iter_i` is not exhausted:
    - `i` is assigned the next value from `iter_i`.
    - `max_speed` is updated to `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`.
    - `min_speed` is updated to `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`.
    - `max_length` is incremented by `max_speed`.
    - `min_length` is incremented by `min_speed`.

2. If the iterator `iter_i` is exhausted:
    - A `StopIteration` exception is raised.
    - The `except` block executes, causing the program to break out of the loop or if statement containing the `try` block.

Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are input integers such that 1 ≤ v1, v2 ≤ 100; `t` and `d` are input integers within their respective ranges; if the iterator `iter_i` is not exhausted, `i` is the next value from `iter_i`, `max_speed` is updated to `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`, `min_speed` is updated to `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`, `max_length` is incremented by `max_speed`, and `min_length` is incremented by `min_speed`. If the iterator `iter_i` is exhausted, the program breaks out of the loop or if statement containing the `try` block.**
