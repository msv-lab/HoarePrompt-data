`t` and `d` are assigned values from the input split and converted to integers. Since `t` and `d` are already given as integers within specified ranges, the output state is: `v1` and `v2` are input integers such that 1 ≤ v1, v2 ≤ 100; `t` and `d` are input integers within their respective ranges.

Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are input integers such that 1 ≤ v1, v2 ≤ 100; `t` and `d` are input integers within their respective ranges**
