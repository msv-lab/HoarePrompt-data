`v1` and `v2` are assigned the values from the input, which are split and converted to integers. The variables `t` and `d` are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `v1` and `v2` are input integers such that 1 ≤ v1, v2 ≤ 100; `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100; `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10.

Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are input integers such that 1 ≤ v1, v2 ≤ 100; `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100; `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10**
