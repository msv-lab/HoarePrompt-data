`min_speed` is assigned the value of `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are input integers such that 1 ≤ v1, v2 ≤ 100; `t` and `d` are input integers within their respective ranges; `i` is the next value from `iter_i` if the iterator `iter_i` is not exhausted, otherwise the loop or if statement containing the `try` block is exited; `max_speed` is the maximum of `max_speed - d` and `min_speed`; `min_speed` is assigned min(min_speed + d, max_speed)**
