Precondition: `n` is an input integer between 1 and 30, `m` is an input integer between 1 and 30, `r` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a sorted list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `shares` is 0, `i` is the value of `n`

Program fragment:
```
if r >= s[i]:
    shares += r // s[i]
    r %= s[i]
else:
    break

```

Postcondition for if body: `n` is an input integer between 1 and 30, `m` is an input integer between 1 and 30, `r` is `r % s[i]`, `s` is a sorted list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `shares` is `r // s[i]`, `i` is the value of `n`

Postcondition for else body: `n` is an input integer between 1 and 30, `m` is an input integer between 1 and 30, `r` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a sorted list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `shares` is 0, `i` is the value of `n` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 30, `m` is an input integer between 1 and 30, `r` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a sorted list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `shares` is 0, and `i` is the value of `n`. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, `shares` is increased by the integer division of `r` by `s[i]` and `r` is updated to the remainder of `r` divided by `s[i]`. Otherwise, the loop or if statement is broken.**
