`i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is less than 0, so after the increment, `i` will still be less than or equal to 0. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 30, `m` is an input integer between 1 and 30, `r` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a sorted list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `shares` is 0, `i` is less than or equal to 0**
