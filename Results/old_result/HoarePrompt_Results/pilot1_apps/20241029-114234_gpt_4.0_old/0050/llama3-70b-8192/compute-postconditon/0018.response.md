According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The condition for the loop to execute is `i < 0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is increased by 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` after the last increment must still be less than 0. Since `i` was increased by 1 in the previous iteration, we need to adjust `i` to be less than -1 before the increment so that it remains less than 0 after the increment.

So, the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration should be less than -1 to ensure that the next iteration can proceed.

State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers with conditions on `c` based on `a` and `b`; variable `i` is less than -1**
