Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 30, `m` is an input integer between 1 and 30, `r` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a sorted list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `shares` is 0, `i` is less than 0. If `shares` is greater than 0, `r` is increased by `shares * b[i]` and `shares` is set to 0. Otherwise, the loop or the most internal block of code is exited.**
