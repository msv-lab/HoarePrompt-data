Postcondition: **It is impossible for the loop to execute again given the current constraints. If `r >= s[i]`, `shares` is incremented by `r // s[i]` and `r` is assigned the remainder of `r` divided by `s[i]`. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Now, here is your task:

Precondition: `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers.
Program fragment:
```
if a > b:
    c = a - b
elif a < b:
    c = b - a
else:
    c = 0

```
Postcondition for if body: `c` is set to the difference `a - b`
Postcondition for else body: If `a` is less than `b`, `c` is set to the difference `b - a`. Otherwise, `c` is set to 0.
Postcondition: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers. If `a > b`, `c` is set to `a - b`. If `a < b`, `c` is set to `b - a`. If `a` equals `b`, `c` is set to 0.**
