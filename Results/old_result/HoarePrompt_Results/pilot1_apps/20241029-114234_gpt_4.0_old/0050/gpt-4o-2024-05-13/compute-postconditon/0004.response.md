`max_sell_price` is assigned the maximum value in the list `b`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are input integers; `s` is a new list of input integers; `b` is a list of input integers converted from a space-separated string; `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in the list `s`; `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in the list `b`.
