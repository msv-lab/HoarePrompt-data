According to the provided state and the `while` loop condition, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than 0. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is increased by 1. To ensure that the next iteration can proceed, `i` must still be less than 0 after being incremented by 1. 

Thus, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to modify the state such that `i + 1` remains less than 0, which means `i` must be less than -1 before the increment. 

Let's adjust the state accordingly:

State: **variable `i` is less than -1, `j` is decreased by 1, if `j` is not -1, `cnt` is set to `c[j-1]`, `ans` is set to `min(ans, (n - cnt + t - 1) // t * t)**
