It appears that there's some confusion in the precondition and postcondition provided in your last example. Let's clarify and correct it.

Let's break down the given task first:

**Precondition:** `k` is an integer and `arr` is a list of integers. If `k` is less than the length of `arr`, then `arr[k]` is set to 100. If `k` is equal to the length of `arr`, then 100 is appended to the list. If `k` is greater than the length of `arr`, then `arr` is extended by `k - len(arr) + 1` zeros, and `arr[k]` is set to 100.

**Program fragment:**
```python
if b[i] > s:
    continue
```

**Postcondition for if body:** The loop continues to the next iteration if `b[i]` is greater than `s`.

**Postcondition for else body:** There is no else part in the code.

**Postcondition:** `k` is an integer and `arr` is a list of integers. If `k` is less than the length of `arr`, then `arr[k]` is set to 100. If `k` is equal to the length of `arr`, then 100 is appended to the list. If `k` is greater than the length of `arr`, then `arr` is extended by `k - len(arr) + 1` zeros, and `arr[k]` is set to 100. Additionally, if `b[i]` is greater than `s`, the loop continues to the next iteration.

Now, let's look at a new task with a similar structure.

**Precondition:** `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer.

**Program fragment:**
```python
if a > b:
    a = a + 1
else:
    b = b + 1
```

**Postcondition for if body:** Integer `a` is incremented by 1.

**Postcondition for else body:** Integer `b` is incremented by 1.

**Postcondition:** **`a` and `b` are integers. If `a` is greater than `b`, `a` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `b` is incremented by 1.**
