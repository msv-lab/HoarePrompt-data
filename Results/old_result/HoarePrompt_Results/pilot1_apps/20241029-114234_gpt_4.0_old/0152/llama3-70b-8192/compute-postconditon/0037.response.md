The values of `s`, `b`, and `i` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is that `s_left` is assigned the value `s - b[i]`.

Output State: **`m` and `n` are integers. If `n` is divisible by 3, `m` is multiplied by 2. If `n % 3 == 1`, `m` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `m` is decremented by 1. `s_left` is `s - b[i]`**
