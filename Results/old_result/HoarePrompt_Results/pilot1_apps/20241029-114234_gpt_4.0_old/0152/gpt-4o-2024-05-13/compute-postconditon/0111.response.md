`min_time` is assigned the value `min(min_time, time_with_both_spells)`. This will be the smaller value between the current `min_time` and `time_with_both_spells`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `j` is less than 0 before increment and increased by 1, `remaining_potions` is `max(0, n - c[j])`, `time_with_both_spells` is `remaining_potions * a[i]`, `min_time` is the smaller value between the previous `min_time` and `time_with_both_spells`**
