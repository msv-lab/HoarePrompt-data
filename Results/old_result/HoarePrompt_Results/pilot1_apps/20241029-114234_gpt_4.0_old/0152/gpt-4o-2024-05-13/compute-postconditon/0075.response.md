`remaining_potions` is assigned the value of `max(0, n - c[j])`. The values of `n` and `j` are known, but the array `c` and the index `j` are not defined in the initial state, so we represent `c[j]` as it is. 

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a number, `m` is an integer, `p` is an integer, `j` is less than -1, `remaining_potions` is assigned the value `max(0, n - c[j])`.

Output State: **`n` is a number, `m` is an integer, `p` is an integer, `j` is less than -1, `remaining_potions` is assigned the value `max(0, n - c[j])`**
