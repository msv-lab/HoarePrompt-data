To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop, which is `j < 0`.

The task provides the state at the end of the previous iteration, where `j` is incremented by 1. For the loop to execute again, the condition `j < 0` must still hold true after this incrementation.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `j` is incremented by 1.

To ensure the loop executes again:
- `j` must still be less than 0 after being incremented by 1.

Therefore, before the incrementation, `j` must have been less than -1, because incrementing a value less than -1 by 1 will result in a value still less than 0.

State: **`j` is less than -1**
