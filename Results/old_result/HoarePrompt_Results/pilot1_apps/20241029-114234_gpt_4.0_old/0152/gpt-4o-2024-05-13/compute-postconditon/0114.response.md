The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is less than 0. Therefore, the new value of `j` is less than or equal to 0. Other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`num` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `j` is less than or equal to 0 before increment and increased by 1, `remaining_manapoints`, `remaining_potions`, `time_with_both_spells`, `min_time` are unchanged**
