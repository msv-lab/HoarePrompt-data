Example Answer: 
The variable `i` is assigned the value 1. The previous values of `v1`, `v2`, and `speeds` list remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `v1` is assigned to `t`, `v2` is assigned to `d`, `speeds` list has the value of `t` at index 0, `speeds` list now has the value of `d` at the last index, `i` is 1.
Output State: **`v1` is assigned to `t`, `v2` is assigned to `d`, `speeds` list has the value of `t` at index 0, `speeds` list now has the value of `d` at the last index, `i` is 1**
