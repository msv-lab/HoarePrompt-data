According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is assigned the value of `m` + 1. To make the loop execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`i` is less than 0, `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b` remain the same**
