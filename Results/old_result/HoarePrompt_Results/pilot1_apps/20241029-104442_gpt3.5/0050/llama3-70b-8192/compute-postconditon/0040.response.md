Example Answer: 
The value of `shares` is assigned 0, which means `r` will remain as it was. Therefore, the output state is: `shares` is 0, `n`, `m`, `r` is updated based on the formula `r += shares * b[i]`, `s`, `b` remain the same.
Output State: **`shares` is 0, `n`, `m`, `r` is updated based on the formula `r += shares * b[i]`, `s`, `b` remain the same**
