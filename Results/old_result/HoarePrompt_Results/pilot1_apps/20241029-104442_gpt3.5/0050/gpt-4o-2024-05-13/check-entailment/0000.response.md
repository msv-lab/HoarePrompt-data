Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly follows the problem description by finding the minimum buy price and the maximum sell price. It then calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought with the current bourles and the remaining bourles after buying shares. Finally, it computes the total bourles after selling all shares at the maximum sell price. The logic of the program matches the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
