Example Answer:
The variable `b` is assigned the list of integers created by mapping the `int` function to each element of the input split by spaces. The initial state does not provide the exact values of `n`, `m`, `r`, or `s`, so the output state is: `n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers, `s` is a list of integers created from the input, `b` is a list of integers created from the input split.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers, `s` is a list of integers created from the input, `b` is a list of integers created from the input split**
