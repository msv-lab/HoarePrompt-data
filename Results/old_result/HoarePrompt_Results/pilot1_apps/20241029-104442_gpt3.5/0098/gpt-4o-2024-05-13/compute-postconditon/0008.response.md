Example Answer:
`w2, h2, w3, h3` are assigned the values of the next tuple in the `possible_orientations` list. The values of `w2`, `h2`, `w3`, and `h3` are determined by the next tuple in the list. The state of other variables is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `possible_orientations` is a list of four tuples with rearranged values of `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, `b3`; `iterator` is an iterator object over `possible_orientations`, `w2`, `h2`, `w3`, `h3` are assigned values based on the next tuple in `possible_orientations`.
Output State: **`possible_orientations` is a list of four tuples with rearranged values of `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, `b3`; `iterator` is an iterator object over `possible_orientations`, `w2`, `h2`, `w3`, `h3` are assigned values based on the next tuple in `possible_orientations`**
