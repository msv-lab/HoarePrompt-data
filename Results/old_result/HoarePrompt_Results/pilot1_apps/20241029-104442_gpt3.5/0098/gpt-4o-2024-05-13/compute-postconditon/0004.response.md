Postcondition: **`possible_orientations` is a list of four tuples with rearranged values of `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, `b3`; `iterator` is an iterator object over `possible_orientations`, `w2`, `h2`, `w3`, `h3` are assigned new values based on the next tuple in the iterator. If the sum of `w2` and `w3` is less than or equal to `a1` and the maximum of `h2` and `h3` is less than or equal to `b1`, or if the maximum of `w2` and `w3` is less than or equal to `a1` and the sum of `h2` and `h3` is less than or equal to `b1`, then the function returns 'YES'.**

Precondition: `n` is an integer
Program fragment:
```
if n % 2 == 0:
    n = n/2
else:
    n = 3*n + 1
```
Postcondition for if body: If `n` is divisible by 2, `n` is updated to half of its current value.
Postcondition for else body: If `n` is not divisible by 2, `n` is updated to 3 times `n` plus 1.
Postcondition: **`n` is an integer. If `n` is divisible by 2, it is updated to half of its current value. If `n` is not divisible by 2, it is updated to 3 times `n` plus 1.**

Precondition: `num` is a positive integer
Program fragment:
```
if num < 10:
    return "Single Digit"
elif num < 100:
    return "Two Digits"
else:
    return "More than Two Digits"
```
Postcondition for if body: If `num` is less than 10, the function returns "Single Digit".
Postcondition for else body: If `num` is between 10 and 99, the function returns "Two Digits". If `num` is 100 or greater, the function returns "More than Two Digits".
Postcondition: **`num` is a positive integer. If `num` is less than 10, the function returns "Single Digit". If `num` is between 10 and 99, the function returns "Two Digits". If `num` is 100 or greater, the function returns "More than Two Digits".**
