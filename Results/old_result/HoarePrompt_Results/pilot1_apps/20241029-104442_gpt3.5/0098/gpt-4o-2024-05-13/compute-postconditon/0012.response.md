The program could raise a `StopIteration` exception if there are no more elements to iterate over in the `iterator`. After the `try` statement is executed, if no exception occurs, the function checks the conditions and returns 'YES' if any of the conditions are met. If the `StopIteration` exception is raised, the program will break out of the loop. 

Output State: **`possible_orientations` is a list of four tuples with rearranged values of `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, `b3`; `iterator` is an iterator object over `possible_orientations`. If the conditions are met, the function returns 'YES', otherwise it breaks out of the loop if `StopIteration` is raised.**
