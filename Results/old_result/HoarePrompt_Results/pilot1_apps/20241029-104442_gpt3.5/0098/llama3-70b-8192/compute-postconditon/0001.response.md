Example Answer: 
`a2` and `b2` are assigned integer values based on user input using the `map` function and `split` method. The previous values of `a1` and `b1` are unknown, but after this code snippet runs, `a2` and `b2` will hold the new integer values input by the user.
Output State: **`a1` and `b1` are assigned integer values based on user input, `a2` and `b2` are assigned new integer values based on user input**
