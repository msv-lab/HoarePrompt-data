Postcondition: **`min_time` is the product of `n` and `x`, `i` is assigned the value of `k` + 1. If `d[i]` is less than or equal to `s`, `remaining_potions` is the maximum value between 0 and `n - c[i]`, `time_with_spell` is the product of `remaining_potions` and `x`, and `min_time` is the minimum value between the current `min_time` and `time_with_spell`.**
