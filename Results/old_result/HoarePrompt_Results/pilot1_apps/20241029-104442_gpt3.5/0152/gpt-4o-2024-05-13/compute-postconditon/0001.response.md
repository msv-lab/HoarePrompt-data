Example Answer:
`i` is assigned the value of `k`. The variable `min_time` is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_time` is the product of n and x, `i` is assigned the value of `k`.
Output State: **`min_time` is the product of n and x, `i` is assigned the value of `k`**
