Example Answer: 
`remaining_potions` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and the result of `n - c[i]`. The value of `n` and `c[i]` are not specified in the initial state, so we cannot calculate the exact value of `remaining_potions`. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_time` is the product of n and x, `i` is assigned the value of `k` + 1, `remaining_potions` depends on the values of `n` and `c[i]`.
Output State: **`min_time` is the product of n and x, `i` is assigned the value of `k` + 1, `remaining_potions` depends on the values of `n` and `c[i]`**
