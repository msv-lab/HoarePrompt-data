According to the code, the loop condition is `i < 0`, which seems to be incorrect as `i` is initially assigned the value of `k` + 1. Therefore, the loop will not execute as the initial value of `i` is not less than 0. No states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`min_time` is the product of n and x, `i` is assigned the value of `k` + 1**
