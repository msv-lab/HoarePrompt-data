Example Answer:
`time_with_both_spells` is assigned the value of `remaining_potions * a[i]`, where `remaining_potions` is updated based on the calculation. The other variables remain the same. 
Output State: **`min_time`, `i`, `time_with_spell`, `remaining_manapoints`, `remaining_potions` (updated based on the calculation), `time_with_both_spells`, `j + 1`, `n`, `c`, `a` are integers**
