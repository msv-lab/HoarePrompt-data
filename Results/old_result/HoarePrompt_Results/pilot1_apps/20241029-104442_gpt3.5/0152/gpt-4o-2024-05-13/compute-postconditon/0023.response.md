Example Answer:
`min_time` is updated to the minimum value between `min_time` and `time_with_spell`. The previous values of `min_time` and `time_with_spell` are unknown, so the new value of `min_time` depends on the value of `time_with_spell`. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_time` is updated to the minimum value between the previous `min_time` and `time_with_spell`, `i` is assigned the value of `m`.
Output State: **`min_time` is updated to the minimum value between the previous `min_time` and `time_with_spell`, `i` is assigned the value of `m`**
