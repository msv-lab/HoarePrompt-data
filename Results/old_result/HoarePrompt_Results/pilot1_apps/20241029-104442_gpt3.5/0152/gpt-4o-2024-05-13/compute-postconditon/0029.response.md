Postcondition: **`min_time` is the product of `n` and `x`, `i` is increased by 1, `time_with_spell` is calculated as `n * a[i]`, and `min_time` is updated to the minimum value between the previous `min_time` and `time_with_spell`. If `b[i]` is less than or equal to `s`, `min_time` is updated to the minimum value between the previous `min_time` and `time_with_spell`.**
