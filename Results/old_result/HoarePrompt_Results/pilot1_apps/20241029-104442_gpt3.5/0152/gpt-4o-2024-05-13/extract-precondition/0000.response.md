**Precondition**: **n, m, k, x, s are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^9, 1 <= m, k <= 2*10^5, 2 <= x <= 2*10^9, 1 <= s <= 2*10^9.**

**a** is a list of m integers where each element is an integer such that 1 <= a_i < x.

**b** is a list of m integers where each element is an integer such that 1 <= b_i <= 2*10^9.

**c** is a list of k integers where each element is an integer such that 1 <= c_i <= n and c_i is non-decreasing.

**d** is a list of k integers where each element is an integer such that 1 <= d_i <= 2*10^9 and d_i is non-decreasing.
