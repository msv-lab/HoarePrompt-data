Example Answer: 
The value of `j` is incremented by 1, and the previous value of `j` is 2. After execution, `j` becomes 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `num` is an even or odd integer, `s_left` is the updated result after subtracting `d[2]` from `s`, `j` is 3.
Output State: **`num` is an even or odd integer, `s_left` is the updated result after subtracting `d[2]` from `s`, `j` is 3**
