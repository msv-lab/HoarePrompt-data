According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j`, `k`, `s_left`, and the elements in the list `d`. 
1. For the loop to execute, `j` must be less than `k`, so `j` needs to be adjusted to `j` is 2.
2. Additionally, `s_left` must be greater than or equal to `d[j]` for the loop to execute, so `s_left` needs to be adjusted accordingly based on the updated `j`.
No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`num` is an even or odd integer, `s_left` is the result of subtracting `d[0]` from `s`, `j` is 2**
