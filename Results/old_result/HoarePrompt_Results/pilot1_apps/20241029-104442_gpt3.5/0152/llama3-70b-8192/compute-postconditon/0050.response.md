Output State: **`num` is an even or odd integer, `s_left` is the updated result after subtracting `d[j]` from `s`, `j` is less than `k, `s_left` is greater than or equal to `d[j]`. Once the loop finishes, `j` will be equal to the number of iterations performed, and `s_left` will be the final result after subtracting all elements from `d` where the sum is less than or equal to `s`. If `s_left` becomes less than `d[j]` before the loop completes, the loop will terminate with the updated values of `s_left`, `j`, and `num`. `cnt` is assigned the value 0.**
