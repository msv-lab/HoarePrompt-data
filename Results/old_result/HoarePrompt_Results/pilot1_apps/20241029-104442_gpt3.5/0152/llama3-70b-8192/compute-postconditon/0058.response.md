Precondition: `x` is a number, `i` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of numbers.

Program fragment:
```
if i == m:
    t = x
else:
    t = a[i]
```

Postcondition for if body: If `x` is a number, then if `x` is non-negative and even, `y` is set to half of `x`. If `x` is non-negative and odd, `y` is set to 3 times `x` plus 1. If `x` is negative, `y` is set to -1. `i` is increased by 1.
Postcondition for else body: If `x` is a number, then if `x` is non-negative and even, `y` is set to half of `x`. If `x` is non-negative and odd, `y` is set to 3 times `x` plus 1. If `x` is negative, `y` is set to -1. `i` is increased by 1. `t` is assigned the value of `a[i]`.

Postcondition: **`x` is a number, `i`, `m` are integers, `a` is a list of numbers. If `i` is equal to `m`, then `t` is assigned the value of `x`. Otherwise, `t` is assigned the value at index `i` in the list `a`. Additionally, if `x` is non-negative and even, `y` is set to half of `x`. If `x` is non-negative and odd, `y` is set to 3 times `x` plus 1. If `x` is negative, `y` is set to -1. `i` is increased by 1 in both cases.**
