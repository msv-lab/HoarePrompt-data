The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It is defined without any input parameters. After executing the function body, it has multiple cases of return behavior. Case_1 indicates that the program returns `None` since nothing is specified for return. In Case_2, it returns nothing. Similarly, in Case_3, it returns nothing as there is no value specified to be returned. Lastly, Case_4 also returns `None`, as the return statement does not specify any value. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to not take any input parameters and ultimately returns `None` or nothing based on its several cases. 

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and may return None or nothing based on its various cases.**
