The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of length `n-1`, `count[nc]` is decremented by 1, `res` includes two instances of `nc`, `c` is the next character in the string `s`, `nc` is the next character in 'ACGT' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
