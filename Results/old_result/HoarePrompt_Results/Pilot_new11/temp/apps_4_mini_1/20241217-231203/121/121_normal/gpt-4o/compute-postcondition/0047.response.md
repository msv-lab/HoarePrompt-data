The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `s` is a non-empty string, `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`, `counts` contains at least one of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', `result[1]` is equal to `char`, `counts[char]` has been increased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
