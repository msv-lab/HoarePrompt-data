You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The process of mammoth's genome decoding in Berland comes to its end!

One of the few remaining tasks is to restore unrecognized nucleotides in a found chain s. Each nucleotide is coded with a capital letter of English alphabet: 'A', 'C', 'G' or 'T'. Unrecognized nucleotides are coded by a question mark '?'. Thus, s is a string consisting of letters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and characters '?'.

It is known that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types in the decoded genome of mammoth in Berland should be equal.

Your task is to decode the genome and replace each unrecognized nucleotide with one of the four types so that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types becomes equal.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the integer n (4 ≤ n ≤ 255) — the length of the genome.

The second line contains the string s of length n — the coded genome. It consists of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and '?'.


-----Output-----

If it is possible to decode the genome, print it. If there are multiple answer, print any of them. If it is not possible, print three equals signs in a row: "===" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
8
AG?C??CT

Output
AGACGTCT

Input
4
AGCT

Output
AGCT

Input
6
????G?

Output
===

Input
4
AA??

Output
===



-----Note-----

In the first example you can replace the first question mark with the letter 'A', the second question mark with the letter 'G', the third question mark with the letter 'T', then each nucleotide in the genome would be presented twice.

In the second example the genome is already decoded correctly and each nucleotide is exactly once in it.

In the third and the fourth examples it is impossible to decode the genom.
Program:
```
func_1()

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    s = data[1]
    if n % 4 != 0:
        print('===')
        return
    target_count = n // 4
    counts = {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}
    for char in s:
        if char in counts:
            counts[char] += 1
    for char in counts:
        if counts[char] > target_count:
            print('===')
            return
    result = list(s)
    for i in range(n):
        if result[i] == '?':
            for char in counts:
                if counts[char] < target_count:
                    result[i] = char
                    counts[char] += 1
                    break
    print(''.join(result))


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze it based on the problem description and evaluate its behavior across potential edge cases.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. The string consists of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'.
2. The goal is to decode the string such that each of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' appears an equal number of times.
3. If the length \( n \) of the input string is not divisible by 4, it is already impossible to evenly distribute the nucleotides, and thus the output should be "===".
4. If '?' can be replaced to achieve the required distribution, print the decoded string. Otherwise, print "===".

### Evaluation of the Program:
1. **Check for divisibility by 4**: The program rightly returns "===" if \( n \) is not divisible by 4. This is correct.
  
2. **Count Existing Nucleotides**: The program counts occurrences of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' correctly.

3. **Check for Over-Counts**: The program checks if any nucleotide exceeds the `target_count`. If it does, it prints "===", which is correct.

4. **Replace '?'**:
   - The program attempts to replace each '?' with the appropriate nucleotide until each nucleotide reaches the `target_count`. 
   - However, an edge case arises when it has used up all '?' before filling all nucleotides to their target counts.

### Potential Edge Case:
- Consider the case where there are insufficient '?' to balance out the nucleotides. For example:
    - Input: 
      ```
      12
      ACGTTT??ACG
      ```
    - Current counts: 
      - A: 2, C: 2, G: 2, T: 3, ? : 2
    - Target count: 3 for each nucleotide.
    - The counts indicate we need one more 'T', but we have only two '?'. The program will assign the available '?' to 'A', 'C', and 'G' respectively, ending with 'T' missing a balance.
  
In this case, the output should be "===" because it is impossible to achieve the balanced nucleotide distribution.

### Conclusion:
There exists a case where the program fails to correctly identify when it is impossible to balance the nucleotides, resulting in an incorrect output. Thus, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads an integer `n` and a string `s` from standard input. `n` must be between 4 and 255 and `s` should contain the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'. If `n` is not a multiple of 4, the function outputs '===' and terminates. After confirming `n` is valid, it counts occurrences of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' in `s`. If any of these counts exceed `n / 4`, it once again outputs '===' and terminates. The function then replaces each '?' in the string with characters 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T' as necessary to ensure that none exceed the target count of `n / 4`. Finally, it prints the modified string. If `s` contains no '?', the output will be identical to `s`. The function always returns `None` as it terminates with print statements rather than return values.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
