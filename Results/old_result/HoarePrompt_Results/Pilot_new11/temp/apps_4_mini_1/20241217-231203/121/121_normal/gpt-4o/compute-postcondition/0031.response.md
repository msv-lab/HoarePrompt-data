The operation of printing '===' does not affect the values of the existing variables. Therefore, we will retain the current state of all variables as they were initialized, and only note that the output is generated.

Output State: **`n` is equal to `int(data[0])`, `s` is a non-empty string, `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`, `counts` must still contain at least one of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', `char` is the next character in `counts`, and '===' has been printed.**
