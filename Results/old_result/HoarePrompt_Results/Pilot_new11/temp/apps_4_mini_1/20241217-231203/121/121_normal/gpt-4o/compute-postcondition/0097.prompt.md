You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 255, and s is a string of length n consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    s = data[1]
    if (n % 4 != 0) :
        print('===')
        return
        #The program returns None as nothing is specified for return.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is equal to `int(data[0])`, where `4 ≤ n ≤ 255`; `s` is equal to `data[1]`, a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'; and `n` is a multiple of 4.
    target_count = n // 4
    counts = {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}
    for char in s:
        if char in counts:
            counts[char] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is equal to `int(data[0])`, `s` is equal to `data[1]`, `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`, and `counts` is {'A': count of 'A' in `s`, 'C': count of 'C' in `s`, 'G': count of 'G' in `s`, 'T': count of 'T' in `s`}. The counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' will vary based on the distribution of these characters in `s`.
    for char in counts:
        if counts[char] > target_count:
            print('===')
            return
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is equal to `int(data[0])`, `s` is a non-empty string, `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`, `counts` contains at least one of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'. The loop will execute for each character in `counts`. If any `counts[char]` is greater than `target_count`, the loop exits early. If all characters have `counts[char]` less than or equal to `target_count`, then the loop will complete its iterations without returning, indicating that none of the counts exceed the target count.
    result = list(s)
    for i in range(n):
        if result[i] == '?':
            for char in counts:
                if counts[char] < target_count:
                    result[i] = char
                    counts[char] += 1
                    break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `result` contains all characters from `s` with '?' replaced by valid characters from `counts` as necessary, `counts` will hold the counts of each character ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') adjusted accordingly based on the replacements made, ensuring that for each character, its count is either equal to or not exceeding `target_count`. If there were no '?' characters in `s`, then `result` will be equal to `s`, and `counts` will remain unchanged.
    print(''.join(result))
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and may return None or nothing based on its various cases.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns None as nothing is specified for return.

Case_2: The program returns nothing.

Case_3: The program returns nothing as there is no value specified to be returned.

Case_4: The program returns None, as the return statement does not specify any value.


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
