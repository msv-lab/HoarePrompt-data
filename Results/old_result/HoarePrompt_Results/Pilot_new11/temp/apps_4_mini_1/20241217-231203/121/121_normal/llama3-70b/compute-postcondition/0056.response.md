Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length `n`, `count[nc]` is greater than 0, `res` is updated to include the characters added in place of '?', `c` is the next character in `s`, and `nc` refers to the next character in 'ACGT'. If `count[nc]` is greater than 0, then `count[nc]` is reduced by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop.***
