Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length `n` (where `n` is greater than 0). If `count[nc]` is greater than 0, then `count[nc]` is decremented by 1, `res` is updated to include the characters added in place of '?', and `c` is the next character in `s`, exiting the most internal loop or statement.***
