Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to form a regular bracket sequence based on the counts of the strings `cnt1`, `cnt2`, `cnt3`, and `cnt4`. 

The correct conditions for forming a regular bracket sequence with the given counts should ensure:
1. The total number of opening brackets `(` should equal the total number of closing brackets `)`.
2. Throughout the constructed sequence, the number of closing brackets must never exceed the number of opening brackets at any point.

In the program, the condition `(cnt1 + cnt2 == cnt3 + cnt4 and cnt2 >= cnt3)` is incorrect. While `cnt1 + cnt2 == cnt3 + cnt4` checks if the total counts of brackets are equal, it does not consider the necessary condition that we need to maintain a non-negative balance of opening brackets at the construction point.

To illustrate an example where the program fails:
- Let `cnt1 = 1`, `cnt2 = 2`, `cnt3 = 3`, `cnt4 = 4`. 
- The program outputs `0` since it does not meet the condition, but the true configuration would have an excess of closing brackets preventing a regular bracket sequence from being formed.

Thus, the logic behind the condition used in the program is flawed as it does not fully address the requirements stipulated in the problem description.
