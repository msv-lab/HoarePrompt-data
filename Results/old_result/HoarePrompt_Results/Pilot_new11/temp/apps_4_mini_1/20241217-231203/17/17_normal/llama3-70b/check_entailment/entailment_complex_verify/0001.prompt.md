You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A string is called bracket sequence if it does not contain any characters other than "(" and ")". A bracket sequence is called regular if it it is possible to obtain correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters "+" and "1" into this sequence. For example, "", "(())" and "()()" are regular bracket sequences; "))" and ")((" are bracket sequences (but not regular ones), and "(a)" and "(1)+(1)" are not bracket sequences at all.

You have a number of strings; each string is a bracket sequence of length $2$. So, overall you have $cnt_1$ strings "((", $cnt_2$ strings "()", $cnt_3$ strings ")(" and $cnt_4$ strings "))". You want to write all these strings in some order, one after another; after that, you will get a long bracket sequence of length $2(cnt_1 + cnt_2 + cnt_3 + cnt_4)$. You wonder: is it possible to choose some order of the strings you have such that you will get a regular bracket sequence? Note that you may not remove any characters or strings, and you may not add anything either.


-----Input-----

The input consists of four lines, $i$-th of them contains one integer $cnt_i$ ($0 \le cnt_i \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

Print one integer: $1$ if it is possible to form a regular bracket sequence by choosing the correct order of the given strings, $0$ otherwise.

-----Note-----

In the first example it is possible to construct a string "(())()(()((()()()())))", which is a regular bracket sequence.

In the second example it is possible to construct a string "", which is a regular bracket sequence.
Program:
```
def func():
    (cnt1, cnt2, cnt3, cnt4) = map(int, [input() for _ in range(4)])
    if cnt3 > cnt1:
        print(0)
    else:
        print(1)


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem description and the code implementation.

### Problem Analysis
We are given four counts of bracket sequences:
- `cnt1`: count of "(("
- `cnt2`: count of "()"
- `cnt3`: count of ")("
- `cnt4`: count of "))"

A regular bracket sequence must satisfy the conditions of balancing the opening and closing brackets. Specifically, it starts with an opening bracket and ends with a closing bracket, and at no point in the sequence can the number of closing brackets exceed the opening brackets.

### Conditions for Regular Bracket Sequences
1. The total number of opening brackets must equal the total number of closing brackets:
   - The opening brackets contributed will be `2 * cnt1 + cnt2` (from "((" and "()")
   - The closing brackets contributed will be `2 * cnt4 + cnt3` (from "))" and "()")

2. We need to ensure that at any point in the sequence, the closing brackets don't exceed opening brackets:
   - This translates to ensuring that the count of closing brackets `cnt4` and `cnt3` does not exceed the count of opening brackets `cnt1 + cnt2`.

### Program Logic
The program checks:
- If `cnt3 > cnt1`, it prints `0` (indicating that it's impossible to form a regular sequence).
- Otherwise, it prints `1`.

### Verification of Cases
Next, we need to imagine scenarios to see if the program produces the correct output.

1. **Case 1: Inputs (3, 1, 4, 3)**:
   - cnt1 = 3, cnt2 = 1, cnt3 = 4, cnt4 = 3
   - `cnt3 > cnt1` ⇒ `4 > 3` is true, so the output is `0`.
   - Expected is `0` (impossible), hence it’s correct.

2. **Case 2: Inputs (0, 0, 0, 0)**:
   - All counts are `0`, suggesting an empty sequence.
   - Since we can create an empty regular sequence, the output is `1`.
   - Expected is `1` (possible), hence it’s correct.

3. **Case 3: Inputs (1, 2, 3, 4)**:
   - cnt1 = 1, cnt2 = 2, cnt3 = 3, cnt4 = 4
   - `cnt3 > cnt1` ⇒ `3 > 1` is true, so the output is `0`.
   - Expected is `0` (impossible), hence it’s correct.

### Possible Edge Cases
Consider the case where:
- `cnt1 = 1`, `cnt2 = 1`, `cnt3 = 1`, `cnt4 = 1`
   - Here we have: opening brackets = `2 * 1 + 1 = 3`, and closing brackets = `2 * 1 + 1 = 3`.
   - `cnt3 = 1` is not greater than `cnt1 = 1`, hence it will print `1`.
   - This combination allows us to successfully create a regular sequence: `"(())"`, thus the program output is correct.

The analysis implies that the only crucial condition the program checks is whether `cnt3 > cnt1`, but it does not account for other combinations where the regular sequence can still be formed based on balance (ex. having enough `cnt2` to balance out `cnt3` and additional needs from `cnt4`).

Thus, the program can incorrectly determine that a sequence cannot be formed in cases not covered by the sole check.

### Conclusion
The program does not account for sufficient combinations that could lead to a valid regular bracket sequence beyond its primary check.

Correctness: **False**. 

### Reason for Incorrectness
The program fails cases such as when `cnt2` is sufficiently high to balance the counts of `cnt3` and `cnt4` even when `cnt3` may be equal to or less than `cnt1`. For instance:
- Input: `cnt1 = 2`, `cnt2 = 3`, `cnt3 = 2`, `cnt4 = 2`, which the program would output as `1`, but doesn't fit into this model and can indeed create a valid sequence with careful ordering.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: cnt_1, cnt_2, cnt_3, and cnt_4 are non-negative integers such that 0 <= cnt_i <= 10^9 for i in {1, 2, 3, 4}.
def func():
    cnt1, cnt2, cnt3, cnt4 = map(int, [input() for _ in range(4)])
    if (cnt3 > cnt1) :
        print(0)
    else :
        print(1)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`cnt1`, `cnt2`, `cnt3`, and `cnt4` are integers within the range of 0 to 10^9. If `cnt3` is greater than `cnt1`, then the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `cnt3` is less than or equal to `cnt1`, the state remains unchanged and 1 is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads four non-negative integers (cnt1, cnt2, cnt3, cnt4) from user input, which must be within the range of 0 to 10^9. It evaluates whether cnt3 is greater than cnt1. If cnt3 is greater, it prints 0; otherwise, it prints 1. The function does not modify cnt1, cnt2, cnt3, or cnt4, and there are no return values. The function primarily serves to output a binary response based on this comparison. Additionally, there are unspecified behaviors for handling edge cases, such as invalid input or cases where cnt3 equals cnt1.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
