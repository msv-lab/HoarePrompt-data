The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It processes the non-negative integer values `cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4` that range from 0 to 10^9. The function will include logic that handles these values, leading to different output cases based on their values, though the specific details of these cases are not provided.

Given the constraints outlined, the functionality of the function can be described with placeholders, as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and processes non-negative integers cnt_1, cnt_2, cnt_3, and cnt_4, which are within the range 0 to 10^9. The actual return value and behavior based on these integers is unspecified.**
