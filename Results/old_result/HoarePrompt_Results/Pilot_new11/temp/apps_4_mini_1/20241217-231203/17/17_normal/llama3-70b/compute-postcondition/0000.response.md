The variables `cnt1`, `cnt2`, `cnt3`, and `cnt4` are assigned values from user input. Each of these variables will now hold an integer value that is read from the input, which are expected to be non-negative integers, specifically between 0 and 10^9. The previous values of `cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4` are no longer relevant as they are replaced by the newly inputted values. 

The output state will reflect that `cnt1`, `cnt2`, `cnt3`, and `cnt4` have been updated with new integer values, as provided by user input without any further information about their actual values.

Output State: **`cnt1`, `cnt2`, `cnt3`, and `cnt4` are integers as given by input from the user, where 0 <= cnt1, cnt2, cnt3, cnt4 <= 10^9**
