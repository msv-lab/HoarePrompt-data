Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `i` is less than `n`, `remaining_kvass` is the amount of kvass that was not taken from the available volumes; if all `remaining_kvass` was taken, it will be 0, if not it will be greater than 0. `volumes` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `total_volume` is equal to `sum(volumes)` and greater than or equal to `s`.**
