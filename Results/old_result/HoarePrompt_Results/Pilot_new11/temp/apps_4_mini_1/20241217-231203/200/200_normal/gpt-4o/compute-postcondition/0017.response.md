The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop in which the code is currently executing. Thus, the output state remains the same for all other variables. 

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, if the current value of `volumes[i]` is less than or equal to `min_keg_volume`, we skip the rest of the current loop iteration; otherwise, `remaining_kvass` is decreased by `possible_to_take`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
