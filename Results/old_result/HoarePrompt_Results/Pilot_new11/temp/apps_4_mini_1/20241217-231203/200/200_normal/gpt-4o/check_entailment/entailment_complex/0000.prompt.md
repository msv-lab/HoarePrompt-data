You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The Fair Nut likes kvass very much. On his birthday parents presented him $n$ kegs of kvass. There are $v_i$ liters of kvass in the $i$-th keg. Each keg has a lever. You can pour your glass by exactly $1$ liter pulling this lever. The Fair Nut likes this drink very much, so he wants to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass. But he wants to do it, so kvass level in the least keg is as much as possible.

Help him find out how much kvass can be in the least keg or define it's not possible to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $s$ ($1 \le n \le 10^3$, $1 \le s \le 10^{12}$) — the number of kegs and glass volume.

The second line contains $n$ integers $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n$ ($1 \le v_i \le 10^9$) — the volume of $i$-th keg.


-----Output-----

If the Fair Nut cannot pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass, print $-1$. Otherwise, print a single integer — how much kvass in the least keg can be.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3
4 3 5

Output
3

Input
3 4
5 3 4

Output
2

Input
3 7
1 2 3

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example, the answer is $3$, the Fair Nut can take $1$ liter from the first keg and $2$ liters from the third keg. There are $3$ liters of kvass in each keg.

In the second example, the answer is $2$, the Fair Nut can take $3$ liters from the first keg and $1$ liter from the second keg.

In the third example, the Fair Nut can't pour his cup by $7$ liters, so the answer is $-1$.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), s is a non-negative integer (1 <= s <= 10^12), and v is a list of n integers where each integer v_i represents the volume of the i-th keg (1 <= v_i <= 10^9).
def func():
    n, s = map(int, input().split())
    volumes = list(map(int, input().split()))
    volumes.sort()
    total_volume = sum(volumes)
    if (total_volume < s) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        min_keg_volume = volumes[0]
        remaining_kvass = s
        for i in range(n):
            if volumes[i] <= min_keg_volume:
                continue
            else:
                possible_to_take = min(volumes[i] - min_keg_volume, remaining_kvass)
                remaining_kvass -= possible_to_take
            
            if remaining_kvass == 0:
                break
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `i` is less than `n`, `remaining_kvass` is the amount of kvass that was not taken from the available volumes; if all `remaining_kvass` was taken, it will be 0, if not it will be greater than 0. `volumes` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `total_volume` is equal to `sum(volumes)` and greater than or equal to `s`.
        if (remaining_kvass > 0) :
            min_keg_volume -= (remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n
        #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000) and `i` is less than `n`. If `remaining_kvass` is greater than 0, `min_keg_volume` is updated to `min_keg_volume - (remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n`. If `remaining_kvass` is 0, no changes are made. The `volumes` is a sorted list of `n` integers, and `total_volume` is equal to `sum(volumes)` and greater than or equal to `s.
        print(min_keg_volume)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `s` is a non-negative integer (1 <= s <= 10^12), `v` is a list of `n` integers, `volumes` is a sorted list of `n` integers, and `total_volume` is equal to `sum(volumes)`. If `total_volume` is less than `s`, -1 is printed. Otherwise, if `total_volume` is greater than or equal to `s`, `min_keg_volume` is updated by subtracting `(remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n` and `min_keg_volume` is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes an integer `n`, an integer `s`, and a list of integers `volumes`. It checks if the total volume of the kegs is at least `s`. If it is not, the function prints `-1`. If it is, the function calculates the minimum volume that can be obtained from the kegs after attempting to reduce the `remaining_kvass` amount by taking volumes from kegs that exceed the minimum keg volume. If any `remaining_kvass` remains after processing all eligible kegs, it adjusts the minimum keg volume downwards based on the amount of remaining kvass and the number of kegs. The final result printed is either the updated minimum keg volume or, if all `remaining_kvass` was taken, the original minimum keg volume. The function directly interacts with user input and output, returning no values but printing results instead.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
