Postcondition: ***`s` is an input positive integer, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `v` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `v[i]` satisfies 1 <= `v[i]` <= 10^9, `low` is 0, `high` is min(v), `mid` is (min(v) + 1) // 2, and `total` is equal to sum(min((min(v) + 1) // 2, x) for x in v). The current value of `total` is less than `s`.***
