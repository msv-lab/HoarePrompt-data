The variable `v` is assigned the value `list(map(int, input().split()))`, which means it will contain a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each part to an integer. The previous state of `n` confirms that `v` will contain exactly `n` integers. Since `s` remains unchanged, the output state will reflect the new values for `v` along with the unchanged states of `s` and `n`.

Output State: **`s` is an input positive integer, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `v` is a list of `n` integers obtained from input, where each integer `v[i]` satisfies 1 <= `v[i]` <= 10^9.**
