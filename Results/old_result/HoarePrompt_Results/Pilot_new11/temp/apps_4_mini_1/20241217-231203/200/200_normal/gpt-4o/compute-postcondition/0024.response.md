The code snippet `break` indicates that the current loop iteration is terminated, and control is transferred to the statement immediately following the loop. The values of `n`, `i`, and `remaining_kvass` do not change, and the process of updating `remaining_kvass` based on the comparison of `volumes[i]` and `min_keg_volume` is not executed as the loop is exited. Therefore, the output state reflects this.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `remaining_kvass` remains unchanged, and we break out of the loop.**
