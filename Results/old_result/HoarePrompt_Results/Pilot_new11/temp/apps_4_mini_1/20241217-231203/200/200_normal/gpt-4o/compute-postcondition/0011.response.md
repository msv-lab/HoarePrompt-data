The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop it is in, proceeding to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the code executed, the states of the variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, and the current value of `volumes[i]` is less than or equal to `min_keg_volume` and we skip the rest of the loop's current iteration.**
