The code `volumes.sort()` sorts the list `volumes` in non-decreasing order. The initial state indicates that `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a non-negative integer between 1 and \(10^{12}\), and `v` and `volumes` are lists of integers of length `n`. The values of `n`, `s`, and `v` are not directly affected by the sort operation, but the order of elements in the `volumes` list will change based on its initial values.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `s` is an input non-negative integer (1 <= s <= 10^12), `v` is a list of `n` integers, and `volumes` is a sorted list of `n` integers from its prior state.**
