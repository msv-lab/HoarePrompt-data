Postcondition: ***`n` is an input positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `s` is an input non-negative integer (1 <= s <= 10^12), `v` is a list of `n` integers, `volumes` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `total_volume` is equal to `sum(volumes)`, and the current value of `total_volume` is less than `s`.***
