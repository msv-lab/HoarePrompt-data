To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's analyze the logic and constraints set by the problem description:

1. **Understanding Inputs**:
   - `N`: Total different coin types available.
   - `M`: Number of friends gifting coins.
   - `K`: Number of coin types Ivan already has.
   - `L`: Minimum number of new coins that must be gifted.

2. **Constraints**:
   - Each friend must gift the same number of coins.
   - All gifted coins must be different.
   - At least `L` coins must be new to Ivan's collection.

3. **Program Logic**:
   - The program first calculates the minimum number of coins per friend (`min_x`) required to ensure that at least `L` coins are new. This is done using the formula: 
     \[
     \text{min\_x} = \left\lceil \frac{L}{M} \right\rceil
     \]
   - Then, the program checks if `M * min_x` (the total coins given by all friends) can fit into the number of new coins available (`N - K`):
     - If this condition is true, it prints `min_x`.
     - If not, it prints `-1` to indicate that it's impossible to satisfy the conditions.

4. **Edge Cases and Potential Failures**:
   - Suppose `N = K`, and thus `N - K = 0`. If `M > 1` and `L > 0`, this scenario should result in `-1`, as giving any coins won't result in new coins for Ivan. The formula might not correctly handle this case, especially since `min_x` would still be computed but the result may not effectively reflect that no new coins can be given.
   - If `M = 1`, then the only gift will be given by one friend, and if he has to give at least `L` new coins and `K` equals or exceeds `N`, it would also lead to a situation where it's impossible to provide `L` new coins, which could mislead the output depending on how the conditions are checked.

Given the flaws and potential pitfalls of the implemented logic under specific conditions, particularly when `N - K` is 0 or when `M` is 1, the program does not appear to correctly check for all required edge cases. 

Therefore, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**

Explicit case where the program fails:
- Input: `N = 5, M = 2, K = 5, L = 1`
- Expected Output: `-1` (impossible to gift any new coins) 
- Actual Output: would incorrectly calculate `min_x = 1` and print `1`, which is wrong because there are no new coins available.
