The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, but it relies on four implicit parameters: `N`, `M`, `K`, and `L`, which are positive integers within the specified constraints: 1 ≤ K ≤ N ≤ 10^18 and 1 ≤ M, L ≤ 10^18. The output and the functionality of the function is not described in the given information, so we cannot ascertain what it returns based on the inputs.

Functionality: **The function does not accept explicit parameters, but depends on the implicit positive integer variables N, M, K, and L within the specified constraints. The return value is not explicitly defined.**
