To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the logic step by step.

### Problem Requirements:
1. **All friends must gift the same number of coins.**
2. **All coins gifted to Ivan must be different.**
3. **At least `L` coins among the gifts must be new (not in Ivan's collection).**

### Given Program:
```python
def func():
    (N, M, K, L) = map(int, input().split())
    if M >= N - K + 1 and M >= L:
        print(1)
    else:
        print(-1)
```

### Analysis:
- The program extracts the values for `N`, `M`, `K`, and `L`.
- It checks if `M`, the number of friends, is at least `N - K + 1` (i.e., can they gift at least one new coin since Ivan has `K` coins already).
- Additionally, it checks that `M` is at least `L` (there need to be at least `L` new coins).
- If both conditions are met, it prints `1`, implying that one coin per friend will suffice. Otherwise, it prints `-1`.

### Edge Cases:
1. **When `M > N`:**
   - Example: If Ivan has `10` different coins (`N = 10`), but has `15` friends (`M = 15`), regardless of the coins they gift, it's impossible for each friend to give a different coin.
   - Here, the code would print `-1`, which is correct.

2. **When `N - K < L`:**
   - Example: If Ivan has `N = 10`, `K = 10`, and `L = 1`. Here, there are no new coins possible (`N - K = 0`), but `L` is `1`, making it impossible to meet the requirements. The output will be `-1`, which is accurate.

3. **Simple Valid Case:**
   - When `N = 20`, `M = 15`, `K = 2`, and `L = 3`; we find that `M >= N - K + 1` means `15 >= 19`, which is false, but since `M >= L` means `15 >= 3`, this might wrongly lead to `-1`, which is inappropriate. The condition fails as `M` should also be able to give of new coins.

### Invalid Cases:
- The issue arises when `M < L` but `M >= N - K + 1` acts as a separate metric and leads to incorrect conclusions about the validity.
  
### Conclusion:
There are scenarios where the output does not satisfy the conditions established by the problem statement, particularly in cases where the actual distribution of coins should also consider how many friends there are relative to new coins. 

For the case when `M < L`, the output should be `-1`, indicating that the minimum gifting cannot happen here logically. Therefore the program logic is flawed.

Correctness: **False**.

The program fails edge cases where it does not compute the correct possible gifts effectively, particularly where it does not let the `L` (minimum number of new coins) validate against the limits established by `M`.
