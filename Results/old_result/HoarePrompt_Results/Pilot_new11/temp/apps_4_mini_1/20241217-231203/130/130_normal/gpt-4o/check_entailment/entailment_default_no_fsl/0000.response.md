Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle all potential cases as required by the problem description. 

For example, if we consider the case where Ivan has `N = 1`, `M = 1`, `K = 1`, and `L = 1`:
- Here, Ivan has one coin, and he has one friend. The friend needs to give Ivan at least one new coin. However, since Ivan already has the only type of coin available (which is also the only type of coin that can be gifted), it is impossible for the friend to gift a new coin. In this scenario, the output should be `-1`, but the calculation will still yield `min_x = 1` since `L` can be divided by `M`, leading to a flawed output.

Thus, the program fails to account for edge cases where the total number of coins Ivan has plus the number of coins gifted cannot cover the total number of required new coins, rendering it incorrect in such conditions.
