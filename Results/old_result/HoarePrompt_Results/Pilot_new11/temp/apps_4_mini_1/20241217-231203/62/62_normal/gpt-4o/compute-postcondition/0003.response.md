According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `digits` list. If `digits` is a non-empty list, the loop will execute once for each element in the list. At the end of the last iteration, `digit` is the first element of `digits`, and since the list is non-empty, it must have at least 1 element. For the loop to execute one more time, `digits` needs to have at least 2 elements, and `digit` should represent the next element in the list.

State: **`digits` is a non-empty list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `base` is an integer such that 2 ≤ base ≤ 40, `decimal_value` is equal to `digit`, `digit` is the second element of `digits`**
