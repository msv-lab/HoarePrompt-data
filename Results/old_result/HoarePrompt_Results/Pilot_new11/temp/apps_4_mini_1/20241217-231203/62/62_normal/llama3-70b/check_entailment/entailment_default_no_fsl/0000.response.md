Correctness: **False**

The program is intended to convert numbers from different bases to base 10 and then compare them. However, it lacks proper validation for the digits being used in their respective bases. According to the problem description, the digits of the numbers X and Y must be within the valid range for their bases (0 to base-1). If an invalid digit is provided (one that is greater than or equal to the base), the program does not handle this error; it simply proceeds to compute a result that would be incorrect.

For example, if given the input:
```
3 5
1 2 4
2 6
3 5
```
The left number X (with base 5) represents 124 in base 5, but digit '4' is valid. The right number Y (with base 6) uses digit '5', which is not valid (as digits should be < base). The absence of proper digit validation leads to potential incorrect or unexpected results, therefore not aligning with the problem requirements.

Since there are cases where the program will not handle the input correctly, it is deemed incorrect overall.
