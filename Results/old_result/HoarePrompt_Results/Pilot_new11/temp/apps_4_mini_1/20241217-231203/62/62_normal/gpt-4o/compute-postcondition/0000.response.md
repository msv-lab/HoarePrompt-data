The variable `decimal_value` is initialized to `0`. Since this is the only variable that has been affected by the code, no existing values from the initial state have changed except for `decimal_value`. Other details related to the list `digits` and the integer `base` remain valid and unchanged.

Output State: **`digits` is a list of integers representing the digits of a number in a specific base; `base` is an integer such that 2 ≤ base ≤ 40; `decimal_value` is 0.**
