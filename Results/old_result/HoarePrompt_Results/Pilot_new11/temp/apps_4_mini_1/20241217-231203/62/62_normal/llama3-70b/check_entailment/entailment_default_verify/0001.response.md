Final: **True** 

The original assessment is accurate. The program successfully reads input as specified in the problem description, accurately converts the numbers from their respective bases to decimal using the `func_1` function, and correctly compares the two decimal values. 

The output hints do point out a lack of robust input validation, which is valid, but since the problem description asserts that the input will be valid and within constraints, this does not negate the correctness of the program for valid inputs. The program's logic adheres to the requirements laid out in the task, yielding correct comparisons for the given range of inputs. Thus, despite its lack of error handling for invalid inputs, the program meets the specific requirements of the problem description and behaves as expected for valid provided inputs.
