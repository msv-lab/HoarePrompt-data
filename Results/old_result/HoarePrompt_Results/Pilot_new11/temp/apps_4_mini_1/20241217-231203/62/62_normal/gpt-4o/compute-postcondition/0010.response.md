Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `digits` representing the digits of a number in a given `base` (ranging from 2 to 40) and returns the equivalent decimal representation of that number as an integer. The function assumes that the input list `digits` is non-empty, contains valid digits in the range of 0 to base-1, and does not contain leading zeroes. It calculates the decimal value by iterating through the list of digits and converting them from the specified base to decimal. However, if the input `digits` contains invalid digits or if it is empty (despite the assumption), the function does not handle these potential edge cases explicitly, which may lead to unexpected behavior.**
