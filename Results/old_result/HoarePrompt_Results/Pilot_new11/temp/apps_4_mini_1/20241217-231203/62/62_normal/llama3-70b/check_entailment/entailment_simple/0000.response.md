To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's break down the steps involved:

1. **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads the first line of input, which contains the number of digits `n` and the base `b_x` of the first number `X`, followed by reading the digits of `X`. It does the same for the second number `Y`, reading `m` and `b_y` and the digits for `Y`. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Function `func_1`**: This function takes a list of digits and a base. It converts the number represented by those digits in the specified base to a base-10 integer. The conversion logic is correct:
   - It initializes `result` to 0.
   - For each digit in the list, it multiplies the current `result` by the base and adds the digit, effectively building the base-10 representation incrementally. 

   This implementation correctly handles the conversion for bases between 2 and 40, as required by the problem description.

3. **Comparison and Output**: After obtaining the base-10 representations of both numbers, the program compares `x` and `y`. It outputs `<`, `>`, or `=` accordingly, which matches the requirement to compare the two numbers and output the appropriate character.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program assumes that inputs will be within valid constraints (as stated), so there are no checks for invalid inputs or leading zeros, which is acceptable given the problem statement.

### Conclusion:

The program processes the input as described, performs the required conversions and comparisons, and outputs the correct result in alignment with the problem requirements. Every step follows the guidelines set forth in the problem description without deviation.

Therefore, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**
