Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. Hereâ€™s why it meets all the criteria:

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads the input correctly, as per the problem description:
   - It captures two space-separated integers \( n \) and \( b_{x} \), where \( n \) is the number of digits for number \( X \) and \( b_{x} \) is its base.
   - It collects \( n \) space-separated integers that represent the digits of \( X \).
   - Similarly, it reads \( m \) and \( b_{y} \), followed by the digits representing \( Y \).

2. **Conversion to Decimal**: The helper function `func_1` correctly converts the digits from their respective bases \( b_{x} \) and \( b_{y} \) to decimal:
   - It initializes `decimal_value` to zero and iteratively computes the decimal value using base conversion rules, ensuring that it constructs the decimal number correctly from the given base representation.

3. **Comparison Logic**: The program performs the comparison of the two decimal values derived from \( X \) and \( Y \) accurately:
   - It uses standard comparison operators to denote if \( X \) is less than, greater than, or equal to \( Y \), and prints the corresponding character ('<', '>', '=').

4. **Assurances**: The problem specifies:
   - Inputs will always be valid; \( b_{x} \) is not equal to \( b_{y} \), and all digits will fall within the valid range.
   - The program assumes that the inputs do not contain leading zeros, aligning with the problem statements.

Overall, the implementation carries out the task as described for valid inputs, and since the assumptions hold true and the rules are followed accurately, the program operates correctly in the context of the given specification. Thus, the final conclusion is that the implementation successfully meets the requirements of the problem description.
