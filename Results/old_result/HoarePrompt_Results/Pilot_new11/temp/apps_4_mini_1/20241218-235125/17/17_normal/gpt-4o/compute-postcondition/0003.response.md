The value of `cnt_4` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input()` accepts an input and is converted to an integer. All other variables `cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, and `cnt_3` remain unchanged. The state of `cnt_4` will now contain the new integer value provided as input, which still satisfies the condition that `0 <= cnt_4 <= 10^9`.

Output State: **`cnt_1` is an input integer, `cnt_2` is an input integer, `cnt_3` is an input integer, `cnt_4` is an input integer satisfying 0 <= `cnt_4` <= 10^9**
