The code assigns the values from input to `cnt1`, `cnt2`, `cnt3`, and `cnt4`. Each of these variables will hold an integer value provided through input. The previous values of `cnt_1, cnt_2, cnt_3, and cnt_4` remain unchanged unless they are specifically overwritten by the input. There are no constraints or conditions on the inputs beyond being non-negative integers.

Output State: **`cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4` are non-negative integers that have been updated to the integers provided as input.**
