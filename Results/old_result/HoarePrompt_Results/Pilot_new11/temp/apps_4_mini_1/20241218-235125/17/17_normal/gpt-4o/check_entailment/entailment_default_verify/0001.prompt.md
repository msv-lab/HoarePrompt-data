You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A string is called bracket sequence if it does not contain any characters other than "(" and ")". A bracket sequence is called regular if it it is possible to obtain correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters "+" and "1" into this sequence. For example, "", "(())" and "()()" are regular bracket sequences; "))" and ")((" are bracket sequences (but not regular ones), and "(a)" and "(1)+(1)" are not bracket sequences at all.

You have a number of strings; each string is a bracket sequence of length $2$. So, overall you have $cnt_1$ strings "((", $cnt_2$ strings "()", $cnt_3$ strings ")(" and $cnt_4$ strings "))". You want to write all these strings in some order, one after another; after that, you will get a long bracket sequence of length $2(cnt_1 + cnt_2 + cnt_3 + cnt_4)$. You wonder: is it possible to choose some order of the strings you have such that you will get a regular bracket sequence? Note that you may not remove any characters or strings, and you may not add anything either.


-----Input-----

The input consists of four lines, $i$-th of them contains one integer $cnt_i$ ($0 \le cnt_i \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

Print one integer: $1$ if it is possible to form a regular bracket sequence by choosing the correct order of the given strings, $0$ otherwise.

-----Note-----

In the first example it is possible to construct a string "(())()(()((()()()())))", which is a regular bracket sequence.

In the second example it is possible to construct a string "", which is a regular bracket sequence.
Program:
```
def func():
    cnt1 = int(input())
    cnt2 = int(input())
    cnt3 = int(input())
    cnt4 = int(input())
    if cnt1 + cnt2 == cnt3 + cnt4 and cnt2 >= cnt3:
        print(1)
    else:
        print(0)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the situation based on the rules of bracket sequences.

A regular bracket sequence can be formed if:
1. The total number of opening brackets '(' is equal to the total number of closing brackets ')'.
2. At no point in the sequence do we have more closing brackets than opening brackets, which can be inferred from the counts of the different strings. 

The program's logic can be broken down as follows:
- It reads four integers: `cnt1`, `cnt2`, `cnt3`, and `cnt4`, which represent the counts of the substring pairs "((", "()", ")(", and "))" respectively.
- It checks if `cnt1 + cnt2` (total opening brackets from combinations of "((" and "()") equals `cnt3 + cnt4` (total closing brackets from combinations of ")(" and "))").
- Additionally, it checks if `cnt2 >= cnt3`, which ensures we don't have more closing brackets than open brackets at any stage.

Based on the problem:
- `cnt1` contributes to the overall opening bracket count and does not result in a direct closing at the end of the sequence.
- `cnt2` provides balanced pairs.
- `cnt3` starts with a closing action.
- `cnt4` ends with a closing action.

Now let's evaluate if this logic holds for all edge cases:

1. **Example Inputs**:
   - For input `0, 0, 0, 0`, we have all counts zero. This results in an empty sequence, which is valid, hence the output should be `1`.
   - For input `3, 1, 4, 3`, we have 3 double open, 1 balanced, 4 double close, and 3 misaligned closes. This configuration is possible; thus the output is `1`.
   - For input `1, 2, 3, 4`, with 1 double open, 2 balanced, 3 misaligned closes, and 4 double closes, it is impossible to achieve a regular sequence; hence the output is `0`.

2. **Problematic Case**:
   If we set `cnt1 = 0`, `cnt2 = 0`, `cnt3 = 1`, and `cnt4 = 0`, it means we have no opening and no balanced pairs, and one immediate closing without any opening. The output for this case should be `0`, but according to the implementation logic, it would evaluate to `0 == 1 + 0` (false), indicating that no sequence can be formed, which seems incorrect under the conclusion that you can't close without an opening bracket.

Hence, we found a specific edge case where the program's logic fails to capture all scenarios correctly.

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads four non-negative integer values from user input, named `cnt1`, `cnt2`, `cnt3`, and `cnt4`. It checks if the sum of the first two integers (`cnt1 + cnt2`) equals the sum of the last two integers (`cnt3 + cnt4`) and whether `cnt2` is greater than or equal to `cnt3`. If both conditions are met, it prints `1`. Otherwise, it prints `0`. The function does not return any values, and the final outputs are solely determined by the input conditions without any additional state modifications to the input variables. It also does not handle potential edge cases such as invalid input types or values outside the specified ranges, which could lead to runtime errors.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
