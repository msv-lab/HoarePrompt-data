The variable `s` is assigned the value of the input string. The initial conditions state that `s` is a string of length `n`, which is an integer within the range [1, 500]. Following the execution of the code, `s` now holds a new input string of length `n`. 

Since the value of `s` will now depend on the user input, we can specify that `s` is an input string of length `n` while `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range [1, 500]; `s` is an input string of length `n`.**
