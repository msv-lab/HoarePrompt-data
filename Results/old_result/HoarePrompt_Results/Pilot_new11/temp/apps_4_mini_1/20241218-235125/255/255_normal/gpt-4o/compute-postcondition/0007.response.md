According to the code, the loop iterates with `i` starting from 1 up to `n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Since the loop starts at 1 and continues while `i` is less than `n`, the conditions at the end of the last iteration need to be adjusted. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1, and `i` is currently at some value between 1 and `n - 1`. For the loop to execute once more, `i` must be incremented to `i + 1`. Therefore, after this incrementation, `n` still must be greater than `i + 1`.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `s` is an input string of length `n`, `i` is the next index for the loop which is currently `i + 1`**
