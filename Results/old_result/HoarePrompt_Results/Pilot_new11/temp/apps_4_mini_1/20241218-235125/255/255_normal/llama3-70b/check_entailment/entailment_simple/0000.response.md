Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The problem requires finding the minimum number of operations needed to delete the entire string by removing contiguous substrings of equal characters. 

The logic in the function counts the number of distinct segments of adjacent characters. This approach does not yield the correct result for the minimum number of operations required to delete the entire string. For instance, if we have the string "aaabb", the function will return 3 (which counts "aa", then "b" and then nothing, since "b" is followed by "b" again). However, using the allowed operation optimally, the whole string can be deleted in just 2 operations (removing "aaa" and then "bb").

Therefore, the output of the program does not align with the requirements of the problem description in all cases. It fails to capture the minimum deletions needed based on the operations allowed. Hence, the correctness of the program is not validated against the described task.
