Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the functionality as described in the problem description. 

### Explanation:
The problem states that we can delete contiguous substrings of equal characters, and we need to calculate the minimum number of operations to delete the entire string. 

In the annotated program, the approach being used simply counts the number of transitions (or changes) between different characters in the string. Each transition increments a counter (`ans`), and it starts from 1 to account for the first character group. 

However, the true minimum operations required to delete the string cannot be determined by merely counting these transitions. For instance, in the string "aaabaaa", you can remove the three 'a's at once, which should be counted as one operation rather than associating each change with an operation.

As an example:
- For the input "aaabaaa", the correct answer should be `2` (remove "aaa" in one operation and "aaa" in another), but the program would output `4` because it counts the transitions between distinct characters.

Thus, the method for calculating the operations based on counting adjacent distinct groups fails to follow the requirement of the problem description, resulting in an incorrect implementation.
