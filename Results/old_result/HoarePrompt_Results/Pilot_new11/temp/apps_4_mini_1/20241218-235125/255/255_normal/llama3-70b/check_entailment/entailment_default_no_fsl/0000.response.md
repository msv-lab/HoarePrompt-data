Correctness: **False**

The provided program is intended to calculate the minimum number of operations required to delete the entire string `s` by repeatedly removing contiguous substrings of equal characters. However, it fails to correctly implement the required logic as per the problem description.

The output hints describe that the code counts distinct adjacent character groups in the string. However, this approach does not account for the actual minimum number of deletions needed based on the allowed operation of deleting contiguous substrings of equal characters. 

For example, consider the input string "aabbcc". The correct approach would recognize that one operation could remove "aabb" in one go, leaving "cc," and then a final operation would remove "cc." The minimum number of operations here is 2. However, the program would evaluate this string and return `5`, which is incorrect because it counts each distinct group of characters separately instead of considering the possible contiguous deletions.

Thus, the logic of the program does not fulfill the requirements specified in the problem description for every potential input case.
