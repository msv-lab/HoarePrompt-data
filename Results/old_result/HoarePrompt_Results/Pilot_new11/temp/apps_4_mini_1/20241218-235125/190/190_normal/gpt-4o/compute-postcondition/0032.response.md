Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= `n` <= 1000), `a` is a list of `n` positive integers (1 <= `a[i]` <= 100), `current_cost` is 0, `min_cost` is unchanged, `best_t` is unchanged, `t` is 101, and `length` is equal to the first element of the list `a`. The current value of `length` is less than 100.***
