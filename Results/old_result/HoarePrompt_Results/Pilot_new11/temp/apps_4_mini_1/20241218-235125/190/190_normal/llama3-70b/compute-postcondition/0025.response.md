To determine the necessary conditions for the loop to execute, let's analyze the situation step by step.

1. The loop statement is `for i in range(mid + 1, 101)`. 
2. This means that the loop iterates starting from `mid + 1` and goes up to (but does not include) 101.
3. For the loop to execute at least once, the starting point `mid + 1` must be less than 101. Thus, we need `mid + 1 < 101`, which simplifies to `mid < 100`.
4. Additionally, it is given that `i` starts as 0 or less. This does not affect the loop itself but indicates the previous state of `i`.
5. If `mid` is equal to 1, then `mid + 1` would evaluate to 2, which is valid for starting the loop.
6. The variables `min_cost` and `min_t` represent the previous state and retain their initial values if the loop did not execute, but they are not necessary for this loop execution condition.

In light of this analysis, to ensure that the loop executes, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `mid` should be less than 100, which allows for `mid + 1` to start from a value that can lead to valid iterations.
- `i` should start at 0 or less as stated.

Putting this together, we arrive at the following modified state for the execution of the for loop:

State: **`n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 <= a[i] <= 100), `sticks` is a sorted list of integers, `mid` must be less than 100, `i` is 0 or less, `min_cost` retains original cost, `min_t` retains original t**
