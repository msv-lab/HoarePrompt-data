The variable `current_cost` is assigned the value of 0. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 <= n <= 1000, `a` is a list of n positive integers where each integer a[i] satisfies 1 <= a[i] <= 100, `min_cost` is equal to infinity, `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1, and `current_cost` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 <= n <= 1000, `a` is a list of n positive integers where each integer a[i] satisfies 1 <= a[i] <= 100, `min_cost` is equal to infinity, `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1, `current_cost` is 0.**
