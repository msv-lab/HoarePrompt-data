You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Salem gave you $n$ sticks with integer positive lengths $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$.

For every stick, you can change its length to any other positive integer length (that is, either shrink or stretch it). The cost of changing the stick's length from $a$ to $b$ is $|a - b|$, where $|x|$ means the absolute value of $x$.

A stick length $a_i$ is called almost good for some integer $t$ if $|a_i - t| \le 1$.

Salem asks you to change the lengths of some sticks (possibly all or none), such that all sticks' lengths are almost good for some positive integer $t$ and the total cost of changing is minimum possible. The value of $t$ is not fixed in advance and you can choose it as any positive integer. 

As an answer, print the value of $t$ and the minimum cost. If there are multiple optimal choices for $t$, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 1000$) — the number of sticks.

The second line contains $n$ integers $a_i$ ($1 \le a_i \le 100$) — the lengths of the sticks.


-----Output-----

Print the value of $t$ and the minimum possible cost. If there are multiple optimal choices for $t$, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
10 1 4

Output
3 7

Input
5
1 1 2 2 3

Output
2 0



-----Note-----

In the first example, we can change $1$ into $2$ and $10$ into $4$ with cost $|1 - 2| + |10 - 4| = 1 + 6 = 7$ and the resulting lengths $[2, 4, 4]$ are almost good for $t = 3$.

In the second example, the sticks lengths are already almost good for $t = 2$, so we don't have to do anything.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    sticks = list(map(int, input().split()))
    sticks.sort()
    mid = sticks[n // 2]
    cost = sum((abs(x - mid) for x in sticks))
    t = mid
    min_cost = cost
    min_t = t
    for i in range(mid - 1, 0, -1):
        cost = sum((min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i + 1))) for x in sticks))
        if cost < min_cost:
            min_cost = cost
            min_t = i
    for i in range(mid + 1, 101):
        cost = sum((min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i - 1))) for x in sticks))
        if cost < min_cost:
            min_cost = cost
            min_t = i
    print(min_t, min_cost)


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the given program against the provided problem description, let's break down the requirements and logic of the provided code.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. The task is to adjust the lengths of sticks to make them all "almost good" for some positive integer `t`, where a stick length `a_i` is considered almost good if `|a_i - t| ≤ 1`.
2. The cost of changing a stick length from `a` to `b` is defined as `|a - b|`.
3. The output must consist of the optimal integer `t` and the minimum total cost for all modifications made.

### Program Analysis:
- The program reads `n` (number of sticks) and the lengths of sticks.
- It sorts the stick lengths and computes the median, which is a reasonable starting point for minimizing total adjustment cost.
- The program checks around this median for optimal solutions, adjusting `t` downward and upward to find other potential values for `t` and their corresponding costs.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Edge Cases for `t`:** The code checks potential values of `t` from `mid - 1` to `0` (i.e., `1`), and from `mid + 1` to `101`, but does not account for the fact that, due to the "almost good" requirement, `t` must always be a positive integer. If `mid` becomes `1`, the next loop (`for i in range(mid - 1, 0, -1)`) initiates with `i = 0` and may lead to an incorrect calculation since `t` cannot be `0`.
   
2. **Cost Calculation Logic:** The calculation of cost using `min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i + 1)))` for decrementing sticks does not properly cover the requirements since it could improperly adjust values without ensuring they adhere to the almost good condition of `t`.

### Input Example for Failure:
Given the input `1 1 2 2 3`, where `1, 1, 2, 2, 3` should yield an optimal `t = 2` with a cost of `0`, it should logically ensure that the resulting lengths are within `t ± 1`. If the calculated `min_t` ends up being `1` or `3`, it could lead to higher costs inconsistency against the problem stipulation.

### Conclusion:
With the analyzed case, the logic has inherent flaws due to improper handling of the positive integer constraint for `t` and may lead to incorrect outputs for the given stick lengths. Therefore, it fails the requirements outlined in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, and a is a list of n integers where each integer satisfies 1 <= a[i] <= 100.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    sticks = list(map(int, input().split()))
    sticks.sort()
    mid = sticks[n // 2]
    cost = sum(abs(x - mid) for x in sticks)
    t = mid
    min_cost = cost
    min_t = t
    for i in range(mid - 1, 0, -1):
        cost = sum(min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i + 1))) for x in sticks)
        
        if cost < min_cost:
            min_cost = cost
            min_t = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 <= a[i] <= 100), `sticks` is a sorted list of integers, `mid` is at least 1, `i` is 0 or less, `min_cost` is the minimum sum of absolute differences of `sticks` from `t` for all valid values of `i`, and `min_t` is the value of `t` (the final value of `i` for which `min_cost` was updated) where the loop may not have executed if `mid` is equal to 1. If the loop did not execute, `min_cost` and `min_t` retain their initial values based on the original `cost` and `t`.
    for i in range(mid + 1, 101):
        cost = sum(min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i - 1))) for x in sticks)
        
        if cost < min_cost:
            min_cost = cost
            min_t = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 <= a[i] <= 100), `sticks` is a sorted list of integers, `mid` is less than 100, `i` is 101, `min_cost` is the minimum cost calculated over the range of i (from mid+1 to 100), and `min_t` is the value of `i` that resulted in `min_cost`. If `mid` is 100 or more, `min_cost` and `min_t` remain their original values.
    print(min_t, min_cost)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers (representing lengths of sticks) as input. It calculates the optimal length `min_t` that minimizes the total cost of transforming all stick lengths to that length, where the cost is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between the stick lengths and the target length. It performs this by evaluating costs for lengths in two ranges: from one less than the median length (the middle value of sorted sticks) down to 1, and from one more than the median length up to 100. The function ultimately prints `min_t` and the associated minimum cost `min_cost`. Edge cases include situations where the input list is already composed of identical values, and handling the cases where the median is 1 or 100, potentially resulting in empty loops if no valid `i` exists in the specified range. Notably, the function does not return a value but instead prints the results.
