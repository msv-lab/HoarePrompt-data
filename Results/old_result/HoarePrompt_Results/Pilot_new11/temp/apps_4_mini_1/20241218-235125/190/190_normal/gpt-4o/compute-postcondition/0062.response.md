Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= `n` <= 1000), `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `current_cost` is increased by `length - 102` if `length` is greater than 102, while `min_cost` and `best_t` remain unchanged. `t` is 101, and `length` is the first element of `a` with the condition that `length` is greater than or equal to 100.***
