Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= `n` <= 1000), `a` is a list of `n` positive integers (1 <= `a[i]` <= 100), `current_cost` is the sum of costs calculated based on the values in `a` relative to `t`, `min_cost` and `best_t` remain unchanged, the loop has iterated through all elements of `a`, and the current value of `current_cost` is less than `min_cost`.***
