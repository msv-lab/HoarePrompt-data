The variable `min_cost` is assigned the value of `cost`. Since no new calculations or changes to `cost` are made, it holds the same value after this operation. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 <= a[i] <= 100), `sticks` is a sorted list of integers, `mid` is less than 100, `i` is mid + 3, `cost` is updated to the sum of min(abs(x - (mid + 3)), abs(x - (mid + 2))) for x in `sticks`, `min_cost` is equal to `cost`.**
