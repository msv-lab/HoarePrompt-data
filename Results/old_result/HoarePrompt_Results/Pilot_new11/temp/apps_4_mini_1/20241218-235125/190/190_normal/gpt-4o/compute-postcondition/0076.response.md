The value of `min_cost` is updated to be equal to `current_cost`. Given that the current value of `current_cost` is already less than `min_cost`, this means that `min_cost` will now be equal to `current_cost`. The variables `best_t` and `min_cost` remain unchanged in structure but reflect the new relationship. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= `n` <= 1000), `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `current_cost` is the cumulative cost based on the relationship of each element in `a` to `t`, `min_cost` is now equal to `current_cost`, and `best_t` is unchanged, with the condition that `current_cost` was previously less than `min_cost`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= `n` <= 1000), `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `current_cost` is the cumulative cost based on the relationship of each element in `a` to `t`, `min_cost` is equal to `current_cost`, `best_t` is unchanged.**
