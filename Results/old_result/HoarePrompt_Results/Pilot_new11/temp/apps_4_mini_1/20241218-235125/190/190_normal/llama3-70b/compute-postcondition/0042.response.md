Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 <= a[i] <= 100), `sticks` is a sorted list of integers, `mid` is less than 100, `i` is 101, `min_cost` is the minimum cost calculated over the range of i (from mid+1 to 100), `min_t` is the value of `i` that resulted in `min_cost`, and the output is `min_t, min_cost`.**
