The value of `min_cost` is updated to be equal to `current_cost`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Since `current_cost` is less than `min_cost`, after the assignment, `min_cost` takes the value of `current_cost`, and `min_cost` is no longer infinity.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where each integer `a[i]` satisfies 1 <= `a[i]` <= 100, `current_cost` is the total adjustment cost based on the differences between each element in `a` and `t`, which is 1, `min_cost` is equal to `current_cost`, and `best_t` remains -1.**
