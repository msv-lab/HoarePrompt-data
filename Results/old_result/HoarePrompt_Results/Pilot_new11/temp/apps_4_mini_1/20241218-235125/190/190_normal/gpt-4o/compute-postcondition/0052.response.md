`best_t` is assigned the value of `t`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `a`, `current_cost`, `min_cost`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= `n` <= 1000), `a` is a list of `n` positive integers (1 <= `a[i]` <= 100), `current_cost` is the sum of costs calculated based on the values in `a` relative to `t`, `min_cost` is equal to `current_cost`, and `best_t` is equal to `t`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= `n` <= 1000), `a` is a list of `n` positive integers (1 <= `a[i]` <= 100), `current_cost` is the sum of costs calculated based on the values in `a` relative to `t`, `min_cost` is equal to `current_cost`, `best_t` is equal to `t`.**
