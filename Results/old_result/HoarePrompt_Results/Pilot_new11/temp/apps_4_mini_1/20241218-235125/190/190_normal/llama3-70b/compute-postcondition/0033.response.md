Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 <= a[i] <= 100), `sticks` is a sorted list of integers, `mid` is less than 100, `i` is mid + 2, `cost` is updated to sum(min(abs(x - (mid + 2)), abs(x - (mid + 1))) for x in sticks), `min_cost` is equal to `cost`.**
