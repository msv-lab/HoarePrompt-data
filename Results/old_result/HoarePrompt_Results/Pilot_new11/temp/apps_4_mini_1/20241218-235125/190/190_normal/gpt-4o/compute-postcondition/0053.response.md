Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= `n` <= 1000), `a` is a list of `n` positive integers (1 <= `a[i]` <= 100), and `current_cost` is the sum of costs calculated based on the values in `a` relative to `t`. If `current_cost` is less than `min_cost`, then `min_cost` is updated to equal `current_cost`, and `best_t` is updated to equal `t`.***
