Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where each integer `a[i]` satisfies 1 <= `a[i]` <= 100. If the first element `length` of `a` is less than `t - 1`, then `current_cost` is updated to its previous value plus `-length`, where `t` is equal to 1, and the value of `length` is less than 0. Otherwise, if `length` is greater than 2, `current_cost` is updated to its previous value plus `length - 2`; if `length` is 2 or less, `current_cost` remains unchanged.***
