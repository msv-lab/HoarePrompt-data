Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where each integer `a[i]` satisfies 1 <= `a[i]` <= 100, if `current_cost` is less than `min_cost`, then `min_cost` is updated to `current_cost`, and `best_t` is updated to `t`. Otherwise, `min_cost` and `best_t` remain unchanged.***
