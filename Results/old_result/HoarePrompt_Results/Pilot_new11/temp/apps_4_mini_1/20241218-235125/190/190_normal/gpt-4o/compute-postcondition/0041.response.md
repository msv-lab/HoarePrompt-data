The value of `current_cost` is updated based on the calculation involving `length`, `t`, and constants from the initial state. The `length` is equal to `a[1]`, which is the second element of the list `a`. Thus, `current_cost` increases by the difference between `length` and `t + 1`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `a`, `min_cost`, `best_t`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= `n` <= 1000), `a` is a list of `n` positive integers (1 <= `a[i]` <= 100), `length` is equal to `a[1]`, `current_cost` is updated as `current_cost += length - (t + 1)`, `min_cost` is unchanged, `best_t` is unchanged.**
