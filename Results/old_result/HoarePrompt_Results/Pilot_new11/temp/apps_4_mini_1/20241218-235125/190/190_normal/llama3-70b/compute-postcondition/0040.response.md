Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 <= a[i] <= 100), `sticks` is a sorted list of integers, `mid` is less than 100, `i` is `mid + 3`, and `cost` is updated to the sum of min(abs(x - (mid + 3)), abs(x - (mid + 2))) for x in `sticks`. If `cost` is less than `min_cost`, then `min_cost` is updated to `cost`, and `min_t` is set to `mid + 3`. Otherwise, `min_cost` and `min_t` remain unchanged.***
