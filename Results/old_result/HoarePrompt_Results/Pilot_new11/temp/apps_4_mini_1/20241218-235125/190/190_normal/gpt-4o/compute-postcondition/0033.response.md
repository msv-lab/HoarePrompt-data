To determine the output state after executing the provided code, let's evaluate the impact step by step.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is a positive integer (1 <= `n` <= 1000)
   - `a` is a list of `n` positive integers (1 <= `a[i]` <= 100)
   - `current_cost` is 0
   - `min_cost` is unchanged
   - `best_t` is unchanged
   - `t` is 101
   - `length` is equal to the first element of the list `a` and `length` is less than 100.

2. We will now evaluate the executed code: 
   ```
   current_cost += t - 1 - length
   ```

3. **Calculating**:
   - Since `t` is 101, the expression `t - 1` evaluates to `100`.
   - Therefore, `current_cost += 100 - length`.

4. Since `length` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, let's denote the first element of the list `a` as `a[0]`. Thus, we can rewrite the equation as:
   - `current_cost += 100 - a[0]`

5. **Result Summary**:
   - The value of `current_cost` will be updated based on the relationship with `a[0]`.
   - Other variables (`n`, `a`, `min_cost`, `best_t`) remain unchanged.

Thus, the output state incorporates the modifications to `current_cost` while preserving the unchanged variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= `n` <= 1000), `a` is a list of `n` positive integers (1 <= `a[i]` <= 100), `current_cost` is equal to `0 + (100 - a[0])`, `min_cost` is unchanged, `best_t` is unchanged, `t` is 101, `length` is equal to the first element of the list `a`.**
