Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here is the explanation why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `sticks` from input. This matches the input requirements of the problem description.

2. **Sorting and Median Calculation**: The program sorts the stick lengths and calculates the median stick length (`mid`). The median is chosen because it minimizes the sum of absolute deviations, which aligns with the goal of minimizing the cost of transforming the sticks to a uniform length.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The program first calculates the cost when trying to set all stick lengths to the median `t = mid`. This establishes a baseline cost.
   - It then explores lengths below `mid` from `mid-1` down to `1` and calculates the cost for each of these values. This is done using the `min` function to ensure that either the length `i` or `i + 1` is considered, keeping the constraint `|a_i - t| â‰¤ 1`.
   - Subsequently, it checks lengths above `mid`, from `mid + 1` up to `100`, performing a similar cost calculation.

4. **Minimum Cost Tracking**: Throughout the process, the program keeps track of the minimum cost (`min_cost`) and the corresponding length (`min_t`) that yields this cost.

5. **Output**: Finally, the result is printed in the required format: the optimal length `min_t` and the associated minimum cost `min_cost`.

The program's approach correctly adheres to the problem requirements by thoroughly exploring the possible values of `t`, ensuring that all stick lengths can be adjusted to be 'almost good' with respect to `t` while keeping overall transformation costs to a minimum. 

Given the nature of the solution (evaluating costs by traversing both directions from the median), and the valid output guarantees from the problem statement, the program effectively meets the parameters outlined in the description and logically handles all cases specified.
