The line `current_cost += length - (t + 1)` will update the value of `current_cost` based on the existing values of `length` and `t`. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is 1
- `length` is the first element of `a`, which is a positive integer greater than or equal to `t - 1` (0)
- Since `length` is also greater than `t + 1` (2), it means `length` must be greater than 2.

The calculation will be as follows:
- Substitute `t` with 1: `t + 1` becomes `1 + 1 = 2`.
- Thus, `current_cost` will increase by `length - 2`.

Since `length > 2`, `length - 2` will always yield a positive value.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `a`, `min_cost`, `best_t`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where each integer `a[i]` satisfies 1 <= `a[i]` <= 100, `min_cost` is equal to infinity, `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1, `current_cost` is equal to its previous value plus `length - 2`, `length` is the first element of `a` greater than or equal to 2.**
