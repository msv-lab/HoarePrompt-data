Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= `n` <= 1000), `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `current_cost` is the cumulative cost based on the relationship of each element in `a` to `t`, `min_cost` is unchanged, `best_t` is unchanged, and the current value of `current_cost` is less than `min_cost`.***
