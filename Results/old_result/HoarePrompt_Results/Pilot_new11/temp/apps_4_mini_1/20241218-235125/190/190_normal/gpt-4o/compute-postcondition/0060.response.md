Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= `n` <= 1000), `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `current_cost` is 0, `min_cost` is unchanged, `best_t` is unchanged, `t` is 101, `length` is the first element of `a`, `length` is greater than or equal to 100, and the current value of `length` is greater than 102 (which means `length` is strictly greater than `t + 1`).***
