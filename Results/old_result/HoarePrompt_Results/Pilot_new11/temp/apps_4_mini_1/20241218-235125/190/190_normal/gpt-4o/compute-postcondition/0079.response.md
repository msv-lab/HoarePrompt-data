To analyze the state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to focus on how `min_cost` and `best_t` evolve throughout the complete range of possible values for `t`. The loop iterates through each possible `t` from 1 to 100, calculating the `current_cost` for each `t` based on the values in the list `a`.

1. **Loop Execution Overview**:
   - The outer loop runs 100 times (for `t` from 1 to 100).
   - For each value of `t`, the `current_cost` is calculated by comparing each length in the list `a` to `t - 1` and `t + 1`.
   - If `current_cost` is lower than the previously stored `min_cost`, `min_cost` is updated to `current_cost`, and `best_t` is updated to `t`.

2. **Final State Determination**:
   - After iterating over all `t` values, `min_cost` will contain the lowest cost computed when adjusting the lengths in `a`, and `best_t` will correspond to the `t` value that produced this minimum cost.
   - If the initial value of `min_cost` was infinity (the starting condition), and the loop executed at least once, `min_cost` will have been set based on the computed costs from the evaluations inside the inner loop, and `best_t` will reflect the `t` at which this minimum was achieved.

Given this analysis, we can determine the final output state after the loop has finished executing for all iterations:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where each integer `a[i]` satisfies 1 <= `a[i]` <= 100, `min_cost` is the minimum cost calculated based on the best `t`, `best_t` is the value of `t` that results in `min_cost`.**
