After executing the code `dp[j] += dp[j - 1]`, the variable `dp[j]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[j - 1]` to it. Since `j` is defined as `f_max_n - 1`, we need to keep in mind that `dp[j - 1]` corresponds to `dp[f_max_n - 2]`. The value of `dp[j - 1]` could be any integer based on the initial conditions given. As `j` is `f_max_n - 1`, we update `dp[j]` without changing the others. The exact numeric value of `dp[j]` and `dp[j - 1]` is not known, but we can keep the relationship. 

The output state thus reflects that `dp[j]` has been changed based on the addition with `dp[j - 1]`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^6 and must be greater than or equal to 3; `i` is 3; `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `j` is `f_max_n - 1`; `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] + dp[j - 1]`**.
