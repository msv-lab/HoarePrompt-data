The provided program calculates the maximum value of `f(p)` for permutations of integers 1 to n and counts how many permutations achieve that maximum value. 

The program includes a function `func_1` that computes the factorial of `(n-1)` modulo `10^9+7` for cases where `n` is greater than 2. The logic indicates that if `n` is 2, it directly returns 1, since the only permutation is `[1,2]`, which results in `f(p) = 1`.

For n = 3, the output hints suggest that there are 4 permutations where `f(p) = 2`. The computation performed by `func_1` for n = 3 results in `(3 - 1)!`, which is `2! = 2`. Therefore, the program should also capture the cases for n = 4, 5, etc., where the number of permutations matching `f(p) = f_max(n)` should continue being evaluated based on the factorial calculations.

However, after analyzing the code, it becomes clear that the program does not directly return correct results for various values due to its current conditions. Particularly for n > 2, it only calculates the factorial for `n - 1` rather than evaluating `n` directly, which can produce incorrect outputs for larger `n`.

In particular, the incorrect outputs can arise from the lack of reasoning for how `f(p)` maximally behaves with different permutations beyond n=3. This indicates that while it may yield correct outputs for smaller values, the generalized computation for n values greater than 3 is flawed, missing the essence of how `f(p)` can indeed reach values reliant on certain sequences, thus violating the problem's requirement on permutations.

For instance:
- For n = 4, the output `3!` seems insufficient to represent the number of distinct permutations.
  
Thus, there's a failure in identifying the how they should relate back to `f_max(n)`.

Therefore, considering the reasons above:

Correctness: **False**.
