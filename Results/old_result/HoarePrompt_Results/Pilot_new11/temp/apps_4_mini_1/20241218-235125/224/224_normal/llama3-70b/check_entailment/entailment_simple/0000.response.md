To determine if the provided program is correct according to the problem description, we must analyze both the problem requirements and the logic implemented in the program.

### Problem Requirements Review:

1. **Function \( f(p) \)**: Define \( f(p) \) based on the GCD of the prefix of the permutation.
2. **Calculate \( f_{max}(n) \)**: Find the maximum value of \( f(p) \) among all permutations of length \( n \).
3. **Count Permutations with \( f(p) = f_{max}(n) \)**: Compute how many permutations have the property \( f(p) = f_{max}(n) \).
4. **Output**: Print the result modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

### Program Analysis:

1. **Function Definitions**:
   - **`func_1(a, b)`** computes the GCD of two numbers. This is correct as per the Euclidean algorithm.
   - **`func_2(n)`** computes a maximum GCD over prefixes: It initializes `res` as 0 and updates it using the maximum GCD of {0, 1, 2, ..., n}. However, this only gives the maximum GCD value, and it does not directly relate to permutations.
   - **`func_3(n, f_max_n)`** seems to be dynamically calculating ways to construct certain sums or counts. It initializes `dp` for combinatorial counting but does not seem to directly count permutations according to \( f(p) = f_{max}(n) \).

### Logical Issues:

1. **Missing Direct Calculation**: The program does not directly calculate \( f(p) \) for all permutations. It primarily focuses on finding the maximum GCD but does not track which permutations achieve that maximum or how many.
2. **Permutations Counting**: There is no specific mechanism to generate or count permutations and check whether they yield \( f(p) = f_{max}(n) \).
3. **Output Validity**: The third function does not guarantee a return value aligning with the problem's requirement of counting specific permutations.

### Example Failures:
For instance, with \( n = 2 \):
- Permutations are [1,2] and [2,1]. Here, only [2,1] gives \( f(p) = 1 \). The maximum \( f_{max}(2) = 1 \) should thus yield 1 permissible permutation. The program, however, will not necessarily affirm this without the proper counting logic for permutations achieving the maximum.

### Conclusion:
The logic presented in the program does not correctly solve the problem as stated, because it does not fully capture the requirements to count the permutations that yield the maximum \( f(p) \). The incorrect handling of the computation of permutations leads me to conclude that the program fails to meet the problem's specifications.

Thus, based on the analysis:

Correctness: **False**
