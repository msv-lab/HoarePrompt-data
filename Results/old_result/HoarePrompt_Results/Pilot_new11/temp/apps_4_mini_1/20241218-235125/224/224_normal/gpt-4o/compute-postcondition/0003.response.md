According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the boundary defined by `n`. The loop is set to iterate from `i = 2` to `i = n`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, leading to `i = 3`. The loop can continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 3.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^6, `mod` is 1000000007, `result` is 2, `i` is 3**
