According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `f_max_n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `f_max_n - 1`. For the loop to be executed one more time, `j` will be decremented by 1 in the next iteration, resulting in `j` being equal to `f_max_n - 1 - 1`, which simplifies to `f_max_n - 2`. 

To ensure that the loop can execute again, `f_max_n` must be at least 2 because when `j` becomes 0 (which means it would stop executing), `f_max_n` needs to be greater than or equal to 1. Additionally, since `j` starts at `f_max_n - 1`, we need `j` to be at least 1 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time:
- `j` will be `f_max_n - 2`
- `f_max_n` must be at least 2, which ensures `j` is greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `i` is 2, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `j` is `f_max_n - 2`, and `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] % MOD`.**
