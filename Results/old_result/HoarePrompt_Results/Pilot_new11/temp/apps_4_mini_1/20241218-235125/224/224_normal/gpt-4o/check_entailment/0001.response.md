To determine the correctness of the provided program, I will analyze the logic against the problem description and test potential edge cases.

The function `f(p)` calculates the number of distinct values among the GCDs of prefixes of a permutation `p` of integers from `1` to `n`. The goal is to compute the maximum value of `f(p)` across all valid permutations and then count how many permutations yield that maximum value.

### Review of the Program:

1. The program defines a constant `MOD` as `10 ** 9 + 7`.
2. It checks if `n` is equal to `2`, in which case it returns `1` immediately.
3. For all other values of `n`, it calculates `func_1(n - 1, MOD)`.
4. The function `func_1` computes the factorial of `n` but starts from `2` to `n`, multiplying iteratively and taking modulus with `MOD`.

### Analysis Against the Problem Statement:
- The problem states that we need to determine how many permutations exist such that `f(p)` equals `f_max(n)`, the maximum distinct prefix GCD count across all permutations.
- The code correctly handles the case for `n = 2`, returning `1`, which follows the expected output for that input.
- It appears to compute `(n-1)!`, and does not take into account other actual values of `f(p)`. 

### Key Points to Consider:
1. The maximum value of `f(p)` is not always `n-1` but depends on the arrangement of the numbers and their GCDs.
2. The calculation of only `(n-1)!` does not correctly reflect the problem requirement of counting permutations that yield `f(p) = f_max(n)`. 
3. The example outputs provided do not correlate with just computing the factorial of `n-1`.

### Potential Edge Case:
Let's consider `n = 4`:
- For permutations of `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, we anticipate multiple configurations and differently computed `f(p)` values.
- The expected `f_max(4)` is not simply `(4-1)! = 6`; there are specific arrangements that give maximum distinct GCD values, but the program will count incorrectly if it continues to halt at just computing `(n-1)!`.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not gather or compute the correct number of permutations that satisfy the criteria of the problem, it fails in this regard. Hence, for certain values (like `3`, and especially for `4`, and further), it won't yield the expected outputs of permutations.

Therefore, given that the program does not adhere to the problem requirements in all cases:

Correctness: **False**
