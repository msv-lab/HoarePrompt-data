To analyze the final output state of the loop, we consider its structure and the initial conditions provided.

The loop iterates downwards from `f_max_n` to 1. The loop executes `f_max_n` times if `f_max_n` is greater than or equal to 1.

Here's what happens during the iterations:
- For each iteration with a current index `j`, `dp[j]` is updated to hold the sum of its current value and `dp[j - 1]`, then taken modulo `MOD`.
- Given that `j` starts from `f_max_n` and decrements to 1, all `dp` values from `1` to `f_max_n` are updated in this process.
- `dp[0]` is also updated based on the loop's structure.

After the loop completes, the following relationships hold:
- If the loop executes `f_max_n` times, the values of `dp[1]` to `dp[f_max_n]` will all contain accumulated values based on their previous states and the relationships defined in the loop.
- Specifically, `dp[j]` will be equal to the sum of the previous values from `dp[j - 1]` up to `dp[0]`, but we need to state the relationship more generically here.
- If `f_max_n < 1`, the loop will not execute, and `dp` remains unchanged.

Considering the potential for zero iterations if `f_max_n` is less than or equal to 0, we incorporate those cases into our final output state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `i` is 1, if `f_max_n` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp[j]` for `j` in range from 1 to `f_max_n` contains the sums as defined in the loop; if `f_max_n` is 0, `dp` remains unchanged.**
