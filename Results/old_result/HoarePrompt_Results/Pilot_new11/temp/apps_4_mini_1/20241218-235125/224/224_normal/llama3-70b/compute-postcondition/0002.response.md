The code assigns the value `1` to `dp[0]`, which is the first element of the `dp` list. The length of the `dp` list is `f_max_n + 1`, and initially, all elements were initialized to `0`. The preconditions regarding `n`, `f_max_n`, and `MOD` remain unchanged because they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state will be:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6; `f_max_n` is a non-negative integer such that f_max_n <= n; `MOD` is 1000000007; `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 1`, where `dp[0]` is 1 and all other elements remain 0.**
