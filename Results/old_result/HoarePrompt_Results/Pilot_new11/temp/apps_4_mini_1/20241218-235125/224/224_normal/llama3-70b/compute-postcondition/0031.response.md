The operation modifies `dp[j]` by performing a modulo operation with `MOD`. While `dp[j]` is updated from its previous value to `dp[j] % MOD`, the values of other variables remain unaffected. The output state retains the previously defined ranges and relationships among the variables but reflects the updated value of `dp[j]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^6 and must be greater than or equal to 3; `i` is 3; `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `j` is `f_max_n - 1`; `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] % MOD`.**
