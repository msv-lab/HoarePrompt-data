You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Let's define a function $f(p)$ on a permutation $p$ as follows. Let $g_i$ be the greatest common divisor (GCD) of elements $p_1$, $p_2$, ..., $p_i$ (in other words, it is the GCD of the prefix of length $i$). Then $f(p)$ is the number of distinct elements among $g_1$, $g_2$, ..., $g_n$.

Let $f_{max}(n)$ be the maximum value of $f(p)$ among all permutations $p$ of integers $1$, $2$, ..., $n$.

Given an integers $n$, count the number of permutations $p$ of integers $1$, $2$, ..., $n$, such that $f(p)$ is equal to $f_{max}(n)$. Since the answer may be large, print the remainder of its division by $1000\,000\,007 = 10^9 + 7$.


-----Input-----

The only line contains the integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^6$) — the length of the permutations.


-----Output-----

The only line should contain your answer modulo $10^9+7$.

-----Note-----

Consider the second example: these are the permutations of length $3$:  $[1,2,3]$, $f(p)=1$.  $[1,3,2]$, $f(p)=1$.  $[2,1,3]$, $f(p)=2$.  $[2,3,1]$, $f(p)=2$.  $[3,1,2]$, $f(p)=2$.  $[3,2,1]$, $f(p)=2$. 

The maximum value $f_{max}(3) = 2$, and there are $4$ permutations $p$ such that $f(p)=2$.
Functions with output description for each function:
n = int(input())
f_max_n = func_2(n)
print(func_3(n, f_max_n))

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, and computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. After executing the function, it guarantees that `b` will be 0, and `a` will hold the value of the GCD (or remain unchanged if `b` was initially 0). There are no additional checks or handling for cases where `a` or `b` is negative, but it is assumed from the comments that they are non-negative. The result returned is the GCD of the inputs, accurately reflecting the state post-execution of the function.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(n):
    res = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        res = max(res, func_1(res, i))
    return res
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts an integer parameter `n` (where 2 <= n <= 10^6) and computes a maximum value by iterating through all integers from 1 to `n`, applying the function `func_1` with a cumulative maximum value and the current integer. It returns the maximum result obtained from these computations. The function does not handle cases where `n` is less than 2, nor does it define the behavior of `func_1`, which may impact the final results. After execution, the final state of the program includes the returned maximum value generated by evaluating `func_1` across the defined range.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3(n, f_max_n):
    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
    dp = [0] * (f_max_n + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(f_max_n, 0, -1):
            dp[j] += dp[j - 1]
            dp[j] %= MOD
    return dp[f_max_n]
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer (with the constraint 2 <= n <= 10^6), and `f_max_n`, a non-negative integer (with the constraint f_max_n <= n). It calculates and returns the number of ways to select sums of exactly `f_max_n` using integers from 1 to `n`. 

If `f_max_n` is greater than or equal to 1, the function returns `dp[f_max_n]`, which is the total number of combinations of choosing numbers that sum to `f_max_n`. If `f_max_n` is 0, the function returns 1, representing the single way to form the sum of 0 (by selecting no numbers). The function maintains the invariant that the computed number of ways to form sums is stored in the list `dp`, indexed by possible sums from 0 to `f_max_n`.

The function’s logic ensures that valid inputs result in correctly calculated outputs, and it correctly handles two specific edge cases: when `f_max_n` is 0, returning 1, and when `f_max_n` is 1 or more, returning the calculated number of combinations. No missing functionality is identified that would impact the expected behavior as described in the annotations.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
