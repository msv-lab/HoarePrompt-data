According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit defined by `n`. The loop will iterate so long as `i` is less than or equal to `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and since `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^6\), it can be confirmed that `i` can increment by 1 for the next iteration. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be 4. The condition states that `n` must be at least 3 (which it is), so `n` must therefore be at least 4 for the loop to continue executing, allowing `i` to increment to 4.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 10^6, `mod` is 1000000007, `result` is 6, `i` is 4**
