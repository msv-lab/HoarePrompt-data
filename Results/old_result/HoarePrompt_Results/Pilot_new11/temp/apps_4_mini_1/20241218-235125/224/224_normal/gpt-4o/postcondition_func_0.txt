The function `func_1` calculates the factorial of an integer `n` (where `2 <= n <= 10^6`) modulo a given modulus value `mod` (defaulting to `1000000007`). It performs a multiplication of integers from `2` to `n`, while continuously taking the modulo to prevent overflow and ensure the result remains within a manageable range. After the calculation, the function returns the value of `n! % mod`. However, the function does not explicitly handle cases where `n` is less than `2`, nor does it validate the modulus value, which could be a potential edge case. It's also important to note that the function assumes `mod` will always have a reasonable value to avoid division by zero or negative modulus issues.
