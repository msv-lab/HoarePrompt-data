The operation `dp[j] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[j]` to be the remainder when the current value of `dp[j]` is divided by `MOD`. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Since `j` is equal to `f_max_n - 1`, the value of `dp[j]` is updated, but without the specific values of `dp[j]` and `MOD`, it is not possible to provide a numerical result. However, we can state that `dp[j]` now holds the value of `dp[j]` modulo `MOD`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `i` is 2, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `f_max_n - 1`, and `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] % MOD`.**
