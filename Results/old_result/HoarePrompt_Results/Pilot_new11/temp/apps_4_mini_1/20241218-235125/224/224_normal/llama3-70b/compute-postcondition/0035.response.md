To analyze the variables after all iterations of the loop have completed, we must first understand what the loop is doing with the provided initial conditions and constraints. 

The loop iterates from `f_max_n` down to `1`, updating the values in the `dp` array at each iteration. 

Given the provided information:

- Initial State: `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^6 and must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3.
- The loop will run `f_max_n` times as it counts down from `f_max_n` to `1`.

Now considering the output states after several iterations, we need to establish the values in `dp` as well as the relationship among remaining variables as the loop completes:

1. After the loop executes `f_max_n` times, `j` will have reached `0` (since it starts at `f_max_n` and counts down to `1`).

2. The updates in `dp` during the iterations suggest that `dp[j]` is influenced by all previous values of `dp` (specifically `dp[j-1]`), and at the end of the iterations, every `dp[j]` will have been updated accordingly.

3. Therefore, it will ultimately depend on the `dp` values accumulated during all those iterations for `j` from `f_max_n` down to 1.

Now compiling this to define the output state:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^6 and must be greater than or equal to 3; `i` is 3; `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to `1`; `j` is `0`; `dp` has been updated for each index from `1` to `f_max_n`, with each `dp[j]` being the accumulated sum of the previous `dp[j-1]` values and wrapped with MOD at each iteration.**
