The variable `dp[j]` is updated by taking the current value of `dp[j]` and applying the modulo operation with `MOD`. The value of `j` is equal to `f_max_n`, and `dp` is an array indexed by `j`. The precise previous values of `dp[j]` or `MOD` are not specified, but we know that `dp[j]` will be modified.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `i` is 2, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `f_max_n`, and `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] + dp[j - 1]`, followed by `dp[j]` being taken modulo `MOD`.**
