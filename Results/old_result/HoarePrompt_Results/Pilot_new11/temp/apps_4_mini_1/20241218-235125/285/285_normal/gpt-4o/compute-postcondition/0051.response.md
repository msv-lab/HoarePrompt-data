Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n - a * house_cost` for the last value of `a` calculated; `remaining_after_cars` is less than `car_cost` for the last value of `b` calculated, indicating that after maximizing the number of cars that can be bought, the remaining amount is not sufficient to buy even a single computer. If 'YES' was not returned during execution, it means that for all combinations of `a` (houses) and `b` (cars) checked, the remaining after cars was never divisible by `computer_cost`.**
