The value of `remaining_after_cars` is updated to be `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`. The previous values of the affected variables are: `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n`, and `b` is used in the calculation. Hence, we can express `remaining_after_cars` as `n - b * car_cost`. The states of the other variables are not affected, so the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1234567; `car_cost` is greater than 0; `a` is 0; `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n`; `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `n - b * car_cost`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1234567; `car_cost` is greater than 0; `a` is 0; `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n`; `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `n - b * car_cost`.**
