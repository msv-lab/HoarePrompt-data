Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `house_cost`, `remaining_after_houses` is greater than or equal to 0, `b` is equal to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`, `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `remaining_after_houses - (remaining_after_houses // car_cost) * car_cost`, and either `remaining_after_cars` is divisible by `computer_cost` (in which case 'YES' would have been returned during the loop execution) or `remaining_after_cars` is not divisible by `computer_cost`.**
