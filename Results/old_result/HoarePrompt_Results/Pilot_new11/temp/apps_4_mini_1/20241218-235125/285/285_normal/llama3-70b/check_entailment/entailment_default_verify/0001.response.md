Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the program correctly implements the logic required to determine if Kolya can spend exactly `n` game-coins on houses, cars, and computers. 

Based on the problem description and the output hints, the following points confirm the correctness:

1. **Correct Iteration**: The program iterates through all non-negative integer combinations of houses (`a`), cars (`b`), and calculates the computers (`c`) that could be bought after those purchases.

2. **Calculation Logic**: The checks made ensure that the total cost calculated from the number of houses, cars, and computers equals `n`.

3. **Exhaustive Search**: Since the program uses nested loops constrained by `n`, it guarantees that all combinations of spending are checked. As such, it can be concluded whether a valid combination exists or not.

4. **Output Consistency**: The output hints affirm the function's behavior, where it correctly prints "YES" if a combination exists and "NO" otherwise, in alignment with the problem requirements.

Considering these points, the program is deemed correct, and the original assessment of its correctness stands validated. Thus, the final conclusion is that the program meets the problem description's requirements.
