To verify the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the function `func_1(n)` and consider potential edge cases that may not be handled correctly.

The function aims to determine if it's possible to express a given integer `n` as a sum of non-negative integer multiples of the costs of houses (1,234,567 coins), cars (123,456 coins), and computers (1,234 coins). The function iterates through all possibilities of how many houses can be bought (denoted by `a`), then within that loop, it iterates through possibilities of how many cars can be bought (denoted by `b`), and finally checks if the remaining coins can be completely spent on computers.

Key considerations:

1. **Large Input Values:** We must check whether the function correctly handles the maximum input value of `n`, which is \(10^9\). 

2. **Combinations of Purchases:** We should also consider if the algorithm will correctly identify when there are valid combinations of purchases that sum exactly to `n`.

3. **Edge Cases:** These include very small values of `n`, such as 1, 2, or 1233, which should return 'NO' as they cannot be formed with the given costs.

### Potential Case that Negates Correctness:

If `n = 1233`:
- The optimal approach to understand the output for this value is that:
    - The only item available for purchase is the computer, which costs 1,234 coins.
    - Since 1,233 is less than 1,234, there is no way to buy even one computer. 
- The function should correctly return 'NO' in this case.

Since this case exists where the change of `n` does not lead to the expected results described in the initial problem statement, and the program fails to correctly identify that `n=1233` cannot be formed with the given costs, bad implementation of boundary values indicates that:

Correctness: **False**. 

The function fails to produce the correct output for at least one valid case (n=1233).
