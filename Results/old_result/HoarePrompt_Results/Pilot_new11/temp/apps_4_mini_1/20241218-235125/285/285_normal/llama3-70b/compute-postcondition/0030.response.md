Postcondition: ***If `a` is 1, `b` is 1, and `c` is calculated as `(n - 1358023) // 1234` to satisfy the equation `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234 == n`, the program exits. Since `n` is at least 1234567 and meets the initial conditions, the condition is satisfied. There is no else part in the code.***
