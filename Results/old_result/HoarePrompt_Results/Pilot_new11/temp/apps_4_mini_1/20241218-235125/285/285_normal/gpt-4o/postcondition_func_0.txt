The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` representing a budget and evaluates whether it is possible to allocate this budget to purchase a specific number of houses, cars, and computers based on their fixed costs: `house_cost`, `car_cost`, and `computer_cost`. It loops through all possible quantities of houses (`a`) and checks for the maximum possible quantity of cars (`b`) that can be bought with the remaining budget. After maximizing car purchases, it checks if the leftover amount is divisible by `computer_cost`. If at least one valid combination is found, the function returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO'. Its final state indicates whether the budget allows for buying these items under given constraints. Notably, the function primarily determines divisibility involving `computer_cost` after attempting to purchase the other two items, and it does not consider situations where the budget is less than the cost of a house or car, which could be edge cases to address.
