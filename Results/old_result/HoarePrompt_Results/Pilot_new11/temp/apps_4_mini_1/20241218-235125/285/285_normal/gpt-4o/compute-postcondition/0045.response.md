Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to `house_cost * (previous a + 1)`; `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n - a * house_cost`, which is greater than or equal to 0; `b` is now 1; `car_cost` is greater than 0; `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `remaining_after_houses - car_cost`, and `remaining_after_cars` is not divisible by `computer_cost`. If `remaining_after_cars` is divisible by `computer_cost`, the program returns 'YES'.***
