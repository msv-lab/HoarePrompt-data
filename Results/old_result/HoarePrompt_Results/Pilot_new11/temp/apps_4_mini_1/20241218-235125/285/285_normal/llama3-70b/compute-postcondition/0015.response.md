The code provided simply prints 'YES' to the output. There are no changes made to the variables in the initial state as a result of the print statement. The values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and is at least 246912; `a` is 0; `b` is 2; `c` is equal to `(n - 246912) // 1234` and 'YES' has been printed.**
