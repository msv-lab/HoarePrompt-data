Final: **True**

The original assessment of the program's correctness remains accurate. The program correctly implements the logic required to determine if Kolya can spend his initial game-coin score `n` on houses, cars, and computers, complying with the problem description. 

The annotations provided describe the state of the program effectively at key points: 

1. At the start of the function, the program correctly defines the costs of houses, cars, and computers.
2. The loops iterate over possible purchases of houses (`a`) and cars (`b`), ensuring that all combinations within the budget are explored.
3. The condition checking whether the remaining coins after purchasing houses and cars can perfectly cover the cost of computers validates the program's logic.
4. The program's final return statement indicates that if no suitable combination of purchases is found, it will return 'NO', consistent with the expectations set by the problem statement.

Overall, the program performs as specified in the problem description, and the annotations support the correctness of its logic and behavior. Therefore, the conclusion is maintained as **True**.
