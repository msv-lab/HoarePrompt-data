According to the code, the loop execution depends on the expression calculated for the range, which is `(n - a * 1234567) // 123456 + 1`. 

1. Firstly, since `n` is a positive integer and `a` is initialized to 0, we can evaluate the range:
   - With `a = 0`, the expression simplifies to `(n - 0 * 1234567) // 123456 + 1`, which becomes `(n // 123456) + 1`.
   
2. To ensure that the for loop executes at least once, the calculated range needs to be greater than 0. This means:
   - `(n // 123456) + 1 > 0`, which will always be true for any positive `n` since `n // 123456` will be 0 or greater. 
   - Specifically, for `n` to ensure at least one iteration, it must be at least 123456 to make `(n // 123456)` at least 1 (but technically, for any positive `n`, it will still execute).

3. At the start of the iteration, `b` will be initialized to 0 on the first iteration of the loop.

Overall, the states can be summarized as:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is 0, `b` is 0**
