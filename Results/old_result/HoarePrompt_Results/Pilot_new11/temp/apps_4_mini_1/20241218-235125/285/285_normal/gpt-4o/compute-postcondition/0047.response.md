The variable `remaining_after_cars` is assigned the value of `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`. We know that `b` is currently 2 and `car_cost` is greater than 0. This means that `remaining_after_cars` will be less than `remaining_after_houses` by an amount of `2 * car_cost`. The other variables' states remain unchanged.

Let's summarize the variables:
- `n` is greater than or equal to `house_cost * (previous a + 1)`.
- `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n - a * house_cost` (which is greater than or equal to `2 * car_cost`).
- `b` is now 2.
- `car_cost` is greater than 0.
- `remaining_after_cars` is now equal to `remaining_after_houses - 2 * car_cost`.
- `remaining_after_cars` is not divisible by `computer_cost`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `house_cost * (previous a + 1)`; `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n - a * house_cost`; `b` is now 2; `car_cost` is greater than 0; `remaining_after_cars` is now equal to `remaining_after_houses - 2 * car_cost`, and `remaining_after_cars` is not divisible by `computer_cost`.**
