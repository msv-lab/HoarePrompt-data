The code executes a `print` statement which outputs the string `'YES'`. It does not modify any of the variables `n`, `a`, `b`, or `c`. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and must be at least 123456; `a` is 0; `b` is 1; `c` is equal to `(n - 123456) // 1234`; 'YES' has been printed.**
