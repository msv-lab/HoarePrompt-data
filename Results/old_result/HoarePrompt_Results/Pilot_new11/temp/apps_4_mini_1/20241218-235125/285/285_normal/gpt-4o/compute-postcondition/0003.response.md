To determine the conditions needed for the `for` loop to execute, we analyze the loop statement.

The loop iterates over the range calculated as `n // house_cost + 1`. 

1. The calculation `n // house_cost` calculates how many times `house_cost` fits into `n` as an integer division.
2. For the loop to be entered, the range must be non-zero, which implies:
   - The expression `n // house_cost` must return at least 0. 
   - Since `n` is a positive integer and `house_cost` is also positive (1234567), `n // house_cost` will return at least 0 if `n` is greater than or equal to `house_cost`. 
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that this value is at least 0, meaning `n` must be sufficiently large.

Now, let's summarize the states that must be satisfied before the loop:

- The variable `a` can be initialized to 0 which will represent the starting point of the loop.
- The variable `n` needs to accommodate the minimum condition; in this case, it is indicated that `n` must be positive and at least as large as `house_cost`.
  
Thus, the minimal state adjustments we can derive are:

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to `house_cost` (1234567), `a` is 0**
