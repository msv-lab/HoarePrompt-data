The code `exit()` terminates the program execution without altering any variable states. The values of `a`, `b`, `n`, and `c` remain unchanged. The statement that 'YES' is printed is not modified in any way by the `exit()` command, but since the program is terminating, it implies that this statement has been executed prior to the termination. Therefore, the Output State reflects that the program exits without further changes to the variable states.

Output State: **`a` is 1, `b` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1350023, `c` is equal to `(n - 1481479) // 1234, and 'YES' has been printed.**
