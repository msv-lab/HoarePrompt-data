Final: **True**

The original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate. The program correctly implements the required logic to determine if Kolya can spend his initial game-coin score `n` solely on houses, cars, and computers based on their respective costs. 

The annotated version of the code reinforces this assessment by clearly delineating the program's operational states and logic flow. Specifically, the following points support the conclusion:

1. **Initialization**: The input is guaranteed to be a positive integer within the specified range, thus aligning with the problem constraints.

2. **Loop Structure**: The nested loops correctly iterate through all possible combinations of houses (`a`) and cars (`b`). This comprehensive exploration ensures all potential allocations of the budget are considered.

3. **Divisibility Check**: The check for divisibility of the remaining balance by the cost of computers accurately captures whether it is possible to spend exactly `n` game-coins. The annotations confirm that the function properly returns 'YES' upon finding a valid combination, or 'NO' if no suitable allocation exists after exhaustive checks.

4. **Understanding of States**: The annotations clarify the program state at critical junctures, effectively explaining the logic behind the loops and checks. They further reinforce that the function's design addresses the problem as described.

Since the program functions as needed according to the problem description and the annotations provide further clarity and evidence of correctness throughout various states of the program, the final assessment is reaffirmed as **True**.
