Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to `house_cost`, `remaining_after_houses` is greater than or equal to `car_cost`, `b` is 2, `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `remaining_after_houses - 2 * car_cost`, and `remaining_after_cars` is not divisible by `computer_cost`. If `remaining_after_cars` is divisible by `computer_cost`, the program returns 'YES', indicating that the conditions have been satisfied.***
