You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Kolya is developing an economy simulator game. His most favourite part of the development process is in-game testing. Once he was entertained by the testing so much, that he found out his game-coin score become equal to 0.

Kolya remembers that at the beginning of the game his game-coin score was equal to n and that he have bought only some houses (for 1 234 567 game-coins each), cars (for 123 456 game-coins each) and computers (for 1 234 game-coins each).

Kolya is now interested, whether he could have spent all of his initial n game-coins buying only houses, cars and computers or there is a bug in the game. Formally, is there a triple of non-negative integers a, b and c such that a × 1 234 567 + b × 123 456 + c × 1 234 = n?

Please help Kolya answer this question.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) — Kolya's initial game-coin score.


-----Output-----

Print "YES" (without quotes) if it's possible that Kolya spent all of his initial n coins buying only houses, cars and computers. Otherwise print "NO" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
1359257

Output
YES
Input
17851817

Output
NO


-----Note-----

In the first sample, one of the possible solutions is to buy one house, one car and one computer, spending 1 234 567 + 123 456 + 1234 = 1 359 257 game-coins in total.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for a in range(n // 1234567 + 1):
        for b in range((n - a * 1234567) // 123456 + 1):
            c = (n - a * 1234567 - b * 123456) // 1234
            if a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234 == n:
                print('YES')
                exit()
    print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program checks if it is possible for Kolya to spend exactly `n` game-coins using a combination of houses, cars, and computers. Here’s the reasoning for the correctness of the provided code:

1. **Iterate through possible numbers of houses (`a`)**: The outer loop iterates `a` from `0` to `n // 1234567`, which represents the maximum number of houses he could afford without exceeding `n`.

2. **Iterate through possible numbers of cars (`b`)**: For each value of `a`, the inner loop calculates possible values for `b` based on the remaining coins after buying `a` houses. It iterates `b` from `0` to `(n - a * 1234567) // 123456`.

3. **Calculate the number of computers (`c`)**: After determining how many houses and cars were bought, the program calculates the remaining coins and computes how many computers can be purchased with that remaining amount. The calculation uses integer division, which is appropriate since `c` must be a whole number.

4. **Check for equality**: It validates if the total spent (calculated using `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234`) equals `n`. If it does, it prints `"YES"` and exits.

5. **Conclude with "NO"**: If no valid combination is found after exhausting all possibilities within the loops, it concludes with printing `"NO"`.

The loops and checks perform exhaustive search through possible combinations of spending. Given the constraints of the problem and the ranges of values involved, the program correctly identifies if the exact amount `n` can be achieved with the combinations of houses, cars, and computers.

I could not find any edge case or potential input that would lead the program to produce an incorrect result based on the logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the conclusion is that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for a in range(n // 1234567 + 1):
        for b in range((n - a * 1234567) // 123456 + 1):
            c = (n - a * 1234567 - b * 123456) // 1234
            if a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234 == n:
                print('YES')
                exit()
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is at most `n // 1234567`, `b` is at most `(n - a * 1234567) // 123456`, `c` is a non-negative integer determined by the loop conditions, and if the loop executes completely without finding a valid combination, `n` is not expressible in the form `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234` for any non-negative integers.
    print('NO')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a positive integer `n` from user input and attempts to determine if it can be expressed as a linear combination of the specific values 1234567, 123456, and 1234 using non-negative integer coefficients. It iterates over possible values for these coefficients (denoted as `a`, `b`, and `c`) and checks if such a combination exists. If a valid combination is found, it prints 'YES' and exits the function. If the function iterates through all possible combinations without finding a match, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value; its result is indicated solely through printed output. Therefore, the key postconditions are that if 'YES' is printed, `n` can be represented in the specified form; otherwise, if 'NO' is printed, `n` cannot be represented as such. Edge cases include the minimal possible value for `n` (which is 1) and larger values up to 10^9, where the performance of the loops must be considered.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
