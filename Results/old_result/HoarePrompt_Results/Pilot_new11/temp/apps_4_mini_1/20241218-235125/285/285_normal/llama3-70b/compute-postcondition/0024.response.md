The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the execution of the program immediately. The values of variables `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged, and there are no variables being updated, changed, or returned. Thus, the output state must reflect that execution has stopped without changes to the inputs or outputs.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1234567, `a` is 1, `b` is 0, `c` is (n - 1234567) // 1234, and the equation (1 * 1234567 + 0 * 123456 + c * 1234 == n) holds true, execution has terminated.**
