The value of `n` is reassigned to `int(input())`, where `input()` accepts an input that is required to be a positive integer within the bounds of 1 to 100. The previous value of `n` may have been a positive integer satisfying the same conditions, but now it will take the input value. The other variable `a` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -100 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100, and `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`.**
