The value of `b` is incremented by the current value of `a[i]`. Here, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers in descending order, and since `i` is less than `n`, the value `a[i]` is valid. The values of `n`, `c`, and `i` remain unchanged, but `b` is updated according to the value of `a[i]`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers in descending order satisfying -100 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 100; `b` is updated to `b + a[i]`; `c` remains 0; `i` is less than `n` so the next value for `i` will be `i + 1`.**
