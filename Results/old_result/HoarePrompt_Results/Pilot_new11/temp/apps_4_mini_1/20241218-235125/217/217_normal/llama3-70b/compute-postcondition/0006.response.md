The value of `b` is updated by adding the value of `a[i]` to it. Since `i` is even, we can conclude that the new value of `b` will be `b + a[i]`. The other variables, `n`, `a`, `c`, and `i`, remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers in descending order satisfying -100 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100, `b` is equal to `b + a[i]`, `c` is 0, `i` is still even (with its unchanged value).**
