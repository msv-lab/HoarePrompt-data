Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers in descending order satisfying -100 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 100. If `i` is even, `b` is updated to `b + a[i]`, `c` remains 0, and `i` is less than `n` so the next value for `i` will be `i + 1`. Otherwise, `b` is updated depending on the parity of `i`, `c` is updated to `c + a[i]`, and `i` must be less than `n`, with the next value for `i` being `i + 1.***
