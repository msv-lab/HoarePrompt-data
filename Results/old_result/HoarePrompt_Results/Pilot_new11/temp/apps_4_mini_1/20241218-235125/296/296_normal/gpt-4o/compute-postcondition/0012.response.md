The code appends the value of `i` to the list `divisors`. The initial conditions state that `n` is a positive integer within certain bounds and `i` is defined as `k + 1`. Additionally, `divisors` is assumed to be a list that can contain integers.

We need to consider that:
1. `i` has a specific value `k + 1`, and it is being appended to `divisors`.
2. The condition for divisors to include `i` depends on whether the current conditions hold true at the time of execution (i.e., if `n` is divisible by `i`).

Since the specific bounds of `n` and `i` are already established, and since the values of `n` and `k` do not change, we can conclude that after executing the code, the state of the variables will be:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that (k + 1)Â² <= `n` <= 10^9 and greater than 2; `i` is k + 1; `divisors` now includes `i`.**
