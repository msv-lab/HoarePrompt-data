The code creates a list `fractions` which consists of tuples. Each tuple is formed by pairing the integer `1` with each divisor in the `divisors` list. The length of `divisors`, which is `k`, remains unchanged since it is only used to describe the size of the `divisors` list and is not modified by the code.

Given that `divisors` is a non-empty list of integers greater than or equal to 2, the resulting `fractions` list will contain tuples of `(1, d)` where `d` represents each integer in the `divisors` list.

The output state reflects these changes.

Output State: **`divisors` contains all divisors of `n` except for `n` itself and is a non-empty list of integers greater than or equal to 2; `k` is a positive integer equal to the length of `divisors`; `fractions` is a list of tuples where each tuple is (1, d) for each d in `divisors`.**
