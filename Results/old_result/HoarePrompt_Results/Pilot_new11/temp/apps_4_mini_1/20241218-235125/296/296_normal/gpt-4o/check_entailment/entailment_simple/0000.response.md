To determine the correctness of the provided annotated program, let's analyze its behavior closely in relation to the requirements outlined in the problem description.

### Breakdown of the Problem Description
1. **Input:** A positive integer \( n \) where \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^9 \).
2. **Output:**
   - Print "YES" if a sequence of fractions \( \frac{a_i}{b_i} \) exists that meets certain conditions.
   - If such a sequence exists, output the number of fractions \( k \) (1 <= \( k \) <= 100,000) and then the fractions themselves.
   - The conditions for \( \frac{a_i}{b_i} \) are:
     - \( b_i \) must divide \( n \) and \( 1 < b_i < n \).
     - \( 1 \leq a_i < b_i \).
     - The sum of the fractions must equal \( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \).

### Analysis of the Program
1. **Handling of Edge Cases:**
   - The program has a check for \( n <= 2 \), immediately returning "NO". This check is correct as it ensures \( n \) can't be less than 2 according to problem constraints.

2. **Finding Divisors:**
   - The program correctly computes all divisors of \( n \) that are greater than 1 and less than \( n \) by iterating from 2 to \( \sqrt{n} \).
   - If \( n \) is prime, the divisors list will be empty, and the program returns "NO", which aligns with the requirement since a prime \( n \) cannot form the required fractions.

3. **Generating Fractions:**
   - It generates fractions \( \frac{1}{d} \) for each divisor \( d \) found, following the criteria \( 1 \leq a_i < b_i \). Here, \( a_i \) is taken as 1 for all divisors.
   - The output format meets the specified format requirements of the problem.

4. **Verifying Fraction Sum:**
   - The program does not explicitly verify that the sum of the fractions equals \( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \). While it ensures that divisors yield valid fractions, it doesn't confirm if their cumulative sum meets the required total.

### Conclusion
The critical issue lies in the lack of verification of the sum of the generated fractions against the required value of \( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \). The program might succeed in some cases, but it fails to guarantee that this condition is always met for all valid \( n \).

Hence, given that the program can produce valid outputs for some cases but does not ensure the solution meets all problem criteria, it leads to the following correctness determination: 

Correctness: **False**
