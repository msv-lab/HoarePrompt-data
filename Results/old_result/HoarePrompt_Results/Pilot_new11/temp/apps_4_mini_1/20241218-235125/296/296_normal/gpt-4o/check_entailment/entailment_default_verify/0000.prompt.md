You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a positive integer $n$.

Find a sequence of fractions $\frac{a_i}{b_i}$, $i = 1 \ldots k$ (where $a_i$ and $b_i$ are positive integers) for some $k$ such that:

$$ \begin{cases} \text{$b_i$ divides $n$, $1 < b_i < n$ for $i = 1 \ldots k$} \\ \text{$1 \le a_i < b_i$ for $i = 1 \ldots k$} \\ \text{$\sum\limits_{i=1}^k \frac{a_i}{b_i} = 1 - \frac{1}{n}$} \end{cases} $$


-----Input-----

The input consists of a single integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

In the first line print "YES" if there exists such a sequence of fractions or "NO" otherwise.

If there exists such a sequence, next lines should contain a description of the sequence in the following format.

The second line should contain integer $k$ ($1 \le k \le 100\,000$) — the number of elements in the sequence. It is guaranteed that if such a sequence exists, then there exists a sequence of length at most $100\,000$.

Next $k$ lines should contain fractions of the sequence with two integers $a_i$ and $b_i$ on each line.


-----Examples-----
Input
2

Output
NO

Input
6

Output
YES
2
1 2
1 3



-----Note-----

In the second example there is a sequence $\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}$ such that $\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} = 1 - \frac{1}{6}$.
Program:
```
import math

n = int(input().strip())
result = func_1(n)
print(result)

def func_1(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return 'NO'
    divisors = []
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
            if i != n // i:
                divisors.append(n // i)
    if not divisors:
        return 'NO'
    k = len(divisors)
    fractions = [(1, d) for d in divisors]
    return f'YES\n{k}\n' + '\n'.join((f'{a} {b}' for (a, b) in fractions))


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze it thoroughly based on the problem description.

### Problem Summary:
We need to find a sequence of fractions \( \frac{a_i}{b_i} \) such that:
- \( b_i \) divides \( n \) (and \( 1 < b_i < n \))
- \( 1 \leq a_i < b_i \)
- The sum of all fractions equals \( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \)

### Analyzing the Program:
The program checks whether the input integer \( n \) is less than or equal to 2 and returns "NO" in that case, which is correct based on the problem description.

Then, it computes the divisors of \( n \) that lie strictly between 1 and \( n \), storing them in a list. The program then checks if there are any such divisors. If none are found, it returns "NO".

Next, it creates a sequence of fractions using the divisors found, where each fraction \( \frac{1}{d} \) corresponds to each divisor \( d \). Finally, it prints "YES", the number of fractions \( k \), and the fractions themselves.

### Edge Cases and Potential Issues:
Let’s consider a few cases:

- For input \( n = 2 \):
  - The expected output is "NO" because there are no divisors satisfying \( 1 < b_i < n \).
  
- For input \( n = 3 \):
  - The only divisor \( b_1 \) would be \( 3 \), which does not satisfy \( 1 < b_1 < n \). Hence, the output should also be "NO".
  
- For composite numbers like \( n = 6 \):
  - The divisors between \( 1 \) and \( 6 \) would be \( 2 \) and \( 3 \). Here, it would form the fractions \( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} = 1 - \frac{1}{6} \), which is correct.
  
- For prime numbers larger than 2 (like \( 5 \)):
  - The output should be "NO" as well because there would be no valid \( b_i \).

### Potential Missing Logic:
The current implementation does not handle the case where \( n \) is a prime number correctly. The logic should also ensure that if \( n \) has no valid divisors in the range specified, it should return "NO".

### Finding a Failing Example:
Input \( n = 5 \):
- For primes, the program would not find any valid divisor. According to the description, it should return "NO" as expected, but the function is implemented in a way that it may lead to confusion because it assumes all \( n > 2 \) are valid for checking divisors.

Additionally, the program's definition does not explicitly ensure that the fractions generated by the divisors satisfy the sum condition \( \sum \frac{1}{b_i} = 1 - \frac{1}{n} \). For example:
- If \( n = 8 \), valid divisors are \( 2, 4 \). The fractions \( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} \) equals \( \frac{3}{4} \), which does not satisfy \( 1 - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{7}{8} \).

### Conclusion:
The program can potentially output incorrect results because it assumes that any divisor \( n > 2 \) will yield the necessary sums, which may not always be true. 

Thus, based on the observations that the program does not account for certain cases correctly, the correctness is:

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a positive integer `n` (where 2 <= n <= 10^9). It checks if `n` is less than or equal to 2, returning 'NO' in such cases. If `n` is a prime number (indicated by an empty list of divisors), it also returns 'NO'. If `n` is not prime, it collects all divisors of `n` (other than 1 and `n` itself), returning 'YES' along with the count of these divisors and a list of fractions of the form (1, d) for each divisor `d`. The function handles potential edge cases involving the smallest inputs and correctly identifies prime numbers.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
