The code appends `n // i` to the `divisors` list. Since `n` is a positive integer such that `2 <= n <= 10^9`, `i` is 2, and the current value of `n` is divisible by `i`, `n // i` will yield a positive integer which is half of `n`. Given that `i` is not equal to `n // i`, `n` must be greater than 4 to satisfy both conditions.

The previous state of `divisors` contained only the value 2, and after executing the code, it will also contain the new value `n // i`. The values of `n`, `i`, and any conditions on them remain unchanged aside from the modifications to `divisors`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9 and `n` is greater than 2; `divisors` is a list containing 2 and `n // i`; `i` is 2; the current value of `n` is divisible by `i` (n % i == 0), and `i` is not equal to `n // i.**
