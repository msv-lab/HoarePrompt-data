Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, it fails to properly construct a valid sequence of fractions for certain values of `n`. 

Consider the case when `n = 4`. The appropriate fractions would be \(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} = 1 - \frac{1}{4}\). However, the program would only return `1 2` as a valid fraction, thus providing an incomplete solution.

Additionally, if `n` is a prime number, the program returns `NO`, which is correct since a prime number does not have divisors in the range specified. However, when `n` is composite and produces divisors, the fractions returned are simply \((1, d)\), which does not guarantee they sum to \(1 - \frac{1}{n}\). 

Therefore, the program lacks robustness and does not ensure that all valid sequences are correctly formed, leading to incorrect outputs for specific inputs.
