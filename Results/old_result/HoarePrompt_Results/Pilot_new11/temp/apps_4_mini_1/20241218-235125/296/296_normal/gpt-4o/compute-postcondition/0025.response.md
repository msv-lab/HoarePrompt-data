The value of `k` is assigned the length of the list `divisors`. Given that `divisors` contains all divisors of `n` except for `n` itself and is a non-empty list of integers greater than or equal to 2, `k` will be a positive integer greater than or equal to 1.

Output State: **`divisors` contains all divisors of `n` except for `n` itself and is a non-empty list of integers greater than or equal to 2; `k` is a positive integer equal to the length of `divisors`.**
