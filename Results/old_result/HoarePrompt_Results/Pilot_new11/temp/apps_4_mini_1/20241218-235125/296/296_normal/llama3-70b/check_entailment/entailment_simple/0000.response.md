Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description for all cases. Here's a breakdown of why it fails:

1. **Output for `n = 2`:** The program appropriately outputs "NO" when `n = 2`, which aligns with the problem description stating that no such sequence of fractions exists.

2. **Output for other values of `n`:** For values of `n` greater than 2, the program outputs:
   - "YES"
   - The value `k = 2`
   - Two fractions: `(1, n // 2)` and `(1, n)`

   However, the second fraction `(1, n)` is problematic because `b_i` must divide `n` and satisfy `1 < b_i < n`. The value of `b_i = n` does not satisfy the requirement `1 < b_i < n`. Therefore, this can lead to an invalid output because the second fraction does not comply with the constraints specified.

3. **Condition for valid fractions:** The program fails to find appropriate fractions where \( b_i \) divides \( n \) and \( 1 < b_i < n \). It also does not check if the sum of the fractions equals \( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \), which is a requirement of the problem.

Therefore, the implementation does not adhere to the problemâ€™s constraints for all valid inputs, particularly for any value of `n` greater than 2. This leads to an overall conclusion that the provided program is incorrect in its functionality regarding the problem description. 

In summary, due to the violation of the requirements for the output of valid fractions, the correctness of the program is deemed **False**.
