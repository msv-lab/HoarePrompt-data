Correctness: **False**

The program incorrectly assumes a sequence of fractions can always be derived based solely on the check if `n` is equal to 2, and it produces fractions for any other value of `n`. However, the fractions generated do not satisfy the required conditions in many cases:

1. For `n = 3`, the program outputs 'YES' and generates the fractions `1/1.5` (which is invalid since 1.5 does not meet the requirement of `b_i` being an integer) and `1/3`. This does not meet the conditions required in the problem statement, as `b_i` must divide `n` and be within the specified range (1 < b_i < n).

2. For values such as `n = 4` or higher, the generated fractions may not equal `1 - 1/n` either.

Thus, there are inputs where the fractions cannot be constructed to satisfy the conditions laid out in the problem statement. The program fails to handle these cases properly, leading to an incorrect implementation. Therefore, it is incorrect.
