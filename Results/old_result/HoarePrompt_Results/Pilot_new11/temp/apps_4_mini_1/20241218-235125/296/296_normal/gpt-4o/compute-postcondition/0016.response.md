According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the range defined by `n`. The loop will run for values of `i` starting from 2 up to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k + 1`. For the loop to execute again, the value of `i` must increase by 1. Since `i` is currently `k + 1`, the next value of `i` will be `k + 2`.

Furthermore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must remain less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(n))`. Given that `n` is a positive integer such that `(k + 1)² <= n <= 10^9`, we know that `int(math.sqrt(n))` is at least `k + 1` and can be as high as `10^4` (when `n` is at its maximum of `10^9`).

To summarize, we must adjust the state as follows:
- The variable `i` is increased to `k + 2`, and for the loop to execute again, it must satisfy the condition of being less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(n))`.

Thus, we have:
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that (k + 1)² <= `n` <= 10^9 and greater than 2; `i` is `k + 2`.**
