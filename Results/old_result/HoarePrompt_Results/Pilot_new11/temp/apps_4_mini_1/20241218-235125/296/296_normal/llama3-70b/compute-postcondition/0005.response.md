The variable `k` is assigned the value `2`. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and the previously printed statement 'YES' is still valid. The other variables and conditions do not change. The Output State reflects the new value of `k` while retaining the information about `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9, and `n` is not equal to 2; `k` is 2; 'YES' has been printed.**
