To determine the correctness of the given program based on the problem description and hints, let's analyze them step by step.

**Problem Description Recap:**
1. There are N different coins.
2. Ivan has K coins.
3. M friends want to gift him coins.
4. Each friend must give the same amount.
5. At least L coins must be new to Ivan's collection.

**Given Program:**
```python
import sys

def func():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    (N, M, K, L) = map(int, input().split())
    min_x = (L + M - 1) // M
    if M * min_x <= N - K:
        print(min_x)
    else:
        print(-1)
```

**Output Hints:**
- The function reads and parses the inputs.
- It computes `min_x`, which represents the minimum number of coins each friend needs to gift.
- It checks if the total number of new coins (M * min_x) is less than or equal to the number of available coins after accounting for K.
- It directly prints `min_x` if the conditions are satisfied; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

**Analysis of the Code:**

1. The code computes `min_x` correctly, which indicates the minimum coins each friend must give to ensure at least `L` new coins are given to Ivan.
2. The expression `(L + M - 1) // M` rounds up the division of `L` by `M` to ensure that enough coins are counted (which is correct).
3. It correctly checks if the product `M * min_x` fits within the available coins that are left after considering Ivan's collection (`N - K`).

**Test Cases:**
- **Case 1:** Input `20 15 2 3`
  - `min_x = (3 + 15 - 1) // 15 = 1`
  - `M * min_x = 15 * 1 = 15`
  - `N - K = 20 - 2 = 18`
  - Since `15 <= 18`, it prints `1`, which is correct.

- **Case 2:** Input `10 11 2 4`
  - `min_x = (4 + 11 - 1) // 11 = 1`
  - `M * min_x = 11 * 1 = 11`
  - `N - K = 10 - 2 = 8`
  - Since `11 > 8`, it prints `-1`, which is also correct.

**Edge Cases:**
- An edge case to consider is when `M` is greater than `N - K`. The logic accounts for that since it checks if `M * min_x` can fit into `N - K`.

**Conclusion:**
The program accurately implements the logic required by the problem description and correctly computes the result for all tested and potential edge cases based on the provided constraints.

Correctness: **True**.
