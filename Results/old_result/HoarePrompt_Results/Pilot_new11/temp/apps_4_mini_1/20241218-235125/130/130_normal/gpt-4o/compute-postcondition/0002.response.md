`min_x` is assigned the value of `(L + M - 1) // M`, where `//` denotes integer division. The values of `L` and `M` are known to be integers satisfying the constraints given (1 <= M, L <= 10^18). The preconditions about `N`, `K`, and `L` remain valid, but the value of `min_x` is now determined based on the given values of `L` and `M`. 

Output State: **`N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` are integers assigned from input values; `min_x` is equal to `(L + M - 1) // M`.**
