To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze both the problem requirements and the annotated program.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. Ivan has `K` collectible coins out of a total of `N` different coins.
2. Ivan has `M` friends who must each gift him the same number of coins.
3. All gifted coins must be unique.
4. At least `L` coins must be new additions to Ivan's collection.
5. The output should be the minimum number of coins each friend can gift, or `-1` if it is impossible to meet the requirements.

### Function Logic:
In the provided function:
```python
def func():
    N, M, K, L = map(int, input().split())
    if (M >= N - K + 1 and M >= L) :
        print(1)
    else :
        print(-1)
```

### Analysis of the Conditions:
- The condition `M >= N - K + 1` checks if the number of friends `M` is at least equal to the number of potentially new coins Ivan could receive `(N - K)` plus 1 (to ensure at least one new coin):
  - `N - K` gives the total number of coins Ivan does not currently have.
  - However, the expression `(N - K + 1)` is not the right condition to check for the minimum unique coins needed for each friend across `M` friends. It should check if `M` (the number of unique coins required) is less than or equal to the total unique coins available `(N - K)`.
  
- The requirement `M >= L` ensures that the number of friends must be at least equal to the minimum new coins `L` that must be added to the collection.

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Unique Coins Requirement**: The condition `M >= N - K + 1` does not accurately encompass the check that all friends can gift unique coins. The should actually check if `M` is less than or equal to `N` and also ensure that they can bring in at least `L` new coins.
  
2. **Result Handling**: The function only returns `1` or `-1` without calculating the actual minimum number of coins each friend needs to gift. It should compute how many coins each friend must gift but does not include that logic.

### Conclusion:
The current program does not properly implement the logic in line with the problem description. There are several edge cases where the logic fails to satisfy the given conditions:

For example, if `N=10`, `K=2`, `M=11`, and `L=4`, while `M` exceeds the total number of different coins (`N`), it's impossible for the friends to gift unique coins. Thus, the program would incorrectly print `1` when it must recognize the impossibility and print `-1`.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
