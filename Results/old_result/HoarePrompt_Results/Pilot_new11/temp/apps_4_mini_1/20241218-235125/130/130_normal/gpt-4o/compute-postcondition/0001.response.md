The values of `N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` are assigned based on the input string, which is split into four integers. The previous values of `N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` are replaced by the values obtained from the input. The conditions that limit these integers remain valid. 

Output State: **`N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` are integers assigned from input values, satisfying 1 <= K <= N <= 10^18, and 1 <= M, L <= 10^18.**
