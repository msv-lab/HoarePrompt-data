The function `func` does not accept any parameters. After executing the function, it performs operations based on the conditions described for the input integers N, M, K, and L. These integers follow the constraints where 1 <= K <= N <= 10^18 and 1 <= M, L <= 10^18. The function likely generates a result based on these conditions, though the exact outputs based on the specified ranges and relationships are not provided in the output information. Thus, we can summarize the functionality based on the defined constraints.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and presumably returns a result based on the operations involving the integers N, M, K, and L under the specified constraints.**
