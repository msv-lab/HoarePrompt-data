The initial state defines `count` as a dictionary where each of the keys 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' is initialized to 0. The state of `n` and `s` remains unchanged as they are not affected by the assignment of `count`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 255; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'; `count` is {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}.**
