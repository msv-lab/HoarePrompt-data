The code `counts[char] += 1` increments the value of the key `char` in the dictionary `counts` by 1. The previous state indicates that `counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', and that `i` is `i + 1`. The variable `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, but it does not directly affect the operation of this code. The variable `result[i]` is equal to `char`, implying that `char` holds a value that is one of the keys in `counts`.

Since `counts[char]` is incremented by 1, the only state that changes is the value associated with `char` in the `counts` dictionary. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`counts` has the key `char` incremented by 1; `i` is `i + 1`; `n` is greater than `i + 1`; `result[i]` is equal to `char`.**
