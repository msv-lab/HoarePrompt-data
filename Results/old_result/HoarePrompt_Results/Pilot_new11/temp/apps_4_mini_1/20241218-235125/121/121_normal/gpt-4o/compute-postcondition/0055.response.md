Postcondition: ***`counts` is a dictionary with keys representing characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' that have respective counts incremented (each count is less than or equal to `target_count`). If `result[i]` was '?', it is updated to the last character from `counts` that had a count less than `target_count`, with `i` still being 0 and `n` greater than 0. If no characters were selected, `result[i]` remains '?'.***
