The code `count[nc] -= 1` decreases the value of `count[nc]` by 1. The initial condition states that `count[nc]` is greater than 0, meaning that after this operation, `count[nc]` will still be non-negative.

After executing the code, the other variables (`n`, `s`, `c`, `res`) remain unchanged. The only updated value is for `count[nc]`. Therefore, we can express the updated state considering that `count[nc]` was decremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'; `c` is '?'; `count[nc]` is greater than 0 after decrementing by 1; `res` has been incremented by `nc`.**
