Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255; `s` is a string of length `n-1` consisting of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'; `c` is defined in each iteration of the loop which executes 4 times for 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'. If `count[nc]` is greater than 0, `count[nc]` is reduced by 1, `res` remains unchanged, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
