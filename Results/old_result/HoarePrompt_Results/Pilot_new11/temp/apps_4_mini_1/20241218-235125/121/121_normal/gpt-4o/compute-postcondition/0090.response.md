The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. The dictionary `counts` remains unchanged; it was only specified that `counts[char]` had previously increased by 1. The variable `i` had increased by 1, and `result[i]` was assigned the value of `char`. However, the `break` statement interrupts any ongoing loops or conditional blocks. Therefore, the Output State is: `counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', `i` is one more than its previous value, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `result[i]` is equal to `char`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
