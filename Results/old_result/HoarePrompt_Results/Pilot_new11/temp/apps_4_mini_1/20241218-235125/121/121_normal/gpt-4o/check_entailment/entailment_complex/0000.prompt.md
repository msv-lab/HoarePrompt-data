You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The process of mammoth's genome decoding in Berland comes to its end!

One of the few remaining tasks is to restore unrecognized nucleotides in a found chain s. Each nucleotide is coded with a capital letter of English alphabet: 'A', 'C', 'G' or 'T'. Unrecognized nucleotides are coded by a question mark '?'. Thus, s is a string consisting of letters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and characters '?'.

It is known that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types in the decoded genome of mammoth in Berland should be equal.

Your task is to decode the genome and replace each unrecognized nucleotide with one of the four types so that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types becomes equal.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the integer n (4 ≤ n ≤ 255) — the length of the genome.

The second line contains the string s of length n — the coded genome. It consists of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and '?'.


-----Output-----

If it is possible to decode the genome, print it. If there are multiple answer, print any of them. If it is not possible, print three equals signs in a row: "===" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
8
AG?C??CT

Output
AGACGTCT

Input
4
AGCT

Output
AGCT

Input
6
????G?

Output
===

Input
4
AA??

Output
===



-----Note-----

In the first example you can replace the first question mark with the letter 'A', the second question mark with the letter 'G', the third question mark with the letter 'T', then each nucleotide in the genome would be presented twice.

In the second example the genome is already decoded correctly and each nucleotide is exactly once in it.

In the third and the fourth examples it is impossible to decode the genom.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 255, and s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    s = data[1]
    if (n % 4 != 0) :
        print('===')
        return
        #The program returns nothing as there is no value specified to return.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is equal to the integer value of `data[0]`, `s` is a string equal to `data[1]` consisting only of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'; `data` is a list created from splitting the input string `s` by whitespace, and `n` is a multiple of 4.
    target_count = n // 4
    counts = {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}
    for char in s:
        if char in counts:
            counts[char] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `counts` is a dictionary containing the counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' from string `s`; if `s` is empty, `counts` remains {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}.
    for char in counts:
        if counts[char] > target_count:
            print('===')
            return
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `counts` is a dictionary containing counts of 'A': [0 or more], 'C': [0 or more], 'G': [0 or more], 'T': [0 or more]; the loop will execute for each base, and if a count exceeds `target_count`, the function would have returned early. If none exceed, counts remain as counted from the string `s`.
    result = list(s)
    for i in range(n):
        if result[i] == '?':
            for char in counts:
                if counts[char] < target_count:
                    result[i] = char
                    counts[char] += 1
                    break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', each having values between 0 and `target_count`, inclusive. `result` is a list containing the characters assigned based on the respective counts, or it may still have '?' in places where counts have reached `target_count`. If `n` is greater than the number of '?' in the original `result`, the number of characters assigned equals the original number of '?' that were replaced before reaching the limit set by `target_count`. If there were no '?' characters in `result` or if counts for all characters reached `target_count`, then `result` remains unchanged.
    print(''.join(result))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes an input string of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?' based on a specified integer length. It ensures that the number of each base does not exceed a target count derived from the input length, which must be a multiple of four. If the length is not a multiple of four or if any base exceeds its target count, the function outputs '===' and terminates. It replaces any '?' characters in the string with the corresponding base if their count is below the target. Finally, the function outputs the modified string. The function does not return values but may output warnings or the resulting string, and handles cases with insufficient '?' characters by not replacing them if the target count has been achieved. Edge cases include strings of different lengths, no '?' characters, or all bases reaching their target count.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
