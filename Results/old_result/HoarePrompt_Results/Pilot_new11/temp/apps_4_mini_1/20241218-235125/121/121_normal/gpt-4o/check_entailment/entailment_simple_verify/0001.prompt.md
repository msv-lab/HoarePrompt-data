You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The process of mammoth's genome decoding in Berland comes to its end!

One of the few remaining tasks is to restore unrecognized nucleotides in a found chain s. Each nucleotide is coded with a capital letter of English alphabet: 'A', 'C', 'G' or 'T'. Unrecognized nucleotides are coded by a question mark '?'. Thus, s is a string consisting of letters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and characters '?'.

It is known that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types in the decoded genome of mammoth in Berland should be equal.

Your task is to decode the genome and replace each unrecognized nucleotide with one of the four types so that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types becomes equal.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the integer n (4 ≤ n ≤ 255) — the length of the genome.

The second line contains the string s of length n — the coded genome. It consists of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and '?'.


-----Output-----

If it is possible to decode the genome, print it. If there are multiple answer, print any of them. If it is not possible, print three equals signs in a row: "===" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
8
AG?C??CT

Output
AGACGTCT

Input
4
AGCT

Output
AGCT

Input
6
????G?

Output
===

Input
4
AA??

Output
===



-----Note-----

In the first example you can replace the first question mark with the letter 'A', the second question mark with the letter 'G', the third question mark with the letter 'T', then each nucleotide in the genome would be presented twice.

In the second example the genome is already decoded correctly and each nucleotide is exactly once in it.

In the third and the fourth examples it is impossible to decode the genom.
Program:
```
func_1()

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    s = data[1]
    if n % 4 != 0:
        print('===')
        return
    target_count = n // 4
    counts = {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}
    for char in s:
        if char in counts:
            counts[char] += 1
    for char in counts:
        if counts[char] > target_count:
            print('===')
            return
    result = list(s)
    for i in range(n):
        if result[i] == '?':
            for char in counts:
                if counts[char] < target_count:
                    result[i] = char
                    counts[char] += 1
                    break
    print(''.join(result))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case where the counts of recognized nucleotides could be at their maximum (i.e., all recognized nucleotides are the same and no '?' characters are left). For example, consider the input:

```
4
AAAA
```

In this case, `n` is 4, and the string `s` contains 4 'A' characters. The program counts 4 'A's and determines that it exceeds the target count of 1 for 'A', leading it to print '===' instead of a valid output. However, since it is impossible to decode the genome to meet the requirement of having equal numbers of all nucleotides (because it does not provide enough nucleotides of 'C', 'G', and 'T'), the output is correct in this scenario.

However, the program incorrectly handles cases when there are insufficient '?' characters to adjust the balance among the nucleotides. Specifically:

Consider the test case:

```
n = 12
s = AAAAA?C???G
```

In this case, the counts before processing '?' are:
- 'A': 5
- 'C': 1
- 'G': 1
- 'T': 0
- '?': 5

To achieve an equal count (i.e., 3 of each), the counts of A should decrease, C should increase to 3, G should increase to 3, and T should increase to 3. The program will only process '?' characters without checking if the counts can actually equalize to the necessary values for the total nucleotides present.

Thus, the program fails for a range of inputs and does not handle this edge case appropriately. Therefore, the correctness is deemed **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 255, and s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    s = data[1]
    if (n % 4 != 0) :
        print('===')
        return
        #The program returns nothing as there is no value specified to return.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is equal to the integer value of `data[0]`, `s` is a string equal to `data[1]` consisting only of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'; `data` is a list created from splitting the input string `s` by whitespace, and `n` is a multiple of 4.
    target_count = n // 4
    counts = {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}
    for char in s:
        if char in counts:
            counts[char] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `counts` is a dictionary containing the counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' from string `s`; if `s` is empty, `counts` remains {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}.
    for char in counts:
        if counts[char] > target_count:
            print('===')
            return
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `counts` is a dictionary containing counts of 'A': [0 or more], 'C': [0 or more], 'G': [0 or more], 'T': [0 or more]; the loop will execute for each base, and if a count exceeds `target_count`, the function would have returned early. If none exceed, counts remain as counted from the string `s`.
    result = list(s)
    for i in range(n):
        if result[i] == '?':
            for char in counts:
                if counts[char] < target_count:
                    result[i] = char
                    counts[char] += 1
                    break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', each having values between 0 and `target_count`, inclusive. `result` is a list containing the characters assigned based on the respective counts, or it may still have '?' in places where counts have reached `target_count`. If `n` is greater than the number of '?' in the original `result`, the number of characters assigned equals the original number of '?' that were replaced before reaching the limit set by `target_count`. If there were no '?' characters in `result` or if counts for all characters reached `target_count`, then `result` remains unchanged.
    print(''.join(result))


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
