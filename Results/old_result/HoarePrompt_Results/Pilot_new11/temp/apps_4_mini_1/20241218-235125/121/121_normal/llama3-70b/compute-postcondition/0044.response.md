Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', and the length of `s` is greater than 0. If `c` is equal to '?', then `c` is no longer '?'; character counts for 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' in `count` may be updated based on occurrences in `s`, allowing `res` to hold the first character from 'ACGT' with a count greater than 0 or remain unchanged if none are present. Otherwise, if `c` is not equal to '?', then `res` is updated to `res + c`.***
