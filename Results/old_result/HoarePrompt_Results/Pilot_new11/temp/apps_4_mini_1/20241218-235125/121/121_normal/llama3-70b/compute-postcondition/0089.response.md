The statement `print('===')` outputs a string of three equals signs but does not alter any variable states or values. Therefore, while the content of the program has been output to the console, the precondition of the program remains unchanged, as no variable has been modified or assigned a new value. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255, `s` has been fully processed, `res` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', `count` contains the remaining counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' after replacing all '?' in `s`, there is at least one character remaining in `count` with a non-zero value.**
