The variable `avg` is assigned the value of `n // 4`, which performs integer division of `n` by 4. As stated in the initial conditions, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255. Therefore, the value of `avg` will be between 1 and 63, depending on the specific value of `n`. The states of the other variables `s` and `count` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'; `count` is a dictionary with the counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'; `avg` is equal to `n // 4`.**
