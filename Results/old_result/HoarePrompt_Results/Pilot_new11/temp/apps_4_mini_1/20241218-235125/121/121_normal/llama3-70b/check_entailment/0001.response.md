Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it fails to handle cases where the total number of nucleotides, including the unrecognized ones, cannot be evenly divided by 4. This situation would make it impossible to have an equal number of each nucleotide.

For example, consider the input:
```
9
A?C??GT?T
```
In this case, `n = 9` and there are 4 unrecognized nucleotides (`?`). The total number of nucleotides, 9, cannot be evenly divided by 4. Thus it is impossible to replace the `?` characters such that there will be an equal number of each nucleotide ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T').

The program does not check if `n % 4 != 0` at the beginning, which would allow it to immediately return `===` without further processing, hence missing certain edge cases where the genome can't be balanced.
