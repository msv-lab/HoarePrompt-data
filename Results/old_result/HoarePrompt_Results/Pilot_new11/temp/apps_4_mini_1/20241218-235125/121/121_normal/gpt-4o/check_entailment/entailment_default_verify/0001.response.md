The original assessment stated that the program's correctness is **False** due to its inability to handle certain edge cases, particularly when the counts of recognized nucleotides are maximum and when there are insufficient '?' characters to balance out the nucleotides.

Upon analyzing the problem description, the program, and the output hints, it is evident that:

1. The program checks if the total length of the genome (n) is a multiple of 4. If it is not, it correctly outputs '===' since equal distribution is impossible.
   
2. It counts the occurrences of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'. If any base exceeds its target count (n // 4), it prints '===' which is correct behavior according to the problem description.

3. When processing '?', the program replaces them with the appropriate characters until each nucleotide reaches its target count. 

4. The original assessment criticized the program for failing in scenarios where the nucleotides are already at their maximum count, leading to an incorrect '===' output. However, the program’s judgment in these scenarios is indeed correct. It identifies when it is impossible to balance the nucleotides and handles the situation accordingly.

5. Moreover, the output hints specifically affirm the process for dealing with all recognized nucleotides reaching their count limit, indicating that the program is designed to handle these cases correctly by terminating with '==='.

In conclusion, the original assessment inaccurately deemed the program incorrect despite it fulfilling the requirements of the problem as stated and correctly responding to problematic scenarios involving unbalanced nucleotide counts.

Thus, I revise the conclusion regarding the program’s correctness.

Final: **True**
