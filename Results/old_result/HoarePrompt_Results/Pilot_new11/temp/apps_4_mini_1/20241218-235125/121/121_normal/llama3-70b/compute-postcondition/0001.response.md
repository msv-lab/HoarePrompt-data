The value of `s` is assigned the value of `input()`, which allows the user to define `s` as a string of length `n`. The initial state indicates that `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 255, but `s` will now reflect whatever input the user provides. There is no change to the value of `n`, and the conditions regarding its range still apply. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 255; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'**
