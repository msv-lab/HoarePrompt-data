Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'; `c` is no longer '?'; each character in 'ACGT' may be updated in `count` based on how many times they were found in `s`, resulting in `count[nc]` potentially being 0 if it was decremented. `res` contains the first character from 'ACGT' with a count greater than 0 from the input string `s`, or remains unchanged if no such character was available.**
