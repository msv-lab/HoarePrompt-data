Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case where the counts of recognized nucleotides could be at their maximum (i.e., all recognized nucleotides are the same and no '?' characters are left). For example, consider the input:

```
4
AAAA
```

In this case, `n` is 4, and the string `s` contains 4 'A' characters. The program counts 4 'A's and determines that it exceeds the target count of 1 for 'A', leading it to print '===' instead of a valid output. However, since it is impossible to decode the genome to meet the requirement of having equal numbers of all nucleotides (because it does not provide enough nucleotides of 'C', 'G', and 'T'), the output is correct in this scenario.

However, the program incorrectly handles cases when there are insufficient '?' characters to adjust the balance among the nucleotides. Specifically:

Consider the test case:

```
n = 12
s = AAAAA?C???G
```

In this case, the counts before processing '?' are:
- 'A': 5
- 'C': 1
- 'G': 1
- 'T': 0
- '?': 5

To achieve an equal count (i.e., 3 of each), the counts of A should decrease, C should increase to 3, G should increase to 3, and T should increase to 3. The program will only process '?' characters without checking if the counts can actually equalize to the necessary values for the total nucleotides present.

Thus, the program fails for a range of inputs and does not handle this edge case appropriately. Therefore, the correctness is deemed **False**.
