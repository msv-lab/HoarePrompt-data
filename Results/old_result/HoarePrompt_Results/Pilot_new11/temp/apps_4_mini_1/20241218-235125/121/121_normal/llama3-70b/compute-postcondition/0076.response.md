The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255, `s` is a string of length `n-1` consisting of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', `c` is the second character in the string `s`, `nc` is 'G', `count[nc]` is now a value greater than or equal to 0 minus 1, and `res` is the previous value of `res` concatenated with 'G' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
