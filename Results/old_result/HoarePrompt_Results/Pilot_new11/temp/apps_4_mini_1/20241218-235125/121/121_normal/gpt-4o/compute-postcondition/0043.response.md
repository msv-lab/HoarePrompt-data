Postcondition: ***`counts` must have at least 1 key, `result` is a list of elements of `s` where `result[i]` is `char`, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and the current value of `result[i]` is `char`. If `counts[char]` is less than `target_count`, the value of `counts[char]` is incremented by 1, remaining less than or equal to `target_count`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
