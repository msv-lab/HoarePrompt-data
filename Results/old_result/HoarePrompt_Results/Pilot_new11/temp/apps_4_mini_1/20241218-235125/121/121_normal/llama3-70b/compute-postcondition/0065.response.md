Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255, `s` is a string of length `n-1` consisting of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', and the length of `s` is greater than 0. If `c` is '?', then `res` is a string containing the characters concatenated in order of availability ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T'), with `count['A']`, `count['C']`, `count['G']`, and `count['T']` representing the remaining counts after the loop execution. Otherwise, if `c` is one of 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T', then `res` includes character `c` appended to its previous value.***
