You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The process of mammoth's genome decoding in Berland comes to its end!

One of the few remaining tasks is to restore unrecognized nucleotides in a found chain s. Each nucleotide is coded with a capital letter of English alphabet: 'A', 'C', 'G' or 'T'. Unrecognized nucleotides are coded by a question mark '?'. Thus, s is a string consisting of letters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and characters '?'.

It is known that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types in the decoded genome of mammoth in Berland should be equal.

Your task is to decode the genome and replace each unrecognized nucleotide with one of the four types so that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types becomes equal.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the integer n (4 ≤ n ≤ 255) — the length of the genome.

The second line contains the string s of length n — the coded genome. It consists of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and '?'.


-----Output-----

If it is possible to decode the genome, print it. If there are multiple answer, print any of them. If it is not possible, print three equals signs in a row: "===" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
8
AG?C??CT

Output
AGACGTCT

Input
4
AGCT

Output
AGCT

Input
6
????G?

Output
===

Input
4
AA??

Output
===



-----Note-----

In the first example you can replace the first question mark with the letter 'A', the second question mark with the letter 'G', the third question mark with the letter 'T', then each nucleotide in the genome would be presented twice.

In the second example the genome is already decoded correctly and each nucleotide is exactly once in it.

In the third and the fourth examples it is impossible to decode the genom.
Program:
```
func_1()

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    s = data[1]
    if n % 4 != 0:
        print('===')
        return
    target_count = n // 4
    counts = {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}
    for char in s:
        if char in counts:
            counts[char] += 1
    for char in counts:
        if counts[char] > target_count:
            print('===')
            return
    result = list(s)
    for i in range(n):
        if result[i] == '?':
            for char in counts:
                if counts[char] < target_count:
                    result[i] = char
                    counts[char] += 1
                    break
    print(''.join(result))


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program, we will analyze it in the context of the problem description step by step.

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input and checks if the length `n` is divisible by 4. This is correct and required, as we need to form four types of nucleotides (A, C, G, T) of equal quantity.

2. **Count of Existing Nucleotides**: The program initializes a dictionary to count occurrences of each nucleotide (A, C, G, T) in the string `s`. It correctly increments the respective counts.

3. **Checking for Excess Nucleotides**: The program checks if any nucleotide count exceeds the `target_count` (which is `n // 4`). If an excess is found, it prints `'==='`, indicating it's impossible to achieve equal counts. This part is also implemented correctly.

4. **Replacing Unrecognized Nucleotides**: The core logic replaces '?' characters with nucleotides to balance their occurrences. It iterates over `s` and fills in the '?', checking if the count of that nucleotide is less than the target before substitution.

5. **Output**: Finally, the updated string is printed.

Let's find potential edge cases that may cause this code to fail:

- **Case with excess nucleotides**: If we input `n = 8` and `s = "AAAACCCC"`, the program would not print `'==='`, because `A` and `C` are equal to `target_count` which is `2`, but it would be impossible to balance the nucleotides by just replacing '?' characters.

- **Case with only '?'**: If we input `n = 4` and `s = "????"`, the program would replace it correctly, resulting in `ACGT` (or any permutation), which is acceptable.

- **Case with alternating characters**: If we input `n = 8` and `s = "ACGTACGT"`, the string is already balanced and should print `ACGTACGT`, which the program does correctly.

- **Case with odd characters that can't be balanced**: The program should handle cases where `n % 4 != 0`, and it does correctly output `'==='`.

Now consider **the specific edge cases** where the number of existing nucleotide characters (A, C, G, T) adds up to `3` and there are `5` `?`, such as `s = "AA??"`. Adding 2 `C`s and 1 `G` for example will make it `6` and exceed the capacity for `4` each, therefore the output should be `'==='`.

In this regard, the code does handle the check for excess correctly but doesn't correctly account for these prior to printing `===`, especially when `n >= 4`.

In conclusion, I found issues in how it handles certain strings, particularly around how it counts and the balance checks.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not handle all possible cases where the nucleotides cannot balance properly and would fail for certain inputs. For example, it would not output `===` for input such as `n = 4; s = "AA??"` where even though it has '?' characters, the nucleotides can't be balanced properly based on the logic implemented.


Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function processes an input string of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?' based on a specified integer length. It ensures that the number of each base does not exceed a target count derived from the input length, which must be a multiple of four. If the length is not a multiple of four or if any base exceeds its target count, the function outputs '===' and terminates. It replaces any '?' characters in the string with the corresponding base if their count is below the target. Finally, the function outputs the modified string. The function does not return values but may output warnings or the resulting string, and handles cases with insufficient '?' characters by not replacing them if the target count has been achieved. Edge cases include strings of different lengths, no '?' characters, or all bases reaching their target count.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
