The function accepts a list of integers `digits`, which represent a number in a specified base, and an integer `base` within the range of 2 to 40. It computes and returns the integer value of the number represented by the provided `digits` in the specified base. The function does not handle cases of invalid input, such as digits that are not within the range of allowable values for the given base (0 to base-1) or if the `digits` list contains leading zeros beyond the valid representation of zero. The final output is the base `base` integer representation of the `digits`, calculated by treating the list as a multi-digit number in that base.
