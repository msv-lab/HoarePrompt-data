Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle cases where the input digits for each number exceed the specified base. According to the problem description, each digit must be in the range [0, base), but the program does not validate this condition. Therefore, if the input has digits equal to or greater than their respective bases, the program's logic would be incorrect, leading to erroneous calculations for the decimal representation.

For example, if we have the following input:
```
3 4
3 1 2
2 5
1 4
```
In this case, `3` is not a valid digit for base `4` (since valid digits are `0`, `1`, `2`, or `3`). The program will calculate a decimal value based on invalid input, which ultimately causes incorrect comparisons. 

Since the program does not handle these potential edge cases and could produce erroneous results for such inputs, the correctness statement is **False**.
