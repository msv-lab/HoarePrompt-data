Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads input consisting of:
   - The first line describing the number of digits and the base for the number X.
   - The second line providing the digits for the number X.
   - The third line describing the number of digits and the base for the number Y.
   - The fourth line providing the digits for the number Y.
   This matches the format described in the problem description.

2. **Conversion from Base to Decimal**: The function `func_1` effectively converts the list of digits representing a number in a specified base to its decimal integer equivalent. It does this by initializing a result variable to 0 and iteratively updating it by multiplying by the base and adding the current digit. This follows the algorithm for converting a number from a specific base to decimal.

3. **Comparison Logic**: After converting both X and Y to their decimal representations, the program compares these two numbers:
   - It prints '<' if X (in decimal) is less than Y (in decimal).
   - It prints '>' if X (in decimal) is greater than Y (in decimal).
   - It prints '=' if both are equal.
   
   This represents the correct logical structure for comparing two numbers.

4. **Correct Output**: The outputs are single characters ('<', '>', or '=') as required by the problem statement.

5. **Edge Cases**: The assumption of valid input means that the program does not need to handle unexpected or invalid cases. Given the constraints (no leading zeroes, valid digits for given bases, etc.), the program will function correctly within the defined limits.

All these reasons confirm that the program strictly adheres to the problem description and will yield correct results for valid inputs as stated.

Thus, the program is correct.
