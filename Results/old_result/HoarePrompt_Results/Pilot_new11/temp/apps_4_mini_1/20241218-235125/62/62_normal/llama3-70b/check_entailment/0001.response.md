Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly converts numbers represented in different bases to their decimal (base 10) equivalent values and compares them, following the requirements of the problem description.

Hereâ€™s a brief explanation of the code and its functionality:

1. **Input Handling**: It reads the base and digits of two numbers (X and Y) correctly.
2. **Conversion Logic**: The function `func_1` takes a list of digits and the base, converting the number from that base to base 10. It does this by iterating through each digit and updating the result according to base conversion rules.
3. **Comparison**: After converting both numbers, the program compares them and prints the appropriate character ('<', '>', or '=') depending on their values.

The program operates correctly under the constraints defined in the problem description, as it correctly handles bases between 2 and 40 and does not perform any invalid operations with respect to the defined input ranges. Since I could not find any potential edge cases that cause the program to fail based on the description, the program is indeed correct.

Overall, the logic consistently adheres to the problem requirements, converting any valid input as specified and outputting the correct comparison result.
