According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. If the list has at least 3 integers, the loop will execute again for the third integer in the list. At the end of the last iteration, `digits` contains at least 2 integers, and the `digit` is the second integer in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 3 integers, and `digit` must be the third integer in the list.

State: **`digits` is a list of integers containing at least 3 integers, `base` is an integer where 2 ≤ base ≤ 40, `result` is equal to `third integer in digits * (base + 1)`, `digit` is the third integer in the list**
