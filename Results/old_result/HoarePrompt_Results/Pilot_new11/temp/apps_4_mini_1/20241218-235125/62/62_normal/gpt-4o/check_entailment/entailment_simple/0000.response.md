Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program correctly follows the problem description for comparing two numbers given in different bases. Let's break down why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the input values for the number of digits and the bases of both numbers, as well as the digits of each number. This aligns with the input format described.

2. **Conversion Function**: The function `func_1` accurately converts a number from its base representation to a decimal value. It iterates through each digit, multiplying the current value of `decimal_value` by the base (which gives the correct positional weight of the digit) and then adding the current digit. This conversion method is standard and effectively handles the conversion for bases ranging from 2 to 40.

3. **Comparison Logic**: After the conversion, the program correctly compares the two decimal values obtained from the conversions. It prints the appropriate relational symbol (`<`, `>`, or `=`) based on the comparison results.

4. **Assumption Handling**: The problem specifies that the input will be valid, and the program assumes well-formed input without needing to explicitly handle errors or edge cases. Since we have been instructed that this assumption holds true, the program's correctness is validated under these conditions.

Thus, given the detailed description of the problem and the corresponding functionality of the program, it meets the required specifications at all points. Therefore, the program is deemed correct.
