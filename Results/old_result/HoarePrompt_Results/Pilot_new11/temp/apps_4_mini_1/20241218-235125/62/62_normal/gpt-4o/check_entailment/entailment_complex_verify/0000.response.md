Final: **True** 

Reasoning: The original assessment that the program is correct is supported by both the problem description and the annotated version of the code. The program accurately reads the input, converts the numbers from their respective bases to decimal using the `func_1` function, and correctly compares the two decimal values, providing the appropriate relational symbol ('<', '>', or '=') based on their comparison. 

The annotations confirm that the input handling is done properly, and that the assumptions about the digits (being valid within their respective bases) hold true. The logic for base conversion is correctly implemented and adheres to the specifications given in the problem description. Since all criteria for correctness are met, and the program performs as expected for valid inputs, the final correctness assessment remains accurate.
