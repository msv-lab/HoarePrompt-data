The program provided reads two numbers represented in different bases, converts them to decimal, and compares them. Based on the problem description and the program behavior, let's analyze it step by step.

1. **Input Handling**: The program captures input for two numbers and their bases correctly. It takes the number of digits and the respective digits for each base.

2. **Conversion to Decimal**: The function `func_1` correctly computes the decimal equivalent of a number represented in a given base by iterating through the digits and accumulating their values appropriately. 

3. **Output Logic**: After converting both numbers to decimal, the program compares them and prints the appropriate relation (`<`, `>`, `=`).

The output hints indicate that the function does not check for the validity of the digit values (like ensuring they are all less than the respective base), which presents a potential problem. Although the problem description guarantees valid inputs, if we assume an edge case where input is indeed valid then the function will perform correctly. 

However, we must also consider that if we were given digits outside the allowed range, the function would yield incorrect behavior.

In the absence of invalid inputs, the logic and functioning align well with the problem description, and the code handles all described cases within those constraints.

Given this analysis:

- The program follows the intended logic of converting the numbers and comparing them as specified.
- The output is directed correctly based on the comparison.

Thus, for valid inputs within the constraints provided by the problem statement, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**.
