#State of the program right berfore the function call: digits is a list of integers representing the number in base notation where each integer is a digit (0 ≤ digit < base), and base is an integer where 2 ≤ base ≤ 40. The digits list should not have leading zeroes unless it is the representation of the number zero itself.
def func_1(digits, base):
    result = 0
    for digit in digits:
        result = result * base + digit
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `result` is equal to the base `base` integer representation of `digits`, `digits` is a list of integers, `base` is an integer where 2 ≤ base ≤ 40.
    return result
    #The program returns the base 'base' integer representation of the list 'digits', where 'result' is equal to that representation
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `digits`, which represent a number in a specified base, and an integer `base` within the range of 2 to 40. It computes and returns the integer value of the number represented by the provided `digits` in the specified base. The function does not handle cases of invalid input, such as digits that are not within the range of allowable values for the given base (0 to base-1) or if the `digits` list contains leading zeros beyond the valid representation of zero. The final output is the base `base` integer representation of the `digits`, calculated by treating the list as a multi-digit number in that base.
