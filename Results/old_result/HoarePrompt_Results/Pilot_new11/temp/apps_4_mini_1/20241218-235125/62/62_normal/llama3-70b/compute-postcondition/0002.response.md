The value of `result` is updated according to the formula `result = result * base + digit`. The previous value of `result` is 0, the `base` is an integer within the range of 2 to 40, and `digit` is the first integer in the `digits` list (which is guaranteed to contain at least one integer). 

Thus, the new value of `result` will be `0 * base + digit`, which simplifies to `digit`. The values of `base` and `digit` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`digits` is a list of integers that must contain at least 1 integer, `base` is an integer where 2 ≤ base ≤ 40, `result` is equal to `digit`, `digit` is the first integer in the `digits` list**.
