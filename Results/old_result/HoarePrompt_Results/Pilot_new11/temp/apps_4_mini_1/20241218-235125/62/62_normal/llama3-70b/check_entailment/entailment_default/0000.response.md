The provided program aims to compare two numbers represented in different bases by converting them into their decimal (base 10) equivalent. Let's analyze the code and the output hints carefully.

1. The function `func_1` correctly converts a list of digits (in base `base`) to its decimal equivalent. It uses a simple algorithm where it multiplies the current result by the base and adds the next digit. This approach is standard for base conversions, and it works correctly as long as all digits are valid for the given base.

2. The program reads inputs appropriately and compares the results of the two converted numbers. If one number is less than, greater than, or equal to the other, it correctly prints the corresponding character ('<', '>', or '=').

3. However, the output hints indicate a significant flaw: the function does not validate the digits against the allowed range for the specified base. For instance, if the input has digits that are outside the expected range (e.g., a digit of 2 in a base 2 number), the function would still process them, leading to incorrect results. Such scenarios would produce erroneous conversions and thus could lead to faulty comparisons.

Considering this crucial point about unhandled invalid digits, there exists a potential situation where the program will not execute correctly when invalid inputs are provided (i.e., if `digits` lists contain invalid numbers for the specified bases).

Thus, given that the program does not handle every potential case as required by the problem description, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**.
