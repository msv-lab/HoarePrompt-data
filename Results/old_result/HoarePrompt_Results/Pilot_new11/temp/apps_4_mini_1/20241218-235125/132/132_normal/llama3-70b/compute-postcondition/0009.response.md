The code snippet executes a print statement which does not alter any variables or their values. It simply outputs the string 'Yes' to the console. The initial conditions regarding `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that the program has confirmed the equality of `x` and `y` by printing 'Yes'.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x` is a sorted list of `n` integers based on user input, `y` is a sorted list of `n` integers based on new user input with the sums of `x` and `y` still equal, and `x` is equal to `y`.**
