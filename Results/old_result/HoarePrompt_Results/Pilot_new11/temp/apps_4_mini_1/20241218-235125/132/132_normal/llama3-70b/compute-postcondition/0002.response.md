The variable `y` is assigned a new value that is generated by mapping the input provided by the user (split into separate integers) into a list of integers. The initial state indicates that `y` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is previously within the range \(0 \leq y[i] \leq 1000\). After execution of the code, `y` will contain the new integers provided as input, while `n` remains unchanged as an input integer and `x` remains unchanged, still being a list of `n` integers.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of `n` integers based on user input, `y` is a list of `n` integers based on new user input**.
