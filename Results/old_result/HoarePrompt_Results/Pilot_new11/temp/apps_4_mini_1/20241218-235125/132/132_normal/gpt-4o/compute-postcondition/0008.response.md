Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `x` is a list of `n` integers as an input from the user; `y` is a new list of `n` integers satisfying `0 <= y_i <= 1000; `total_x` is the sum of the integers in list `x`; `total_y` is the sum of the integers in list `y`; the sum of the integers in list `y` is less than or equal to the sum of the integers in list `x` (total_y <= total_x); and the output 'Yes' has been printed.**
