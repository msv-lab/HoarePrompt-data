The variable `x` is sorted in ascending order. The variable `n` remains the same, as it is not affected by the sorting process. The lists `y` and `x` maintain their structure, but the order of the elements in `x` changes. The conditions and sums of the lists still hold. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x` is a sorted list of `n` integers based on user input, `y` is a list of `n` integers based on new user input. The sums of the lists `x` and `y` are equal.**
