The variable `total_y` is assigned the value of the sum of the integers in list `y`. The value of `total_y` is thus the total of all elements in `y`, which contains `n` integers satisfying the condition `0 <= y_i <= 1000`. The states of `n`, `x`, and `total_x` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `x` is a list of `n` integers as an input from the user; `y` is a new list of `n` integers satisfying `0 <= y_i <= 1000; `total_x` is the sum of the integers in list `x`; `total_y` is the sum of the integers in list `y`.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `x` is a list of `n` integers as an input from the user; `y` is a new list of `n` integers satisfying `0 <= y_i <= 1000; `total_x` is the sum of the integers in list `x`; `total_y` is the sum of the integers in list `y`.**
