The variable `total_x` is assigned the value of the sum of the list `x`, which contains `n` integers. Given the initial state, where `n` is an input positive integer (between 1 and 50) and `x` is a list of `n` integers, the value of `total_x` will be the total sum of those integers in the list `x`. The value of `total_x` is now defined, while the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `x` is a list of `n` integers as an input from the user; `y` is a new list of `n` integers satisfying `0 <= y_i <= 1000; `total_x` is the sum of the integers in list `x`.**
