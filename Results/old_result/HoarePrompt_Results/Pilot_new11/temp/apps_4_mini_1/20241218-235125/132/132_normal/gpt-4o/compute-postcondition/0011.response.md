Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` representing the number of elements in two lists, `x` and `y`, from user input. It then reads the elements of these lists, both of which must contain `n` integers within specified bounds. The function calculates the sum of elements in both lists, `total_x` and `total_y`. If `total_y` is greater than `total_x`, it prints 'No'; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. The function does not handle cases where the input format is incorrect (e.g., if the number of integers provided does not match `n`, or if non-integer values are given), nor does it provide any output or return value based on the user's input beyond the printed results. Therefore, the final state of the program includes the integer sums computed and the printed result based on their comparison.**
