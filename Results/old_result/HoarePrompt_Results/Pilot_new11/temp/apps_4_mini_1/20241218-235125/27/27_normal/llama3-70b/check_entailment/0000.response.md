Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic outlined in the problem description. It takes three floating-point numbers as input and computes twelve expressions based on the specified formulas. It then identifies the maximum value among these computations and prints the corresponding expression. 

1. The use of `map(float, input().split())` ensures that the input is correctly parsed as floating-point numbers, adhering to the requirement that the numbers have one digit after the decimal point.
2. The calculations for the twelve expressions accurately reflect the problem's requirements, including exponentiation with the correct order of operations.
3. The program collects all calculated values in a list and then uses `max(a)` to find the maximum value and its corresponding index in the expression list.
4. The output formatting matches the specified format without extra parentheses around expressions that do not require them.

Given that the problem description is satisfied in every aspect and that no edge cases or potential issues have been identified, the solution is deemed correct.
