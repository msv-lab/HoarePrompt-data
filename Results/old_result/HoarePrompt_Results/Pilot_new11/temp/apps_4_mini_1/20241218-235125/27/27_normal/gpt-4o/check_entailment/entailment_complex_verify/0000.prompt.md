You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Wet Shark asked Rat Kwesh to generate three positive real numbers x, y and z, from 0.1 to 200.0, inclusive. Wet Krash wants to impress Wet Shark, so all generated numbers will have exactly one digit after the decimal point.

Wet Shark knows Rat Kwesh will want a lot of cheese. So he will give the Rat an opportunity to earn a lot of cheese. He will hand the three numbers x, y and z to Rat Kwesh, and Rat Kwesh will pick one of the these twelve options:  a_1 = x^{y}^{z};  a_2 = x^{z}^{y};  a_3 = (x^{y})^{z};  a_4 = (x^{z})^{y};  a_5 = y^{x}^{z};  a_6 = y^{z}^{x};  a_7 = (y^{x})^{z};  a_8 = (y^{z})^{x};  a_9 = z^{x}^{y};  a_10 = z^{y}^{x};  a_11 = (z^{x})^{y};  a_12 = (z^{y})^{x}. 

Let m be the maximum of all the a_{i}, and c be the smallest index (from 1 to 12) such that a_{c} = m. Rat's goal is to find that c, and he asks you to help him. Rat Kwesh wants to see how much cheese he gets, so he you will have to print the expression corresponding to that a_{c}.

 


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains three space-separated real numbers x, y and z (0.1 ≤ x, y, z ≤ 200.0). Each of x, y and z is given with exactly one digit after the decimal point.


-----Output-----

Find the maximum value of expression among x^{y}^{z}, x^{z}^{y}, (x^{y})^{z}, (x^{z})^{y}, y^{x}^{z}, y^{z}^{x}, (y^{x})^{z}, (y^{z})^{x}, z^{x}^{y}, z^{y}^{x}, (z^{x})^{y}, (z^{y})^{x} and print the corresponding expression. If there are many maximums, print the one that comes first in the list. 

x^{y}^{z} should be outputted as x^y^z (without brackets), and (x^{y})^{z} should be outputted as (x^y)^z (quotes for clarity). 


-----Examples-----
Input
1.1 3.4 2.5

Output
z^y^x

Input
2.0 2.0 2.0

Output
x^y^z

Input
1.9 1.8 1.7

Output
(x^y)^z
Program:
```
import math

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    (x, y, z) = map(float, input().split())
    expressions = [(x ** y ** z, 'x^y^z'), (x ** z ** y, 'x^z^y'), ((x ** y) ** z, '(x^y)^z'), ((x ** z) ** y, '(x^z)^y'), (y ** x ** z, 'y^x^z'), (y ** z ** x, 'y^z^x'), ((y ** x) ** z, '(y^x)^z'), ((y ** z) ** x, '(y^z)^x'), (z ** x ** y, 'z^x^y'), (z ** y ** x, 'z^y^x'), ((z ** x) ** y, '(z^x)^y'), ((z ** y) ** x, '(z^y)^x')]
    (max_value, max_expr) = max(expressions, key=lambda pair: pair[0])
    print(max_expr)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly evaluate the expressions as described. The calculation of the maximum value using the `max()` function may lead to a situation where two distinct expressions yield the same maximum value. In such cases, the program will return only one of them based on the appearance order in the list, but the logic to maintain the proper precedence of equal maximums is not specified.

For example, consider the input `2.0, 4.0, 2.0`. The expressions would evaluate to certain values where `x^y^z` and `y^z^x` could both potentially yield the same maximum value. According to the problem description, if multiple expressions yield the same maximum value, the first one in the order must be returned. The way the input is currently structured might not account for this properly, leading to an incorrect output. Thus, the program does not handle the tie-breaking case correctly, which breaks the requirement set by the problem statement.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import math

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x, y, and z are positive real numbers in the range [0.1, 200.0], each with exactly one digit after the decimal point.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    x, y, z = map(float, input().split())
    expressions = [(x ** y ** z, 'x^y^z'), (x ** z ** y, 'x^z^y'), ((x ** y) **
    z, '(x^y)^z'), ((x ** z) ** y, '(x^z)^y'), (y ** x ** z, 'y^x^z'), (y **
    z ** x, 'y^z^x'), ((y ** x) ** z, '(y^x)^z'), ((y ** z) ** x, '(y^z)^x'
    ), (z ** x ** y, 'z^x^y'), (z ** y ** x, 'z^y^x'), ((z ** x) ** y,
    '(z^x)^y'), ((z ** y) ** x, '(z^y)^x')]
    max_value, max_expr = max(expressions, key=lambda pair: pair[0])
    print(max_expr)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads three positive real numbers, x, y, and z, from standard input, each within the range [0.1, 200.0] and with exactly one digit after the decimal point. It evaluates a series of power expressions formed from these three numbers and determines the maximum value among them. The function then prints the expression that corresponds to this maximum value. Note that the function does not handle invalid inputs or any edge cases such as exceptions caused by reading from input. Additionally, it does not return a value; it solely prints the result.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
