The variable `a5` is assigned the value `y ** x ** z`. The expression `y ** x ** z` represents `y` raised to the power of `x` raised to the power of `z`. Since `x`, `y`, and `z` are all positive real numbers in the range [0.1, 200.0], the result of `y ** x ** z` will also be a positive real number. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, `z` are positive real numbers in the range [0.1, 200.0] with exactly one digit after the decimal point; `a1` is equal to `x`; `a2` is equal to `x`; `a3` is equal to `x`; `a4` is equal to `x`; `a5` is equal to `y ** x ** z`.**
