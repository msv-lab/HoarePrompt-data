The variable `a8` is assigned the value of `(y ** z) ** x`. Given that `y`, `z`, and `x` are positive real numbers in the range [0.1, 200.0], the value of `a8` will also be a positive real number. The previous states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`x`, `y`, `z` are positive real numbers in the range [0.1, 200.0] with exactly one digit after the decimal point; `a1` is equal to `x`; `a2` is equal to `x`; `a3` is equal to `x`; `a4` is equal to `x`; `a5` is equal to `y`; `a6` is equal to `y`; `a7` is equal to `(y`; `a8` is equal to `(y ** z) ** x`.**
