The code `ratings_before.append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `ratings_before`. The initial state states that `ratings_before` already includes the value of `a`. Therefore, the value of `ratings_before` will now include `a` twice, but the overall state does not change. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `ratings_before` includes the value of `a` twice; `ratings_after` includes the value of `b`.**
