The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `unrated` is False, the value of `ratings_before[i]` is less than the value of `ratings_before[j]`, and the value of `ratings_after[i]` is greater than the value of `ratings_after[j]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
