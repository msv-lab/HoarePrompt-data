The function `print('maybe')` outputs the string 'maybe' to the console but does not change any variable states or values. Therefore, after the execution, all preconditions stay the same.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 1000, `ratings` contains `n` tuples of integers, `is_rated` is False, `is_unrated` is False, and there are no pairs of consecutive ratings where the first element of the tuple at index `i - 1` is less than the first element of the tuple at index `i`.**
