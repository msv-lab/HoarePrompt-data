According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is given to be between 2 and 1000, the loop will execute at least once, starting from `i = 1`. Additionally, since `ratings` contains `n` tuples as specified, `ratings` is not empty.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` will take values from 1 up to `n-1`. Given that `is_rated` is False and `is_unrated` is also False, these states indicate that there are no special conditions that would stop the loop from executing.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, we do not need to adjust `ratings`, `is_rated`, or `is_unrated`, but we do acknowledge that `i` will start from 1 on the first iteration.

State: **`n` is between 2 and 1000, `ratings` contains `n` tuples of integers, `is_rated` is False, `is_unrated` is False, `i` is 1**
