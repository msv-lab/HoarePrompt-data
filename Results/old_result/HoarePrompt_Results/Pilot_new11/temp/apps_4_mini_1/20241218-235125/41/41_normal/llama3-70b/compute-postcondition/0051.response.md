Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `i` is 1, `j` is equal to `n - 1`, and `unrated` will be False if there exists any `j` (where `j` goes from 2 to `n - 1`) such that `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]`. If no such `j` exists, `unrated` remains True.**
