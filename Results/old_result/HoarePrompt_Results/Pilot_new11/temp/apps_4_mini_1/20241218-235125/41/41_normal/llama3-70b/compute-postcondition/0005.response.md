In the given code snippet, `ratings_before.append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `ratings_before`. The initial state provides no information about the contents of `ratings_before`, but it indicates that it is a list. Since only the list is affected, we will keep the information of `n`, `a`, and `b` intact.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `ratings_before` now includes the value of `a`.**
