Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `rated` is True indicating that there is at least one index `i` (where `i` is in the range 0 to `n-1`) such that `ratings_before[i]` is not equal to `ratings_after[i]`; `unrated` remains unchanged based on the relationship of `ratings_before` and `ratings_after`.***
