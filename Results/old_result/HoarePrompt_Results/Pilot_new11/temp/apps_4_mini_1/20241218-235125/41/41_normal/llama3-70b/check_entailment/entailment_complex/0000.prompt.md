You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Is it rated?

Here it is. The Ultimate Question of Competitive Programming, Codeforces, and Everything. And you are here to answer it.

Another Codeforces round has been conducted. No two participants have the same number of points. For each participant, from the top to the bottom of the standings, their rating before and after the round is known.

It's known that if at least one participant's rating has changed, then the round was rated for sure.

It's also known that if the round was rated and a participant with lower rating took a better place in the standings than a participant with higher rating, then at least one round participant's rating has changed.

In this problem, you should not make any other assumptions about the rating system.

Determine if the current round is rated, unrated, or it's impossible to determine whether it is rated of not.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of round participants.

Each of the next n lines contains two integers a_{i} and b_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i}, b_{i} ≤ 4126) — the rating of the i-th participant before and after the round, respectively. The participants are listed in order from the top to the bottom of the standings.


-----Output-----

If the round is rated for sure, print "rated". If the round is unrated for sure, print "unrated". If it's impossible to determine whether the round is rated or not, print "maybe".

2246 2246
1699 1699

Output
maybe



-----Note-----

In the first example, the ratings of the participants in the third and fifth places have changed, therefore, the round was rated.

In the second example, no one's rating has changed, but the participant in the second place has lower rating than the participant in the fourth place. Therefore, if the round was rated, someone's rating would've changed for sure.

In the third example, no one's rating has changed, and the participants took places in non-increasing order of their rating. Therefore, it's impossible to determine whether the round is rated or not.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, and for each of the next n lines, a_i and b_i are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 4126 representing the ratings before and after the round for each participant in ordered standings.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ratings_before = []
    ratings_after = []
    for _ in range(n):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        ratings_before.append(a)
        
        ratings_after.append(b)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 1000 \); `ratings_before` contains `n` values which are the input integers corresponding to `a`; `ratings_after` contains `n` values which are the input integers corresponding to `b`; `a` is the last input integer received; `b` is the last input integer received.
    rated = False
    unrated = True
    maybe = True
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j] and ratings_after[i
                ] > ratings_after[j]:
                unrated = False
                break
        
        if not unrated:
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `unrated` is False if there exists at least one pair `(i, j)` such that `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]`; otherwise, `unrated` is True. `i` is the index of the last evaluated element in `ratings_before`, `j` is the index of the last evaluated element in `ratings_before`, and both are within the range of `n`. `rated` is still False, and `maybe` remains True.
    for i in range(n):
        if ratings_before[i] != ratings_after[i]:
            rated = True
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `rated` is True if there is at least one index `i` such that `ratings_before[i]` is not equal to `ratings_after[i]`, otherwise `rated` is False; `i` is 0 to `n-1` depending on the number of iterations; `unrated` remains unchanged based on the relationship of `ratings_before` and `ratings_after`.
    if rated :
        print('rated')
    else :
        if unrated :
            print('unrated')
        else :
            print('maybe')
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000. If `unrated` is true, 'unrated' is printed. Otherwise, if `unrated` is false, the function outputs 'maybe', maintaining that `rated` is False and that all elements `ratings_before[i]` are equal to `ratings_after[i]` for all indices `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000. If `rated` is True, there is at least one index `i` (where `i` is in the range 0 to `n-1`) such that `ratings_before[i]` is not equal to `ratings_after[i]`, and the string 'rated' has been printed, with `unrated` remaining unchanged. If `rated` is False, and `unrated` is true, the string 'unrated' is printed. Otherwise, if `unrated` is false, the function outputs 'maybe', indicating that all elements `ratings_before[i]` are equal to `ratings_after[i]` for all indices `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes ratings for a specified number of participants and classifies the outcome based on the relationship between their ratings before and after a round. It accepts an integer `n` indicating the number of participants and `n` pairs of integers representing their ratings before (`a_i`) and after (`b_i`) the round. After evaluating these ratings, the function prints one of three possible outcomes: 'rated' if at least one participant's before and after ratings differ, 'unrated' if there are no pairs where a participant with a lower before rating has a higher after rating than another participant, and 'maybe' if all participants have the same ratings before and after. The function ensures that all comparisons and evaluations stay within the specified limits for input sizes.

The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
