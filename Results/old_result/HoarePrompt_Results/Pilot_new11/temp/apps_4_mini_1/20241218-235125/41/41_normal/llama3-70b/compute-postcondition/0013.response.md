The code appends the value of `a` to the list `ratings_before`. Before execution, `ratings_before` was [a, a], and after the execution, it becomes [a, a, a]. The values of `n`, `b`, and `ratings_after` are unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `ratings_before` is [a, a, a]; `ratings_after` is [b, b].**
