Postcondition: ***`n` is between 2 and 1000, `ratings` contains `n` tuples of integers. If `is_rated` is True, the output is 'rated' and the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `is_rated` is False, and `is_unrated` is True, this indicates that there exists at least one pair of consecutive ratings where the first element of the tuple at index `i - 1` is less than the first element of the tuple at index `i`, and the output is 'unrated'. If `is_unrated` is False, there are no such pairs of consecutive ratings.***
