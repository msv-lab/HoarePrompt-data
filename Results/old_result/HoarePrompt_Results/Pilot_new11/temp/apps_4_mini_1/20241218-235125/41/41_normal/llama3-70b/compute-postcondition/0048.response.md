The code assigns the value `False` to the variable `unrated`, but since `unrated` is already `False`, there is no change in its value. The values of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, and `unrated` is False.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, and `unrated` is False**
