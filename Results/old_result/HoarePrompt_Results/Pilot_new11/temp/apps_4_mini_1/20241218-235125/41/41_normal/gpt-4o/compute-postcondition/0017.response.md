`ratings` is modified to include the new tuple `(a, b)`. The content of `ratings` changes because we are appending a new element, but other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 1000, `is_rated` is True, `is_unrated` is False, `a` is a new input integer, `b` is a new input integer, `ratings` includes the tuples previously in the list plus the new tuple `(a, b)`, and the current iteration count is 3.**
