The value of `unrated` is assigned as `False`, but it was already `False`, so there is no change in value. Therefore, the other variables also remain unchanged. The output state reflects that no modifications occurred in this case.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `unrated` is False**
