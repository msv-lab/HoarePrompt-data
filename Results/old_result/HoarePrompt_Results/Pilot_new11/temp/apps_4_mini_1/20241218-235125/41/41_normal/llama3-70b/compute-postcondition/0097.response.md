The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it reads `n`, an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, followed by `n` pairs of integers, `a_i` and `b_i`, where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 4126. The output of the function is not explicitly stated but is implied to relate to the ratings before and after the round for each participant in the standings.

Functionality: **The function reads an integer n that specifies the number of participants and n pairs of integers representing their ratings before and after the round, and processes these ratings accordingly.**
