To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished executing, we must analyze the loop code and its conditions. 

The loop iterates for values of `j` starting from `i + 1` (which is 3) up to `n - 1`. Therefore, `j` will take on values starting from 3 and up to `n - 1`.

1. If `n` is exactly 4, the loop will execute for `j` = 3. The state will depend on the evaluation of the condition.  
2. If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, the loop will execute for `j` values from 3 to `n - 1`. Also, the loop checks whether `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]`. If at any point, this condition is true, `unrated` remains `False` and the loop will break; otherwise, if the condition never holds true for all iterations, `unrated` will remain `False`.

Thus, in all cases the values of the variables will be as follows after all iterations have finished:

- `n` will still be `n` (unchanged).
- `i` will be `2` (unchanged).
- `j` will end at `n` (it goes from `3` up to `n - 1`).
- `unrated` is `False` because the only time it might change would be if the break statement is reached, but we don’t have any context indicating it gets changed to `True`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `i` is 2, `j` is equal to `n - 1`, and `unrated` is False.**
