To determine the state at the beginning of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the given information carefully.

1. **Loop Details**: The loop statement is `for j in range(i + 1, n)`, which means `j` will start from `i + 1` and will go up to (but not including) `n`. 

2. **Current State**: At the end of the last iteration, we know:
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 4.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `j` is 3.

3. **Range for `j`**: Given that `i` is 2, the range for `j` in the next iteration will be `range(3, n)`. This means that `j` will take on the value of 3 in the next iteration, assuming `n` is sufficient.

4. **Next Iteration Criteria**: For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n`. Since `j` is currently 3, it means that for the loop to execute once more:
   - `n` must be greater than 3 (which aligns with the condition that `n` is at least 4).

5. **Updating `j`**: After the current iteration where `j` was 3, on the next iteration, `j` would become 4 (if it can increment).

Hence, our modified state would reflect that `j` is now 4, while still maintaining the other variables as per their conditions.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `unrated` is False**
