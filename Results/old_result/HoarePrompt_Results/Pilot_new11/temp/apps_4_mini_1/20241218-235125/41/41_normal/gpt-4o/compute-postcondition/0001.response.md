The variable `ratings` is assigned an empty list. The values of the variables `n`, `a[i]`, and `b[i]` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer with a value between 2 and 1000, and for each participant `i` (0 <= `i` < `n`), `a[i]` and `b[i]` are integers such that 1 <= `a[i]`, `b[i]` <= 4126; `ratings` is an empty list.**
