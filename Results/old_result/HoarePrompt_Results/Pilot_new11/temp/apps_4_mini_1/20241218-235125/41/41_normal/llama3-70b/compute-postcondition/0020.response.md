According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop starts at `i + 1`, which is 1 in this case since `i` is 0. The loop iterates as long as `j` is less than `n`. Given that `n` is at least 2 (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000), `j` will start from 1 and can execute as long as `n` is greater than 1.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` will be equal to `n`, but since it is a for-loop defined by `range(i + 1, n)`, it will include values from 1 up to (but not including) `n`. Therefore, with `n` being an integer within the defined range, the loop can execute.

To summarize, the conditions needed for the loop to execute are met, and the states are as follows:
- `n` must be between 2 and 1000 (which it is).
- `i` is 0.
- `j` will start at 1.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
