Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `s` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `s` <= 10^12, and `v` contains integers such that min(v) > 0. If `total` is less than `s`, `low` is now equal to `mid`, `mid` is recalculated as (low + high + 1) // 2, and `total` remains the sum of min(mid, x) for each x in v. Otherwise, `high` is equal to `mid - 1`, while `low` still remains less than `high`, and `mid` is also recalculated as (low + high + 1) // 2, with `total` staying the same as before.***
