Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer equal to the input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `s` is a non-negative integer equal to the input integer such that 1 <= `s` <= 10^12; `v` contains integers such that min(v) > 0; `low` is 0; `high` is min(v); `mid` is equal to (high + 1) // 2; the total is equal to the sum of min(mid, x) for each x in v, and the current value of `total` is less than `s`.***
