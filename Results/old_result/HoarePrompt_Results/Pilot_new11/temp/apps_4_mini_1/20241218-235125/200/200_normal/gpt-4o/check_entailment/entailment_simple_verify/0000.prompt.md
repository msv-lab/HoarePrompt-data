You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The Fair Nut likes kvass very much. On his birthday parents presented him $n$ kegs of kvass. There are $v_i$ liters of kvass in the $i$-th keg. Each keg has a lever. You can pour your glass by exactly $1$ liter pulling this lever. The Fair Nut likes this drink very much, so he wants to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass. But he wants to do it, so kvass level in the least keg is as much as possible.

Help him find out how much kvass can be in the least keg or define it's not possible to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $s$ ($1 \le n \le 10^3$, $1 \le s \le 10^{12}$) — the number of kegs and glass volume.

The second line contains $n$ integers $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n$ ($1 \le v_i \le 10^9$) — the volume of $i$-th keg.


-----Output-----

If the Fair Nut cannot pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass, print $-1$. Otherwise, print a single integer — how much kvass in the least keg can be.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3
4 3 5

Output
3

Input
3 4
5 3 4

Output
2

Input
3 7
1 2 3

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example, the answer is $3$, the Fair Nut can take $1$ liter from the first keg and $2$ liters from the third keg. There are $3$ liters of kvass in each keg.

In the second example, the answer is $2$, the Fair Nut can take $3$ liters from the first keg and $1$ liter from the second keg.

In the third example, the Fair Nut can't pour his cup by $7$ liters, so the answer is $-1$.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, s) = map(int, input().split())
    volumes = list(map(int, input().split()))
    volumes.sort()
    total_volume = sum(volumes)
    if total_volume < s:
        print(-1)
    else:
        min_keg_volume = volumes[0]
        remaining_kvass = s
        for i in range(n):
            if volumes[i] <= min_keg_volume:
                continue
            else:
                possible_to_take = min(volumes[i] - min_keg_volume, remaining_kvass)
                remaining_kvass -= possible_to_take
            if remaining_kvass == 0:
                break
        if remaining_kvass > 0:
            min_keg_volume -= (remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n
        print(min_keg_volume)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program, let us analyze its logic based on the problem description. The task is to help the Fair Nut determine how much kvass can remain in the least keg after he pours a specified volume of kvass from n kegs.

1. **Input Validation**: The program reads two integers n (number of kegs) and s (liters to pour). It then reads a list of integers representing the volume of kvass in each keg. 

2. **Checking Total Volume**: The program checks if the total volume of kvass in all kegs is less than the required volume s. If true, it prints -1, as it is not possible to pour that much kvass.

3. **Keg Calculation**: The program aims to keep the kvass level in the least keg as high as possible. It tracks the minimum keg's volume and attempts to pour kvass from the other kegs without reducing the minimum keg too much.

4. **Pouring Logic**: It uses a for loop to pour kvass from each keg until it meets the required volume or exhausts the possibility of further pouring.

Now let's consider potential edge cases:

- **Edge Case 1**: When s is exactly equal to the total volume in the kegs. If the kegs contain varying volumes, the implementation needs to ensure that it can pour precisely s liters without violating the condition regarding the minimum keg.
  
- **Edge Case 2**: If all kegs have the same volume and s equals n times that volume, resulting in all kegs being emptied equally. In this case, the minimum keg can't be defined (should it be 0 or still considered the original volume).

Upon further analysis of the given program, I found a potential flaw, specifically in the calculation of the remaining kvass after it might have been depleted:

1. Suppose all kegs have an identical maximum volume, and s is such that the total available volume is just enough. The program may improperly reduce the minimum keg's possible volume below what it could have been because it doesn't correctly handle cases where further pouring would not improve the minimum keg's volume.

2. For an instance: If kegs have volumes `[5, 5, 5]` and `s = 5`: the correct output should be `5`, but in scenarios where poor iteration considers excess consumption from one keg reducing others prematurely could yield incorrect results.

Thus, due to these overlooked conditions where the program's mechanics may result in an incorrect minimum keg volume or incorrect output situation in edge cases, the final conclusion is:

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, s is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= s <= 10^12, and v is a list of n integers where each integer v[i] satisfies 1 <= v[i] <= 10^9.
def func():
    n, s = map(int, input().split())
    volumes = list(map(int, input().split()))
    volumes.sort()
    total_volume = sum(volumes)
    if (total_volume < s) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        min_keg_volume = volumes[0]
        remaining_kvass = s
        for i in range(n):
            if volumes[i] <= min_keg_volume:
                continue
            else:
                possible_to_take = min(volumes[i] - min_keg_volume, remaining_kvass)
                remaining_kvass -= possible_to_take
            
            if remaining_kvass == 0:
                break
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `remaining_kvass` equals the initial `s` minus the total kvass taken from eligible volumes; `possible_to_take` is the last value taken from the eligible volumes, or remains undefined if no volumes were eligible; `i` is `n`, representing all volumes attempted.
        if (remaining_kvass > 0) :
            min_keg_volume -= (remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n
        #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; if `remaining_kvass` is greater than 0, `min_keg_volume` is decreased by `(remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n`. If `remaining_kvass` is not greater than 0, no changes are made to `min_keg_volume`.
        print(min_keg_volume)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `s` is a non-negative integer satisfying 1 <= `s` <= 10^12; `volumes` is a sorted list of `n` integers; `total_volume` is the sum of integers in `volumes`. If `total_volume` is less than `s`, the function maintains the current values of `n`, `s`, and `volumes`, and `total_volume` remains less than `s`. If `total_volume` is greater than or equal to `s`, and `remaining_kvass` > 0, then `min_keg_volume` is adjusted by subtracting `(remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n`; otherwise, `min_keg_volume` remains unchanged.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
