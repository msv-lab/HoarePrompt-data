The statement `continue` does not change the values of any variables, but it causes the loop execution to skip to the next iteration. The values of `n`, `i`, and `volumes[i]` remain unchanged. Thus, the state of the program indicates that we are still within a loop structure but moving to the next iteration due to the `continue` statement. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `i` is 0, and the current value of `volumes[i]` is less than or equal to `min_keg_volume; continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
