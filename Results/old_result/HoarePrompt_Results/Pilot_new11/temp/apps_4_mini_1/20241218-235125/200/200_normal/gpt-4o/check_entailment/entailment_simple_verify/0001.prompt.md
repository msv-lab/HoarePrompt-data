You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The Fair Nut likes kvass very much. On his birthday parents presented him $n$ kegs of kvass. There are $v_i$ liters of kvass in the $i$-th keg. Each keg has a lever. You can pour your glass by exactly $1$ liter pulling this lever. The Fair Nut likes this drink very much, so he wants to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass. But he wants to do it, so kvass level in the least keg is as much as possible.

Help him find out how much kvass can be in the least keg or define it's not possible to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $s$ ($1 \le n \le 10^3$, $1 \le s \le 10^{12}$) — the number of kegs and glass volume.

The second line contains $n$ integers $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n$ ($1 \le v_i \le 10^9$) — the volume of $i$-th keg.


-----Output-----

If the Fair Nut cannot pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass, print $-1$. Otherwise, print a single integer — how much kvass in the least keg can be.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3
4 3 5

Output
3

Input
3 4
5 3 4

Output
2

Input
3 7
1 2 3

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example, the answer is $3$, the Fair Nut can take $1$ liter from the first keg and $2$ liters from the third keg. There are $3$ liters of kvass in each keg.

In the second example, the answer is $2$, the Fair Nut can take $3$ liters from the first keg and $1$ liter from the second keg.

In the third example, the Fair Nut can't pour his cup by $7$ liters, so the answer is $-1$.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, s) = map(int, input().split())
    volumes = list(map(int, input().split()))
    volumes.sort()
    total_volume = sum(volumes)
    if total_volume < s:
        print(-1)
    else:
        min_keg_volume = volumes[0]
        remaining_kvass = s
        for i in range(n):
            if volumes[i] <= min_keg_volume:
                continue
            else:
                possible_to_take = min(volumes[i] - min_keg_volume, remaining_kvass)
                remaining_kvass -= possible_to_take
            if remaining_kvass == 0:
                break
        if remaining_kvass > 0:
            min_keg_volume -= (remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n
        print(min_keg_volume)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze how the program behaves with given input scenarios and edge cases.

### Key Requirements from the Problem Description:
1. The sum of kvass in all kegs must be at least `s`. If not, the output should be `-1`.
2. If enough kvass can be poured, the goal is to maximize the minimum amount of kvass left in the least filled keg after pouring out `s` liters.

### Analyzing the Code:
1. **Input Reading and Sorting**: 
   - The input values (n and s) and the kegs' volumes are read and sorted. Sorting helps easily find the minimum keg.
  
2. **Checking Total Volume**:
   - It checks if the total volume is less than `s`. If true, the program correctly prints `-1`.

3. **Pouring Logic**:
   - The program then initializes `min_keg_volume` as the first element of the sorted volumes and uses a loop to simulate the pouring of kvass from the kegs.
   - It attempts to equalize the pouring from other kegs to minimize the impact on the least filled keg.
   - If `remaining_kvass` is still greater than 0 after attempting to pour from all other kegs, it computes how much more can be sacrificed equally among kegs to preserve the minimum level in `min_keg_volume`.

4. **Final Result**:
   - Finally, it prints the effective minimum amount of kvass left in the least keg.

### Potential Edge Cases:
We'll examine potential edge cases where the logic could fail. Here are a few important ones:

- **Case 1**: When kegs have exactly the amount needed.
    - Input: `4 4`, `1 1 1 1`
      - Expected Output: `-1` because the total is exactly what we needed.
      - Current Output: The program would incorrectly alter `min_keg_volume` even though it's not possible to take any more kvass.

- **Case 2**: When the smallest keg is significantly smaller than the total volume.
    - Input: `3 6`, `2 2 9`
      - Here, it's possible to pour `6` liters, but would leave the smallest keg at `0`, making the output theoretically `0`.
      - The output would be `0`, which is expected.

Based on these observations, I conclude that the program is **not** handling the first case correctly. 

### Correctness Evaluation:
Since the program fails for at least one test case derived from the potential edge cases provided by the problem description, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, s is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= s <= 10^12, and v is a list of n integers where each integer v[i] satisfies 1 <= v[i] <= 10^9.
def func():
    n, s = map(int, input().split())
    volumes = list(map(int, input().split()))
    volumes.sort()
    total_volume = sum(volumes)
    if (total_volume < s) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        min_keg_volume = volumes[0]
        remaining_kvass = s
        for i in range(n):
            if volumes[i] <= min_keg_volume:
                continue
            else:
                possible_to_take = min(volumes[i] - min_keg_volume, remaining_kvass)
                remaining_kvass -= possible_to_take
            
            if remaining_kvass == 0:
                break
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `remaining_kvass` equals the initial `s` minus the total kvass taken from eligible volumes; `possible_to_take` is the last value taken from the eligible volumes, or remains undefined if no volumes were eligible; `i` is `n`, representing all volumes attempted.
        if (remaining_kvass > 0) :
            min_keg_volume -= (remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n
        #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; if `remaining_kvass` is greater than 0, `min_keg_volume` is decreased by `(remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n`. If `remaining_kvass` is not greater than 0, no changes are made to `min_keg_volume`.
        print(min_keg_volume)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `s` is a non-negative integer satisfying 1 <= `s` <= 10^12; `volumes` is a sorted list of `n` integers; `total_volume` is the sum of integers in `volumes`. If `total_volume` is less than `s`, the function maintains the current values of `n`, `s`, and `volumes`, and `total_volume` remains less than `s`. If `total_volume` is greater than or equal to `s`, and `remaining_kvass` > 0, then `min_keg_volume` is adjusted by subtracting `(remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n`; otherwise, `min_keg_volume` remains unchanged.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
