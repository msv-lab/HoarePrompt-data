Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `i` is 0, and `volumes[i]` is greater than `min_keg_volume`, `possible_to_take` is set to the minimum of (`volumes[i] - min_keg_volume`, `remaining_kvass`), `remaining_kvass` has been decreased by `possible_to_take`, and currently, `remaining_kvass` is equal to 0.***
