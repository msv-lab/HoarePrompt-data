Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer equal to the input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `s` is a non-negative integer equal to the input integer such that 1 <= `s` <= 10^12; `v` contains integers such that min(v) > 0; if the total sum of min(mid, x) for each x in `v` is less than `s`, then `low` is equal to `mid`; otherwise, `low` is 0, `high` is min(v) - 1, and `mid` is equal to (min(v) + 1) // 2, with the value of `total` being greater than or equal to `s`.***
