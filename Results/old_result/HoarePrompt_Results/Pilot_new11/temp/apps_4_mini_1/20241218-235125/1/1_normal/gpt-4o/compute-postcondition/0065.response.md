Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string, `n` is at least 1, `bind` is greater than `ind + 1`, `i` is less than or equal to `ind`, `start_colon` remains -1 or is a valid index if a colon was found before the loop started; `end_colon` is either the index of the last colon found (if a colon was present in the range) or -1 (if no colon was found in the examined range). Additionally, either `start_colon` is -1, `end_colon` is -1, or `start_colon` is greater than or equal to `end_colon`.***
