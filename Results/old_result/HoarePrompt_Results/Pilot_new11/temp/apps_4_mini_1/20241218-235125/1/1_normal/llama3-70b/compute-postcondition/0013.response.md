Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is the length of `s`, which is greater than 0; `ind` is 0; `f` is True; `i` is 0; if the character at index `i` of `s` is ':', the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, `ind`, `f`, and `i` maintain their original values and `s[i]` remains unchanged.***
