The variable `bind` is assigned the value of `i`. Given that `i` is `n - 2`, after the assignment, `bind` will hold the value `n - 2`. The values of `s`, `n`, and the original value of `bind` are unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is at least 1; `bind` is `n - 2`; `i` is `n - 2`.

Output State: **`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is at least 1; `bind` is `n - 2`; `i` is `n - 2`**
