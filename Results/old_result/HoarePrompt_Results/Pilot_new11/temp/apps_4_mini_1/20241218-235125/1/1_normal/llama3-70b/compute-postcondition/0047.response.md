Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `n - 2; `f` remains unchanged; if `f` is true, then `bind` is equal to `n - 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change to the values of `s`, `n`, `i`, `f`, or `bind`.***
