Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is at least 1; `bind` must be greater than `ind + 3; `i` is `ind + 3; if `s[i]` is a colon (`:`), then `start_colon` is `ind + 3` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. There is no else part to consider.***
