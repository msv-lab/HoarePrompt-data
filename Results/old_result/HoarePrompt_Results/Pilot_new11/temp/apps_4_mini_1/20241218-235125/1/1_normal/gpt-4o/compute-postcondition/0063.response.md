Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string, `n` is at least 1, `bind` is greater than `ind + 2`, `i` is `bind - 3`, and `start_colon` is -1 or a valid index if a colon is present. If `s[i]` is a colon, then `end_colon` is set to `bind - 3`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
