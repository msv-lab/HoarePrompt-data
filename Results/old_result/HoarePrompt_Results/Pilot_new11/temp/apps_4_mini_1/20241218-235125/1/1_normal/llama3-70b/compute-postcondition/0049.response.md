Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `n - 2;` if `s[i]` is ']', then `f` is True and `bind` remains unchanged. If `s[i]` is not ']', and if `s[i]` is ':', and if `f` is true, then `bind` is set to `n - 2`; if `s[i]` is not ':', there are no changes to the values of `s`, `n`, `i`, `f`, or `bind`.***
