According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of the string `n`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 with each iteration of the loop, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `n` is greater than 0, meaning that the loop has executed at least once and `i` is less than `n`. Therefore, in order for the loop to run again, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is the length of `s`, which is greater than 0; `i` is incremented to `i + 1`, and the condition `i` must be less than `n` holds true.**
