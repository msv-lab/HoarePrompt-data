Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string, `n` is at least 1, `bind` is greater than `ind + 1`, `i` is `start_colon + 2`, `start_colon` must be less than `end_colon - 1`, `end_colon` is a valid index not equal to -1; if the character at index `i` of `s` is '|', then `pipe_count` is incremented by 1, resulting in a new value for `pipe_count`. If the character at index `i` is not '|', the value of `pipe_count` remains unchanged.***
