`ind` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 2. The previous value of `ind` is not defined in the initial state, but it is now set to 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and | with a length between 1 and 500,000 (inclusive); `n` is at least 2; `i` is 2; `ind` is now 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
