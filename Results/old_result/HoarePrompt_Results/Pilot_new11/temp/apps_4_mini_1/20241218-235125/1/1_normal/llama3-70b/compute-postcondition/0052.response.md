The value of `bind` is assigned the value of `i`, which is `n - 3`. Since `n` must be greater than 2, `i` will be a positive integer. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |; `n` must be greater than 2; `i` is `n - 3`; `f` remains unchanged; `bind` is now equal to `n - 3`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |; `n` must be greater than 2; `i` is `n - 3`; `f` remains unchanged; `bind` is equal to `n - 3`**.
