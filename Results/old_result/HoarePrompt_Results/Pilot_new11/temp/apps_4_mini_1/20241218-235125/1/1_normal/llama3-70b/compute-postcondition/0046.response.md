The `break` statement is used to exit the nearest enclosing loop or conditional block. Since no loops or conditionals are presented in the provided code snippet, execution will simply end without changing any variables. Therefore, the values of the variables remain the same, though the execution context indicates that control has exited from a loop or conditional if one were present. 

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `n - 2; `f` remains unchanged; `bind` is equal to `n - 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
