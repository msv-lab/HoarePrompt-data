Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is at least 1; `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of ']' in `s`; `i` is `ind + 2`. If `s[i]` is equal to ':', then `start_colon` is set to `ind + 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
