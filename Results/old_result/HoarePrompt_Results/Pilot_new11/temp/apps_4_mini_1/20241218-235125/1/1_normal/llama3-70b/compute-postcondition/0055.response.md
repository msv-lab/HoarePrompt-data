Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is greater than 2; `i` is `n - 3`; `f` remains unchanged. If `s[i]` equals `':'` and `f` evaluates to true, `bind` is set to `n - 3`, and execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[i]` does not equal `':'`, no changes are made to `bind`, `f`, or any other variables.***
