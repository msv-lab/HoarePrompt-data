The variable `end_colon` is assigned the value of `i`. Given that `i` is defined as `bind - 3`, we now have `end_colon` equal to `bind - 3`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an input string, `n` is at least 1, `bind` must be greater than `ind + 2`, `i` is `bind - 3`, `start_colon` is -1 or a valid index if a colon is present, and `end_colon` is equal to `bind - 3`.
