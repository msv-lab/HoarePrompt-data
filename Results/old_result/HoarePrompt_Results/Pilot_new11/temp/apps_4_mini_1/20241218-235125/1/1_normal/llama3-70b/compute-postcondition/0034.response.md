In this case, the variable `f` is assigned the value `True`. The other variables (`s`, `n`, and `i`) remain unchanged in terms of values, but `i` is still `n - 1`, and the current value of `s[i]` is `']'`. The output state provides the current status of all variables along with the new value of `f`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `n - 1`; the current value of `s[i]` is ']'; `f` is True**
