Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `n - 2`; `f` remains unchanged; if `s[i]` is equal to ':', and if `f` is true, then `bind` is set to `n - 2` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, there are no changes to the values of `s`, `n`, `i`, `f`, or `bind`.***
