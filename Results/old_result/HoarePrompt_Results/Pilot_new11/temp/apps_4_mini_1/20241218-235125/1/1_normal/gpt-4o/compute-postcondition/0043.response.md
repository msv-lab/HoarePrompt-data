The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is at least 1; `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of ']' in `s`; `i` is `ind + 2`; `start_colon` is equal to `ind + 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
