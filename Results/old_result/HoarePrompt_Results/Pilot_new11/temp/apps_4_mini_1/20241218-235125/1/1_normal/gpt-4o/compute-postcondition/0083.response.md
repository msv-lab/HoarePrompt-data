Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is at least 1; `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of ']' in `s` or -1 if ']' does not exist in `s`; `i` is -1 after all iterations are completed. If `ind` is -1 or `bind` is -1 or `ind` is greater than or equal to `bind`, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, if `bind` is greater than `ind + 1`, `start_colon` and `end_colon` are valid indices with `start_colon` less than `end_colon - 1`, `end_colon` not equal to -1, and `pipe_count` is the total number of '|' characters found between the indices `start_colon + 1` and `end_colon`, then `result` is equal to `4 + pipe_count`, which is printed.***
