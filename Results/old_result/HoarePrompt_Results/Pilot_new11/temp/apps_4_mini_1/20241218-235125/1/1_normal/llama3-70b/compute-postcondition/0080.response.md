Functionality: The function accepts a string `s` that consists of lowercase Latin letters and the characters `[`, `]`, `:`, and `|`, with a length between 1 and 500,000 characters. It searches for the first `:` that follows a `[`, and the last `:` that precedes a `]`. If either of these `:` indices is not valid (i.e., if one of them is `-1` or if the first index is greater than or equal to the last index), the function prints `-1`. If valid indices are found, it calculates a value `ans`, starting from `4`, and increments it by the count of `|` characters found between these two indices (exclusive). Finally, it prints the value of `ans`. If no valid `:` characters are found between the brackets, or if the configuration does not meet the specified conditions, it would result in `-1` being printed. 

This function, however, does not explicitly return a value; it only prints output based on the conditions evaluated. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where `s` does not contain any `[` or `]` at all, which could lead to incorrect behavior or assumptions. Therefore, the complete behavior of the function considers potential edge cases like input strings with no valid bracket pairs or colons, ensuring that it accurately assesses the existence of necessary characters.
