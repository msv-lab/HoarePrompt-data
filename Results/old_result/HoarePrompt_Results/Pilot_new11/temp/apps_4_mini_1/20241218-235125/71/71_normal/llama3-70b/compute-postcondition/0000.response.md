The variables `n` and `k` are assigned the values obtained from the `input()` function, which is then processed by `map(int, ...)` to convert the split input strings into integers. The values of `n` and `k` are directly obtained from user input but are constrained by their defined ranges, where `n` must remain a non-negative integer between 0 and 2,000,000,000 and `k` must be a positive integer between 1 and 9. The previous range constraints still apply.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 2,000,000,000; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 9; and `n`, `k` now hold the values from input as integers.**
