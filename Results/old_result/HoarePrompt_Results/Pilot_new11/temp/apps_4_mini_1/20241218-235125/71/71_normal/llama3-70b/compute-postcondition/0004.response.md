The operation `n //= 10` performs an integer division of `n` by 10, which reduces `n` to a smaller value. Given the initial state of `n` as a non-negative integer that is not a multiple of 10, this operation will divide `n` by 10 and assign the resulting quotient back to `n`. The value of `w` is increased by 1 but is not directly related to `n`.

After the operation, the possible values for `n` can be determined as follows:
- Since `n` is not a multiple of 10, the new value of `n` after performing `n //= 10` will always remain a valid integer (either 0 or a value less than the initial value of `n`), as the denominator is greater than zero.

The value of `w` has increased by 1 from its previous amount.

Therefore, the output state reflects the updated values of `n` and `w`, while maintaining all relevant information about the initial conditions.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 200,000,000 and n is not a multiple of 10; `w` is increased by 1; new n is `n // 10` (floor division of n by 10)**
