In this scenario, `k` is assigned the value of `int(k)`, converting the string representation of `k` to an integer. The variable `n` remains unchanged and continues to be a string. The initial information about the variables remains valid, but `k` now holds an integer value.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ n ≤ 2,000,000,000), `k` is now a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 9), `n` is now a string, `k` is now an integer.**
