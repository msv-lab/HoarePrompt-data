According to the code, the loop executes for each digit in `n` when iterating in reverse. The loop can execute again if there are more digits to process. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, indicating that it contains at least one digit, and `k` is a positive integer. 

If we consider the iteration over the digits in reverse, we need to check the number of digits in `n`. If `n` has more digits, the next digit will be accessed on the next iteration.

Since the loop is iterating in reverse, we expect the digit variable to take on the next digit from the left side (or a higher place value when considering the magnitude). Therefore, if there is at least one more digit to process, the loop will run again.

Given that `digit` is currently set to the last digit of `n`, the next iteration will capture the preceding digit. The states can then be adjusted as follows:

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer, digit is the next digit from the left of the previous digit processed**
