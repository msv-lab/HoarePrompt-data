The code snippet updates the values of `n` and `k` by taking input and mapping it to strings. The initial state provides that `n` is a non-negative integer and `k` is a positive integer. However, after the `map(str, input().split())` operation, both `n` and `k` will become strings. The previous conditions regarding the constraints of `n` and `k` remain valid, but now their types have changed.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ n ≤ 2,000,000,000), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 9), `n` is now a string, `k` is now a string**
