According to the code, the loop iterates over the keys in the dictionary `d`. For the loop to execute at least once, `d` must contain at least one key, meaning that the dictionary should not be empty. The values of `n`, `c`, `a1`, and `a2` do not influence the execution of the loop since they are not used in the loop's execution or condition. 

Since we know that `a` is an array of `n` integers and `d` is a dictionary constructed from `a`, it is dependent on `a` having unique values for `d` to not be empty. Thus, in order for the loop to execute at least once:

1. `d` must have at least one key.
2. The variables `c`, `a1`, and `a2` can remain unchanged.
3. In case `d` has keys that were derived from integers in `a`, it must be noted implicitly.

Thus, to ensure the loop executes, I will say that `d` must not be empty, and since `n` is already confined to even integers between 2 and 100, `n` itself does not need to be specified further.

State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` contains `n` integers, `d` must not be empty, `c` is 0, `a1` is -1, `a2` is -1**
