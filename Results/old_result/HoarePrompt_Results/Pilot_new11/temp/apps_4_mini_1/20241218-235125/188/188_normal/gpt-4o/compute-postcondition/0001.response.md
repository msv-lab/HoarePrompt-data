The variable `cards` is assigned a list of integers obtained from the input, where the number of integers is determined by the previous value of `n`. The integers in the list are constrained by the input condition (each integer between 1 and 100). The previous value of `n` remains unchanged, but it dictates how many integers will be collected. 

If we assume `n` is replaced by the input integer, then the list `cards` will contain `n` integers.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 100; `cards` is a list of `n` integers obtained from input, where each integer is within the range of 1 to 100.**
