Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical issue that fails to correctly assess when a fair game is possible. Specifically, it only checks for the case where there are two distinct integers, each appearing exactly n/2 times. 

A critical edge case that this code doesn't handle correctly is when there are more than two distinct integers, but one of them appears n/2 times and another appears the remaining (n/2) times. For instance, consider the input:

```
4
1
1
2
2
```

This should return "YES" and the output should be "1 2" because both Petya and Vasya can choose 1 and 2 respectively, and the counts are equal (two cards each). However, the program would not consider this a valid case due to its current logic that it has implemented.

Thus, since the program does not account for all conditions under which a fair game can happen, it is incorrect.
