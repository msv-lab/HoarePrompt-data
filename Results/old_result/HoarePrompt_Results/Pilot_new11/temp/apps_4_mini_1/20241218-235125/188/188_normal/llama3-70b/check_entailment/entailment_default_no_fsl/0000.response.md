Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine whether Petya and Vasya can fairly play the game with the given cards. The main issue is that it only checks for cases where exactly two distinct integers appear `n / 2` times without considering other configurations that could make the game fair.

For example, consider the case where the input is:
```
4
1
1
2
2
```
In this case, the integers 1 and 2 each appear twice, which allows for a fair game. The program would output "NO" because it only checks if exactly two integers appear `n / 2` times, but in this case, there are two integers that each meet that condition. The correct output should be "YES" followed by `1 2`.

Additionally, the program does not handle cases where more than two distinct integers might yield a valid configuration, since it incorrectly assumes that there can only be two valid integers. Thus, it misses multiple potential cases where a fair game could be possible.

Hence, the logic leading to the decision-making in the program is insufficient, and it fails to accurately output results for valid configurations of card integers. Therefore, the correctness is evaluated as false.
