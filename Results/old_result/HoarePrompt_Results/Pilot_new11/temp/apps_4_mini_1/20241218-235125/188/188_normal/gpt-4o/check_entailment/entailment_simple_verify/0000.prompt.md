You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Petya and Vasya decided to play a game. They have n cards (n is an even number). A single integer is written on each card.

Before the game Petya will choose an integer and after that Vasya will choose another integer (different from the number that Petya chose). During the game each player takes all the cards with number he chose. For example, if Petya chose number 5 before the game he will take all cards on which 5 is written and if Vasya chose number 10 before the game he will take all cards on which 10 is written.

The game is considered fair if Petya and Vasya can take all n cards, and the number of cards each player gets is the same.

Determine whether Petya and Vasya can choose integer numbers before the game so that the game is fair. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) — number of cards. It is guaranteed that n is an even number.

The following n lines contain a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (one integer per line, 1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100) — numbers written on the n cards.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible for Petya and Vasya to choose numbers in such a way that the game will be fair, print "NO" (without quotes) in the first line. In this case you should not print anything more.

In the other case print "YES" (without quotes) in the first line. In the second line print two distinct integers — number that Petya should choose and the number that Vasya should choose to make the game fair. If there are several solutions, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
4
11
27
27
11

Output
YES
11 27

Input
2
6
6

Output
NO

Input
6
10
20
30
20
10
20

Output
NO

Input
6
1
1
2
2
3
3

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example the game will be fair if, for example, Petya chooses number 11, and Vasya chooses number 27. Then the will take all cards — Petya will take cards 1 and 4, and Vasya will take cards 2 and 3. Thus, each of them will take exactly two cards.

In the second example fair game is impossible because the numbers written on the cards are equal, but the numbers that Petya and Vasya should choose should be distinct.

In the third example it is impossible to take all cards. Petya and Vasya can take at most five cards — for example, Petya can choose number 10 and Vasya can choose number 20. But for the game to be fair it is necessary to take 6 cards.
Program:
```
from collections import Counter

def func():
    n = int(input())
    cards = [int(input()) for _ in range(n)]
    count = Counter(cards)
    unique_numbers = sorted(count.keys(), key=lambda x: count[x])
    if len(unique_numbers) < 2:
        print('NO')
    elif count[unique_numbers[-1]] == n // 2 and count[unique_numbers[-2]] == n // 2:
        print('YES')
        print(unique_numbers[-1], unique_numbers[-2])
    else:
        print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, I will analyze the provided implementation.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input**: 
   - An even number `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of cards.
   - `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing card values.

2. **Output**: 
   - If a fair game is possible, print "YES" followed by two distinct integers (the numbers chosen by Petya and Vasya).
   - If not, print "NO".

3. **Conditions for fairness**:
   - Both chosen integers must result in an equal number of cards for each player.
   - Both integers must be distinct.

### Review of the Code:
1. **Counter and Unique Values**: 
   - The code uses `Counter` to count occurrences of each card number.
   - It then creates a sorted list of the unique numbers based on their frequency.

2. **Logic**:
   - It checks if there are at least two unique numbers.
   - It checks if the two most frequent numbers each appear exactly `n // 2` times.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **Case with Less than Two Unique Numbers**:
   - If all cards have the same value, the program correctly outputs "NO" since distinct integers are required.
   - Example: `2, 6, 6`.

2. **Case with More than Two Unique Numbers**:
   - The program checks only the top two most frequent card values. 
   - It does not handle the case where there might be multiple distinct numbers, and selecting the right pair is crucial.
   - For instance, given the cards: `[10, 20, 30, 20, 10, 20]`, the output is "NO", but it should also consider other pair combinations.

3. **Edge Case Example**:
   - List: `[1, 1, 2, 2]` — Here both have equal counts, the program correctly outputs "NO". It does work as expected.
   - Now consider: Input `4, 1, 1, 2, 2` (4 cards, `1` occurs twice, `2` occurs twice). This should be valid and produce "YES" output as both players get 2 cards.

### Conclusion:
The logic relies solely on the two most frequent numbers and doesn't comprehensively assess all combinations that could lead to a valid configuration for a fair game.

### Final Assessment:
The program overlooks valid combinations that can provide distinct integers with equal numbers of cards. The testing of edge cases reveals this flaw.

Correctness: **False**. 

A specific failing case would be:
- Input: `4`, `1`, `1`, `2`, `2`, should yield "YES" and not "NO".

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the following n integers a_i (where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) represent the numbers written on the n cards.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    cards = [int(input()) for _ in range(n)]
    count = Counter(cards)
    unique_numbers = sorted(count.keys(), key=lambda x: count[x])
    if (len(unique_numbers) < 2) :
        print('NO')
    else :
        if (count[unique_numbers[-1]] == n // 2 and count[unique_numbers[-2]] == n // 2) :
            print('YES')
            print(unique_numbers[-1], unique_numbers[-2])
        else :
            print('NO')
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `cards` is a list of `n` integers obtained from input, where each integer is within the range of 1 to 100; `count` is a Counter object representing the frequencies of each integer in `cards`; `unique_numbers` is a sorted list of unique integers based on their frequency in ascending order and has a length of 2 or greater. If the count of the most frequent integer and the second most frequent integer in `unique_numbers` are both equal to n // 2, then the output is 'YES' and the printed values are the two most frequent integers in `unique_numbers`. Otherwise, the output is 'NO'.

If the length of `unique_numbers` is less than 2, the output is 'NO'. Otherwise, if `unique_numbers` has a length of 2 or greater, the output is 'YES' if the most frequent and the second most frequent integers in `unique_numbers` both have a frequency of n // 2, with the printed values being these two most frequent integers; otherwise, the output is 'NO'.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
