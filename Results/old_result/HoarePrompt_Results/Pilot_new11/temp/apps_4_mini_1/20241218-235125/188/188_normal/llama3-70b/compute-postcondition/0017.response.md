The code `d[i] += 1` increments the value at index `i` of the list `d` by 1. The initial state specifies that `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, and `i` is the second integer in the list `a`. Therefore, `i` will have a specific value based on `a`, which consists of `n` integers. The exact value of `d[i]` before the operation is not specified, but it can be assumed that it is an integer.

Consequently, the new value of `d[i]` will be its previous value increased by 1, and no other variables are affected.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` contains `n` integers, `i` is the second integer from list `a`, and `d[i]` is increased by 1.**
