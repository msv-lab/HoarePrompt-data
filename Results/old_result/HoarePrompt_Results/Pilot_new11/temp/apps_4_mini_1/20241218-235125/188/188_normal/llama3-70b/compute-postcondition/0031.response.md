The variable `c` is incremented by 1. The value of `c` initially is 0, so after the operation `c += 1`, the new value of `c` will be 1. The states of other variables remain unchanged, and the initial conditions are still valid. 

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` contains `n` integers, `d` must not be empty, `c` is 1, `a1` is equal to `i`, `a2` is -1, and the current value of the element `d[i]` is equal to `n` divided by 2.**
