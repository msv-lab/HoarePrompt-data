The code snippet assigns the values -1 to both `a1` and `a2`. The initial state of the variables `n`, `a`, `d`, and `c` remains unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, `a1` and `a2` are updated, while the other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` contains `n` integers, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `a` and each value is the count of occurrences of that integer in `a`, `c` is 0, `a1` is -1, `a2` is -1**
