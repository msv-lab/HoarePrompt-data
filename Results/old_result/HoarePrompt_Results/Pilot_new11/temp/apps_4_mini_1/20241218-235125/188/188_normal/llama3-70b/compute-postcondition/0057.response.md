Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` contains `n` integers, `d` is a dictionary containing key-value pairs where the keys are the integers from `a` and the values are their counts, and `c` is either 0, 1, or 2. If `a1` and `a2` are both not -1, then 'YES' has been printed along with the values of `a1` and `a2`. If either `a1` or `a2` is -1, then 'NO' has been printed, indicating that either no integers with a count of `n // 2` were found or that they do not correspond to valid integers with that count.***
