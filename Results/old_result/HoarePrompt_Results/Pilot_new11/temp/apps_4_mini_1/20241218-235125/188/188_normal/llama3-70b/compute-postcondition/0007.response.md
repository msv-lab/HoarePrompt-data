The variable `a` will have a new integer appended to its previous elements by using the `append` function. The input integer will be converted to an integer type before being added to the list. The specific value of `n` has no direct impact on the list `a` or the appending operation, and therefore remains unchanged. The value of `i` is also unaffected during this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 2, `a` now contains the previous elements plus an input integer**.
