You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Petya and Vasya decided to play a game. They have n cards (n is an even number). A single integer is written on each card.

Before the game Petya will choose an integer and after that Vasya will choose another integer (different from the number that Petya chose). During the game each player takes all the cards with number he chose. For example, if Petya chose number 5 before the game he will take all cards on which 5 is written and if Vasya chose number 10 before the game he will take all cards on which 10 is written.

The game is considered fair if Petya and Vasya can take all n cards, and the number of cards each player gets is the same.

Determine whether Petya and Vasya can choose integer numbers before the game so that the game is fair. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) — number of cards. It is guaranteed that n is an even number.

The following n lines contain a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (one integer per line, 1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100) — numbers written on the n cards.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible for Petya and Vasya to choose numbers in such a way that the game will be fair, print "NO" (without quotes) in the first line. In this case you should not print anything more.

In the other case print "YES" (without quotes) in the first line. In the second line print two distinct integers — number that Petya should choose and the number that Vasya should choose to make the game fair. If there are several solutions, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
4
11
27
27
11

Output
YES
11 27

Input
2
6
6

Output
NO

Input
6
10
20
30
20
10
20

Output
NO

Input
6
1
1
2
2
3
3

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example the game will be fair if, for example, Petya chooses number 11, and Vasya chooses number 27. Then the will take all cards — Petya will take cards 1 and 4, and Vasya will take cards 2 and 3. Thus, each of them will take exactly two cards.

In the second example fair game is impossible because the numbers written on the cards are equal, but the numbers that Petya and Vasya should choose should be distinct.

In the third example it is impossible to take all cards. Petya and Vasya can take at most five cards — for example, Petya can choose number 10 and Vasya can choose number 20. But for the game to be fair it is necessary to take 6 cards.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = []
    for i in range(n):
        a.append(int(input()))
    d = {}
    for i in a:
        if i in d:
            d[i] += 1
        else:
            d[i] = 1
    c = 0
    (a1, a2) = (-1, -1)
    for i in d:
        if d[i] == n // 2:
            if c == 0:
                a1 = i
                c += 1
            else:
                a2 = i
                break
    if a1 != -1 and a2 != -1:
        print('YES')
        print(a1, a2)
    else:
        print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description:

1. The problem requires Petya and Vasya to choose distinct integers from the cards such that together they collect all the cards, and each player ends up with an equal number of cards.
2. The number of cards `n` is guaranteed to be even.
3. The output must be "NO" if it's impossible for them to achieve this under the given conditions.

Let's analyze the program:

- The program reads an integer `n`, and then `n` integers (the card values) into a list `a`.
- It uses a dictionary `d` to count occurrences of each card value.
- It tries to find two distinct integers that appear exactly `n / 2` times each, which would mean they can equally split the cards.
- The logic checks if exactly two such integers are found. If found, it prints "YES" along with those integers; otherwise, it prints "NO".

However, there is a flaw in the condition of selecting integers. The program currently checks if any integer appears exactly `n / 2` times, but it does not check if there are two distinct integers across the entire list that can cover all cards. Also, if all numbers on the cards are the same, this logic will not handle it correctly, as it will still go into the loop checking distinct integers and may end up printing "NO" incorrectly.

### Potential failing case:
- If the input is:
  ```
  6
  1
  1
  1
  2
  2
  2
  ```
- In this case, Vasya cannot choose a number to make a fair game because even though "1" appears 3 times and "2" appears 3 times, they can't both pick distinct numbers and end up with even card counts and total `n`. The correct output is "NO", but if the logic does not reflect that accurately, it would fail.

Given this analysis, the implementation has a logical flaw in handling such scenarios.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), and the next n lines contain integers a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the numbers written on the n cards. Each number a_i may appear multiple times.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = []
    for i in range(n):
        a.append(int(input()))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` contains `n` integers received as inputs.
    d = {}
    for i in a:
        if i in d:
            d[i] += 1
        else:
            d[i] = 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` contains `n` integers, and `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `a` and each value is the count of occurrences of that integer in `a`.
    c = 0
    a1, a2 = -1, -1
    for i in d:
        if d[i] == n // 2:
            if c == 0:
                a1 = i
                c += 1
            else:
                a2 = i
                break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` contains `n` integers, `d` is a dictionary containing key-value pairs where the keys are the integers from `a` and the values are their counts; `c` is either 0, 1, or 2, indicating how many elements with a count equal to `n // 2` have been found, `a1` contains the first integer found with a count of `n // 2` (if any), `a2` contains the second integer found with a count of `n // 2` (if any), and if no such integers were found `a1` and `a2` remain -1.
    if (a1 != -1 and a2 != -1) :
        print('YES')
        print(a1, a2)
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` contains `n` integers, `d` is a dictionary containing key-value pairs where the keys are the integers from `a` and the values are their counts, and `c` is either 0, 1, or 2. If `a1` and `a2` are both not -1, then 'YES' has been printed along with the values of `a1` and `a2`. If either `a1` or `a2` is -1, then 'NO' has been printed, indicating that either no integers with a count of `n // 2` were found or that they do not correspond to valid integers with that count.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an even integer `n` between 2 and 100, and then reads `n` integers that represent the values on `n` cards. It counts the occurrences of each integer and checks if there are exactly two distinct integers that each appear `n / 2` times. If such integers are found, it prints 'YES' followed by the two integers; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not handle cases where fewer or more than two integers have the required count, and it does not validate the input bounds for the integers beyond ensuring they are between 1 and 100.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
