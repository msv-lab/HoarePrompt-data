The variable `c` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `d`, `a1`, `a2`) remain unchanged based on the initial state as they are not affected by the operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `c`.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` contains `n` integers, `d` must have at least `m + 1` elements, `c` is updated to its previous value plus 1, `a1` is equal to the current value of `i`, `a2` is the previous value of `i`.**
