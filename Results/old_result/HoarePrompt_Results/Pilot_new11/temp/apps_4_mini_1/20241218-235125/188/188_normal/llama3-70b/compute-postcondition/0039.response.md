The variable `c` is incremented by 1. Given that `c` can either remain 0 or become 1 when executed, if `c` was initially 0, it will now become 1. If `c` was already 1 or greater, it will simply increase by 1. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `d`, `a1`, and `a2`) remain unchanged.

Since no specific initial value for `c` is provided, I can only ascertain the effect:

1. If `c` was 0 before the code was executed, now `c` becomes 1.
2. If `c` was already a positive integer (1 or greater), it would simply increase by 1.

Therefore, the Output State reflecting both possible outcomes is:

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` contains `n` integers, `d` is not empty, `c` is either 1 or a positive integer greater than 1, `a1` is set to the value of `i`, and `a2` is the new iteration value.**
