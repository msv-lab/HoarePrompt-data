The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` contains `n` integers, `d` must have at least `m + 1` elements, and `c` is unchanged or updated based on previous values, `a1` is the previous value of `i`, `a2` is equal to the current value of `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
