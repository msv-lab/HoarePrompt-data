The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, as it seems to be defined without any input arguments. However, it operates on a predefined set of parameters governed by variable constraints. Specifically, `n` is an even integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 100 \), and there are \( n \) integers \( a_i \) where \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 100 \) representing the numbers written on the \( n \) cards.

The function performs operations based on the values of \( n \) and the list of integers \( a_i \). The exact output statement is not specified in the provided information. 

Moreover, since there is no definitive output case outlined, we can summarize the expected behavior based on the input constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts an even integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and `n` integers `a_i` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100). It processes these inputs but the specific return value or output behavior is not defined in the provided context.**
