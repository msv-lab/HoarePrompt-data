Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` contains `n` integers, and `i` is the first integer from list `a`. If `i` is already a key in dictionary `d`, then the value of `d[i]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `d` contains the key `i` with a value of 1 since `i` was not previously in `d`.***
