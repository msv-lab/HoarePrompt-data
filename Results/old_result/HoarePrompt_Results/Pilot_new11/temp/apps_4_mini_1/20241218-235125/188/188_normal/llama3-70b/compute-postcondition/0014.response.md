The code assigns the value `1` to the key `i` in the dictionary `d`. The dictionary `d` starts empty and since `i` is taken from the list `a` (which contains `n` integers), we can assume `i` is one of these integers. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated state of the dictionary `d` while retaining the information about the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` contains `n` integers, `d` contains key `i` with value `1`, `i` is the first integer from list `a` and is not in `d` before this assignment.**
