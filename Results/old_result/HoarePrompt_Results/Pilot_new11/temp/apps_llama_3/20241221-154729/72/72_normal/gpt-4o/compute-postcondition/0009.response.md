The value of `min_questions` is updated to be `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)`. Since `full_cycles` is `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)`, we can substitute this into the expression for `min_questions` to get `min_questions = (k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)) // (2 * n - 2)`. 

This simplifies to `min_questions = k // ((2 * n - 2)^2 * m)`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 100, `m` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 10^18 (inclusive), `x` is a non-negative integer between 0 and `n-1` (inclusive), `y` is a non-negative integer between 0 and `m-1` (inclusive), the current value of `full_cycle_length` is `(2 * n - 2) * m`, `full_cycles` is `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)`, `remaining_questions` is `k % ((2 * n - 2) * m)`, `min_questions` is `k // ((2 * n - 2)^2 * m)`, and `max_questions` is `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)`.
