The code `full_cycles = k // full_cycle_length` calculates the number of full cycles that can be completed with `k` units of time, where one full cycle takes `full_cycle_length` units of time. 

Given that `full_cycle_length` is `(2 * n - 2) * m` if `n` > 1, otherwise `m`, and `k` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 10^18 (inclusive), `full_cycles` is assigned the value of `k` divided by `full_cycle_length`, which can be expressed as `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)` if `n` > 1, otherwise `k // m`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `m` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 10^18 (inclusive), `x` is a non-negative integer between 0 and `n-1` (inclusive), `y` is a non-negative integer between 0 and `m-1` (inclusive), `full_cycle_length` is `(2 * n - 2) * m` if `n` > 1, otherwise `m`, and `full_cycles` is `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)` if `n` > 1, otherwise `k // m`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `m` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 10^18 (inclusive), `x` is a non-negative integer between 0 and `n-1` (inclusive), `y` is a non-negative integer between 0 and `m-1` (inclusive), `full_cycle_length` is `(2 * n - 2) * m` if `n` > 1, otherwise `m`, and `full_cycles` is `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)` if `n` > 1, otherwise `k // m`**
