The value of `remaining_questions` is assigned the remainder of `k` divided by `full_cycle_length`. Given that `full_cycle_length` is `(2 * n - 2) * m` if `n` > 1, otherwise `m`, the value of `remaining_questions` will be between 0 and `full_cycle_length - 1` (inclusive). The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `m` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 10^18 (inclusive), `x` is a non-negative integer between 0 and `n-1` (inclusive), `y` is a non-negative integer between 0 and `m-1` (inclusive), `full_cycle_length` is `(2 * n - 2) * m` if `n` > 1, otherwise `m`, `full_cycles` is `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)` if `n` > 1, otherwise `k // m`, and `remaining_questions` is the remainder of `k` divided by `full_cycle_length`, which equals `k % ((2 * n - 2) * m)` if `n` > 1, otherwise `k % m`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `m` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 10^18 (inclusive), `x` is a non-negative integer between 0 and `n-1` (inclusive), `y` is a non-negative integer between 0 and `m-1` (inclusive), `full_cycle_length` is `(2 * n - 2) * m` if `n` > 1, otherwise `m`, `full_cycles` is `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)` if `n` > 1, otherwise `k // m`, and `remaining_questions` is `k % ((2 * n - 2) * m)` if `n` > 1, otherwise `k % m`**
