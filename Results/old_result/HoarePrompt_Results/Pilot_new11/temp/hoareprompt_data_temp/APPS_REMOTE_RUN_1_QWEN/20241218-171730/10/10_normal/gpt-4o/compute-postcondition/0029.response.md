The code `left_count[i] += 1` increments the value of `left_count[i]` by 1. Given that `i` is 0, this means `left_count[0]` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `left_count[0]` is incremented by 1.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is 0.
- `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[0]`.
- `y1_j` is the second element of `sofas[0]`.
- `x2_j` is the third element of `sofas[0]`.
- `y2_j` is the fourth element of `sofas[0]`.
- `right_count[0]` remains unchanged.
- `x1` satisfies `x1 > x2_j`.
- `x2` satisfies `x2 > x2_j`.

Output State: **`left_count[0]` is incremented by 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[0]`, `y1_j` is the second element of `sofas[0]`, `x2_j` is the third element of `sofas[0]`, `y2_j` is the fourth element of `sofas[0]`, `right_count[0]` is unchanged, `x1` satisfies `x1 > x2_j`, and `x2` satisfies `x2 > x2_j`.**
