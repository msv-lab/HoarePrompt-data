Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` representing the number of simple cakes and a list of tuples `cakes`, where each tuple contains two positive integers (radius and height) representing the dimensions of each cake. It calculates the volume of each cake and then uses dynamic programming to find the maximum value that can be obtained by selecting a subset of the cakes such that no two selected cakes have overlapping volumes. The function returns the maximum value from the list or array `dp`. Potential edge cases include when `n` is 0 (returning 0) or when the list `cakes` is empty (also returning 0).**

- The function first computes the volume of each cake using the formula \(\pi r^2 h\).
- It initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the maximum value obtainable by considering the first `i+1` cakes.
- For each cake `i`, it sets `dp[i]` to the volume of cake `i`.
- It then iterates over all previous cakes `j` to update `dp[i]` by checking if including cake `i` after cake `j` increases the total value.
- Finally, it returns the maximum value from the `dp` array, which is the optimal value for selecting a subset of cakes.
