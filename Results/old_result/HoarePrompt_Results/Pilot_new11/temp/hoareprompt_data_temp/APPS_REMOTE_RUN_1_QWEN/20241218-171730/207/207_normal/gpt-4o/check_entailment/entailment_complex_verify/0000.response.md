Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_2` does not correctly implement the required functionality. Specifically, the sum calculation part is incorrect. The logic used to compute the sum of reachable positions up to `k` and beyond `k` is flawed. 

For example, the annotated version shows that the function attempts to simplify the problem by reducing `m`, `a`, and `b` to their coprime form when their GCD is not 1, and then uses a simplified formula for the sum when `m < k`. However, this approach does not correctly account for all reachable positions within the interval `[0, m]`, especially when considering the boundaries and the nature of the jumps allowed (either `k + a` or `k - b`). 

The provided examples in the problem description highlight specific cases where the current implementation fails to produce the correct results. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment is appropriate.
