The code sets `right` to the value of `j`. This means that the previous value of `right` (the largest column index of any 'w' in the `n`-th row of `screen`) is now updated to `j`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `j` is a value within the range `[0, m - 1]`, `top` is the smallest row index of any 'w' in the `n`-th row of `screen`, `bottom` is `n + 1` if `i > bottom`, `left` is the smallest column index of any 'w' in the `n`-th row of `screen`, `right` is `j`, `m` must be greater than 0, the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w', and `top` is not None.**
