`count` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `count` is either 4 or retains its original value (which is 2), so after incrementing, `count` will be either 5 or 3. The value of `num` remains at least 25, and the value of `i` will be 5 in the next iteration. 

Output State: **`num` is at least 25, `count` is either 3 or 5, and `i` will be 5 in the next iteration.**
