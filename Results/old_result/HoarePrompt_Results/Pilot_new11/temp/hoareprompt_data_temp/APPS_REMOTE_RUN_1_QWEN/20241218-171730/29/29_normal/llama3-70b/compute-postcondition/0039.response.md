Functionality: **The function processes a series of filenames and their types (example or regular tests) and generates a script of moves for sorting these files into a specific order. First, it sorts the files by their type in descending order, prioritizing examples over regular tests. Then, it generates a move script to reorder the files according to their type and index. Finally, it prints the number of moves and the move commands. The function assumes that there is at least one file of each type and that the input adheres to the specified constraints. If no files of a certain type are present, the function will still execute as expected.**

**Potential Edge Cases:**
- If there are no example tests (`examples` is empty), the function will still generate moves for the regular tests.
- If there are no regular tests (`regular` is empty), the function will still execute normally, assuming there are at least one or more example tests.
- If the input format is incorrect or the constraints are not met (e.g., filenames are not unique or do not meet length requirements), the function will rely on the provided input, and such issues would need to be handled by the caller or through additional validation logic.
