The code calculates the `frame_size` which is defined as `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`. This value does not change the values of the other variables directly but updates the `frame_size` itself.

Given the initial conditions:
- `n` is the first integer input.
- `pixels` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` characters ('.' or 'w').
- `white_pixels` is a list of tuples representing the coordinates `(i, j)` of all 'w' characters in the `pixels` grid and must contain at least one tuple.
- `min_x` is the smallest `x` value from all tuples in `white_pixels`.
- `min_y` is the smallest `y` value from all tuples in `white_pixels`.
- `max_x` is the largest `x` value from all tuples in `white_pixels`.
- `max_y` is the largest `y` value from all tuples in `white_pixels`.

After executing the line of code:
- `frame_size` is calculated as `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`.

Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `frame_size` based on the given formula.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `pixels` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` characters ('.' or 'w'), `white_pixels` is a list of tuples representing the coordinates `(i, j)` of all 'w' characters in the `pixels` grid and must contain at least one tuple, `min_x` is the smallest `x` value from all tuples in `white_pixels`, `min_y` is the smallest `y` value from all tuples in `white_pixels`, `max_x` is the largest `x` value from all tuples in `white_pixels`, `max_y` is the largest `y` value from all tuples in `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`.**
