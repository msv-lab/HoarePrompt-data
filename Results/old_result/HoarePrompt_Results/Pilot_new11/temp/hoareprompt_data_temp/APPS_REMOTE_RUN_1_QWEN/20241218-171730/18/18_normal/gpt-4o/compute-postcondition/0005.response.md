The code prints the value of `k`. Since the initial values of `n`, `k`, and `t` are provided by the user, `k` retains its initial value after the print statement is executed. The states of the other variables (`n` and `t`) are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is printed, `t` is an integer**
