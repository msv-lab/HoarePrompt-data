The code initializes an empty list named `cakes`. This means that no tuples are added to the list yet, and the value of `n` remains as an integer input indicating the number of tuples that will be added later. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the `cakes` list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input indicating the number of tuples, `cakes` is an empty list**
