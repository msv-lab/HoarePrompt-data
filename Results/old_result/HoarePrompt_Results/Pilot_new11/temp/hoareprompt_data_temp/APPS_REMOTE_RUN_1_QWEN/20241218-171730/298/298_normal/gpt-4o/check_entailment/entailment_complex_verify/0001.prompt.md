You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has got three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$. He'd like to find three integer points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, $(x_3, y_3)$, such that $0 \le x_1, x_2, x_3 \le n$, $0 \le y_1, y_2, y_3 \le m$ and the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$.

Help Vasya! Find such points (if it's possible). If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The single line contains three integers $n$, $m$, $k$ ($1\le n, m \le 10^9$, $2 \le k \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

If there are no such points, print "NO".

Otherwise print "YES" in the first line. The next three lines should contain integers $x_i, y_i$ â€” coordinates of the points, one point per line. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 3

Output
YES
1 0
2 3
4 1

Input
4 4 7

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example area of the triangle should be equal to $\frac{nm}{k} = 4$. The triangle mentioned in the output is pictured below:  [Image] 

In the second example there is no triangle with area $\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{16}{7}$.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    area = n * m / k
    if area != int(area):
        print('NO')
    else:
        area = int(area)
        if area == 0:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            print('0 0')
            if 2 * area <= n:
                print(f'{2 * area} 1')
                print(f'0 1')
            elif 2 * area <= m:
                print(f'1 {2 * area}')
                print(f'1 0')
            else:
                print(f'{n} {m // 2}')
                print(f'0 {m // 2}')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `n` or `m` is odd and `area` is a non-integer. Specifically, when `n` or `m` is odd, the calculated area might not be achievable with integer coordinates. For example, consider the input `3 4 5`. The required area is \( \frac{3 \times 4}{5} = 2.4 \), which is not an integer, but the program will still attempt to find integer coordinates, leading to an incorrect solution. This can be seen as a potential case where the program fails to meet the requirements.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: $n$ and $m$ are positive integers such that $1 \le n, m \le 10^9$, and $k$ is an integer such that $2 \le k \le 10^9$.
def func():
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    area = n * m / k
    if (area != int(area)) :
        print('NO')
    else :
        area = int(area)
        if (area == 0) :
            print('NO')
        else :
            print('YES')
            print('0 0')
            if (2 * area <= n) :
                print(f'{2 * area} 1')
                print(f'0 1')
            else :
                if (2 * area <= m) :
                    print(f'1 {2 * area}')
                    print(f'1 0')
                else :
                    print(f'{n} {m // 2}')
                    print(f'0 {m // 2}')
                #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, and `area` is recalculated as follows: if `2 * area <= m`, then `area` remains `n * m / k` and the console prints '1 0'. Otherwise, `area` becomes `n * (m // 2) / k` and the console prints '0 {m // 2} YES'.
            #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers. `area` is initially calculated as `n * m / k`. If `2 * area <= n`, then `area` is updated to `n / 2` and the console prints '0 1'. Otherwise, `area` is recalculated as follows: if `2 * area <= m`, then `area` remains `n * m / k` and the console prints '1 0'. Otherwise, `area` becomes `n * (m // 2) / k` and the console prints '0 {m // 2} YES'.
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers. `area` is initially calculated as `n * m / k`. If `area == 0`, the string 'NO' is printed to the console. Otherwise, if `2 * area <= n`, then `area` is updated to `n / 2` and the console prints '0 1'. If `2 * area > n` and `2 * area <= m`, then `area` remains `n * m / k` and the console prints '1 0'. Otherwise, `area` becomes `n * (m // 2) / k` and the console prints '0 {m // 2} YES'.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers. `area` is initially calculated as `n * m / k`. If `area` is not an integer, the output is 'NO'. If `area` is an integer:
    #- If `area == 0`, the string 'NO' is printed.
    #- If `2 * area <= n`, then `area` is updated to `n / 2` and the console prints '0 1'.
    #- If `2 * area > n` and `2 * area <= m`, then `area` remains `n * m / k` and the console prints '1 0'.
    #- Otherwise, `area` becomes `n * (m // 2) / k` and the console prints '0 {m // 2} YES'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \), where \( n \) and \( m \) are positive integers within the range \( 1 \le n, m \le 10^9 \) and \( k \) is an integer within the range \( 2 \le k \le 10^9 \). It calculates the area as \( \text{area} = \frac{n \times m}{k} \). If \( \text{area} \) is not an integer, the function prints 'NO'. If \( \text{area} \) is an integer, it checks several conditions and prints specific outputs based on those conditions. The final state of the program includes the following:

- If \( \text{area} = 0 \), the function prints 'NO'.
- If \( 2 \times \text{area} \leq n \), the function prints '0 1' and '0 0', and exits.
- If \( 2 \times \text{area} > n \) and \( 2 \times \text{area} \leq m \), the function prints '1 0' and '1 0', and exits.
- Otherwise, the function prints '0 \(\frac{m}{2}\)' and '0 \(\frac{m}{2}\)', and exits.

The function does not return any value; instead, it only prints the necessary outputs to the console. Potential edge cases include when \( n \) or \( m \) is exactly \( 1 \) or \( k \) is at its maximum, which might affect the calculation of \( \text{area} \).

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
