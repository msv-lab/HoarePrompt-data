`temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Initially, `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 1`. Since `n` is at least 1, `2 * n + 1` is at least 3. After incrementing, `temp_counter` becomes `2 * n + 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1; `examples[i]` is `str(2 * n + 1)'; `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 2`; `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`; `n` must be at least 1; `moves` is a list containing the string `'move {examples[i]} {temp_counter}'`**
