The code `break` does not affect the values of any variables. It only breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement, but since there is no loop or switch statement in the given initial state, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers, `x` is a value such that `a + b < 3x`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
