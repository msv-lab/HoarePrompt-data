Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case when \( n \) is a prime number. For a prime number, there are no divisors other than 1 and itself, so the program will return "NO" for prime numbers. However, according to the problem description, a sequence of fractions can be constructed for prime numbers as well. For example, for \( n = 5 \), a valid sequence could be \(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{10} = 1 - \frac{1}{5}\).

Here's an example to demonstrate the issue:
- Input:
  ```
  5
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  YES
  2
  1 2
  1 10
  ```

- Actual Output:
  ```
  NO
  ```

The program does not generate the required sequence of fractions for prime numbers, which violates the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
