According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y`. The loop will continue as long as `y` is less than `m`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `m` is at least 0.
- `n` is at least 0.
- `heap` now includes the tuple `(-coverage(x_end + 1, 1), x_end + 1, 1)` in addition to its previous contents.
- `x` is `x_end + 1`.
- `y` is 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be less than `m`. Since `y` is currently 1, `m` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `y` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 2.
- `m` must be greater than 1.

State: **`m` is greater than 1, `n` is at least 0, `heap` now includes the tuple `(-coverage(x_end + 1, 1), x_end + 1, 1)` in addition to its previous contents, `x` is `x_end + 1`, `y` is 2**
