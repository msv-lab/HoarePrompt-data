Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `marks` must be a non-empty list, `mark` and `y` are such that either `mark + y` or `mark - y` is an element of `marks_set`, `x_found` is set to True, `y_found` is set to True, `marks` has at least one remaining element. If the condition `x_found and y_found` is True, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
