Postcondition: ***`n` is the first integer input, `s` is the second integer input, `v` is a sorted list of integers created from the third input, `low` is either 0 or \((\text{min}(v) + 1) // 2\), `high` is either \(\text{min}(v)\) or \((\text{min}(v) + 1) // 2 - 1\), `mid` is \((\text{min}(v) + 1) // 2\), and `total` is \(mid * \text{len}(v)\). If `total` is less than `s`, then `low` remains as \((\text{min}(v) + 1) // 2\) and `high` remains as \(\text{min}(v)\). Otherwise, `low` becomes 0 and `high` becomes \((\text{min}(v) + 1) // 2 - 1\).***
