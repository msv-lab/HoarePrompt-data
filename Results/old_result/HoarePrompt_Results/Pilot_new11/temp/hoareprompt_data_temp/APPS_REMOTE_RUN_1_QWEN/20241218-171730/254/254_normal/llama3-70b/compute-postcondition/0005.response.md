The code swaps the values of `a` and `b` such that `a` is now the original value of `b` and `b` is now the original value of `a % b`. Given the initial state where `a` is the original value of `b` and `b` is the original value of `a % b`, the new values after executing the code will be: `a` is now the original value of `b` (let's call it `original_b`) and `b` is now the original value of `a % b` (let's call it `original_a % original_b`).

Output State: **`a` is `original_b`; `b` is `original_a % original_b`**
