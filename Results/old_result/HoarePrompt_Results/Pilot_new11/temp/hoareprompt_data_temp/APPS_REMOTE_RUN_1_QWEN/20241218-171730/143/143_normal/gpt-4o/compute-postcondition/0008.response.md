The code updates `dp[i]` to be the minimum of `dp[i]` and `c[i]`. Given that `i` is initially 2, `dp[2]` is updated to be the minimum of `dp[2]` and `c[2]`.

Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `dp[2]` and `c[2]`, we represent the updated state as follows:

- `dp[0]` remains the minimum of `dp[0]` and `c[0]`
- `dp[1]` remains the minimum of `dp[1]` and `c[1]`
- `dp[2]` is updated to be the minimum of `dp[2]` and `c[2]`

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `dp[0]` is the minimum of its current value and `c[0]`, `dp[1]` is the minimum of `dp[1]` and `c[1]`, `dp[2]` is the minimum of `dp[2]` and `c[2]`**
