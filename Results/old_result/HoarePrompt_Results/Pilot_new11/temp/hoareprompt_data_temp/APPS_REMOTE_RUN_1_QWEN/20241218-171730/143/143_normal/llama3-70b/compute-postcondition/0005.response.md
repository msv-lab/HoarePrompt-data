According to the given for loop:

```python
for j in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Let's analyze the necessary conditions for this loop to execute:

1. **Variable `j`:** The loop will iterate from `0` to `n-1`. Therefore, `j` will take values starting from `0` and going up to `n-1`.

2. **Variable `n`:** The loop will run as long as `j < n`. Hence, `n` must be a positive integer (greater than or equal to 0).

3. **Variable `costs`:** This list is mentioned but is not directly involved in the loop condition. However, it could influence the loop body's operations.

4. **Variables `L`, `dp`, and `i`:** These variables are already defined and set up correctly for the loop to execute. The variable `i` is not directly involved in the loop condition either, but its initial value (`i` is 1) ensures that it won't interfere with the loop starting.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be explicitly adjusted for the loop to execute is `n`, which must be a non-negative integer.

Therefore, the states to be adjusted are:

State: **`costs` is a list of integers, `L` is an integer greater than 0, `dp` is a list of length `L + 1` where each element is `float('inf')`, `dp[0]` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be a non-negative integer (â‰¥ 0)**
