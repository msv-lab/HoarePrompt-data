Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Here are the key issues:

1. **Requirement for Rectangle Formation**: The program needs to ensure that the four parts can form a rectangle but not a square. A rectangle can be formed if two pairs of parts are equal, while a square requires all four parts to be equal. However, the program does not enforce this condition explicitly.

2. **Counting Valid Ways**: The program counts pairs `(a, b)` such that `2(a + b + c + d) = n` and `a â‰  b` to ensure a rectangle can be formed but not a square. However, the current implementation does not fully capture this requirement. Specifically, the logic inside the loop does not properly account for ensuring that the parts form a rectangle but not a square.

To correctly implement the solution, the program should:
- Ensure that the parts can form a rectangle (i.e., two pairs of parts are equal).
- Ensure that the parts cannot form a square (i.e., all four parts are not equal).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
n = int(input())
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(n):
    if n < 6:
        return 0
    
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n // 4 + 1):
        for b in range(a, n // 4 + 1):
            c = (n - 2 * (a + b)) // 2
            if c > 0 and 2 * (a + b + c) == n and a != b and a != c and b != c:
                count += 1
                
    return count
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Initial Check**: If `n < 6`, return 0 because fewer than six units cannot form four parts.
2. **Nested Loops**: Use nested loops to iterate over possible values of `a` and `b`. This ensures that `a` and `b` are chosen in a way that they can form a rectangle.
3. **Calculate `c`**: Calculate `c` as `(n - 2 * (a + b)) // 2`. This ensures that the remaining part `d` is also calculated correctly.
4. **Conditions Check**: Check if `c > 0` and if the parts form a rectangle (i.e., two pairs are equal) but not a square (i.e., all parts are not equal). Specifically, ensure `a != b` and `a != c` and `b != c`.

This ensures that the program correctly counts the number of ways to split the stick into four parts such that they can form a rectangle but not a square.
