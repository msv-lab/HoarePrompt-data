The code `print('unrated')` prints the string 'unrated' to the console. This operation does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `is_rated` remains `False`, `is_unrated` remains `True`**
