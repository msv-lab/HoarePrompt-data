Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Reading**: The code reads four integers \(N\), \(M\), \(K\), and \(L\) from standard input using `sys.stdin.read()`. This is correct according to the input specifications.

2. **Calculation of Minimum Coins per Friend**: The code calculates the minimum number of coins (\(x\)) that each friend needs to gift using the formula:
   \[
   \text{min\_x} = \left\lfloor \frac{L + M - 1}{M} \right\rfloor
   \]
   This formula ensures that the total number of new coins gifted by all friends (\(M \cdot \text{min\_x}\)) is sufficient to meet the requirement of at least \(L\) new coins, plus accounting for the fractional part.

3. **Condition Check**: The code checks if \(M \cdot \text{min\_x} \le N - K\). If this condition is satisfied, it means that the total number of new coins gifted can fit within the available unique coins minus those already in Ivan's collection. In this case, the code prints \(\text{min\_x}\).

4. **Edge Case Handling**: If the condition \(M \cdot \text{min\_x} > N - K\) is not met, the code correctly prints \(-1\) indicating that it is not possible to satisfy all the conditions.

Given these points, the code correctly handles all described cases and follows the problem statement accurately. Therefore, the program is correct.
