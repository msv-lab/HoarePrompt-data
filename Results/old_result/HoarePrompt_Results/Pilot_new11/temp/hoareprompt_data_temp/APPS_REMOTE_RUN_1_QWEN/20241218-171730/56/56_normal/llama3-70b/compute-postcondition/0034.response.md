The code `print('Yes')` simply prints the string 'Yes' to the console and does not change any of the existing variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is 0, `a` is [sorted list in descending order], `i` is the length of the original list `a`, `k` is an integer obtained from input() and remains unchanged, `x` is `i - 1`, printed 'Yes'**
