Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The program correctly implements the logic required to find a counterexample for PolandBall's hypothesis. Here's why:

1. **Problem Description Requirements**:
   - The program needs to find an integer `m` (where \(1 \leq m \leq 1000\)) such that \(n \cdot m + 1\) is not a prime number for a given integer \(n\) (where \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\)).
   - The program should output such an `m`.

2. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - The program reads an integer `n` from the input.
   - It then iterates through values of `m` from 1 to 1000.
   - For each value of `m`, it calculates `n * m + 1` and checks if it is a prime number using the function `func_1`.
   - If `func_1` returns `False`, indicating that `n * m + 1` is not a prime number, the program prints `m` and breaks out of the loop.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - `func_1` correctly determines whether a given number `num` is a prime number.
   - It returns `False` if `num` is less than 2, if `num` is divisible by any number in the range from 2 to the square root of `num`, or if `num` is not a prime number.
   - It returns `True` if `num` is a prime number.

4. **Edge Cases and Validity**:
   - The program handles all valid inputs within the specified range (1 to 1000 for both `n` and `m`).
   - Given the guarantees in the problem statement that a suitable `m` always exists, the program will eventually find and print such an `m`.

Since the program meets all the requirements of the problem description and correctly implements the logic to find and print a suitable `m`, the program is correct.
