`v` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping `int` over the input split by spaces. The initial values of `n` and `s` are not affected by this operation. The output state is: `n` is the first integer input, `s` is the second integer input, and `v` is a list of integers created from the third input.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `s` is the second integer input, and `v` is a list of integers created from the third input**.
