Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `p` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `data` is a list of strings, `visited` is a list of boolean values where each element indicates if the corresponding index was visited during the loop, `cycles` is a list of lists representing the cycles found in the graph defined by `p`, and `no_reverse_components` is the sum of boolean values determined by whether all elements in each cycle are equal to 0 in the list `b`. The current length of the `cycles` list is exactly 1.***
