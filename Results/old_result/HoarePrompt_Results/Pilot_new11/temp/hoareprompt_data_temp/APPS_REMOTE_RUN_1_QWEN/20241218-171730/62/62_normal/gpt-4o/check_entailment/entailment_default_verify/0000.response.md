Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the provided code and the output hints, the program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` accurately converts numbers from their respective bases to decimal form. The main part of the program then correctly compares the two decimal values and outputs the appropriate character ('<', '>', or '=') based on the comparison. The original assessment is accurate because there are no apparent issues or potential edge cases in the provided code that would cause it to fail for valid inputs within the specified constraints.
