Output State: **`n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\) and \(n > k + 2\); `k` is an integer where \(0 \leq k \leq 1000\); `l` is \(\frac{n + k - 1}{k * 2 + 1}\) and \(l > 0\); `res` is a list containing \([i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1 \mid 0 \leq i < l]\)**

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization and Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range `0` to `l-1`.
   - `l` is calculated as \(\frac{n + k - 1}{k * 2 + 1}\), and for the loop to execute, `l` must be greater than 0, meaning \(n > k + 2\).

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each iteration of the loop, `res.append(i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1)` appends the value \(i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1\) to the list `res`.
   - After `l` iterations, `res` will contain the sequence \([1, k * 2 + 2, k * 2 + 3, \ldots, i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1]\) where \(i\) ranges from \(0\) to \(l-1\).

3. **Final Values**:
   - If the loop executes exactly `l` times, `res` will contain exactly `l` elements, each calculated as \(i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1\) for \(i\) ranging from \(0\) to \(l-1\).
   - If the loop does not execute (i.e., `l` is 0), then `res` remains an empty list, which matches the initial state.

Thus, the final output state after all iterations of the loop is as stated above.
