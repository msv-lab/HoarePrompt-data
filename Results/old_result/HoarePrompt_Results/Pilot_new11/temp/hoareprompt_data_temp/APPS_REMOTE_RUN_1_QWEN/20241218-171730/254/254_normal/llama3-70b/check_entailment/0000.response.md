Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program attempts to calculate the Least Common Multiple (LCM) using the greatest common divisor (GCD) and checks if the LCM is divisible by each of the given intervals. However, the approach used in the `lcm` calculation is incorrect. Specifically, the formula used does not correctly compute the LCM for multiple numbers. The provided solution incorrectly assumes that the product of the numbers divided by their pairwise GCDs gives the LCM, which is not valid.

To illustrate the issue, consider the input `(4, 2, 3)`:

- The correct LCM of 4, 2, and 3 is 12.
- However, the program calculates the LCM as follows:
  - `func_1(4, 2) = 2`
  - `func_1(2, 3) = 1`
  - `func_1(4, 3) = 1`
  - Therefore, the calculated LCM is `4 * 2 * 3 // (2 * 1 * 1) = 12 // 2 = 6`, which is incorrect.

This incorrect LCM calculation leads to an incorrect determination of whether Mishka can light up the tree with the given intervals. For instance, with the input `(4, 2, 3)`, the program outputs 'YES', but the correct output should be 'NO'.

A correct approach would involve using the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD and then iteratively computing the LCM of the three numbers.
