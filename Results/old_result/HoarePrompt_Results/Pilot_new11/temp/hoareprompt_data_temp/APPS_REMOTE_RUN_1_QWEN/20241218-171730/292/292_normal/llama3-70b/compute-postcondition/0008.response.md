The value of `b` is multiplied by 2. Since `b` can be either 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10, after multiplication, the new values of `b` will be 4, 8, 12, 16, or 20 respectively. The values of `a` and `years` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is less than or equal to 6; `b` is either 4, 8, 12, 16, or 20; `years` is 1**
