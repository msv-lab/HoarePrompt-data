The code `d[i] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the key `i` in the dictionary `d`. Since `i` is the first element of the list `a`, and no other variables are affected, the output state is as follows:

- `a` remains a non-empty list of integers.
- `i` is the first element of `a`.
- `n` is an even number between 2 and 100 inclusive.
- `total` remains undefined.
- `d` now contains the key-value pair `{i: 1}`.
- `i` is not in `d` is no longer true because `i` is now a key in `d`.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers, `i` is the first element of `a`, `n` is an even number between 2 and 100 inclusive, `total` is undefined, `d` is a dictionary containing {i: 1}, `i` is in `d`**
