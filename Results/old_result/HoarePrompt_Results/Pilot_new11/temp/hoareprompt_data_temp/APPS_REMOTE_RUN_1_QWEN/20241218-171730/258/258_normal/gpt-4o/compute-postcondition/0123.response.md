The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables but instead skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves on to the next iteration. Since the initial values of the variables remain unchanged, the output state will be the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `k + 2`, `x1` is `meats[i][0]`, `y1` is `meats[i][1]`, `c1` is `meats[i][2]` (or `meats[j][2]` if `c1 * T < c2 * T`), `x2` is `meats[j][0]`, `y2` is `meats[j][1]`, `c2` is `meats[j][2]` (if `c1 * T < c2 * T`), `d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T`, `dx` is \((x1 - x2) / 2\), `dy` is \((y1 - y2) / 2\), `d2` is \(\left(\frac{x1 - x2}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y1 - y2}{2}\right)^2\), `my` is `cy - dx \cdot \frac{\mathbf{math.sqrt(d2 \cdot d - d^2)}}{d2}`, `count` remains unchanged.**
