Final: **False**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the original assessment is accurate. The annotated version clarifies that the program attempts to use the least common multiple (LCM) to determine if it's possible to light at least one garland at every second after switching them on. However, the calculation of the LCM in the code is incorrect. The LCM is computed as the product of the three intervals divided by the product of their pairwise GCDs, which is not the correct method for computing the LCM of three numbers. 

The annotated version shows that the `func_1` function correctly computes the GCD, but its usage in calculating the LCM is flawed. For example, for the input `4 2 3`, the program incorrectly calculates the LCM and concludes that it is possible to light at least one garland at every second, which is not true.

To accurately solve the problem, one should compute the LCM of all three intervals and then verify if it's possible to start the garlands in such a way that every second is covered. The provided corrected version in the problem description uses a proper LCM calculation and verifies all possible starting times, ensuring the solution is correct. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate and the program remains incorrect.
