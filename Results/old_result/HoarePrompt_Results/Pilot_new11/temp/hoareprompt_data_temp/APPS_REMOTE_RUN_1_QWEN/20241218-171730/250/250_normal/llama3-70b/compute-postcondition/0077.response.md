`additional_marks` is a non-empty list. An element `i + j` is appended to `additional_marks`, where `j` is an element in `additional_marks` such that `i + j` is not already in `marks` and `i + j <= l`. The state of other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`additional_marks` is a non-empty list containing an additional element `i + j`; there exists at least one element `j` in `additional_marks` such that `i + j` is not in `marks` and `i + j <= l`.**
