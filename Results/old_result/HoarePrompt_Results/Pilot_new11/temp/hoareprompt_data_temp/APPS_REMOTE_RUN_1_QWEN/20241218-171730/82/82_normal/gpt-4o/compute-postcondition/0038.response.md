The code updates the value of `min_lcm` to be equal to `current_lcm`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`new_a` is the largest multiple of `candidate` that is less than or equal to `a + candidate - 1`, `a` and `candidate` remain unchanged, `new_b` is the largest multiple of `candidate` that is less than or equal to `b + candidate - 1`, `current_lcm` is assigned the value of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, and `min_lcm` is now equal to `current_lcm`.**
