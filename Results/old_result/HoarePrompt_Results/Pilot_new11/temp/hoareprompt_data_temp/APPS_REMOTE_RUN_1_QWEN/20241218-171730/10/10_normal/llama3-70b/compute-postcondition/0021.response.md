`top` is incremented by 1. The conditions related to `sofas` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state remains as follows:

Output State: **`sofas` must have at least two tuples. If `sofa[0][0] > sofa[1][0]` and `sofa[0][1] == sofa[1][1]`, then `left` remains 0 and `right` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `left` remains 0 and `right`, `top`, and `bottom` remain 0; `top` is 1 more than its previous value.**
