Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\) and \(n \geq 6\), `count` is the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the conditions inside the loop, `a` is undefined, `b` is undefined, `rem` is \(n - 2 \cdot (a + b)\) with `rem` greater than 0 and even.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: The loop starts with `a` ranging from 1 to `n // 4`. For each value of `a`, `b` is set to `a`, and `rem` is calculated as `n - 2 * (a + b)`. The condition `rem > 0 and rem % 2 == 0` checks if `rem` is a positive even number. If this condition is met, and `a` is not equal to `rem // 2`, `count` is incremented by 1.
   
2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will iterate over all possible values of `a` from 1 to `n // 4`.
   - For each value of `a`, `b` is set to `a`, and `rem` is calculated.
   - The condition `rem > 0 and rem % 2 == 0` is checked.
   - If `a` is not equal to `rem // 2`, `count` is incremented.
   - If `a` equals `rem // 2`, the condition `a != rem // 2` fails, so `count` remains unchanged.

3. **Final Values**:
   - After the loop completes, `count` will hold the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfied the conditions inside the loop.
   - `a` and `b` will be undefined after the loop as they are local variables within the loop scope.
   - `rem` will be undefined because the final value of `rem` is not retained outside the loop, and it is recalculated for each iteration.

4. **No Execution Case**:
   - If the loop does not execute at all (which would happen if `n < 6` or `n // 4` is 0), `count` will remain 0.

Thus, the final state of the variables after the loop completes is summarized as above.
