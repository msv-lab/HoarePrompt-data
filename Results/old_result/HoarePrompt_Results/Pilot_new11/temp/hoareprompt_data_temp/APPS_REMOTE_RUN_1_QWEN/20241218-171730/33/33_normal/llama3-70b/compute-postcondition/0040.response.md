The code `print('NO')` simply prints the string 'NO' to the console. This does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `curr_lat`, `dir`, or the output state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `curr_lat` is within the range of -90 to 90, the output remains 'NO', and the direction `dir` is not 'South'. If `curr_lat` equals -90 and `dir` is not 'North', the function does nothing.**
