The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), and `trophies`, a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', where 'G' represents a golden trophy and 'S' represents a silver trophy. 

After analyzing the code, the function performs the following actions:
1. It identifies all segments of consecutive 'G's in the `trophies` string and stores them in the `segments` list as tuples of their starting and ending indices.
2. If no segments of 'G's are found, the function returns 0.
3. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum length of any segment of consecutive 'G's.
4. It then checks if there are adjacent segments (i.e., segments where the end of one segment is exactly two positions before the start of the next segment). For such pairs, it updates the maximum length to include the gap between these segments.
5. Finally, it returns the minimum value between the updated maximum length plus one and `n`.

The function covers all potential cases as follows:
- If there are no segments of 'G's, the function returns 0.
- If there is only one segment of 'G's, the function returns the length of this segment.
- If there are multiple segments of 'G's and there are adjacent segments, the function updates the maximum length to include the gaps between these segments.
- In all other cases, the function returns the minimum value between the maximum length plus one and `n`.
