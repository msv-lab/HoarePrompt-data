#State of the program right berfore the function call: x, y, X, and Y are floating-point numbers representing coordinates in a 2D plane. x and y are the coordinates of a piece of meat, while X and Y are the coordinates of the heat source.
def func_1(x, y, X, Y):
    return math.sqrt((X - x) ** 2 + (Y - y) ** 2)
    #The program returns the Euclidean distance between the coordinates (x, y) of the piece of meat and the coordinates (X, Y) of the heat source, calculated as math.sqrt((X - x)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts four floating-point numbers `x`, `y`, `X`, and `Y`, which represent the coordinates of a piece of meat and a heat source in a 2D plane, respectively. It calculates and returns the Euclidean distance between these two points using the formula `math.sqrt((X - x)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x, y are lists of integers representing the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the meat pieces respectively, and c is a list of integers representing the hardness of each piece of meat. X and Y are real numbers representing the coordinates of the heat source.
def func_2(x, y, X, Y):
    return [(c * func_1(x, y, X, Y)) for x, y, c in meats]
    #The program returns a list of integers where each integer is calculated as (c * func_1(x, y, X, Y)), with 'x', 'y', and 'c' being elements from the respective lists and 'X' and 'Y' representing the coordinates of the heat source
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts four parameters: `x` and `y` (lists of integers representing the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the meat pieces), `c` (a list of integers representing the hardness of each piece of meat), and `X` and `Y` (real numbers representing the coordinates of the heat source). The function calculates a new list of integers, where each integer is the product of the corresponding element in the `c` list and the result of the function `func_1` evaluated at the coordinates `(x[i], y[i], X, Y)` for each pair of elements `(x[i], y[i], c[i])`. The function returns this list of integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: ans is initialized to positive infinity, x and y are integers representing coordinates on a 2D plane such that -1000 <= x, y <= 1000. The function `func_2` is assumed to return a list of cooking times for each piece of meat when the heat source is placed at coordinates (x, y).
def func_3():
    ans = float('inf')
    for x in range(-1000, 1001):
        for y in range(-1000, 1001):
            times = func_2(x, y, x, y)
            times.sort()
            ans = min(ans, times[K - 1])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `ans` is the minimum value among the K-th largest elements of the list `times` obtained from calling `func_2(x, y, x, y)` for every combination of `x` and `y` in the range from -1000 to 1000, `x` is an integer within the range \([-1000, 1000]\), `y` is an integer within the range \([-1000, 1000]\), and `times` is a list of sorted values returned by `func_2(x, y, x, y)` for each combination of `x` and `y`.
    return ans
    #The program returns ans, which is the minimum value among the K-th largest elements of the list times obtained from calling func_2(x, y, x, y) for every combination of x and y in the range from -1000 to 1000
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` iterates over all possible integer coordinates (x, y) within the range from -1000 to 1000, inclusive. For each coordinate pair, it calls `func_2(x, y, x, y)` to obtain a list of cooking times for a piece of meat when heated at that specific location. These lists of cooking times are then sorted. The function keeps track of the minimum value among the K-th largest elements from these sorted lists. After completing the iteration, it returns this minimum value. Potential edge cases include the scenarios where `K` is larger than the length of the list `times`, in which case the K-th largest element might not exist. Additionally, the function assumes that `func_2` returns a non-empty list of cooking times for each (x, y) pair. If `func_2` ever returns an empty list, the function will incorrectly handle the subsequent operations.
