The code `print('-')` prints a hyphen (`-`) to the console. This operation does not affect the values of the variables `x`, `y`, or `z`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **x is an integer from input(), y is an integer from input(), z is an integer from input(). The value of x is less than y, and x is less than or equal to the sum of y and z.**
