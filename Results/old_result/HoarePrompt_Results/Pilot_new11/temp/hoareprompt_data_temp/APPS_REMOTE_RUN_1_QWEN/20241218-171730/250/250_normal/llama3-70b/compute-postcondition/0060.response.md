Output State: **`marks` is a list of integers, `i` is the last value `i` took during the loop (which will be `n-1`), `j` is the last value `j` took during the loop (which will be `n-1`), `need_x` is `True` if there exists any pair `(i, j)` such that `marks[j] - marks[i] == x`, otherwise `need_x` is `False`. `need_y` is `True` if there exists any pair `(i, j)` such that `marks[j] - marks[i] == y`, otherwise `need_y` is `False`.**
