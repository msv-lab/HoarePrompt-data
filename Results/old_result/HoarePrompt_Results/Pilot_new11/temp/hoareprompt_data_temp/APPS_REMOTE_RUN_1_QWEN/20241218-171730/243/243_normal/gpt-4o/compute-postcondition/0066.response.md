To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition under which the loop continues: `func_1(left) == m`.

Given the current state:
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\)
- `low` is less than or equal to `high`
- `mid` is equal to \((low + high) // 2\)
- `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`
- `result` is an empty list
- `left` is equal to `mid`

The loop condition `func_1(left) == m` checks if the function evaluated at `left` equals `m`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `func_1(left)` must be equal to `m`. Since `left` is currently set to `mid`, this means that `func_1(mid)` should be equal to `m`.

Let's summarize the necessary adjustments:

1. The function evaluation at `mid` should be equal to `m`.
2. The other states do not directly influence the loop condition in this context.

Therefore, the state right before the loop that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `mid` is equal to \((low + high) // 2\), and `func_1(mid)` must be equal to `m`**
