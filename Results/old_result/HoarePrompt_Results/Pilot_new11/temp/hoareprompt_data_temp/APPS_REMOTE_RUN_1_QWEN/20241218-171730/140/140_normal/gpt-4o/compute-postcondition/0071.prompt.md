You have been assigned the role of a program executor, responsible for simulating the execution of Python code. You will be provided with an initial state and a Python code snippet. You need to provide the output state after running the Python code based on the initial state. Please avoid describing how the program runs. When a variable has a specific value, use that specific value directly for calculations. If a return takes place makes sure to always mention that a value or variable has been returned at the output state. You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state**.
Include all the information of the precondition that is still valid after the code has been executed. Just update the values of the variables that have been changed by the code.
I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.


Example1:
Initial State: `str` is a string
```
n = int(input())
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer 1:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `str` is a string, `n` is an input integer.
Output State: **`str` is a string, `n` is an input integer**


Example2:
Initial State: variables can hold any values
```
i += 1
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer 2:
The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown, so the output state is: variable `i` is increased by 1.
Output State: **variable `i` is increased by 1**


Example3:
Initial State: `n` is either 3 or 5
```
m = n + 1
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer 3:
m is assigned the value n + 1. The value of n can be 3 or 5, so the value of m is 4 or 6. Therefore, the Output State is: n is either 3 or 5; m is either 4 or 6.
Output State: **`n` is either 3 or 5; `m` is either 4 or 6**


Example4:
Initial State: `x` is a positive integer, if x is greater than 10 then z=0 else z=1.
```
y = -z
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer : 
`y` is assigned the value of minus `z`, and if x is greater than 10 then z=0 else z=1.The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`x` is a positive integer, if x is greater than 10 then z=0 and y =0 , else z=1 and y=-1**


Example 5:
Initial State: `total' is 0, `i` is 1
```
break
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer 5: 
`The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is:  `total' is 0, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State: **`total' is 0, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Example 6:
Initial State: `total' is positive, `num` is negative, `x` is 0
```
x = total - num
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer 6: 
`x' becomes total minus num. The value of `total` is positive, and the value of `num` is negative, so the value of `x` is a positive valye greater than total. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `total' is positive, `num` is negative, `x` is a positive value `total` - `num.
Output State: **`total' is positive, `num` is negative, `x` is a positive value equal to `total` - `num'.**

Your Task:
Initial State: According to the given code, the loop iterates over each neighbor of the current node. The loop body decreases the in-degree of each neighbor and checks if the in-degree of the neighbor becomes zero. If it does, the neighbor is added to the queue. The loop continues as long as there are neighbors to process.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- The `queue` is not empty.
- It now includes the neighbor node if the in-degree of `neighbor` was 0.
- `count` is the total number of nodes whose in-degree became 0 plus 1.
- `node` is the node that was dequeued from the left side of the queue.
- `neighbor` is a neighbor of `node`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must be met:
1. There must be at least one neighbor of the current node (i.e., the node that was dequeued).
2. The in-degree of at least one of these neighbors must be zero, and this neighbor must be added to the queue.

Since the loop processes each neighbor of the current node, the current state must reflect that there is at least one neighbor left to process.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The `queue` must still contain at least one element because it includes the neighbor node if its in-degree was 0.
2. The `count` reflects the total number of nodes whose in-degree became 0 plus 1, so it indicates how many nodes have had their in-degrees reduced to zero.
3. The `node` is the node that was dequeued, and the `neighbor` is a neighbor of `node`.
4. For the loop to continue, there must be at least one more neighbor of `node` whose in-degree is not yet zero or whose in-degree has become zero but is not already in the queue.

Given these considerations, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- The `queue` is not empty.
- It now includes the neighbor node if the in-degree of `neighbor` is 0.
- `count` is the total number of nodes whose in-degree became 0 plus 1.
- `node` is the node that was dequeued from the left side of the queue.
- `neighbor` is a neighbor of `node`.

To ensure the loop continues, the key point is that there must be at least one neighbor left to process, meaning the in-degree of at least one neighbor of `node` must be zero.

Thus, the state should be:

**State: `queue` is not empty, and it includes the neighbor node if the in-degree of `neighbor` is 0, `count` is the total number of nodes whose in-degree became 0 plus 1, `node` is the node that was dequeued from the left side of the queue, and `neighbor` is a neighbor of `node`.**
```
in_degree[neighbor] -= 1

```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result. You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state**.
Be as specific as possible. If a variable has a specific value or is equal to some combination of variables, use that specific value  or expression it is equal to. nclude all the information of the precondition that is still valid after the code has been executed. Just update the values of the variables that have been changed by the code.
