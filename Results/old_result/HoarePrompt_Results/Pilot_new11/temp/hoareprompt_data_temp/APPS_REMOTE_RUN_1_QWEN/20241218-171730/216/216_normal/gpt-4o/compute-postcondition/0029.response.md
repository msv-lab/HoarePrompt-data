The code `current_set.clear()` clears the set `current_set`. This means that all elements in `current_set` are removed. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` must be a non-empty string with at least one more character, `max_count` is the maximum between its original value and either 1 or 2 (if `current_count` is 1 or 2), `current_set` is an empty set, and `current_count` is either 1 or 2 if the new character was a lowercase character not previously in `current_set`, otherwise `current_count` remains 0.**
