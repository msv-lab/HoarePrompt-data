Postcondition: ***`directions` is a non-empty list; `current` is a valid puzzle state with an 'X' position; `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`. If `0 <= new_row < 2` and `0 <= new_col < 2`, then `new_state` is a list identical to `current` except that the elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` are swapped; `new_state_str` is a string created by joining the elements of `new_state`; `visited` either includes `new_state_str` or remains unchanged; `queue` either includes `new_state_str` or remains unchanged. If these conditions are not met, `new_pos`, `new_state`, `new_state_str`, `visited`, and `queue` remain unchanged.***
