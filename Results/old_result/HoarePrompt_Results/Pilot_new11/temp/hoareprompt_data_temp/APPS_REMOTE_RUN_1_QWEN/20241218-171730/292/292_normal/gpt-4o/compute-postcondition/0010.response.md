To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions under which the loop continues. The loop condition is `a <= b`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Current States:**
   - `a` is 9 or 18.
   - `b` is a value between 4 and 20 (inclusive).
   - `years` has been incremented by 1.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `a <= b`.

3. **Determining the Next State:**
   - For the loop to continue, `a` must be less than or equal to `b` after the current iteration.
   - Since `years` has been incremented by 1, we need to consider how this affects the loop condition.

4. **Considering Different Values of `a`:**
   - If `a` is 9:
     - For the loop to continue, `b` must be greater than or equal to 9.
   - If `a` is 18:
     - For the loop to continue, `b` must be greater than or equal to 18.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Regardless of the value of `a`, the condition `a <= b` must hold true for the loop to execute again.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `b` is at least as large as the maximum possible value of `a`, which is 18.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute one more time, `b` must be greater than or equal to 18. No other states need to be adjusted since `years` and `a` do not directly affect the loop condition in this context.

### Final Answer:
State: **`a` is 9 or 18, `b` must be greater than or equal to 18, `years` has been incremented by 1**
