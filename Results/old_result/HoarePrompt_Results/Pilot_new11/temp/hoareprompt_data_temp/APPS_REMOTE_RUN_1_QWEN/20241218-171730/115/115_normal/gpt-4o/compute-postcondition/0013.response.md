The code assigns the value 1 to four elements in a 2D list `B`. However, since the initial state does not specify the exact structure and content of `B`, we can only update the values of `i` and `j` which are used in the assignment.

- `i` is updated to `i + 1` twice.
- `j` is updated to `j + 1` twice.

So, the new values of `i` and `j` after executing the code are `i = 2` and `j = 4`.

The output state is:

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 4**
