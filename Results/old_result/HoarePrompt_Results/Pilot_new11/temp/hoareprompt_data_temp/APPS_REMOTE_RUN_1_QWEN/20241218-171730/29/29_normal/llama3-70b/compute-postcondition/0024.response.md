The code snippet `script.append(f'move {file} {i}')` appends a string to the `script` list. This string includes a file name from `examples` and the value of `i`.

- `i` is defined as `len(examples)`, which means `i` is the length of the `examples` list.
- `examples` is a list of the first elements of the tuples in `files` where the second element is 1.
- `script` is a list containing the moves for all files in `examples`.

Since `i` is set to the length of `examples`, the `script` list gets appended with a move command for each file in `examples` using the current value of `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `files` is a list of tuples sorted in descending order by the second element of each tuple, `examples` is a list of the first elements of the tuples in `files` where the second element is 1, `regular` is a list of the first elements of the tuples in `files` where the second element is 0 and must contain at least one element, `script` is a list containing the moves for all files in `examples`, `i` is `len(examples)`**
