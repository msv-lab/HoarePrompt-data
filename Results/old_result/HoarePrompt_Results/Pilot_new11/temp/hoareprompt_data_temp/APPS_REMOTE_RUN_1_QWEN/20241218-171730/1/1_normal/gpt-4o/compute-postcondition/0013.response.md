The code `ind = i` assigns the current value of `i` to `ind`. The initial state shows that `i` is `i + 1`, but since `i` itself hasn't been given a concrete value, we only know that `i` is one more than its previous value. However, the exact value of `i` is not specified, so we can only say that `ind` is assigned the value of `i`.

Output State: **`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters `[`, `]`, `:`, and `|`, `ind` is `i`, `i` is `i + 1`**
