The code initializes an empty list `a`. The value of `n` remains unchanged and is still an even number between 2 and 100 inclusive. Therefore, the only change is the addition of the list `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an even number and is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `a` is an empty list**
