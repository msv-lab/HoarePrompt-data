To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the conditions required for the `for i in d:` loop to run.

1. **Understanding the Loop**: The loop iterates over the keys (integers) of the dictionary `d`.

2. **Dictionary `d`**: The dictionary `d` maps each integer from the list `a` to its count of occurrences in `a`.

3. **State Before the Loop**:
   - `a` is a non-empty list of integers.
   - `i` is the last element of `a`.
   - `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `a` and the value is the count of occurrences of that integer in `a`.
   - `total` is undefined.
   - `n` is an even number between 2 and 100 inclusive.
   - `c` is 0.
   - `a1` is -1.
   - `a2` is -1.

4. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop `for i in d:` will execute if the dictionary `d` is not empty. Since `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `d` will also be a non-empty dictionary (assuming there is at least one unique integer in `a`).

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - `a` is non-empty, so `d` will be non-empty if there is at least one unique integer in `a`.
   - We need to ensure that the dictionary `d` contains at least one key (integer) for the loop to execute. This means `a` must contain at least one unique integer.
   - No specific changes are needed for `i`, `n`, `c`, `a1`, or `a2` as they do not affect the loop condition directly.
   - `total` is undefined, and this does not affect the loop condition either.

Therefore, the key state adjustment needed is to ensure that `d` is non-empty, which will happen if `a` contains at least one unique integer.

**State:**
- **`a` is a non-empty list of integers that contains at least one unique integer**, ensuring `d` is non-empty.
- `i` is the last element of `a`.
- `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `a` and the value is the count of occurrences of that integer in `a`.
- `total` is undefined.
- `n` is an even number between 2 and 100 inclusive.
- `c` is 0.
- `a1` is -1.
- `a2` is -1.
