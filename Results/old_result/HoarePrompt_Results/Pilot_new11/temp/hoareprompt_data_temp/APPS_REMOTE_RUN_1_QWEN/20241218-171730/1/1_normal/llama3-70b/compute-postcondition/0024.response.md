The line of code `ind = i` assigns the value of `i` to `ind`. However, the variable `i` is not defined in the given initial state, and there is no assignment or initialization for `i` in the provided code snippet. Therefore, the exact value of `ind` cannot be determined without additional context. The other variables (`s`, `n`, and `f`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is the input string, `n` is greater than 0, `ind` is `i`, and `f` is True**
