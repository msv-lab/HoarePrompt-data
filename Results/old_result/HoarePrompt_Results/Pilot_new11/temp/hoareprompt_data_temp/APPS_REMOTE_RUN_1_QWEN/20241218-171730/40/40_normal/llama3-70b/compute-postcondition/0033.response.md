Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is a valid starting index such that `i + 1` is within bounds of `s`.
   - `s` is a non-empty string.
   - `n` is greater than `i + 1`.
   - `max_len` is the maximum length of any non-palindromic substring found in `s` from index `i + 1` to any valid end index `j` where `i + 2 <= j <= n`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Next Iteration Analysis:**
   - The loop will iterate over `i` starting from 0 up to `n-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was a valid index such that `i + 1` is within bounds of `s` and `n` is greater than `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1 (since it starts from 0).
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.

4. **Updated States:**
   - `i` must now be `i + 1`.
   - Since `i` was valid before, `i + 1` should still be a valid starting index such that `i + 1 + 1` (which is `i + 2`) is within bounds of `s`.
   - `n` remains the same because it is an upper bound and does not change within the loop.
   - `max_len` is the maximum length of any non-palindromic substring found in `s` from index `i + 2` to any valid end index `j` where `i + 3 <= j <= n`.

Therefore, the updated states for the next iteration are:

**State: **`i` is a valid starting index such that `i + 2` is within bounds of `s`, `s` is a non-empty string, `n` is greater than `i + 2`, and `max_len` is the maximum length of any non-palindromic substring found in `s` from index `i + 2` to any valid end index `j` where `i + 3 <= j <= n`**.
