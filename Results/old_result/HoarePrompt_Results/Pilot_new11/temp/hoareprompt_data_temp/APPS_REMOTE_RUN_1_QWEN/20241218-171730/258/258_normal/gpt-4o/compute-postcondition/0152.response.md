The code assigns the value of `(y1 + y2) / 2` to `cy`. This means `cy` is now the average of `y1` and `y2`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `N-1`, `x1` is `meats[N-1][0]`, `y1` is `meats[N-1][1]`, `y2` is `meats[N][1]`, `c1` is `meats[N-1][2]`, `c2` is `meats[N][2]`, `count` is the number of meat entries within distance `T` if a valid combination is found, otherwise it is the maximum number of meat entries checked during the loop, `d` is `(c1_val - c2_val) * T / (c1_val * c2_val)`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `cx`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `mx`, `my` hold the values calculated for the last pair of meat entries compared, `j` is `N`, `c1_val` is `meats[N-1][2]`, `c2_val` is `meats[N][2]`.**
