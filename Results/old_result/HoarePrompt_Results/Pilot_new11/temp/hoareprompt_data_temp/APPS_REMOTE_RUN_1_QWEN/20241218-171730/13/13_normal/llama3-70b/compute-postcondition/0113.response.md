Postcondition: ***`j` is `i + 2`, `beauty` is the count of consecutive 'G's from `i - 1` to the first non-'G' character, incremented by 1 if `s[j]` is 'G', and unchanged otherwise. `left`, `right`, `max_beauty`, `max_beauty_one_swap`, and `golden` remain unchanged. The loop or if statement is exited if `s[j]` is not 'G'.***
