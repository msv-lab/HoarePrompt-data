You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: It's New Year's Eve soon, so Ivan decided it's high time he started setting the table. Ivan has bought two cakes and cut them into pieces: the first cake has been cut into a pieces, and the second one — into b pieces.

Ivan knows that there will be n people at the celebration (including himself), so Ivan has set n plates for the cakes. Now he is thinking about how to distribute the cakes between the plates. Ivan wants to do it in such a way that all following conditions are met:  Each piece of each cake is put on some plate;  Each plate contains at least one piece of cake;  No plate contains pieces of both cakes. 

To make his guests happy, Ivan wants to distribute the cakes in such a way that the minimum number of pieces on the plate is maximized. Formally, Ivan wants to know the maximum possible number x such that he can distribute the cakes according to the aforementioned conditions, and each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.

Help Ivan to calculate this number x!


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers n, a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b) — the number of plates, the number of pieces of the first cake, and the number of pieces of the second cake, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible number x such that Ivan can distribute the cake in such a way that each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 2 3

Output
1

Input
4 7 10

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the first example there is only one way to distribute cakes to plates, all of them will have 1 cake on it.

In the second example you can have two plates with 3 and 4 pieces of the first cake and two plates both with 5 pieces of the second cake. Minimal number of pieces is 3.
Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, a, b):
    (low, high) = (1, min(a, b) + 1)

    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if can_distribute(mid):
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
    return low - 1

#Function 2:
def can_distribute(x):
    return a // x + b // x >= n


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Specifically, the `can_distribute` function checks if the sum of the integer divisions of `a` and `b` by `x` is greater than or equal to `n`. However, this approach does not guarantee that the distribution of pieces will meet the requirement that each plate contains at least one piece of cake from either the first or the second cake but not both.

Let's consider a counterexample:

- Input: `n = 4`, `a = 3`, `b = 3`
- According to the problem, we need to distribute the cakes such that each plate gets at least one piece of cake, and no plate gets pieces from both cakes. The goal is to maximize the minimum number of pieces per plate.

If we use the current logic:
- For `x = 1`, `a // 1 + b // 1 = 3 + 3 = 6`, which is greater than `n = 4`, so `x = 1` would be returned.
- However, this means each plate could get 1 piece from the first cake and 1 piece from the second cake, violating the condition that no plate can have pieces from both cakes.

The correct approach would involve checking if it is possible to distribute the pieces such that each plate gets at least `x` pieces and no plate gets pieces from both cakes. The current implementation does not handle this correctly and may return invalid results for certain inputs.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
(n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(n, a, b))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b.
def func_1(n, a, b):
    low, high = 1, min(a, b) + 1
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        if can_distribute(mid):
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\), `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 100\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 100\), `can_distribute(mid)` returns True if `n` can be distributed starting from `mid`, otherwise it returns False; `low` is equal to `high`, and `high` is the maximum value of `low` and `high` when the loop terminates.
    return low - 1
    #`The program returns the value of low minus 1`

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers representing the number of pieces of the first and second cake respectively, and n is a positive integer representing the number of plates such that 1 <= a, b <= 100 and 2 <= n <= a + b.
def can_distribute(x):
    return a // x + b // x >= n
    #`The program returns the result of (a // x + b // x) which is greater than or equal to n`



Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
