Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the requirement that the sum of the fractions must equal \(1 - \frac{1}{n}\). Instead, it simply lists all divisors of \(n\) from 2 to \(\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor\) and their corresponding quotients, without ensuring that their sum equals the required value. For example, for \(n = 6\), the code would generate the fractions \(\frac{1}{2}\) and \(\frac{1}{3}\), but their sum is \(\frac{5}{6}\), which is not equal to \(1 - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{6}\). Therefore, the code does not meet the problem requirements for every potential case.
