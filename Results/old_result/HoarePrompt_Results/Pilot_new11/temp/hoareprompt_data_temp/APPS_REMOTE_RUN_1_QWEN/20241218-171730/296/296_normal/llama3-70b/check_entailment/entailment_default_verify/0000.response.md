Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly points out that the program does not generate a sequence of fractions that satisfy the given conditions for all possible inputs. The program always prints "YES" and a fixed sequence regardless of the input value of `n`. This means it does not properly check if a valid sequence of fractions can be formed for a given `n` and does not dynamically adjust the sequence based on the input. The output hints confirm that the program does not handle cases correctly, especially for values of `n` other than 2. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
