Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is either incremented by 1 if a '0' is found, or remains unchanged, and `to_remove` is set to 1 if a '0' is found, otherwise it is set to 2. Since there is no else part provided, the postcondition remains as described in the if part.***
