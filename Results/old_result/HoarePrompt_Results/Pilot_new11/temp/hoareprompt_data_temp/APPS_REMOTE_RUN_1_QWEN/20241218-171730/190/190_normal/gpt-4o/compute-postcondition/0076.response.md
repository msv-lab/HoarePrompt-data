The code `min_cost = current_cost` updates the value of `min_cost` to be equal to `current_cost`. Given that the initial state is `current_cost` is less than `min_cost`, this assignment will set `min_cost` to the value of `current_cost`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list, `current_cost` is the cumulative cost calculated based on the conditions inside the loop for each element in `a`, `min_cost` is now equal to `current_cost`, `best_t` is the value of `t` when `min_cost` was last updated, and `t` is the value of `t` at the end of the loop execution.**
