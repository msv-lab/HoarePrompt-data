Postcondition: ***`unrated` is `False`, `rated` is `True`, if there exists at least one index `i` such that `ratings_before[i]` is not equal to `ratings_after[i]`, `maybe` is `False`, `ratings_before` is a list of `n` integers, `ratings_after` is a list of `n` integers, where `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `n`, and `j` is `n + 1`***

The postcondition retains all the information from the precondition and includes the condition of the if statement, which is `rated` being `True`.
