The function `func_1` accepts two positive integer parameters `x` and `y`. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. The function iteratively updates `x` and `y` such that `x` becomes `y` and `y` becomes `x % y` until `y` is 0. At this point, `x` contains the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`. The function then returns `x`. 

This process handles the case where `y` might initially be 0, in which case the function immediately returns `x` without entering the loop. Additionally, the function correctly handles the scenario where both `x` and `y` are positive integers greater than 0, as it repeatedly reduces the problem size until `y` becomes 0. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `x` holds the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`, and `y` is 0.
