`dp[j]` is updated to the remainder of `dp[j]` divided by `MOD`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since the exact value of `MOD` is not specified, we will keep it as `MOD`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `f_max_n` is at least 2, `j` is `f_max_n - 2`, `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] % MOD`**
