`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which means `n` now holds the integer input from the user. The lengths of `x` and `y` remain unchanged, and their values stay within the specified range. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is the integer input from the user, the length of `x` and `y` is `n`, and 0 ≤ x[i] ≤ 1000 and 0 ≤ y[i] ≤ 1000 for all i in range(n).

Output State: **`n` is the integer input from the user, the length of `x` and `y` is `n`, and 0 ≤ x[i] ≤ 1000 and 0 ≤ y[i] ≤ 1000 for all i in range(n)**
