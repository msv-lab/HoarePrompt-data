Postcondition: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is `n - 1`, `m` is at least 2, and `operations` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a 2x2 submatrix in `A` that satisfied the condition and was flipped in `B`. The value of `A[i][j]` is 1, the value of `A[i][j + 1]` is 1, the value of `A[i + 1][j]` is 1, and the value of `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1**.
