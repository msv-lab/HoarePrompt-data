The code appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `operations`. The values of `i` and `j` are 0 and 0 respectively based on the initial state, so the tuple added to `operations` is `(1, 1)`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `m` must be at least 2, `A[i][j]` is 1, `A[i][j + 1]` is 1, `A[i + 1][j]` is 1, `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1, `B[i][j]` is 1, `B[i][j + 1]` is 1, `B[i + 1][j]` is 1, `B[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1, and `operations` contains the tuple `(1, 1)`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `m` must be at least 2, `A[i][j]` is 1, `A[i][j + 1]` is 1, `A[i + 1][j]` is 1, `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1, `B[i][j]` is 1, `B[i][j + 1]` is 1, `B[i + 1][j]` is 1, `B[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1, `operations` contains the tuple (1, 1)**
