The code prints the values of `op[0]` and `op[1]`. After printing these values, the variables `op[0]` and `op[1]` retain their printed values, and the third element of the `operations` list becomes the new `op` for the next iteration. The states of other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`op[0]` is printed, `op[1]` is printed, `op` for the next iteration is the third element in the `operations` list**
