Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Initial States:
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\).
- `bits` is the list of positions of the 1-bits in the binary representation of `n` excluding the last position, plus the value `smallest - 1` appended to it.
- `smallest` is the value of the last element in the original `bits`.
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k > \text{len}(bits)\).

### Loop Condition:
The loop continues as long as `len(bits) < k`.

### Loop Body:
Since the loop body is omitted, we need to focus on the condition `len(bits) < k`. For the loop to continue executing, `len(bits)` must be less than `k`.

### Analysis:
At the end of the previous iteration, `len(bits)` was one less than `k` because the loop would only terminate when `len(bits)` equals `k`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `len(bits)` must be less than `k`.

### Adjusted States:
- The only state that needs to be adjusted is `len(bits)`. It must be less than `k` to allow the loop to execute one more time.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), `bits` is the list of positions of the 1-bits in the binary representation of `n` excluding the last position, plus the value `smallest - 1` appended to it, `smallest` is the value of the last element in the original `bits`, `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k > \text{len}(bits)\), and `len(bits)` must be less than `k`**.
