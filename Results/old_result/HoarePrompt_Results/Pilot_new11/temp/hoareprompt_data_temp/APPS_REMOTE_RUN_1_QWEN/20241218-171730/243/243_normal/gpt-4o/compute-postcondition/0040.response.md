To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition under which the loop continues:

The loop condition is:
```python
while func_1(left) == m:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Current States**:
   - `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\).
   - `low` and `high` are set such that `low <= high`.
   - `mid` is the integer value of `(low + high) // 2`.
   - `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`.
   - `result` is an empty list.
   - `left` is `mid`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `func_1(left) == m`.

3. **Initial Values**:
   - Given that `left` is initially set to `mid`, we need to check if `func_1(mid) == m` is true.

4. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - For the loop to continue, `func_1(left)` must equal `m`. Since `left` is initially set to `mid`, `func_1(mid)` must equal `m`.

5. **Additional Conditions**:
   - To ensure the loop can proceed, we need to ensure that the values of `low` and `high` are still valid for further iterations. This means `low <= high` should hold true.
   - Since `mid` is the integer value of `(low + high) // 2`, adjusting `low` or `high` might be necessary if they no longer satisfy this condition.

Given these points, we need to adjust the states to ensure the loop can proceed:

- `m` must remain within its bounds: \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\).
- `low` and `high` must satisfy `low <= high`.
- `left` (which is `mid`) must be such that `func_1(mid) == m`.

Since `m` and the relationship between `low` and `high` are already specified, and `left` is initialized to `mid`, the only critical adjustment is ensuring `func_1(mid) == m`.

Therefore, the final answer is:

**State: `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `low` and `high` are set such that `low <= high`, `left` is `mid` and `func_1(mid) == m`**
