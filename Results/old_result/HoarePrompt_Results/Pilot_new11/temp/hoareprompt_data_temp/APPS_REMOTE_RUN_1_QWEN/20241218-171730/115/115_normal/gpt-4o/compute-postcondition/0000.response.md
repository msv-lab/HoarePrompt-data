The code initializes an empty list named `operations`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, or `A`. Therefore, the only change is the addition of an empty list `operations`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is a positive integer such that 2 <= m <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, `operations` is an empty list**
