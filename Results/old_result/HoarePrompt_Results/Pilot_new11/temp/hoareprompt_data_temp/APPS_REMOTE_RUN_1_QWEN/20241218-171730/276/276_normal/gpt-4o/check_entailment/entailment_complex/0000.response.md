Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the functionality required by the problem description. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads two strings from the input, which represent numbers in the golden system. These strings are valid and non-empty, as per the problem description.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a string `s` representing a number in the golden system and converts it into its decimal value using the formula \( \sum_{i = 0}^{n} a_{i} \cdot q^{n - i} \).
   - It initializes `q` as \(\frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2}\), which is the golden ratio.
   - It iterates over each character in the string `s` and if the character is '1', it adds \( q^{n - i - 1} \) to the `value` variable, where `n` is the length of the string and `i` is the index of the current character.
   - The function correctly returns the computed `value`.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main part of the program compares the values returned by `func_1` for the two input strings.
   - If `value1` is greater than `value2`, it prints `>`; if `value1` is less than `value2`, it prints `<`; otherwise, it prints `=`.

4. **Compliance with Problem Description**:
   - The program accurately computes the decimal value of a number in the golden system.
   - It correctly handles the comparison of two such numbers.
   - The assumptions about valid input are consistent with the problem description, as invalid inputs are not explicitly handled but are considered to be valid.

Since the program correctly implements the logic for converting a golden system number to its decimal value and comparing these values, it meets the requirements of the problem description in all cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
