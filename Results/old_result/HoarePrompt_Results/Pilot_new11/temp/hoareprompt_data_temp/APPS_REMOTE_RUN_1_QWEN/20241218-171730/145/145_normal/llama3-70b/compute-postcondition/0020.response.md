The code `segments += 1` increments the value of `segments` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is as follows:

- `curr_sum` is increased by the value of `digit`.
- `ticket` is a non-empty string of exactly `n` digits.
- `total_sum` is the sum of all digits in `ticket`.
- `target_sum` is `total_sum // 2`.
- `segments` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`curr_sum` is increased by the value of `digit`, `ticket` is a non-empty string of exactly `n` digits, `total_sum` is the sum of all digits in `ticket`, `target_sum` is `total_sum // 2`, and `segments` is increased by 1.**
