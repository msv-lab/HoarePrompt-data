To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the conditions:

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - `len(examples)` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `examples[i]` is not equal to `str(i + 1)`.
   - `temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 1`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `temp_counter <= 2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`.

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`.

Given these points, we need to ensure the following conditions are met for the next iteration of the loop:
- `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`.
- `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`.

Let's check each condition against the current state:

- **`len(examples)`**: This does not affect the loop condition directly, so no adjustment is needed.
- **`i`**: This does not affect the loop condition directly, so no adjustment is needed.
- **`examples[i]`**: This does not affect the loop condition directly, so no adjustment is needed.
- **`temp_counter`**: This must be less than or equal to `2 * n` for the loop to continue.

Since the current state does not provide information about `2 * n` or `files_set`, we need to ensure that `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`.

Thus, the necessary adjustments are:
- `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`.
- `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`.

Therefore, the modified state is:

**State: `len(examples)` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `examples[i]` is not equal to `str(i + 1)`, `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`, and `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`**
