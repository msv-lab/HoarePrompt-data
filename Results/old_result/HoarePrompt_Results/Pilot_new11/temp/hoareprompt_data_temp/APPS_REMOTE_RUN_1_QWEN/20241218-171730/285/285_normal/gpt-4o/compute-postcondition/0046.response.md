To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the following:

1. The loop iterates over a range based on `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1`.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, the variable `b` would be the value it was set to in the previous iteration.
3. For the loop to continue, `b` must be less than the upper bound of the range, which is `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1`.

Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `a = a + 1` (This part is not directly related to the loop, so it remains unchanged).
   - `remaining_after_cars` is checked for divisibility by `computer_cost` and returns 'YES' if true.

2. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - The loop variable `b` was set to some value during the previous iteration.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `b < remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1`.

Since the exact value of `b` at the end of the previous iteration is not given, let's denote the value of `b` as `b_prev`. The loop will continue if `b_prev < remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1`.

For the next iteration:
- `b` will be incremented by 1, so the new value of `b` will be `b_prev + 1`.
- The condition for the loop to continue will be `b_prev + 1 < remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `b` is one more than its previous value, and the condition for the loop to continue must still hold.

State: **`a` is `a + 1`, `b` is `b_prev + 1`, and `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1` must be greater than `b_prev + 1`.**

To express this clearly:
- `a` remains `a + 1`.
- `b` becomes `b_prev + 1`.
- `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1` must still be greater than `b_prev + 1`.

Given that the exact value of `b_prev` is not specified, we can represent the state as:
State: **`a` is `a + 1`, `b` is `b_prev + 1`, `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1` must be greater than `b_prev + 1`.**
