The code `in_degree[v] += 1` increments the value of `in_degree[v]` by 1. Since `v` is a vertex in `graph[u]`, it means `v` is already part of the dictionary `in_degree` with an existing value. Incrementing this value by 1 will update the in-degree count for vertex `v`.

- `graph` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it.
- `in_degree` will have its value for key `v` incremented by 1.
- `u` and `v` remain unchanged as the code does not modify them.

Output State: **`graph` must have at least one key remaining, `in_degree` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex and the corresponding value is the total number of incoming edges for that vertex incremented by the number of times the vertex was iterated over, `u` is a vertex such that `graph[u]` is not empty and contains at least one vertex, and `v` is a vertex in `graph[u]`; `in_degree[v]` is incremented by 1.**
