`temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Initially, `temp_counter` is 2, so after the increment, `temp_counter` becomes 3. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is 3, `0` is in `files_set`, `2 * n` must be greater than or equal to 2, and "2" must be added to `files_set` in the loop body**
