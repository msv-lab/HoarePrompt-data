Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `max_erase` is the maximum value of `j - i - 1` for all valid sublists `[i:j]` where `j` ranges from `i+1` to `n+1` and satisfies the condition `a[k] - a[i] == k - i` for all `k` in the range `[i, j)`, and `n` must be greater than 0. The condition `(all((a[k] - a[i] == k - i for k in range(i, j))))` is true.**
