The line `y_found = True` sets the variable `y_found` to `True`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `marks` is a non-empty list, `mark` and `y` are such that either `mark + y` or `mark - y` is an element of `marks_set`, `x_found` is set to True, `y_found` is set to True, `marks` has at least one remaining element.**
