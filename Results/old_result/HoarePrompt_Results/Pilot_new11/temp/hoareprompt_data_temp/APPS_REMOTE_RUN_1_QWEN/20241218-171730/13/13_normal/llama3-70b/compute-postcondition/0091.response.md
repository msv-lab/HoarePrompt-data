Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `i` is a non-negative integer.
   - `j` is `n`.
   - `beauty` is the number of consecutive 'G's from index `i-1` to the first 'S' or the end of the string `s`.
   - `left` is the index of the last 'G' in the string `s`, or `n` if there are no 'G's.
   - `right` is `n`.
   - `max_beauty` is the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`.
   - `curr_beauty` is 0.
   - `max_beauty_one_swap` is `beauty` if `beauty` > 0, else 0.
   - `golden` is a list of indices of all characters in `s` that are equal to 'G'.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop runs for `i` in the range `range(n - 1)`. This means `i` should be incremented by 1 at each iteration until `i` is less than `n - 1`.

3. **Loop Execution:**
   Since we don't know the exact loop body, let's focus on how the states change based on the loop condition.

4. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is some non-negative integer, and `i < n - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `i + 1`.
   - `j` remains `n` since it is not modified within the loop.
   - `beauty` may change depending on the character `s[i]`. If `s[i]` is 'G' and `s[i+1]` is 'S', then `beauty` might increase, otherwise it remains the same.
   - `left` will update if `s[i]` is 'G', otherwise it remains the same.
   - `right` remains `n` as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `max_beauty` will be updated to the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`, but since `curr_beauty` is always 0, `max_beauty` will remain unchanged.
   - `max_beauty_one_swap` will only change if `beauty` is greater than 0 and `s[i]` is 'G' and `s[i+1]` is 'S', otherwise it remains unchanged.
   - `golden` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Final Adjusted States:**
   - `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now `i + 1`.
   - `j` remains `n`.
   - `beauty` might change based on the conditions described.
   - `left` might change based on the conditions described.
   - `right` remains `n`.
   - `max_beauty` remains unchanged.
   - `max_beauty_one_swap` might change based on the conditions described.
   - `golden` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the adjusted states for the next iteration are:

State: **`i` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `i + 1`, `j` is `n`, `beauty` is the number of consecutive 'G's from index `i-1` to the first 'S' or the end of the string `s`, `left` is the index of the last 'G' in the string `s`, or `n` if there are no 'G's, `right` is `n`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is `beauty` if `beauty` > 0, else 0, and `golden` is a list of indices of all characters in `s` that are equal to 'G'.**
