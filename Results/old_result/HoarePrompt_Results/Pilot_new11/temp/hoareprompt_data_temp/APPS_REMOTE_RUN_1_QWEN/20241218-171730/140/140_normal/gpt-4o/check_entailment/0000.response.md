Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if a directed graph can become acyclic by removing at most one edge. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Graph Representation**: The graph is represented using an adjacency list, which is appropriate for this problem.
2. **Cycle Detection**: The `has_cycle` function uses topological sorting via in-degree counting to detect cycles. This is a standard method to check for cycles in directed graphs.
3. **Edge Removal Check**: The main function `func_1` iterates through each edge, temporarily removes it, and checks if the graph becomes acyclic. If it does, the function returns 'YES'; otherwise, it re-adds the edge and continues checking other edges.
4. **Boundary Cases**: The code handles the boundary cases correctly by checking if the graph is already acyclic before attempting to remove any edge. If the graph is already acyclic, it immediately returns 'YES'.

Since the program follows the problem description and handles all cases appropriately, it is correct.
