Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `ratings` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers `(a_i, b_i)` with `1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 4126`, `is_rated` is True, `is_unrated` is False.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `n` times, appending tuples of integers `(a_i, b_i)` to the `ratings` list.
- The condition `if a != b:` ensures that `is_rated` is set to True if `a` is not equal to `b`. Since the condition `a != b` is checked within the loop and the loop runs `n` times, `is_rated` will always be True after the loop completes.
- The `is_unrated` variable is never modified and remains False throughout the loop execution.
- Each iteration reads two integers `a_i` and `b_i` from input and appends them as a tuple to the `ratings` list.
- Since the loop runs `n` times, `ratings` will contain exactly `n` tuples.
- The values of `a_i` and `b_i` are derived from user input and range between 1 and 4126, inclusive.
