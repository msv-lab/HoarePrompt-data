Let's break down the task step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

1. **Identify the Variables Involved:**
   - `n`: An integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\).
   - `f_max_n`: The maximum value of \(f(p)\) for permutations of length \(n\).
   - `MOD`: Set to \(1000000007\) (which is \(10^9 + 7\)).
   - `dp`: A list of length `f_max_n + 1` where the first element is 1 and all other elements are 0.

2. **Understand the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates from `1` to `n + 1` (exclusive).

3. **Determine Necessary Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 1`.
   - For each iteration, `i` increments until it reaches `n + 1`.

4. **Check Initial States:**
   - `n` must be at least 2 because the loop starts at `1` and goes up to `n + 1`, meaning there must be at least one valid `i` to enter the loop.
   - Since the loop body is omitted, we don't need to adjust any specific values inside `dp` or `f_max_n` for the loop to start executing, but we need to ensure these are defined correctly.

5. **Adjust the State:**
   - The variable `i` should start at 1.
   - The variable `n` must be at least 2.

Therefore, the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute are:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `f_max_n` is the maximum value of f(p) for permutations of length n, `MOD` is 1000000007, `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1` where the first element is 1 and all other elements are 0, `i` is 1**
