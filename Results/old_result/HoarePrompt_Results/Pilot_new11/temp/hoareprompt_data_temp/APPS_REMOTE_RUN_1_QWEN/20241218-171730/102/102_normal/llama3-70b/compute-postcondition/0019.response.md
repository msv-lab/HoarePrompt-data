The `print(x, y)` statement outputs the values of `x` and `y`. Since `x` is \(x + 1\) and `y` is \((n - x * a - a) // b\), these values are printed but do not change the actual values of the variables themselves. Therefore, the output of the print statement does not affect the values of `x` and `y`.

Output State: **`x` is \(x + 1\); `y` is \((n - x * a - a) // b\)**
