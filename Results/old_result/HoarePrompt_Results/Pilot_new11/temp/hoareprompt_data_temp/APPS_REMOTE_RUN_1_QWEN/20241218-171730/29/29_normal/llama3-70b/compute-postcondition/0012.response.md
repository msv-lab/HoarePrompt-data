The code sorts the `files` list in descending order based on the second element of each tuple (which is `type_`). The `n` variable remains unchanged since it was not used in the sorting operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect that the `files` list has been sorted, while `n` retains its initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `files` is a list of tuples sorted in descending order by the second element of each tuple (i.e., `type_`).**
