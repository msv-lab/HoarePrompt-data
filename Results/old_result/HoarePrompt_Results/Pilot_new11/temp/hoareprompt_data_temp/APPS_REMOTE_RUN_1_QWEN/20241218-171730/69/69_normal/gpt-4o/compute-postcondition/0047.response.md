Postcondition: ***`dx` is `x - final_x`, `final_x` is the number of 'R' operations minus the number of 'L' operations, `final_y` is the number of 'U' operations minus the number of 'D' operations, `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R', `x` and `y` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `dy` is `y - final_y`, `min_length` is set to `float('inf')`, `current_x` is 0, `current_y` is 0, `position_map` is `{(0, 0): -1}`. At this point in the execution, the character in `operations` at index `i` is 'U', which means the current position `(current_x, current_y)` moves up to `(current_x, current_y + 1)`. Therefore, `current_y` is now `current_y + 1`.***
