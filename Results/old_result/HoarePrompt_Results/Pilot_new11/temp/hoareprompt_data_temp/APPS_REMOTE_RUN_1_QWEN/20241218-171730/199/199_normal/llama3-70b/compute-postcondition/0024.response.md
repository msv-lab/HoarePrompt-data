Output State: **`ways` is either 0 or a positive integer, `a` is 2, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^9\), `b` is the last value of `b` checked in the loop. If for any `b` in the range where \(a \neq b\) and \(2 * (a + b) == n\), then `ways` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the value of `ways` remains unchanged.**
