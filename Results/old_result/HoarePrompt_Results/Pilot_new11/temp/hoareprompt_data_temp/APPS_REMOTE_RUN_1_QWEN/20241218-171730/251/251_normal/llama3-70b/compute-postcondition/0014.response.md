`dp[0]` is assigned the value of `cakes[0][0]`. This means the first element of the `dp` list, which was previously set to `0.0`, is now set to the volume of the first cake in the `cakes` list. The values of `n` and `cakes` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer; `cakes` is a list of tuples sorted in reverse order by their calculated volume; `dp`[0] is the volume of the first cake in the `cakes` list; all other elements in `dp` are `0.0`.**
