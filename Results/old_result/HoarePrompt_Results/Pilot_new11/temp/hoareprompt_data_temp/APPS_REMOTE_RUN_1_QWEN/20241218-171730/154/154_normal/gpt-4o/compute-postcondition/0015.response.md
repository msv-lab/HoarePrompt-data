Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 45, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, `M` is an integer such that 0 ≤ M ≤ 2 · 10^9, `t` is a list of `k` integers where each `t_j` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t_j ≤ 1000000, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in the list `t`, `time_used` is greater than `M`, `max_points` is 0, `points` is `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `remaining_time` is `M - time_used`, `subtasks_solved` is incremented by the integer division of `remaining_time` by `subtask_time`.***
