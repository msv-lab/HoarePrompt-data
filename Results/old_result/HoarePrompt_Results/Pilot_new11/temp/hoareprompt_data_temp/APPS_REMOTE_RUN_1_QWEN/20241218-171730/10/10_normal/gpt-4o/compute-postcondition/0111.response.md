Postcondition: ***`i` and `j` are integers, and they are equal to each other since the condition `i == j` is always true, and no changes are made to their values in the else part (if present).*** 

Given that the else part is specified as None, it implies there is no additional action when the condition `i == j` is false. Therefore, the only case to consider is when the condition `i == j` is true, which results in `i` and `j` being equal to each other.
