Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the input `m` is zero. According to the problem description, if `m` is zero, there should be no values of `n` such that the factorial of `n` ends with exactly `m` zeroes. However, the provided code returns an empty list for `m = 0`, which does not meet the requirement specified in the problem description.

For example, if the input is `0`, the expected output should be:
```
0
```

But the current implementation will return:
```
[]
```

This discrepancy indicates that the program is not fully compliant with the problem description for the case when `m = 0`. Therefore, the correctness is `False`.
