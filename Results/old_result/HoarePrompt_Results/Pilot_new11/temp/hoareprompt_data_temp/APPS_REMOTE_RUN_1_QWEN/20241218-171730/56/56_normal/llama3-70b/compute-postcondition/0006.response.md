Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- The state right before the while loop: 
  - `n` is an integer obtained from input()
  - `k` is an integer obtained from input()
  - `a` is an empty list
  - `i` is 0
- The while loop condition: `while n > 0:`

### Analysis:
- For the loop `while n > 0` to execute at least once, the initial value of `n` must be greater than 0.
- Since `n` is obtained from user input, we cannot guarantee its value without knowing the user's input.
- The variables `k`, `a`, and `i` do not affect the condition `n > 0`.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop can execute at least once, the only state that needs adjustment is ensuring `n` is greater than 0.

### Modified Program State:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer obtained from input(), `a` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
