You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A frog is initially at position $0$ on the number line. The frog has two positive integers $a$ and $b$. From a position $k$, it can either jump to position $k+a$ or $k-b$.

Let $f(x)$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $[0, x]$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $0$.

Given an integer $m$, find $\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$. That is, find the sum of all $f(i)$ for $i$ from $0$ to $m$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers $m, a, b$ ($1 \leq m \leq 10^9, 1 \leq a,b \leq 10^5$).


-----Output-----

Print a single integer, the desired sum.


-----Examples-----
Input
7 5 3

Output
19

Input
1000000000 1 2019

Output
500000001500000001

Input
100 100000 1

Output
101

Input
6 4 5

Output
10



-----Note-----

In the first example, we must find $f(0)+f(1)+\ldots+f(7)$. We have $f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$. The sum of these values is $19$.

In the second example, we have $f(i) = i+1$, so we want to find $\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$.

In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.
Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x

#Function 2:
def func_2(m, a, b):
    g = func_1(a, b)
    if g != 1:
        return func_2(m // g, a // g, b // g) * g
    k = a + b - 1
    if m < k:
        return (m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2
    sum_k = k * (k + 1) // 2
    sum_m = m * (m + 1) // 2 - k * (k - 1) // 2
    return sum_k + sum_m


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly implement the required functionality. The main issue lies in how the function `func_2` calculates the sum of `f(i)` for `i` from `0` to `m`. Specifically, the logic used to compute the sum of reachable positions up to `k` and beyond `k` is flawed.

Let's analyze the problematic part of the function:

1. **GCD Calculation**: The function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`.
2. **Recursive Call**: The function makes a recursive call to handle the case where `a` and `b` are coprime (`g == 1`), which is a good approach.
3. **Sum Calculation**: However, the sum calculation part is incorrect. It assumes that the reachable set forms an arithmetic sequence with the GCD `g`, but this is not always true, especially when considering the boundaries `[0, x]`.

To illustrate the flaw, consider the following input:
- For `m = 10`, `a = 4`, and `b = 5`:
  - The function will incorrectly calculate the sum as if the reachable set forms an arithmetic sequence, which is not accurate.

A more accurate approach would involve dynamically tracking the reachable positions within the interval `[0, m]` and counting the distinct positions. This would require a more complex algorithm that iteratively builds the set of reachable positions and ensures no duplicates are added.

Since the provided code does not correctly handle all cases, particularly the dynamic tracking of reachable positions, it is deemed incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
(m, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
result = func_2(m, a, b)
print(result)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers, where x and y represent the positive integers \(a\) and \(b\) from the problem description.
def func_1(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`; `y` is 0.
    return x
    #The program returns x, which is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of x and y, given that y is 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integers `x` and `y`. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. The function iteratively updates `x` and `y` such that `x` becomes `y` and `y` becomes `x % y` until `y` is 0. At this point, `x` holds the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`. The function then returns `x`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `x` is the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`, and `y` is 0. An edge case to consider is when either `x` or `y` is 0; in such cases, the function still correctly computes the GCD.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: m, a, and b are integers such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\) and \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^5\).
def func_2(m, a, b):
    g = func_1(a, b)
    if (g != 1) :
        return func_2(m // g, a // g, b // g) * g
        #The program returns the value of `func_2(m // g, a // g, b // g)` multiplied by `g`
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\), `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^5\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 10^5\), `g` is the return value of `func_1(a, b)`, and \(g\) is equal to 1
    k = a + b - 1
    if (m < k) :
        return (m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2
        #The program returns ((m + 1) * (m + 2)) // 2, where m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9 and the current value of m is less than k, and k is equal to a + b - 1, with a and b being integers such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ b ≤ 10^5
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\), `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^5\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 10^5\), `g` is equal to 1, `k` is `a + b - 1`, and \(m \geq a + b - 1\)
    sum_k = k * (k + 1) // 2
    sum_m = m * (m + 1) // 2 - k * (k - 1) // 2
    return sum_k + sum_m
    #`The program returns sum_k + sum_m where sum_k is (a + b - 1) * (a + b) // 2 and sum_m is m * (m + 1) // 2 - (a + b - 1) * (a + b - 2) // 2`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts three integers `m`, `a`, and `b` such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\) and \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^5\). It performs the following actions based on the GCD of `m`, `a`, and `b`:

1. If the GCD of `m`, `a`, and `b` (stored in `g`) is not 1, the function recursively calls itself with `m`, `a`, and `b` divided by `g` and multiplies the result by `g`. This ensures that `m`, `a`, and `b` are reduced to their coprime form.
2. If the current value of `m` is less than `k` (where `k` is `a + b - 1`), the function returns \(((m + 1) * (m + 2)) // 2\).
3. Otherwise, the function calculates two sums: `sum_k` as \((a + b - 1) * (a + b) // 2\) and `sum_m` as \(m * (m + 1) // 2 - (a + b - 1) * (a + b - 2) // 2\), then returns their sum.

This function effectively computes a specific mathematical expression based on the initial values of `m`, `a`, and `b`, reducing the problem size in the first case and performing calculations in the other cases.
