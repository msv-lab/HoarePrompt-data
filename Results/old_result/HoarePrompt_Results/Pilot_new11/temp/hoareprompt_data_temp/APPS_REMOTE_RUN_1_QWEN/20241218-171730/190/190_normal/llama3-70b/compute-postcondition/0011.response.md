`min_cost` is assigned the value of `cost`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this line of code. The current value of `cost` is less than `min_cost`, which means `min_cost` is updated to the current value of `cost`. 

Output State: **`i` is `mid - 1`, `min_cost` is `cost`, and the current value of `cost` is less than `min_cost`.**
