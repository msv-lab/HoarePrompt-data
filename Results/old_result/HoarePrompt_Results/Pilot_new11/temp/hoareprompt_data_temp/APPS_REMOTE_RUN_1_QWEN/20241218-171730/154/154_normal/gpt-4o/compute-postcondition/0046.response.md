Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `complete_tasks`, `max_points`, `total_time_per_task`, `time_used`, `points`, `remaining_time`, `num_processed`, and `t` are integers within their specified ranges. If `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`, then `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is set to `remaining_time // subtask_time`, `subtasks_solved` is incremented by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`, and `remaining_time` is updated to `remaining_time - (remaining_time // subtask_time) * subtask_time`. Otherwise, no changes are made to these variables.***
