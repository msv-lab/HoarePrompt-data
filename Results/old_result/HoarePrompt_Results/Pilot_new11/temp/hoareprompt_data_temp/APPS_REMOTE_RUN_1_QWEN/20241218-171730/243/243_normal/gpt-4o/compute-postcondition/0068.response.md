To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to carefully analyze the condition of the `while` loop and the given states.

### Given Information:
- The loop condition is `while func_1(left) == m`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
  - `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\).
  - `mid` is equal to \((low + high) // 2\).
  - `func_1(mid)` must be equal to `m`.
  - `left` is decreased by 1.

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `func_1(left) == m`.
2. **Current State**: 
   - We know `func_1(mid)` is equal to `m`.
   - `left` has been decreased by 1, so the new value of `left` is `mid - 1`.

### Determining the Next State:
For the loop to continue executing, `func_1(left)` must still be equal to `m`. Given that `left` is now `mid - 1`, we need to ensure that `func_1(mid - 1)` is equal to `m`.

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs to be adjusted is `left` to ensure that `func_1(left)` remains equal to `m`. Specifically, `left` must be set to `mid - 1` so that in the next iteration, `func_1(left)` will be checked again.

### Final State:
State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `mid` is equal to \((low + high) // 2\), `func_1(mid)` must be equal to `m`, and `left` must be equal to `mid - 1`**.
