You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Two positive integers a and b have a sum of s and a bitwise XOR of x. How many possible values are there for the ordered pair (a, b)?


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers s and x (2 ≤ s ≤ 10^12, 0 ≤ x ≤ 10^12), the sum and bitwise xor of the pair of positive integers, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer, the number of solutions to the given conditions. If no solutions exist, print 0.


-----Examples-----
Input
9 5

Output
4

Input
3 3

Output
2

Input
5 2

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first sample, we have the following solutions: (2, 7), (3, 6), (6, 3), (7, 2).

In the second sample, the only solutions are (1, 2) and (2, 1).
Program:
```
def func():
    (s, x) = map(int, input().split())
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, s):
        b = s - a
        if a ^ b == x:
            count += 1
    print(count)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle large inputs correctly. Specifically, the program uses a brute-force approach to iterate through all possible values of `a` from 1 to `s-1` and calculates `b` as `s - a`. It then checks if `a ^ b == x`. However, this approach fails for large values of `s` because it exceeds the time limit due to the large range of values being iterated over.

For example, consider the input `s = 10^12` and `x = 0`. The program will iterate through all values from 1 to \(10^{12} - 1\), which is computationally infeasible.

A more efficient approach would involve understanding the properties of the XOR operation and the constraints given. Given that \(a + b = s\) and \(a \oplus b = x\), we can derive the conditions under which valid pairs \((a, b)\) exist. This involves analyzing the binary representation of `s` and `x` and counting the number of solutions based on their bit patterns.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two non-negative integers `s` and `x` as input, where `2 ≤ s ≤ 10^12` and `0 ≤ x ≤ 10^12`. It iterates through all possible pairs `(a, b)` such that `a + b = s` and counts how many of these pairs satisfy the condition `a ⊕ b = x`, where `⊕` denotes the bitwise XOR operation. If `x` is 0, the function directly prints `s`. Otherwise, it prints the count of valid pairs `(a, b)`. The function does not return anything explicitly but prints the result. Potential edge cases include when `s` is exactly 2 or `x` is 0, which are handled correctly by the code.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
