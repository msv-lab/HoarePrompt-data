Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The annotated version confirms that the program does not correctly handle cases where there are no example tests. Specifically, the program always generates a move script, even if there are no example tests, which leads to incorrect results. For instance, in the input:

```
3
11 0
12 0
13 0
```

The program outputs:
```
3
move 11 1
move 12 2
move 13 3
```

This is incorrect because there are no example tests, and thus the output should be:

```
0
```

The annotated version shows that the program sorts the files by their type in descending order and then generates a move script for the regular tests starting from the position of the last example test. However, it does not account for the scenario where there are no example tests, leading to the incorrect behavior described. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.
