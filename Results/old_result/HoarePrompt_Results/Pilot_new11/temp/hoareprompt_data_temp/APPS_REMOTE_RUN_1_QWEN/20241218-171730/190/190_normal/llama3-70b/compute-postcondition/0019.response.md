Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `i` is `mid - 2`.
   - `cost` is the sum of `min(abs(x - (mid - 2)), abs(x - (mid - 1)))` for each `x` in `sticks`.
   - `min_cost` is some value (not explicitly defined but known from the context).
   - `min_t` is either set to `i` or remains unchanged based on the condition.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs in reverse from `mid - 1` to `1` (inclusive).

3. **Current Iteration**:
   - The current value of `i` is `mid - 2`.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to decrease by 1.
   - Therefore, the new value of `i` will be `mid - 3`.

5. **Updating Other States**:
   - The value of `cost` will be recalculated for the new value of `i` (`mid - 3`).
   - `min_t` will be updated if the new `cost` is less than `min_cost`.

Based on these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is `mid - 3`.
- `cost` is the sum of `min(abs(x - (mid - 3)), abs(x - (mid - 2)))` for each `x` in `sticks`.
- `min_t` is either set to `i` (`mid - 3`) or remains unchanged.

Thus, the final state is:

State: **`i` is `mid - 3`, `cost` is the sum of `min(abs(x - (mid - 3)), abs(x - (mid - 2)))` for each `x` in `sticks`, `min_t` is either set to `mid - 3` or remains unchanged**.
