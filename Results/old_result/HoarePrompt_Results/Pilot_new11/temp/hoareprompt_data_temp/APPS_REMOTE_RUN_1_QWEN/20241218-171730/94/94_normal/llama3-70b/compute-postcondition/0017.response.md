Output State: **`puzzle1` is a string of four characters, `puzzle2` is a string of four characters, `x1` is the index of 'X' in `puzzle1`, and `x2` is the index of 'X' in `puzzle2`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the indices `0` to `3` (inclusive) in `range(4)`.
- For each iteration, the loop checks if the current character in `puzzle1` is 'X' and if the current character in `puzzle2` is 'X'.
- If the character in `puzzle1` at the current index `i` is 'X', `x1` is set to the current index `i`.
- Similarly, if the character in `puzzle2` at the current index `i` is 'X', `x2` is set to the current index `i`.
- After the loop completes all iterations, `x1` will hold the index of 'X' in `puzzle1`, and `x2` will hold the index of 'X' in `puzzle2`.

Since the loop iterates through all possible indices, it will always find the index of 'X' in both `puzzle1` and `puzzle2`. Therefore, after the loop completes, `x1` and `x2` will definitely be set to the correct indices of the empty cell ('X') in their respective puzzles.
