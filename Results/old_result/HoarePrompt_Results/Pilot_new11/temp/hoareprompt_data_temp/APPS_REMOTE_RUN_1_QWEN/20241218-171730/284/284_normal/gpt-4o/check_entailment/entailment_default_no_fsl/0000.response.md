Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code appears to correctly implement the logic to find a counterexample for PolandBall's hypothesis. The program reads an integer `n`, then iterates through values of `m` from 1 to 1000, checking if `n * m + 1` is a prime number using the `func_1` function. If it finds a value of `m` for which `n * m + 1` is not a prime, it prints `m` and breaks the loop.

The `func_1` function correctly implements the primality test described in the problem. It handles the special cases for numbers less than or equal to 3 and uses a more efficient algorithm to check for primality for larger numbers. Given the constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), the code should find a counterexample for any valid input.

Since the problem guarantees that there will always be a valid `m` for any given `n` in the specified range, and the provided code correctly implements the necessary logic, the program is correct for every potential case.
