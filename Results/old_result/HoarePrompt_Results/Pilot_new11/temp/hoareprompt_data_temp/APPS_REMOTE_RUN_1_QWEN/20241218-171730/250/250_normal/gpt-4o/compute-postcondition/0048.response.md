Postcondition: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `marks` is a list of integers that must not be empty, `marks_set` is a set of unique elements from `marks`, `x_found` is `False`, `y_found` is `False`, and `new_marks` is a set containing either `mark + x` or `mark - x` based on the condition inside the if-else block, and none of `mark + y + x`, `mark + y - x`, or `mark - y + x` are in `marks_set`. The condition `(mark - y + x in marks_set or mark - y - x in marks_set)` is true.**
