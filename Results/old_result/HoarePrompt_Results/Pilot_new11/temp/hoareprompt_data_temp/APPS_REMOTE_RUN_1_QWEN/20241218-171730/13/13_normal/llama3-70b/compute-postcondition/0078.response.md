The code `break` is used to exit a loop or the most internal nested structure, but in this case, there is no loop or nested structure present that would be exited by this `break` statement. The variables `i`, `j`, `beauty`, `left`, `right`, `max_beauty`, `curr_beauty`, `max_beauty_one_swap`, and `golden` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 3, `beauty` is the number of consecutive 'G's from index `i-1` to the first 'S' or the end of the string `s`, `left` is the index of the last 'G' in the string `s`, or `n` if there are no 'G's, `right` is `n`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is 0, `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0, and `golden` is a list of indices of all characters in `s` that are equal to 'G'. The character at index `j` in `s` is not 'G'**
