Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly find the smallest possible square frame that encloses all white pixels. Specifically, the program calculates the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates of the white pixels and attempts to form a square frame based on these coordinates. However, this approach does not guarantee that the resulting frame will be the smallest possible square that encloses all white pixels.

For example, consider the following input:

```
4 5
..w..
.....
..w..
..w..
```

The program would output:

```
++w++
+.+..
++.+.
++.+.
```

However, the correct output should be:

```
++w++
++w++
++w++
++w++
```

This is because the smallest square frame that encloses all white pixels is of size 3x3, not 4x4 as the program suggests. The program incorrectly forms a 4x4 frame instead of the optimal 3x3 frame. Therefore, the program is incorrect for this case and for other similar cases where the optimal frame is smaller than the calculated frame size.
