Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `curr_lat` is -90, and the output is 'NO'.*** 

Explanation: Given the precondition and the if part of the program fragment, `curr_lat` is fixed at -90 regardless of the value of `dir`. Since the condition `curr_lat == -90 and dir != 'North'` is checked in the if part, it implies that `curr_lat` will remain -90, and the program will print 'NO'. There is no else part, so the postcondition does not change from the if part.
