The code `prev_start, prev_end = segments[i - 1]` assigns the first and second elements of the tuple at index `i - 1` in the `segments` list to `prev_start` and `prev_end`, respectively. This changes the values of `prev_start` and `prev_end`. The values of `curr_start` and `curr_end` remain unchanged.

- `prev_start` is now the first element of the tuple at index `i - 1` in `segments`.
- `prev_end` is now the second element of the tuple at index `i - 1` in `segments`.
- `curr_start` remains the first element of the tuple at index `i + 1` in `segments`.
- `curr_end` remains the second element of the tuple at index `i + 1` in `segments`.

Output State: **`prev_start` is the first element of the tuple at index `i - 1` in `segments`; `prev_end` is the second element of the tuple at index `i - 1` in `segments`; `curr_start` is the first element of the tuple at index `i + 1` in `segments`; `curr_end` is the second element of the tuple at index `i + 1` in `segments`.**
