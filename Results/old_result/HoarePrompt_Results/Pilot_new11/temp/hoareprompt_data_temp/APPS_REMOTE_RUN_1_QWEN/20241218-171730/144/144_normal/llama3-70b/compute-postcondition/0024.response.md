The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it reads input from the standard input stream. The first line of input is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000), representing the number of elements in the array. The second line of input is `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}` (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9), representing the elements of the array. The function then processes this input and returns a value based on the array elements.

Given the lack of an explicit return statement in the function definition, we need to consider the possible outputs. Since the problem does not specify any particular return value or behavior beyond reading the input, we can infer that the function's primary purpose is to process the array. However, without more context, we can only state what it accepts and the nature of its input processing.

Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` followed by `n` integers from the standard input, processes the array, and returns a value based on the array elements.**
