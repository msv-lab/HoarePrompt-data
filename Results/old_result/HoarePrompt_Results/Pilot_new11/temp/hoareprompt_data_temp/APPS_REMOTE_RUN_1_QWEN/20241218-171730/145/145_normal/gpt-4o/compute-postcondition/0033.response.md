Postcondition: ***`target_sum` is the sum of the first `n` elements in the list, `segment_length` is `n`, `current_sum` is either 0 or the value of `ticket[0]`, `segment_count` is 1, `i` is 1, and `n` is the length of the ticket list.***

This postcondition summarizes both cases: when `current_sum` equals `target_sum`, `current_sum` becomes 0 (due to the reset implied by the if condition), and when it does not, `current_sum` retains the value of `ticket[0]` as per the if part's description. The other variables (`segment_count`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged in both cases.
