Output State: **`n` is greater than 2; `ratings` is `[('a', 'b'), ('a', 'b'), (a, b)]; `is_rated` is True; `is_unrated` is False; `a` is an integer from input; `b` is an integer from input** 

Explanation: The code simply sets `is_rated` to `True`. Since `is_rated` was already `True` in the initial state, setting it again to `True` does not change its value. All other variables remain unchanged.
