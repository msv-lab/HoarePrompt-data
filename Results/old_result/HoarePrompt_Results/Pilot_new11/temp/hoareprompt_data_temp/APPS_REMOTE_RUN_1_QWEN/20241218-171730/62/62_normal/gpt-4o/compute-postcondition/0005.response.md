Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables and Their Current States:**
   - `decimal_value`: This is calculated as `digits[1] * base + digit`.
   - `digits`: This is a list of integers.

2. **Understand the Loop Structure:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in the `digits` list.
   - The variable `digit` takes on the value of each element in the `digits` list during each iteration.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - After the previous iteration, `decimal_value` is `digits[1] * base + digit`.
   - The `digit` used in the calculation was the second element in the `digits` list (index 1).

4. **Determine the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, it needs to process the next element in the `digits` list.
   - Therefore, `digit` will now be the third element in the `digits` list (index 2).
   - The `decimal_value` will be recalculated based on this new `digit`.

5. **Adjust the States:**
   - The `digit` will change to the third element in the `digits` list.
   - The `decimal_value` will be updated using the new `digit`.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`decimal_value` is `digits[1] * base + digits[2]`, `digits` is a list of integers**
