Let's break down the given problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given States:
- `d` is an input integer.
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^5\).
- `x_1` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x_1 \leq n\).
- `y_1` is an integer such that \(1 \leq y_1 \leq m\).
- `x_2` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x_2 \leq n\).
- `y_2` is an integer such that \(1 \leq y_2 \leq m\).
- `cnt_l` is an integer such that \(0 \leq cnt_l \leq d - 1\).
- `cnt_r` is an integer such that \(0 \leq cnt_r \leq d - 1\).
- `cnt_t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq cnt_t \leq d - 1\).
- `cnt_b` is an integer such that \(0 \leq cnt_b \leq d - 1\).
- `n` is the first integer input.
- `m` is the second integer input.
- `sofas` is an empty list.

### For Loop:
```
for _ in range(d):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
The for loop runs `d` times. To ensure the loop can execute, the value of `d` must be at least 1. The values of `n`, `m`, `x_1`, `y_1`, `x_2`, `y_2`, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b`, `n`, and `m` do not directly impact whether the loop can execute. The key variable is `d`.

### Required Adjustments:
- Ensure `d` is at least 1, as the loop runs `d` times.

### Final State:
State: **`d` must be at least 1**, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^5\), `x_1` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x_1 \leq n\), `y_1` is an integer such that \(1 \leq y_1 \leq m\), `x_2` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x_2 \leq n\), `y_2` is an integer such that \(1 \leq y_2 \leq m\), `cnt_l` is an integer such that \(0 \leq cnt_l \leq d - 1\), `cnt_r` is an integer such that \(0 \leq cnt_r \leq d - 1\), `cnt_t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq cnt_t \leq d - 1\), `cnt_b` is an integer such that \(0 \leq cnt_b \leq d - 1\), `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `sofas` is an empty list.
