Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the code fails to generate the required sequence of fractions for cases where \( n \) is not divisible by 2. For example, if \( n = 4 \), the code would incorrectly print "YES" and then set \( n \) to 2, which is not a valid fraction according to the problem constraints (\( 1 < b_i < n \)).

To correctly solve the problem, the code needs to factorize \( n-1 \) and find divisors of \( n-1 \) that satisfy the conditions for \( b_i \). The current implementation only works for even values of \( n \) greater than 2 and does not cover other cases where \( n-1 \) has suitable divisors.
