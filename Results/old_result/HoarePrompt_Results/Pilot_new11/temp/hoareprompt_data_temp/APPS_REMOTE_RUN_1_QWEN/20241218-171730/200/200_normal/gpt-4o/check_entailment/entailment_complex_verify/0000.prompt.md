You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The Fair Nut likes kvass very much. On his birthday parents presented him $n$ kegs of kvass. There are $v_i$ liters of kvass in the $i$-th keg. Each keg has a lever. You can pour your glass by exactly $1$ liter pulling this lever. The Fair Nut likes this drink very much, so he wants to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass. But he wants to do it, so kvass level in the least keg is as much as possible.

Help him find out how much kvass can be in the least keg or define it's not possible to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $s$ ($1 \le n \le 10^3$, $1 \le s \le 10^{12}$) — the number of kegs and glass volume.

The second line contains $n$ integers $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n$ ($1 \le v_i \le 10^9$) — the volume of $i$-th keg.


-----Output-----

If the Fair Nut cannot pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass, print $-1$. Otherwise, print a single integer — how much kvass in the least keg can be.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3
4 3 5

Output
3

Input
3 4
5 3 4

Output
2

Input
3 7
1 2 3

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example, the answer is $3$, the Fair Nut can take $1$ liter from the first keg and $2$ liters from the third keg. There are $3$ liters of kvass in each keg.

In the second example, the answer is $2$, the Fair Nut can take $3$ liters from the first keg and $1$ liter from the second keg.

In the third example, the Fair Nut can't pour his cup by $7$ liters, so the answer is $-1$.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, s) = map(int, input().split())
    volumes = list(map(int, input().split()))
    volumes.sort()
    total_volume = sum(volumes)
    if total_volume < s:
        print(-1)
    else:
        min_keg_volume = volumes[0]
        remaining_kvass = s
        for i in range(n):
            if volumes[i] <= min_keg_volume:
                continue
            else:
                possible_to_take = min(volumes[i] - min_keg_volume, remaining_kvass)
                remaining_kvass -= possible_to_take
            if remaining_kvass == 0:
                break
        if remaining_kvass > 0:
            min_keg_volume -= (remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n
        print(min_keg_volume)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the initial volume of the least keg is already greater than or equal to the target volume `s` divided among all kegs. Let's consider an example:

### Counterexample:
**Input:**
```
3 6
5 5 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Actual Output:**
```
5
```

**Explanation:**
- The total volume of kvass is \(5 + 5 + 1 = 11\) liters.
- The target is to get 6 liters of kvass, which means we need to reduce the volume in the third keg from 1 to 1, but since the other two kegs have 5 liters each, we can take 1 liter from each of them, leaving the third keg with 1 - 1 = 0 liters. However, the program incorrectly keeps the volume of the third keg as 1, which is not the maximum possible volume for the least keg under the given constraints.

The program does not properly adjust the volume of the least keg when the remaining volume to be taken from the other kegs is less than the difference between the current volume of the least keg and the target volume per keg. This leads to an incorrect result in certain cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and s are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3 and 1 ≤ s ≤ 10^{12}, and v is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^9 for each i in range n.
def func():
    n, s = map(int, input().split())
    volumes = list(map(int, input().split()))
    volumes.sort()
    total_volume = sum(volumes)
    if (total_volume < s) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        min_keg_volume = volumes[0]
        remaining_kvass = s
        for i in range(n):
            if volumes[i] <= min_keg_volume:
                continue
            else:
                possible_to_take = min(volumes[i] - min_keg_volume, remaining_kvass)
                remaining_kvass -= possible_to_take
            
            if remaining_kvass == 0:
                break
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^3\), `s` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{12}\), `volumes` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order where \(1 \leq v_i \leq 10^9\) for each \(i\) in range `n`, `total_volume` is the sum of the elements in the `volumes` list, `min_keg_volume` is equal to the first element of the `volumes` list, `remaining_kvass` is either 0 or the amount of kvass remaining after processing all elements in `volumes` where the volume of the keg is greater than `min_keg_volume`. The loop breaks out of the loop when `remaining_kvass` is 0 or there are no more elements in `volumes` that satisfy the condition `volumes[i] > min_keg_volume`.
        if (remaining_kvass > 0) :
            min_keg_volume -= (remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n
        #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^3\), `s` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{12}\), `volumes` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order where \(1 \leq v_i \leq 10^9\) for each \(i\) in range `n`, `total_volume` is the sum of the elements in the `volumes` list, `min_keg_volume` is reduced by \((\text{remaining\_kvass} + n - 1) // n\) and `remaining_kvass` is the amount of kvass remaining after processing all elements in `volumes` where the volume of the keg is greater than `min_keg_volume` and its current value is greater than 0.
        print(min_keg_volume)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^3\), `s` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{12}\), `volumes` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order where \(1 \leq v_i \leq 10^9\) for each \(i\) in range `n`, `total_volume` is the sum of the elements in the `volumes` list. If `total_volume` is less than `s`, `-1` is printed. Otherwise, `min_keg_volume` is reduced by \((\text{remaining\_kvass} + n - 1) // n\) and `remaining_kvass` is the amount of kvass remaining after processing all elements in `volumes` where the volume of the keg is greater than `min_keg_volume` and its current value is greater than 0; the value of `min_keg_volume` is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers `n` and `s`, and a list `v` of `n` integers. It first sorts the list `v` in ascending order. Then, it checks if the sum of the elements in `v` is less than `s`. If it is, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it initializes `min_keg_volume` to the smallest element in `v` and calculates the remaining kvass needed (`remaining_kvass`). It iterates through the list `v`, adjusting `min_keg_volume` based on the difference between the current element and `min_keg_volume`, until `remaining_kvass` is zero or the loop exits. If `remaining_kvass` is still greater than zero after the loop, it further reduces `min_keg_volume` by \((\text{remaining\_kvass} + n - 1) // n\). Finally, it prints the adjusted `min_keg_volume`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function correctly handles the case where the sum of `v` is less than `s` by printing `-1`.
- The function correctly sorts the list `v` before processing.
- The function correctly updates `min_keg_volume` during the iteration, ensuring it is always the smallest possible value that can accommodate the remaining kvass.
- However, the function does not explicitly handle the case where `remaining_kvass` is zero before the loop ends due to elements in `v` being larger than `min_keg_volume`. This means the function may incorrectly reduce `min_keg_volume` even when `remaining_kvass` is zero, which should be a terminal condition for the loop.

After the function concludes, the state of the program will be:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^3\).
- `s` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{12}\).
- `volumes` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order where \(1 \leq v_i \leq 10^9\) for each \(i\) in range `n`.
- `total_volume` is the sum of the elements in the `volumes` list.
- `min_keg_volume` is the smallest possible value that can accommodate the remaining kvass after adjustments.
- `remaining_kvass` is either 0 or the amount of kvass remaining after processing all elements in `volumes` where the volume of the keg is greater than `min_keg_volume` and its current value is greater than 0.
