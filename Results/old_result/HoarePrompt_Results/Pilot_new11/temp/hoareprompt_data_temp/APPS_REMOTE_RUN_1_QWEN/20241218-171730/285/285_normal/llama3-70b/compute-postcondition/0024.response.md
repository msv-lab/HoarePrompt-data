The code `exit()` is used to terminate the program immediately. It does not affect any variables but simply exits the current execution context. Given the initial state, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `1234567`, `a` is `a_initial + 1`, `b` is `b_final`, `c` is \((n - (a_initial + 1) * 1234567 - b_final * 123456) // 1234\), and the equation \(a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234\) equals `n`. Printed output: 'YES'**
