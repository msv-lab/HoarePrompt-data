The code `print('Yes')` does not affect any variables; it only prints the string 'Yes' to the console. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user, `x` is a sorted list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of length `n` with elements converted from the input integers, the sum of the elements in `x` is equal to the sum of the elements in `y`, `y` is sorted, and the current value of `x` is equal to the current value of `y`. The console displays 'Yes'**
