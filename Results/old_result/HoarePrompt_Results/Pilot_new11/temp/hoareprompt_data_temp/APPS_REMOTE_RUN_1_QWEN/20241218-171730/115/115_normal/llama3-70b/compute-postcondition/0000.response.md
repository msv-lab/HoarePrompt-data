`n` and `m` are assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers. The matrix `A` remains unchanged, and its elements are either 0 or 1. Therefore, the output state is: $n$ and $m$ are integers such that $2 \le n, m \le 50$; A is a matrix of integers where each element is either 0 or 1; we read two integers from input and assign them to `n` and `m`.
