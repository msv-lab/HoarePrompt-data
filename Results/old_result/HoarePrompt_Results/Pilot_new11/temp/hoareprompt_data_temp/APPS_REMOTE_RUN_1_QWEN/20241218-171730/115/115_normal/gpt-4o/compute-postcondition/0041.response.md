Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `i` is `n - 2`, `m` is at least 2, and `j` is incremented by 1. If \( A[i][j] \), \( A[i][j + 1] \), \( A[i + 1][j] \), and \( A[i + 1][j + 1] \) are all equal to 1, then \( B[i][j] \), \( B[i][j + 1] \), \( B[i + 1][j] \), and \( B[i + 1][j + 1] \) are all equal to 1, `operations` contains the tuple \((n - 1, j + 1)\). Otherwise, \( B[i][j] \), \( B[i][j + 1] \), \( B[i + 1][j] \), and \( B[i + 1][j + 1] \) remain unchanged and `operations` remains unchanged.***
