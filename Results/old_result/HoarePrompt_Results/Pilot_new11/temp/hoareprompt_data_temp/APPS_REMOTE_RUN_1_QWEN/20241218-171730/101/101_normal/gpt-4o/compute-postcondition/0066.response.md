The code sets the value of `right` to `j`. Since `j` is a valid index and was previously greater than `right`, this assignment updates `right` to `j`. The other variables (`screen`, `i`, `j`, `top`, `bottom`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` and `j` are valid indices for `screen`, and `screen[i][j]` remains 'w'. `top` remains unchanged and equals `i`, `bottom` equals `i`; `right` is equal to `j`.**
