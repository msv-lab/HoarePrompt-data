`c` is incremented by `a[i]`. Since `i` is not even, the value of `i` could be 1, 3, 5, ..., up to the largest odd number less than or equal to `n-1`. However, without knowing the exact value of `i`, we cannot determine the exact value of `c`. But we know that `c` has been updated.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this line of code. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `b` is 0, `c` is `c + a[i]`, `i` is 0 and `i` is not even**
