You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A frog is initially at position $0$ on the number line. The frog has two positive integers $a$ and $b$. From a position $k$, it can either jump to position $k+a$ or $k-b$.

Let $f(x)$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $[0, x]$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $0$.

Given an integer $m$, find $\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$. That is, find the sum of all $f(i)$ for $i$ from $0$ to $m$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers $m, a, b$ ($1 \leq m \leq 10^9, 1 \leq a,b \leq 10^5$).


-----Output-----

Print a single integer, the desired sum.


-----Examples-----
Input
7 5 3

Output
19

Input

Output
500000001500000001

Input
100 100000 1

Output
101

Input
6 4 5

Output
10



-----Note-----

In the first example, we must find $f(0)+f(1)+\ldots+f(7)$. We have $f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$. The sum of these values is $19$.

In the second example, we have $f(i) = i+1$, so we want to find $\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$.

In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.
Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x

#Function 2:
def func_2(m, a, b):
    g = func_1(a, b)
    if g != 1:
        return func_2(m // g, a // g, b // g) * g
    k = a + b - 1
    if m < k:
        return (m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2
    sum_k = k * (k + 1) // 2
    sum_m = m * (m + 1) // 2 - k * (k - 1) // 2
    return sum_k + sum_m


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not accurately calculate the value of \( f(i) \) for each \( i \) from 0 to \( m \).

To illustrate this, consider the following example:

For \( m = 6 \), \( a = 4 \), and \( b = 5 \):

- According to the problem, \( f(0) = 1 \) (the frog can only stay at 0).
- For \( f(1) \), the frog cannot reach 1 since the smallest possible jump is 4 (from 0 to 4 or -4 which is not within [0, 1]).
- Similarly, \( f(2) = 1 \), \( f(3) = 1 \), and \( f(4) = 1 \).
- For \( f(5) \), the frog can jump from 0 to 4 and then from 4 to 5, so \( f(5) = 2 \).
- For \( f(6) \), the frog can jump from 0 to 4 and then from 4 to 9 (but 9 is out of range), or from 0 to -1 (not valid), or from 0 to 4 and back to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. So \( f(6) = 7 \).

Thus, the correct values are \( f(0) = 1 \), \( f(1) = 1 \), \( f(2) = 1 \), \( f(3) = 1 \), \( f(4) = 1 \), \( f(5) = 2 \), and \( f(6) = 7 \). Summing these gives \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 7 = 14 \).

However, the provided program outputs 10 for this input, indicating that the logic is flawed. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
(m, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
result = func_2(m, a, b)
print(result)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers, where x and y represent the positive integers \(a\) and \(b\) from the problem description.
def func_1(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`; `y` is 0.
    return x
    #The program returns x, which is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of x and y, given that y is 0

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: m, a, and b are integers such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\) and \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^5\).
def func_2(m, a, b):
    g = func_1(a, b)
    if (g != 1) :
        return func_2(m // g, a // g, b // g) * g
        #The program returns the value of `func_2(m // g, a // g, b // g)` multiplied by `g`
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\), `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^5\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 10^5\), `g` is the return value of `func_1(a, b)`, and \(g\) is equal to 1
    k = a + b - 1
    if (m < k) :
        return (m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2
        #The program returns ((m + 1) * (m + 2)) // 2, where m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9 and the current value of m is less than k, and k is equal to a + b - 1, with a and b being integers such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ b ≤ 10^5
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\), `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^5\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 10^5\), `g` is equal to 1, `k` is `a + b - 1`, and \(m \geq a + b - 1\)
    sum_k = k * (k + 1) // 2
    sum_m = m * (m + 1) // 2 - k * (k - 1) // 2
    return sum_k + sum_m
    #`The program returns sum_k + sum_m where sum_k is (a + b - 1) * (a + b) // 2 and sum_m is m * (m + 1) // 2 - (a + b - 1) * (a + b - 2) // 2`



Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
