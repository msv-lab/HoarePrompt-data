According to the code, the loop will iterate over values of `t` from 1 to 100. For the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `t` starts at 1 and ends at 100.

Let's break down the necessary adjustments:

1. The variable `t` must start at 1 and go up to 100.
2. The value of `n` is given as an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), but this does not directly impact the loop's execution, as the loop itself is iterating over `t` from 1 to 100, regardless of the value of `n`.
3. The initial values of `min_cost` and `best_t` are given as `infinity` and `-1`, respectively, which are correct for initializing these variables.

Therefore, the key adjustment needed is ensuring that `t` starts at 1.

State: **`a` is a list of n integers, `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `min_cost` is infinity, `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1**
