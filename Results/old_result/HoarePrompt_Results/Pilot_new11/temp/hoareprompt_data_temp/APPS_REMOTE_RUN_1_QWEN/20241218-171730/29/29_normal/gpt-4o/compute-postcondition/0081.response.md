`temp_counter` is initially `2 * n + 1`. The code increments `temp_counter` by 1, so `temp_counter` becomes `(2 * n + 1) + 1`, which simplifies to `2 * n + 2`. The values of `files_set` and `regulars[i]` remain unchanged, and `moves` contains the new element `'move regulars[i] temp_counter'`.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is `2 * n + 2`, `files_set` contains all integers from 0 to `2 * n`, `regulars[i]` is `"2 * n + 1"`, and `moves` now contains a new element `'move regulars[i] temp_counter'`.**
