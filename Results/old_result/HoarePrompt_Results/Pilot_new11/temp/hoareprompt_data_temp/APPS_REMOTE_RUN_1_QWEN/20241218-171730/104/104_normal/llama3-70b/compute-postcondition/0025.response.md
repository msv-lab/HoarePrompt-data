Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `i` is 1, `j` is 4. If for all elements in the sub-list from index `i` to `j-1`, the difference between each element and `a[i]` equals their respective index differences, then `max_erase` is 2. Otherwise, the value of `max_erase` remains unchanged (either 1 or as it was previously). `n` must still be greater than 0.***
