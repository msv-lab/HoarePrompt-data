The code `max_questions -= 1` decrements `max_questions` by 1. The other variables (`sergei_questions` and `col`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1, `max_questions` is decreased by 1, and `col` is incremented by 1. If `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then these increments apply. Otherwise, no changes occur to the variables based on the given conditions.

Output State: **`sergei_questions` is incremented by 1, `max_questions` is decreased by 1, and `col` is incremented by 1. If `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then these increments apply. Otherwise, no changes occur to the variables based on the given conditions.**
