The code `break` does not assign any new values to the variables. It simply exits the loop or the most nested loop or conditional block it is inside. Since no new assignments are made, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer entered by the user, `k` is a positive integer, `line` is a string of length `n` consisting of '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos`, `T_pos` is greater than or equal to `G_pos`, `new_pos` is `pos + k`, and `reachable` is `True`. We break out of the most internal loop or conditional block.**
