The code reads four integers from input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k`. Since the input values are not specified in the initial state, we can only state that they are assigned the respective values from the input. However, the constraints for these variables remain the same.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r`, and `k` are assigned the respective integer values from input, with the constraints 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ `r` ≤ min(`n`, `m`), and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ min(`n` * `m`, 10^5).**
