Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200\), `s` is a non-empty string, `max_count` remains 0, `current_set` is a set containing the current character of `s` (which is lowercase), and `current_count` is 1 if the current character of `s` is not already in `current_set`, otherwise `current_count` remains 0.***
