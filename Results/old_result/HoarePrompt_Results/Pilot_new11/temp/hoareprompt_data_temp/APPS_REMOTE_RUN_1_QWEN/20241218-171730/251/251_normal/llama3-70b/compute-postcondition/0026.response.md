Postcondition: ***`dp[1]` is the volume of the first cake, and all elements in `dp` from `dp[0]` to `dp[k]` are updated to their new values according to the loop logic. If `cakes[i][1]` is less than `cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2]` is less than `cakes[j][2]`, then `dp[k+1]` is the value it gets after the loop completes its iteration up to `j = k`. Otherwise, `dp[k+1]` remains unchanged.***
