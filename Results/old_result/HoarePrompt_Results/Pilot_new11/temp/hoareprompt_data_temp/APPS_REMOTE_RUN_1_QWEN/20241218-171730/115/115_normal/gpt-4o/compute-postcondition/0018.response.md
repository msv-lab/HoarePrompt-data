To ensure the loop can execute, we need to verify the conditions under which the loop runs. The loop is defined as follows:

```python
for j in range(m - 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition of the Loop**: The loop runs for `j` in the range from `0` to `m - 2`. Therefore, the loop will execute if `m - 1 > 0`, which simplifies to `m > 1`.

2. **Given States**:
   - `n` is at least 2 (`n >= 2`).
   - `i` is `n - 1` (`i = n - 1`).
   - `m` is at least 2 (`m >= 2`).

3. **Loop Execution Condition**:
   - For the loop to execute, `m` must be greater than 1. Since it is given that `m` is at least 2, this condition is already satisfied.

4. **Initialization and Iteration Variables**:
   - `j` starts at `0` and increments by `1` until it reaches `m - 2`.

5. **List `operations`**:
   - The list `operations` contains tuples representing 2x2 submatrices in `A` that were flipped in `B`. This list is not directly involved in the loop's execution but may be used within the loop body.

### Conclusion:

The initial states provided do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute because `m` being at least 2 ensures that `m - 1` is at least 1, making the loop executable.

### Final Answer:

State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is `n - 1`, `m` is at least 2, and `operations` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a 2x2 submatrix in `A` that satisfied the condition and was flipped in `B`**.

Since `m` is at least 2, the loop condition `range(m - 1)` will include at least one iteration, ensuring the loop can execute. No additional adjustments are necessary based on the given states.
