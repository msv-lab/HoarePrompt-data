`possible_to_take` is subtracted from `remaining_kvass`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `possible_to_take`, we only know that it is being subtracted from `remaining_kvass`. The value of `n` remains greater than 1 as no operation was performed on it.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `remaining_kvass` is `remaining_kvass - possible_to_take`, `possible_to_take` is unchanged**
