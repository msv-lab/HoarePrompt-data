Postcondition: ***`unrated` is `False`, `rated` is `False`, `maybe` is `False`, `ratings_before` is a list containing `n` input integers, `ratings_after` is a list containing `n` input integers, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, and `i` is `n`. Since the condition `not unrated` is true, the if part is executed, and no changes occur to the variables in this case.***
