Let's analyze the given while loop and the conditions under which it will execute one more time.

### Given Loop:
```python
while left < right and s[left] != 'G':
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' or 'S' and `s[0]` is not 'G'
- `golden` is a list of integers containing the indices of all characters in `s` that are equal to 'G'
- `max_beauty` is the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`
- `left` is 1
- `right` is 1
- `curr_beauty` is 0

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition Analysis:**
   - The loop condition is `left < right and s[left] != 'G'`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions must hold true:
     - `left < right`: This condition is already false because `left` (which is 1) is not less than `right` (which is also 1).
     - `s[left] != 'G'`: This condition is irrelevant since the loop will not execute due to the first condition.

2. **Modification Needed:**
   - Since `left < right` is false, we need to adjust this condition to make it true for the next iteration.
   - To satisfy `left < right`, we need to change either `left` or `right` (or both) such that `left` is less than `right`.

Given the constraints and the current state:
- `left` is 1
- `right` is 1

To satisfy `left < right`, we need to increment `right` to be greater than `left`. The smallest value for `right` that satisfies this condition would be 2.

### Adjusted State:
- Increment `right` to 2 (since `right` must be greater than `left`).

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' or 'S' and `s[0]` is not 'G', `golden` is a list of integers containing the indices of all characters in `s` that are equal to 'G', `max_beauty` is the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`, `left` is 1, `right` is 2, and `curr_beauty` is 0**

This ensures that the condition `left < right` is satisfied, allowing the loop to execute one more time.
