Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find a counterexample for the given hypothesis. The program reads an integer \( n \) from the input, then iterates through values of \( m \) from 1 to 1000 to find an \( m \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number. The function `func_1` correctly determines whether a number is prime by checking divisibility up to the square root of the number. Given the constraints and the guarantee that an answer exists, the program will always find and print a suitable \( m \) within the specified range. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
