The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters but reads input from the user. Specifically, it first reads an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of elements in the array A. Then, it reads `n` integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-10^3 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^3) representing the elements of the array A.

Based on the given output cases, there are no specific return values mentioned directly in the problem statement, but we need to consider the typical behavior of such a function which would process the array A and return some result based on its elements. However, since no specific return values are provided in the example output, we can infer that the function might return some form of processed data from the array A, but the exact nature of the return value is not specified here.

Functionality: **The function reads an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-10^3 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^3) and processes the array A.**
