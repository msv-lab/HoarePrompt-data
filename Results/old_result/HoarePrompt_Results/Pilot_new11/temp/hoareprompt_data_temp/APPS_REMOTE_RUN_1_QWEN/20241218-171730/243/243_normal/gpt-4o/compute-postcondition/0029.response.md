The code `result = list(range(left + 1, right))` creates a list of integers starting from `left + 1` up to `right - 1`. Given the initial conditions:

- `right` is \(5 \times (m + 1)\)
- `left` is 0

So, `result` will be a list starting from `0 + 1` (which is 1) up to \(5 \times (m + 1) - 1\). This means `result` will contain all integers from 1 to \(5 \times (m + 1) - 1\).

The other variables (`result`, `zeroes`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `func_1(mid)`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`right` is \(5 \times (m + 1)\), `result` is a list containing integers from 1 to \(5 \times (m + 1) - 1\), `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)` and is less than or equal to `m`, `low` is 0, `high` is \(5 \times (m + 1)\), `mid` is \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2}\)**
