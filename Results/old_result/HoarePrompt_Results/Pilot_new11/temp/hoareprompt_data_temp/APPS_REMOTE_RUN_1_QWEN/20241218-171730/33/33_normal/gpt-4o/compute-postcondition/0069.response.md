The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. However, it implies that there are some variables or inputs that are used within the function, but these are not listed in the function signature. The functionality involves processing a series of movements (directions and distances) where `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, and for each `i` in the range from 1 to `n`, `t_i` is an integer between 1 and \(10^6\) representing the distance, and `dir_i` is a string indicating the direction of movement ("North", "South", "West", or "East").

Given the lack of explicit parameters in the function signature, we focus on the described functionality:

- The function processes `n` movements, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 50.
- For each movement, it considers a distance `t_i` between 1 and \(10^6\) and a direction `dir_i` which can be one of "North", "South", "West", or "East".

Since the problem does not specify any return value based on the given information, we assume the function performs operations based on the input but does not explicitly return anything.
