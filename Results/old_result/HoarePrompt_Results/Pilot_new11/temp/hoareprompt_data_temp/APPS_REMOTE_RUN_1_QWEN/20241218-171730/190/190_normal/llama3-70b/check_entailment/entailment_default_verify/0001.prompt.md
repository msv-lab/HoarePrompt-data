You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Salem gave you $n$ sticks with integer positive lengths $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$.

For every stick, you can change its length to any other positive integer length (that is, either shrink or stretch it). The cost of changing the stick's length from $a$ to $b$ is $|a - b|$, where $|x|$ means the absolute value of $x$.

A stick length $a_i$ is called almost good for some integer $t$ if $|a_i - t| \le 1$.

Salem asks you to change the lengths of some sticks (possibly all or none), such that all sticks' lengths are almost good for some positive integer $t$ and the total cost of changing is minimum possible. The value of $t$ is not fixed in advance and you can choose it as any positive integer. 

As an answer, print the value of $t$ and the minimum cost. If there are multiple optimal choices for $t$, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 1000$) — the number of sticks.

The second line contains $n$ integers $a_i$ ($1 \le a_i \le 100$) — the lengths of the sticks.


-----Output-----

Print the value of $t$ and the minimum possible cost. If there are multiple optimal choices for $t$, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
10 1 4

Output
3 7

Input
5
1 1 2 2 3

Output
2 0



-----Note-----

In the first example, we can change $1$ into $2$ and $10$ into $4$ with cost $|1 - 2| + |10 - 4| = 1 + 6 = 7$ and the resulting lengths $[2, 4, 4]$ are almost good for $t = 3$.

In the second example, the sticks lengths are already almost good for $t = 2$, so we don't have to do anything.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    sticks = list(map(int, input().split()))
    sticks.sort()
    mid = sticks[n // 2]
    cost = sum((abs(x - mid) for x in sticks))
    t = mid
    min_cost = cost
    min_t = t
    for i in range(mid - 1, 0, -1):
        cost = sum((min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i + 1))) for x in sticks))
        if cost < min_cost:
            min_cost = cost
            min_t = i
    for i in range(mid + 1, 101):
        cost = sum((min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i - 1))) for x in sticks))
        if cost < min_cost:
            min_cost = cost
            min_t = i
    print(min_t, min_cost)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where all stick lengths are already almost good for some $t$. Specifically, the program calculates the median stick length as a candidate for $t$ and then checks neighboring values. However, if all stick lengths are already within 1 unit of each other, the program may incorrectly suggest changing lengths instead of choosing the minimum possible cost, which is 0.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
1 1 2 2 3
```

The output of the program is `2 0`, which is correct. However, if all stick lengths are already within 1 unit of each other, the program should recognize this and output `t` as the median value without any cost. The program should also check if the minimum cost is 0 before suggesting any changes.

To fix this, the program needs to explicitly check if the minimum cost is 0 before proceeding with further calculations. Here’s a modified version of the function:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    sticks = list(map(int, input().split()))
    sticks.sort()
    
    # Check if all stick lengths are already almost good for some t
    min_val = min(sticks)
    max_val = max(sticks)
    if max_val - min_val <= 1:
        print(min_val, 0)
        return
    
    mid = sticks[n // 2]
    cost = sum((abs(x - mid) for x in sticks))
    t = mid
    min_cost = cost
    
    for i in range(mid - 1, 0, -1):
        new_cost = sum((min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i + 1))) for x in sticks))
        if new_cost < min_cost:
            min_cost = new_cost
            min_t = i
    
    for i in range(mid + 1, 101):
        new_cost = sum((min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i - 1))) for x in sticks))
        if new_cost < min_cost:
            min_cost = new_cost
            min_t = i
    
    print(min_t, min_cost)
```

With this modification, the program will correctly handle cases where all stick lengths are already almost good for some $t$, ensuring that the minimum cost is 0 if applicable.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads a list of integers `a` of length `n` (where `1 ≤ n ≤ 1000`) and each integer `a_i` in the list satisfies `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100`. It then sorts the list and calculates the median value `mid`. The function computes the cost of moving all elements in the list to a central value by considering the median and values around the median. Specifically, it first checks the cost for values around the median (`mid - 1` to `0` and `mid + 1` to `100`). The function finds the central value `min_t` that minimizes the total cost of moving all elements to that value. Finally, it prints the optimal central value `min_t` and the corresponding minimum cost `min_cost`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function handles the case where the median `mid` is considered initially, but it does not handle the case where the median itself is one of the elements in the list. This could potentially affect the cost calculation.
- The function assumes that the input values are within the specified range (1 to 100). If the input includes values outside this range, the function would still run but might produce incorrect results.
- The function does not check for duplicate values in the input list, which might affect the cost calculation if multiple elements have the same value as the median or the optimal central value.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
