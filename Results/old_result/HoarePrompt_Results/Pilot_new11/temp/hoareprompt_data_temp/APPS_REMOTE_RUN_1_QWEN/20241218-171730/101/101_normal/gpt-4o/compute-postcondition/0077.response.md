The code sets `left` to the value of `j`. Given the initial state, the value of `j` is updated to `j + 1`. Therefore, `left` will be assigned the new value of `j`, which is `j + 1`.

The states of the other variables (`screen`, `i`, `top`, `bottom`, and `right`) remain unchanged according to the precondition.

Output State: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is unchanged, `j` is updated to `j + 1`, `top` and `bottom` both remain unchanged and equal `i`, `right` is updated to `j + 1` if `j + 1 > right`, `left` is `j + 1`.**
