Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly converts the given numbers from their respective bases to decimal and compares them. The function `func_1` correctly computes the decimal value of a number given its digits and base. The main part of the program reads the inputs, calls `func_1` for both numbers, and compares their decimal values to output the correct symbol ('<', '>', or '='). Since the examples provided and the logic implemented handle all specified cases correctly, and there are no edge cases or constraints violated, the program is correct.
