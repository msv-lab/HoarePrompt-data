The code `c = costs + [max_cost] * (31 - len(costs))` concatenates the `costs` list with a list containing `max_cost` repeated `(31 - len(costs))` times. Since `costs` is a list of `n` integers and `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 30`, `31 - len(costs)` will always be 1, thus `[max_cost] * (31 - len(costs))` will be `[10]`.

Therefore, the new list `c` will contain all elements from `costs` followed by the single element `10`. The values of `n`, `L`, `max_cost`, and `dp` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, `L` is an integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9, `costs` is a list of n integers where each cost_i satisfies 1 ≤ cost_i ≤ 10^9, `max_cost` is 10, `dp` is a list of 31 integers where each element is 10, `c` is a list of n+1 integers where the first n integers are the same as in `costs` and the last integer is 10.**
