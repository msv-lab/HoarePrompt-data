Postcondition: ***`unrated` remains `False`, `rated` remains `False`, `maybe` remains `False`, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` remain unchanged as lists containing `n` input integers each, the current value of `i` is `n - 2`, and the condition `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[n-1] and ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[n-1]` remains false. If the condition `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j] and ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]` is true, the most internal loop or conditional block is broken. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
