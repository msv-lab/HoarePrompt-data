Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `remaining_after_houses` is greater than 0.
- `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`.
- If `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0`, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, no specific action is taken, and the postcondition remains as per the precondition.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for b in range(remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for each value of `b` from `0` to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`.
2. **Variable `b`**: This variable is incremented by 1 in each iteration.
3. **State Adjustments**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, let's assume `b` was some value `b_prev`.
   - For the next iteration, `b` will be `b_prev + 1`.

### New State:
- Since `b` starts from `0` and increments by `1` each iteration, the new value of `b` will be `b_prev + 1`.
- We need to update `remaining_after_cars` based on the new value of `b`.

Given that `remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`:
- After the previous iteration, if `b_prev` was the value of `b`, then:
  \[
  remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - b_prev \times car_cost
  \]
- For the next iteration, with `b = b_prev + 1`:
  \[
  remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - (b_prev + 1) \times car_cost
  \]

### Final State:
- `remaining_after_houses` remains unchanged.
- `remaining_after_cars` becomes `remaining_after_houses - (b_prev + 1) * car_cost`.

### Conclusion:
State: **`remaining_after_houses` is greater than 0, `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - (b_prev + 1) * car_cost`**.
