The code `last_vowel = i` assigns the value of `i` to `last_vowel`. This changes the value of `last_vowel` from its previous value to `i`. The other variables (`s`, `vowels`, `n`, and `max_jump`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of capital English letters 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y', with a length not exceeding 100; `vowels` is 'AEIOUY'; `n` must be greater than 0; `i` is such that `s[i]` is a vowel and `i` is the new `last_vowel`; `last_vowel` is equal to `i`; `max_jump` is the maximum of its current value and either `i + 1` or 1.**
