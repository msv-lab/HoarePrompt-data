The function accepts a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two positive integers representing the radius and height of a simple cake. It calculates the volume of each cake using the formula \( \pi r^2 h \), sorts the cakes in descending order based on their volume, and then uses dynamic programming to find the maximum volume that can be achieved by selecting a subset of cakes such that no cake in the subset has both dimensions (radius and height) less than those of any other cake in the subset. The function prints the maximum volume that can be achieved.
