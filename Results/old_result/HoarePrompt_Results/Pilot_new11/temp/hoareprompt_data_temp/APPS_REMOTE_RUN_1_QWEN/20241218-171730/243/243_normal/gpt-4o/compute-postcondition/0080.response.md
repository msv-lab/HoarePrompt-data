Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `mid` is the final value after incrementing by the number of iterations, ensuring that `func_1(mid)` equals `m`; `func_1(mid)` is equal to `m`; `left` is the final value after decrementing by the number of iterations, ensuring that `func_1(left)` equals `m`; `right` is `mid + k + 1` where `k` is the number of iterations and `func_1(right)` is equal to `m`.**
