According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `marks` list. The loop will execute if the `marks` list is not empty. Here are the initial states given:

- `n` is a non-negative integer
- `marks` is a list of integers (potentially empty)
- `marks_set` is a set of unique elements from `marks`
- `x_found` is `False`
- `y_found` is `False`
- `new_marks` is an empty set

For the loop to execute, the `marks` list must contain at least one element. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect this condition.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `marks` is a list of integers that must not be empty, `marks_set` is a set of unique elements from `marks`, `x_found` is `False`, `y_found` is `False`, `new_marks` is an empty set**
