The code sets the variable `max_cost` to the value `10 ** 18`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `L`, or the `costs` list. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `max_cost`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, `L` is an integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9, `costs` is a list of n integers where each cost_i satisfies 1 ≤ cost_i ≤ 10^9, `max_cost` is 10 ** 18**
