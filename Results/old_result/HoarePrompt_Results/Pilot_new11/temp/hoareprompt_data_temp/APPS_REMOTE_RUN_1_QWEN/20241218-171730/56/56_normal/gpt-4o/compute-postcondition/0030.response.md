Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), `bits` is the list of positions of the 1-bits in the binary representation of `n` with all the `smallest - 1` values added to it, `smallest` is reduced by the number of iterations the loop has executed, `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k > \text{len}(bits)\)**
