The code `row -= 2` decreases the value of `row` by 2. Since the initial value of `row` is equal to `n`, the new value of `row` will be `n - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1, `row` is `n - 2`, `col == x`, `direction` is -1, and `max_questions` is incremented by 1.**
