`operations` is incremented by 1, changing its value from its initial state. The value of `s` and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 1 is also still valid.

Output State: **`s` is a string entered by the user, `i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 1, and `operations` is increased by 1.**
