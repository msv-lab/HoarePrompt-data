The code initializes two variables `b` and `c` to 0. The values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `b` is 0, and `c` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `b` is 0, `c` is 0**
