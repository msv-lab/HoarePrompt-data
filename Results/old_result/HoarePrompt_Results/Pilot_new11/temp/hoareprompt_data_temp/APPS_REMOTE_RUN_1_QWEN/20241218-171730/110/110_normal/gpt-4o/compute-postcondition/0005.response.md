`heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))` adds a new tuple `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` to the heap. Since `y` is initially 1, the tuple added to the heap is `(-coverage(x, 1), x, 1)`. The value of `m` and the contents of the heap (other than the newly added tuple) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` must be at least 2; `heap` contains tuples including `(-coverage(x, 1), x, 1)`**
