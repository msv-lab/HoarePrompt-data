Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` (where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\)) and returns the sum of its digits. The function converts the integer `n` into a string to iterate over each digit, converts each digit back to an integer, and sums them up. This process handles all positive integers within the specified range, including the maximum value \(10^{18}\), which has 19 digits (1 followed by 18 zeros). There are no missing functionalities or edge cases mentioned in the provided code.**
