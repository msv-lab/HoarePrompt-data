The code `left = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `left`. This assignment does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except for the new value of `left`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' or 'S', `golden` is a list of integers containing the indices of all characters in `s` that are equal to 'G', `max_beauty` is 0, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is 0.**
