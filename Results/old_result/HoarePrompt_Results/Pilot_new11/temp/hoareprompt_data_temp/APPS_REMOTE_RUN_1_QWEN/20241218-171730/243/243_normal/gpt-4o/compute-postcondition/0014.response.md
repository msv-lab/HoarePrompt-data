To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition inside the `while` loop:

The loop condition is:
```
while func_1(left) == m:
```

Given the initial states:
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\)
- `low` is 0
- `high` is \(5 \times (m + 1)\)
- `mid` is \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2}\)
- `result` is an empty list
- `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)` and is less than or equal to `m`
- `left` is \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2}\)

The loop will continue as long as `func_1(left) == m`. For the loop to execute one more time, the function call `func_1(left)` must still return `m`.

Since `left` is set to \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2}\), the only state that needs to be checked and potentially adjusted is `left` itself. However, since `left` is derived from `m` and is not being modified within the loop, the value of `left` remains the same throughout the loop's execution unless explicitly changed.

Given the condition `func_1(left) == m`, the loop can only proceed if this condition holds true. Since `left` is defined and does not change, no adjustment is necessary in the states provided.

Therefore, the state right before the loop remains unchanged for the loop to proceed:

State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `low` is 0; `high` is \(5 \times (m + 1)\); `mid` is \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2}\); `result` is an empty list; `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)` and is less than or equal to `m`; `left` is \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2}\)**
