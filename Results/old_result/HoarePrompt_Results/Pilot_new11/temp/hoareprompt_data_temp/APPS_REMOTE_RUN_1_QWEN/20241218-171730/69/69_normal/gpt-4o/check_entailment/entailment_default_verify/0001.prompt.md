You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has got a robot which is situated on an infinite Cartesian plane, initially in the cell $(0, 0)$. Robot can perform the following four kinds of operations:   U — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x, y + 1)$;  D — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x, y - 1)$;  L — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x - 1, y)$;  R — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x + 1, y)$. 

Vasya also has got a sequence of $n$ operations. Vasya wants to modify this sequence so after performing it the robot will end up in $(x, y)$.

Vasya wants to change the sequence so the length of changed subsegment is minimum possible. This length can be calculated as follows: $maxID - minID + 1$, where $maxID$ is the maximum index of a changed operation, and $minID$ is the minimum index of a changed operation. For example, if Vasya changes RRRRRRR to RLRRLRL, then the operations with indices $2$, $5$ and $7$ are changed, so the length of changed subsegment is $7 - 2 + 1 = 6$. Another example: if Vasya changes DDDD to DDRD, then the length of changed subsegment is $1$. 

If there are no changes, then the length of changed subsegment is $0$. Changing an operation means replacing it with some operation (possibly the same); Vasya can't insert new operations into the sequence or remove them.

Help Vasya! Tell him the minimum length of subsegment that he needs to change so that the robot will go from $(0, 0)$ to $(x, y)$, or tell him that it's impossible.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer number $n~(1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5)$ — the number of operations.

The second line contains the sequence of operations — a string of $n$ characters. Each character is either U, D, L or R.

The third line contains two integers $x, y~(-10^9 \le x, y \le 10^9)$ — the coordinates of the cell where the robot should end its path.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the minimum possible length of subsegment that can be changed so the resulting sequence of operations moves the robot from $(0, 0)$ to $(x, y)$. If this change is impossible, print $-1$.


-----Examples-----
Input
5
RURUU
-2 3

Output
3

Input
4
RULR
1 1

Output
0

Input
3
UUU
100 100

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example the sequence can be changed to LULUU. So the length of the changed subsegment is $3 - 1 + 1 = 3$.

In the second example the given sequence already leads the robot to $(x, y)$, so the length of the changed subsegment is $0$.

In the third example the robot can't end his path in the cell $(x, y)$.
Program:
```
n = int(input())
operations = input().strip()
(x, y) = map(int, input().split())
result = func_1(n, operations, x, y)
print(result)

def func_1(n, operations, x, y):
    final_x = 0
    final_y = 0
    for op in operations:
        if op == 'U':
            final_y += 1
        elif op == 'D':
            final_y -= 1
        elif op == 'L':
            final_x -= 1
        elif op == 'R':
            final_x += 1
    dx = x - final_x
    dy = y - final_y
    if dx == 0 and dy == 0:
        return 0
    min_length = float('inf')
    current_x = 0
    current_y = 0
    position_map = {(0, 0): -1}
    for i in range(n):
        if operations[i] == 'U':
            current_y += 1
        elif operations[i] == 'D':
            current_y -= 1
        elif operations[i] == 'L':
            current_x -= 1
        elif operations[i] == 'R':
            current_x += 1
        target_pos = (current_x + dx, current_y + dy)
        if target_pos in position_map:
            min_length = min(min_length, i - position_map[target_pos])
        position_map[current_x, current_y] = i
    return min_length if min_length != float('inf') else -1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to consider the scenario where the initial position of the robot is not \((0, 0)\). In the example below, the robot starts at \((0, 0)\), but the operations provided do not result in the desired position without making any changes, leading to an incorrect output:

### Example Case:
**Input:**
```
5
RURUU
-2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Actual Output:**
```
0
```

### Reasoning:
- The program calculates the final position \((final_x, final_y)\) after executing the given operations.
- It then checks if the desired position \((x, y)\) can be reached by modifying the sequence.
- However, the program does not properly account for the possibility that the initial position might not be \((0, 0)\) after the given operations.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the initial position after the given operations is taken into account before determining the necessary changes. This involves checking if the current position matches the desired position and adjusting the logic accordingly.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `operations`, `x`, and `y`. 

- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R'.
- `x` and `y` are integers such that \(-10^9 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\).

The function processes the operations string to determine the final position `(final_x, final_y)` after performing all the specified movements ('R' for right, 'L' for left, 'U' for up, 'D' for down). It then calculates the required changes `dx` and `dy` to move from the final position to the initial position `(x, y)`.

Next, the function searches for the minimum index `i` in the operations string where the position after performing the operations up to index `i` matches the required position `(final_x + dx, final_y + dy)`. If such an index is found, it returns the minimum value of `i - position_map[target_pos]` for any target_pos found in `position_map`. If no such index is found, it returns -1.

The function returns 0 if the required position `(final_x + dx, final_y + dy)` is already the final position `(final_x, final_y)`, meaning no additional moves are needed.

Therefore, the function `func_1` determines whether a sequence of operations can bring the final position to the required position and, if possible, finds the minimum number of operations needed to achieve this, returning -1 if it's not possible.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
