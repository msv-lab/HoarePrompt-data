`j` is initially 2, so `2 ** j` is `2 ** 2`, which is 4. Subtracting 1 from 4 gives 3. Therefore, `vol` is updated to 3. The other variables (`dp[i]`, `costs[0]`, and `n`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`j` is 2, `vol` is 3, `dp[i]` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `dp[i - 1] + costs[0]`, and `n` is a positive integer**
