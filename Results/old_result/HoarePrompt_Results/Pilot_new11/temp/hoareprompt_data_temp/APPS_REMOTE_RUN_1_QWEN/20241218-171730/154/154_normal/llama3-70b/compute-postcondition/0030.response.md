The code updates the value of `dp[i][j]` to `dp[i][j - 1]`. Given the initial state where `i` is 1, `M` is greater than or equal to 1, and `dp[1][2]` is equal to `max(dp[1][1], 1)`, the code changes `dp[1][j]` to `dp[1][j - 1]`. Since `i` is 1 and `j` is initially 2, `dp[1][2]` is updated to `dp[1][1]`.

Given that `dp[1][2]` was previously `max(dp[1][1], 1)`, after updating, `dp[1][2]` becomes `dp[1][1]`. The value of `dp[1][1]` is not specified in the initial state, but it does not change during this operation. The other variables (`i` and `M`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `M` is greater than or equal to 1, and `dp[1][2]` is equal to `dp[1][1]`**
