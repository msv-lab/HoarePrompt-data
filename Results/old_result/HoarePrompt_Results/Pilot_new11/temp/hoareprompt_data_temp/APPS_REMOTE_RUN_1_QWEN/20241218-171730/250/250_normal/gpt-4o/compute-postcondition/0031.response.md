The code `print(0)` simply prints the integer 0 to the console. This does not change any of the existing variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `marks` is a list of integers (potentially empty), `marks_set` is a set of unique elements from `marks`, `x_found` is `True`, `y_found` is `True`, and the condition `(x_found and y_found)` is satisfied.**
