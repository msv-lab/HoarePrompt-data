Postcondition: ***`node` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary where `graph[node]` must contain at least one element, `visited[node]` is `True`, `rec_stack` is a list with `rec_stack[node] = True`. If the neighbor `neighbor` has not been visited (`visited[neighbor]` is `False`), the function `func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack)` returned `False`. If the neighbor `neighbor` has already been visited (`visited[neighbor]` is `True`), the condition `rec_stack[neighbor]` is `False`.***
