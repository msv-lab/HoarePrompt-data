        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: 'a' is the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the original values of 'a' and 'b', 'b' is 0
    return a
    #The program returns 'a' that is the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the original values of 'a' and 'b', where 'b' is 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both non-negative integers where `a` is greater than 0 and `b` is greater than or equal to 0. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b`. The function then returns the gcd of the original values of `a` and `b`, where `b` will be 0 after the algorithm has completed. 

The function correctly handles the case where `b` is initially 0, returning `a` as the gcd without entering the loop. Additionally, it correctly handles the general case where both `a` and `b` are positive, reducing the problem size in each iteration until `b` becomes 0.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6, `res` is the maximum value obtained by applying `func_1(res, i)` for every `i` in the range [1, `n` + 1].
    return res
    #The program returns the maximum value obtained by applying func_1(res, i) for every i in the range [1, n + 1]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) and iterates through the range [1, n + 1]. For each integer `i` in this range, it computes `func_1(res, i)` where `res` starts at 0 and is updated to be the maximum value between its current value and the result of `func_1(res, i)`. After completing the iteration, the function returns the maximum value obtained during these computations. This means that the final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns the highest value produced by applying `func_1(res, i)` for every `i` in the specified range. Potential edge cases include the minimum allowed value of `n` (2), as well as the maximum allowed value (10^6). If `n` is less than 2, the function should still start with `res = 0` and iterate from 1 up to the given `n`, ensuring that the computation is performed correctly even for the smallest valid input.

    return dp[f_max_n]
    #dp[f_max_n], which is the cumulative sum of dp[0] to dp[f_max_n] modulo 1000000007
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `n` (an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) and `f_max_n` (the maximum value of \(f(p)\) for permutations of length `n` as defined in the problem description). It initializes a list `dp` of size `f_max_n + 1` with all elements set to 0, except for `dp[0]` which is set to 1. The function then iterates over the range from 1 to `n`, updating each element `dp[j]` to be the cumulative sum of `dp[j - 1]` modulo `10^9 + 7`. After the loop, the function returns `dp[f_max_n]`, which is the cumulative sum of `dp[0]` to `dp[f_max_n]` modulo `10^9 + 7`.

The function performs the following actions:
- Initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[j]` represents a cumulative sum.
- Sets the base case `dp[0]` to 1.
- Iteratively updates the `dp` array such that each element `dp[j]` is the sum of `dp[j - 1]` modulo `10^9 + 7`.
- Returns the final value of `dp[f_max_n]` which is the cumulative sum of the `dp` array up to `f_max_n` modulo `10^9 + 7`.

Potential edge cases:
- If `n` is 2, the loop will only run once, and `dp[j]` will only update for `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`.
- If `f_max_n` is 0, the initial `dp[0]` value will not change, and `dp[f_max_n]` will remain 1.

There are no missing functionalities in the provided code, and all relevant actions are covered in the summary.
