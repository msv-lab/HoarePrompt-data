Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of why it fails:

1. **Area Calculation and Check**:
   - The program correctly calculates the area as \( \text{area} = \frac{n \times m}{k} \).
   - It checks if \( \text{area} \) is an integer by comparing \( \text{area} \) with \( \text{int(area)} \). If they are not equal, it prints 'NO'. This check is correct.

2. **Case When Area is Zero**:
   - If \( \text{area} = 0 \), the program prints 'NO'. This condition is handled correctly.

3. **Case When \( 2 \times \text{area} \leq n \)**:
   - The program prints '0 1' and '0 0' under this condition. However, this configuration of points does not form a valid triangle because the points are collinear (i.e., all points lie on the same vertical line).

4. **Case When \( 2 \times \text{area} > n \) and \( 2 \times \text{area} \leq m \)**:
   - The program prints '1 0' and '1 0' under this condition. Again, this configuration of points does not form a valid triangle because the points are collinear (i.e., all points lie on the same horizontal line).

5. **Case When \( 2 \times \text{area} > m \)**:
   - The program correctly prints '0 \(\frac{m}{2}\)' and '0 \(\frac{m}{2}\)'. However, this also forms a degenerate triangle (a line segment) and does not meet the requirement of forming a non-degenerate triangle with the specified area.

To form a valid non-degenerate triangle, the points should be placed such that the area is correctly calculated and the points are not collinear. For instance, the points could be arranged in a way that they form a right triangle with legs parallel to the coordinate axes. A more appropriate approach would be:

- Calculate the area correctly.
- Ensure that the points are placed such that they form a valid triangle.
- For example, if the area is \( A \), place the points at \((0, 0)\), \((A, 0)\), and \((0, A)\).

The current implementation fails to ensure that the points form a valid non-degenerate triangle and hence does not meet the problem description.
