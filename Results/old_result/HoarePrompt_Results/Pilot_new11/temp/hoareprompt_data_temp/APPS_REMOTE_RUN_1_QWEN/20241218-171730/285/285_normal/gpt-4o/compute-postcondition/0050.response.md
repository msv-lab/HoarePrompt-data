Let's analyze the given loop step by step to determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State:
- `remaining_after_houses` > 0
- `remaining_after_cars` = `remaining_after_houses - (a + 1) * car_cost`
- `a` = `a + 1`

### Loop Code:
```python
for b in range(remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1):
    remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost
    if remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0:
        return 'YES'
```

### Analysis:
1. **First Iteration**:
   - `b = 0`: `remaining_after_cars` = `remaining_after_houses - 0 * car_cost` = `remaining_after_houses`
   - No return statement is executed.

2. **Second Iteration**:
   - `b = 1`: `remaining_after_cars` = `remaining_after_houses - 1 * car_cost`
   - No return statement is executed unless `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0`.

3. **General Iteration**:
   - For each iteration, `b` increments by 1.
   - `remaining_after_cars` = `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`
   - The loop checks if `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0`. If true, it returns 'YES'.

4. **Loop Termination**:
   - The loop terminates when `b` reaches `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1`.
   - At this point, `remaining_after_cars` = `remaining_after_houses - (remaining_after_houses // car_cost) * car_cost`.

### Final Output State:
- **If the loop returns 'YES'**:
  - This means there exists an integer `b` such that `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0`.
  - Therefore, `a` = `original_a + (number_of_iterations)` where `number_of_iterations` is the number of times the loop executed.
  - `remaining_after_cars` = `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost` where `b` satisfies `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0`.

- **If the loop does not return 'YES'**:
  - The loop completes all iterations without finding a valid `b`.
  - `a` = `original_a + (number_of_iterations)`
  - `remaining_after_cars` = `remaining_after_houses - (remaining_after_houses // car_cost) * car_cost`
  - The function does not return anything, so the final state is the same as the last iteration of the loop.

### Output State:
- **Final Output State**: **`a` is `original_a + (number_of_iterations)`, `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - (remaining_after_houses // car_cost) * car_cost`. If the loop returned 'YES', then `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0`. If not, `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost != 0`.**

This ensures we capture both the conditions under which the loop would return 'YES' and the state of the variables in either scenario.
