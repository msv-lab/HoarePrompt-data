#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9. The function `func_1` computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b using the Euclidean algorithm.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`, `b` is 0
    return a
    #The program returns `a`, which is the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`, and `b` is 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two positive integer parameters `a` and `b`, where both are within the range 1 to \(10^9\). It computes their greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm. After the computation, the function returns the GCD as the new value of `a` and 0 as the new value of `b`. 

This process handles the following scenarios:
- If either `a` or `b` is zero initially, the function correctly computes the GCD based on the non-zero value.
- If `a` and `b` are equal, the function correctly returns `a` (or `b`) as the GCD.
- The function correctly handles the case where one of the inputs is a multiple of the other.
- The function iteratively reduces the problem size until `b` becomes zero, at which point `a` holds the GCD of the original inputs.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that \(1 \le a, b \le 10^9\).
def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b // func_1(a, b)
    #The program returns the integer division of the product of a and b by the result of func_1(a, b)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` (where \(1 \le a, b \le 10^9\)) and returns the integer division of the product of `a` and `b` by the result of `func_1(a, b)`. This means the function computes `(a * b) // func_1(a, b)` and ensures that the result is an integer. If `func_1(a, b)` returns zero, the function will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the annotations or the code itself that need to be handled separately, but the function assumes that `func_1(a, b)` will always return a non-negative value. If `func_1(a, b)` returns a negative value, the behavior of the integer division operation is defined by Python, which will treat the negative value as a non-zero divisor.
