Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `marks` is a non-empty list of integers, `marks_set` is a set of unique elements from `marks`, `x_found` is `False`, `y_found` is `False`, and `new_marks` is a set containing the updated results based on the next `mark` in `marks`. If `mark - x + y` is in `marks_set` or `mark - x - y` is in `marks_set`, `new_marks` includes `mark - x`. Otherwise, `new_marks` remains unchanged.***
