The value of `index` is incremented by 3. Initially, `index` is 2, so after the increment, `index` becomes 5. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`K` is the integer obtained from `data[1]`, `meats` is a list containing one element which is the tuple (`x`, `y`, `c`), `data` is a list of strings resulting from the split input, `N` must be greater than 0, `index` is 5, `x` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `y` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[4]`**
