Postcondition: ***`sofas` must have at least one tuple, `left` is 1, `right` is 0, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, and the current value of `s` is not equal to `sofa`. Additionally, the first tuple in `sofas` has its first element less than the first element of `s` and its second element equal to the second element of `s`. If the condition `sofa[0][0] < s[0][0] and sofa[0][1] == s[0][1]` is true, then `left` is set to 1. Otherwise, the values of `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom` remain unchanged.***
