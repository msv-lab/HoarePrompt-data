Final: **False**

Reason: Although the program correctly calculates the difference between the sum of positive integers and the sum of negative integers, it does not handle the case when \( n \) is outside the range 1 to 100. According to the problem description, \( n \) should be within this range, but the program does not perform any validation for this condition. Additionally, the program does not handle non-integer inputs for the list elements, which would lead to a `ValueError`. Since the original assessment did not consider these potential issues, the final assessment must account for them. Therefore, the program is not fully correct based on the provided problem description and constraints.
