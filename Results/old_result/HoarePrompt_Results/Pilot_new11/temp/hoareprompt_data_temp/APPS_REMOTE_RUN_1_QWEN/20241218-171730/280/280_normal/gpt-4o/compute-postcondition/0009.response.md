Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `v1` is an integer within the range [1, 100]
- `v2` is an integer within the range [1, 100]
- `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100
- `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10
- `speeds[0]` is `v1`
- `speeds[1]` is `min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 2) * d)`
- `speeds[2]` is `min(min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 2) * d) + d, v2 + (t - 3) * d)`
- `speeds[t-1]` is `v2`
- The rest of the elements in `speeds` are zeros
- `i` is 2

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, t):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = t-1`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2. This means the loop has already executed for `i = 1` and is currently on `i = 2`.

### Next Iteration:
For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to `3`.

#### Adjusted States:
- `v1` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
- `v2` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
- `t` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
- `d` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
- `speeds[0]` remains `v1`.
- `speeds[1]` remains `min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 2) * d)`.
- `speeds[2]` remains `min(min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 2) * d) + d, v2 + (t - 3) * d)`.
- `speeds[3]` will be calculated based on the loop body.
- The rest of the elements in `speeds` remain zeros.
- `i` will be incremented to `3`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`v1` is an integer within the range [1, 100], `v2` is an integer within the range [1, 100], `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100, `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10, `speeds[0]` is `v1`, `speeds[1]` is `min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 2) * d)`, `speeds[2]` is `min(min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 2) * d) + d, v2 + (t - 3) * d)`, `speeds[3]` is yet to be calculated, `speeds[4]` to `speeds[t-1]` are zeros, and `i` is 3**
