Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program adheres to the requirements:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the input as a single string using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into parts.
   - It correctly extracts `n`, `k`, `M`, and the list of times `t` from the input.
   - The input constraints are respected (i.e., `1 ≤ n ≤ 45`, `1 ≤ k ≤ 45`, `0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9`, and `1 ≤ t_j ≤ 1000000`).

2. **Function Logic:**
   - The function `func_1` iterates over the possible number of complete tasks (`complete_tasks`) from `0` to `n`.
   - For each possible number of complete tasks, it calculates the total time used and checks if it exceeds `M`. If it does, the loop breaks.
   - It calculates the base points from completing the tasks (`points = complete_tasks * (k + 1)`).
   - For the remaining time, it calculates how many additional subtasks can be completed.
   - It ensures that the number of subtasks solved does not exceed the possible number of subtasks remaining (`(n - complete_tasks) * k`).
   - It updates the maximum points found so far (`max_points`).

3. **Output:**
   - The function returns the maximum points achievable, which is the output specified by the problem statement.

### Summary:
The program correctly implements the logic for calculating the maximum number of points Polycarp can earn within the given time constraint `M`. It considers all possible scenarios of completing tasks and solving subtasks, ensuring that it respects the constraints and produces the correct output. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
