The code `print(-1)` simply prints `-1` to the console. It does not change any of the existing variables or their values. Therefore, the only change is that the value `-1` is printed.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `s` is the second integer input, `v` is a sorted list of integers created from the third input, `low` is 0, `high` is the smallest value such that the sum of the minimum between `mid` and each element `x` in the list `v` is at least `s`, `mid` is the last calculated mid value, and `total` is the sum of the minimum between `mid` and each element `x` in the list `v`. The sum of the minimum between `low` and each element `x` in the list `v` is not equal to `s`. -1 is printed to the console.**
