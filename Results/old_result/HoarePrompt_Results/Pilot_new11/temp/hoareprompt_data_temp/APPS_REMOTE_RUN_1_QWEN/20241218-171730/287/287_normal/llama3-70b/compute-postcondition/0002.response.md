According to the given code, the loop will execute if the condition inside the `range` function evaluates to a non-empty sequence. Specifically, the loop will execute if `1 <= int(n ** 0.5) + 1`.

Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if `int(n ** 0.5) + 1` is greater than 0.
2. **Understanding `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`**:
   - `n ** 0.5` calculates the square root of `n`.
   - `int(n ** 0.5)` converts the square root to an integer (rounding down).
   - Adding 1 to this integer value means the smallest possible value for `int(n ** 0.5) + 1` is 1 (when `n` is 1).

Given that `n` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\), the expression `int(n ** 0.5) + 1` will always be at least 2 because the smallest integer greater than or equal to `int(n ** 0.5)` when `n` is 1 is 1, and adding 1 makes it 2.

Therefore, the loop will always execute as long as `n` is within the specified range.

However, we should still ensure that `n` is within the specified range and that `res` is correctly initialized.

State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 1 <= n <= 10^9, `res` is 0**
