The code appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `operations`. Given the initial values, `i` is 2 and `j` is 4, so `i + 1` is 3 and `j + 1` is 5. Therefore, the tuple `(3, 5)` is appended to `operations`.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `i`, and `j`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `operations` is `[ (3, 5) ]`**
