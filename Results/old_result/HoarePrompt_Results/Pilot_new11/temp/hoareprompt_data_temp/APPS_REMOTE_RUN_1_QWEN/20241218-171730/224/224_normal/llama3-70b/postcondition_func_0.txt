The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both non-negative integers where `a` is greater than 0 and `b` is greater than or equal to 0. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b`. The function then returns the gcd of the original values of `a` and `b`, where `b` will be 0 after the algorithm has completed. 

The function correctly handles the case where `b` is initially 0, returning `a` as the gcd without entering the loop. Additionally, it correctly handles the general case where both `a` and `b` are positive, reducing the problem size in each iteration until `b` becomes 0.
