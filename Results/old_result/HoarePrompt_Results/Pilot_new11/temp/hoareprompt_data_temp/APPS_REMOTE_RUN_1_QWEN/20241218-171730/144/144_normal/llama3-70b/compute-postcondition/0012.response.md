To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Understand the Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know that `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order with at least one element. The variable `num` is currently the value being processed from the list `arr`.

2. **Determine the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left to process in the list `arr`. Therefore, the loop will execute again if `num` is still within the bounds of the list `arr`.

3. **Identify the Next Value of `num`**: Since the loop processes each element in the list `arr` sequentially, the next value of `num` will be the next element in the list.

4. **Adjust the States**: The key states to adjust are `arr` (which remains the same) and `num` (which moves to the next element in the list).

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `arr` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order with at least one element.
- `num` is the next element in the list `arr`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`arr` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order with at least one element, `num` is the next element in the list `arr`**
