The code snippet `dp[j] %= MOD` modifies the value of `dp[j]` to be the remainder when `dp[j]` is divided by `MOD`. Since `dp[j]` for all `j` from 1 to `f_max_n - 1` was initially set to `2 * dp[j - 1] % MOD`, the value of `dp[j]` is already within the range of 0 to `MOD-1`. Therefore, the modulo operation does not change these values.

The variable `i` is not affected by this line of code. The initial state of `dp[0]` remains unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`dp[0]` retains its original value, `dp[j]` for all `j` from 1 to `f_max_n - 1` is `2 * dp[j - 1] % MOD`, `f_max_n` must be greater than 1, `i` is `k + 1`**.
