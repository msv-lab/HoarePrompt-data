Functionality: **The function takes an integer \( n \) as input, where \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^9 \). It attempts to find non-negative integers \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) such that \( a \cdot 1234567 + b \cdot 123456 + c \cdot 1234 = n \). If such integers exist, it prints 'YES' and exits. If no such integers exist, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. Potential edge cases include when \( n \) is exactly \( 1234567 \), \( 123456 \), or \( 1234 \), as these might affect the range of the loops. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where \( n \) is less than \( 1234567 \); in such cases, the loops will not execute, and the function will print 'NO'.**
