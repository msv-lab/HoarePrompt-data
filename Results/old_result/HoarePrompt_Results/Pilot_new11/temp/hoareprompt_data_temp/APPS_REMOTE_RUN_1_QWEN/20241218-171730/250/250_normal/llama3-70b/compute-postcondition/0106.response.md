The code `print(' '.join(map(str, additional_marks)))` prints the elements of `additional_marks` separated by spaces. This does not change the value of `additional_marks` or any other variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `j`, `need_x`, `need_y`, and `additional_marks` remain unchanged. The output of the print statement is simply the elements of `additional_marks` joined with a space.

Output State: **`additional_marks` is a set of all elements that can be formed by adding an element from the `marks` list to each element in the original `additional_marks` list such that the sum is less than or equal to `l` and is not already present in `marks`, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `n-1`, `need_x` remains as the previous value indicating whether there exists a pair `(i, j)` such that `marks[j] - marks[i] == x`, `need_y` remains as the previous value indicating whether there exists any pair `(i, j)` such that `marks[j] - marks[i] == y`, `additional_marks` is a list containing `x` and `y`, and the output of the print statement is the length of `additional_marks`.**
