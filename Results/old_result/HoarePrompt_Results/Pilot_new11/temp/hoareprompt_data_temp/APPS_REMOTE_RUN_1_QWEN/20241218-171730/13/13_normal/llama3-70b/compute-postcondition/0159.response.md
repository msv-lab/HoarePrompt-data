Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer less than `n-1`, `j` is either `i + 2` or the position just after the last consecutive 'G' in the string starting from index `i + 1` (if the condition `s[i] == 'G' and s[i + 1] == 'S'` is true), `beauty` is the count of consecutive 'G's from `i - 1` to the first non-'G' character in the range from `i + 1` to `j`, `left` is the index of the last 'G' in the string `s`, or `n` if there are no 'G's, `right` is `n`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is 0, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum value among all `beauty` calculated during the loop iterations when `beauty` > 0, and `golden` is a list of indices of all characters in `s` that are equal to 'G'.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates through the string `s` and checks if a character is 'G' followed by 'S'.
- When the condition `s[i] == 'G' and s[i + 1] == 'S'` is true, it calculates the `beauty` by counting consecutive 'G's from `i - 1` to the first non-'G' character.
- The `max_beauty_one_swap` is updated to the maximum value of its original value and the current `beauty`.
- After the loop completes, `i` will be a non-negative integer less than `n-1` because the loop runs until `i < n-1`.
- `j` will be either `i + 2` or the position just after the last consecutive 'G' in the string starting from index `i + 1`.
- `beauty` will be the count of consecutive 'G's from `i - 1` to the first non-'G' character in the range from `i + 1` to `j`.
- `left` and `right` remain unchanged and are the index of the last 'G' in the string `s`, or `n` if there are no 'G's, and `n`, respectively.
- `max_beauty` remains unchanged as `curr_beauty` is always 0.
- `max_beauty_one_swap` will hold the maximum value of `beauty` calculated during the loop iterations when `beauty` > 0.
- `golden` will remain a list of indices of all characters in `s` that are equal to 'G'.
