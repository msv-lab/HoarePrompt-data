Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions**: 
   - `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\).
   - `low` and `high` are set such that `low <= high`.
   - `left` is `mid - k`, where `k` is the number of iterations the loop has executed.
   - `right` is `mid + 2`.
   - `func_1(right)` must be equal to `m`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop continues as long as `func_1(right) == m`.

3. **Objective**:
   - To determine what adjustments are needed in the program state for the loop to execute one more time.

### Analysis:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `func_1(right)` must still be equal to `m`.
- Since `right` is defined as `mid + 2`, we need to ensure that the function `func_1(mid + 2)` returns `m`.

### States to Adjust:
- The value of `right` should be such that `func_1(right)` remains equal to `m`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `right` is set correctly.
- We don't need to adjust `m`, `low`, `high`, or `left` because these are not directly involved in the loop condition.

### Modified Program State:
- `right` must be set to `mid + 2` such that `func_1(mid + 2)` equals `m`.

### Final State:
State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `low` and `high` are set such that `low <= high`; `left` is `mid - k` where `k` is the number of iterations the loop executed; `right` is `mid + 2` and must be such that `func_1(right)` equals `m`.**

This ensures that the loop can continue to the next iteration as required.
