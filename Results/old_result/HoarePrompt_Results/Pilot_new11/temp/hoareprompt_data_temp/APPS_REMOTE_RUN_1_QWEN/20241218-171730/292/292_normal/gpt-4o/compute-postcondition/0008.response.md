`b` is initially twice its original value and within the range of 2 to 20. The code `b *= 2` multiplies `b` by 2. Since `b` was originally between 2 and 20, after multiplying by 2, `b` will now be between 4 and 40. However, since `b` must remain within the range of 2 to 20, `b` will now be within the range of 4 to 20.

The value of `a` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it.

Output State: **`a` is 9 or 18; `b` is a value between 4 and 20**
