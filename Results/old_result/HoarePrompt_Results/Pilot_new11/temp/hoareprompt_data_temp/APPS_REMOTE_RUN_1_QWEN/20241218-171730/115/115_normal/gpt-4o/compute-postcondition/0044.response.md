The code appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `operations`. Given the initial state, we know the following:

- `i` is `n - 2`
- `j` is `n - 1`

Therefore, the tuple appended to `operations` will be `(n - 1, n)`. The variables `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2; `i` is `n - 2`; `j` is `n - 1`; `B[i][j]` is 1; `B[i][j + 1]` is 1; `B[i + 1][j]` is 1; `B[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1; `operations` contains the element `(n - 1, n)`**
