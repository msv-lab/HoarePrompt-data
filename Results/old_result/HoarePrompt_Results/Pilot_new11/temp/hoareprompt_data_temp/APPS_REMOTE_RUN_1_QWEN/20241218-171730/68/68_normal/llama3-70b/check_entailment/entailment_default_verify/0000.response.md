Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided output hints, the program correctly handles all the specified cases:

1. **Case where \(x > y + z\):** The program prints '+', which is correct since there will always be more upvotes than downvotes.
2. **Case where \(x < y\):** The program prints '-', which is correct since there will always be more downvotes than upvotes.
3. **Case where \(x = y\):** The program checks if \(z = 0\). If \(z = 0\), it prints '0', which is correct since the number of upvotes and downvotes will be equal. If \(z > 0\), it prints '?', which is correct because the outcome depends on how the unknown votes are distributed.
4. **Case where \(x = y\) and \(z > 0\):** The program correctly identifies this as an uncertain case and prints '?'.
5. **Edge cases:** The program handles edge cases such as when \(x = 0\), \(y = 0\), and \(z > 0\), printing '?' because the outcome depends on how the unknown votes are distributed. Similarly, when \(x > 0\), \(y = 0\), and \(z > 0\), the program correctly prints '+' because the additional unknown votes cannot change the fact that there are more upvotes. When \(x = 0\), \(y > 0\), and \(z > 0\), the program correctly prints '-' because the additional unknown votes cannot change the fact that there are more downvotes.

Given that the program accurately implements the logic as described in the problem statement and the output hints, the original assessment is accurate. Therefore, the final assessment is **True**.
