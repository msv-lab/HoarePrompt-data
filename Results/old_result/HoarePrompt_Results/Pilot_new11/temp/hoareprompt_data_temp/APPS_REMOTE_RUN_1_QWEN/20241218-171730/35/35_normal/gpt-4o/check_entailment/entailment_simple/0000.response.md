Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads three integers \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \) from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. This ensures that the input is properly parsed and validated within the constraints specified (i.e., \( 1 \leq a, b \leq 100 \) and \( 2 \leq n \leq a + b \)).

2. **Binary Search Implementation:**
   - The `func_1` function uses binary search to find the maximum possible number \( x \) such that each plate contains at least \( x \) pieces of cake. 
   - The search range is initialized from 1 to \( \min(a, b) + 1 \). 
   - For each midpoint \( \text{mid} \) in the search range, the program checks if a distribution is possible with at least \( \text{mid} \) pieces per plate using the `can_distribute` function.
   - The binary search correctly narrows down the range until the optimal value \( x \) is found.

3. **Distribution Check Function:**
   - The `can_distribute` function checks if it is possible to distribute the pieces of the cakes among the plates such that each plate has at least \( x \) pieces. 
   - It calculates the total number of plates needed by summing up the ceiling values of the division of \( a \) and \( b \) by \( x \). If this total is greater than or equal to \( n \), the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result returned by `func_1`, which is the maximum value \( x \) that satisfies the conditions.

### Summary:
- The program correctly handles the input constraints and performs a binary search to find the optimal number of pieces per plate.
- The `can_distribute` function accurately checks if a valid distribution is possible.
- The overall logic aligns perfectly with the problem statement, ensuring that the output is the maximum number \( x \) such that each plate contains at least \( x \) pieces of cake.

Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
