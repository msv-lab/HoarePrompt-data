To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the variables and conditions involved in the given `for` loop statement. The loop iterates over the range defined by `m`, where `m` must be greater than or equal to 1.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variable `m`:**
   - The loop will iterate as long as `m` is greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, `m` must be at least 1.

2. **Variable `j`:**
   - In the first iteration, `j` will be 0 (since the loop starts from 0 and goes up to `m-1`).
   - For subsequent iterations, `j` will increment and must remain within the range `[0, m-1]`.

3. **List `white_pixels`:**
   - The presence of `white_pixels` is already stated to contain at least one tuple, so no adjustment is needed here regarding its existence. However, since the loop iterates `m` times, we should ensure that `white_pixels` is not empty after the loop runs. But initially, we only need to know it contains at least one tuple.

4. **Pixels Array `pixels`:**
   - The initial state of the pixels is described in terms of how they change based on certain conditions. This does not affect the loop's ability to execute directly but influences what happens inside the loop.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute, the primary requirement is that `m` must be at least 1. The value of `j` will naturally satisfy this condition during each iteration as long as `m` is valid.

### Final State Adjustment:
State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `white_pixels` must contain at least one tuple, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 0 at the start of the first iteration**
