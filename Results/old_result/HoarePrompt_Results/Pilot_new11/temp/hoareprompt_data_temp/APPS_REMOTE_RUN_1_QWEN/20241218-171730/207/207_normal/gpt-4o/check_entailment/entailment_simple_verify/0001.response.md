Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the annotated version of the code, the function `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The function attempts to simplify the problem by dividing `a` and `b` by their GCD, but it does not correctly calculate the number of distinct integers the frog can reach within the interval `[0, m]`. 

For instance, in the provided examples, the annotated code does not accurately compute the function `f(i)` for each `i` from 0 to `m`. As illustrated in the first example with `m = 7`, `a = 5`, and `b = 3`, the expected result is 19, but the program outputs 10. This discrepancy indicates that the logic in `func_2` is flawed and does not meet the problem requirements.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is not correct based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code.
