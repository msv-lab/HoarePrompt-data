The code initializes four variables `ux`, `uy`, `lx`, and `ly` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `ops`, `x`, or `y`. Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5`, `ops` is a string consisting of 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R' characters, `x` is an integer input, `y` is an integer input, `ux` is 0, `uy` is 0, `lx` is 0, and `ly` is 0.**
