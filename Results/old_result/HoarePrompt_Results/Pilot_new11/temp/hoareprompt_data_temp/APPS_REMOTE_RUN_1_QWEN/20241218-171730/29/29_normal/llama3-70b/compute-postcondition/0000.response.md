`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which means `n` is now an integer input by the user within the range of 1 to \(10^5\). The filenames and their types, which were previously described by `n` lines, remain unchanged as the code snippet does not affect them.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ \(10^5\)**
