The code assigns the string `'.'` to the element in the `pixels` list at index `i` and column `j`. Given the initial conditions:

- `n` is greater than 1
- `white_pixels` contains at least one tuple
- `m` is greater than or equal to 1
- `i` is less than `n`
- `j` is 1

The only variable directly modified by the code is `pixels[i][j]`, which is now set to `'.'`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1; `white_pixels` contains at least one tuple; `m` is greater than or equal to 1; `i` is less than `n`; `j` is 1; `pixels[i][j]` is `'.'`**
