`min_t` is assigned the value of `i`. Given that `i` is `mid - 3`, `min_t` will also be `mid - 3`. The other variables (`min_cost`, `cost`, `sticks`) remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`i` is `mid - 3`, `min_cost` is the value of `cost`, `cost` is the sum of `min(abs(x - (mid - 3)), abs(x - (mid - 2)))` for each `x` in `sticks`, `min_t` is `mid - 3`**
