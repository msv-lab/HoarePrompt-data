Functionality: **The function `func` accepts four parameters: `n`, `k`, `M`, and a list `t` of `k` integers. It first reads these inputs from standard input. Then, it sorts the list `t`. The function uses dynamic programming to fill a 2D list `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum number of elements from the first `i` elements of `t` that can be selected such that their sum does not exceed `j`.

After populating the `dp` table, the function calculates and returns the sum of the last row of the `dp` table (`dp[k][M]`) plus the count of indices `i` where `dp[i][M]` equals `i`. This sum effectively gives the total number of elements that can be selected from the list `t` without exceeding the limit `M`, along with a count of those selections that fully utilize the limit `M`.

Potential edge cases include:
- If the input values for `n`, `k`, or `M` do not meet the specified constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 45, 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, and 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9), the function will raise an error since it relies on these constraints to properly initialize and use the `dp` table. However, the provided annotations do not explicitly handle this case, so the function should be modified to handle invalid inputs appropriately.

The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it prints and returns a single integer value representing the sum of the last row of the `dp` table plus the count of indices where `dp[i][M]` equals `i`. This value indicates the maximum number of elements that can be selected from `t` such that their sum does not exceed `M`, with a special consideration for selections that exactly reach the limit `M`.**
