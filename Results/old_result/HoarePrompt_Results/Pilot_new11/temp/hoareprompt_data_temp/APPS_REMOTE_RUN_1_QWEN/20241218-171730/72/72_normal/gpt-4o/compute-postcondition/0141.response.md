`max_questions` is assigned the value of `max_questions + 1`. The value of `max_questions` is increased by 1, but the values of `col`, `m`, and `sergei_questions` remain unchanged. The condition for `sergei_questions` increasing by 1 is not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`col` is 1 and `m` is greater than 0; `sergei_questions` is increased by 1 if `row == x` and `col == y`; `max_questions` is increased by 1**
