The initial state is such that `n` is an input integer within the range 1 <= n <= 10^9, and `res` is 2. The condition for `res` is that it remains 2 if `n` has no divisors other than 1 and itself. Additionally, the current value of `i * i` equals `n`.

The code snippet is `res -= 1`. This operation subtracts 1 from the value of `res`.

Given that `res` is initially 2, after executing `res -= 1`, `res` becomes 1.

The condition for `res` remains unchanged unless `n` has a divisor other than 1 and itself, which is not mentioned to occur in this case.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `res` is now 1.
- `n` remains an input integer within the range 1 <= n <= 10^9.
- The condition for `res` remains as described, but since no new divisor was found, `res` is simply decremented.

Output State: **`res` is 1, `n` is an input integer within the range 1 <= n <= 10^9.**
