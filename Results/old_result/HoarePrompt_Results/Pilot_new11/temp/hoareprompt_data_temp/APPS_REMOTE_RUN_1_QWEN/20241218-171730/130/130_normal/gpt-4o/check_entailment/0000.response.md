Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the minimum number of coins one friend can gift to satisfy all the conditions. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program works:

1. **Condition Calculation**: The program calculates `min_x` as the minimum number of coins each friend needs to gift, ensuring that the total number of unique coins gifted is at least `L` more than the number of coins already in Ivan's collection (`K`). This is done using the formula `(L + M - 1) // M`, which ensures that each friend gives at least `min_x` coins.

2. **Feasibility Check**: The program checks if `M * min_x` is less than or equal to `N - K`. If this condition is true, it means the total number of unique coins gifted can indeed be `N - K` or more, satisfying the requirement that at least `L` of these coins are new. In this case, the program prints `min_x`.

3. **Impossibility Handling**: If `M * min_x` is greater than `N - K`, it means it is impossible to meet the requirement of having at least `L` new coins, and the program correctly prints `-1`.

Given the constraints and the logic used, the program handles all edge cases and satisfies the problem requirements. There are no obvious counterexamples where the program fails to meet the conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.
