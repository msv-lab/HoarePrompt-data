Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. According to the problem description, the task is to find the minimum number of seconds required to transform an equilateral triangle of side length `x` into an equilateral triangle of side length `y` by modifying one side at a time while ensuring the triangle remains non-degenerate (i.e., all sides remain positive and the triangle inequality holds).

However, the given program simply calculates and prints the absolute difference between `x` and `y`:

```python
def func():
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    print(abs(x - y))
```

This program does not consider the constraints of maintaining a valid triangle (the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side). Therefore, it fails to correctly solve the problem as described.

For example, if the input is `6 3`, the program would output `3`, but the correct answer should be `4` as shown in the annotated problem description.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to iteratively reduce `x` to `y` while ensuring that at each step, the triangle inequality holds, and count the number of steps required to achieve this.
