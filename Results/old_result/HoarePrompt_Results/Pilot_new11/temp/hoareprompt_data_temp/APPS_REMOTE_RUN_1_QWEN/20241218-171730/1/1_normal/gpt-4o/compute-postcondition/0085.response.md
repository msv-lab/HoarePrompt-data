Functionality: **The function processes a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters `[`, `]`, `:`, and `|`. It aims to find the first occurrence of `[` and the last occurrence of `]` within the string. Then, it searches for the first and last occurrences of `:` within the substring between these two brackets. If any of these characters do not exist in the specified order or positions, the function prints `-1`. Otherwise, it counts the number of `|` characters between the first and last `:` found within the bracketed substring and adds 4 to this count, then prints the result.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- If there are no `[` or `]` in the string, the function correctly prints `-1`.
- If there are no `:` within the substring between the first `[` and the last `]`, the function also correctly prints `-1`.
- If the substring between `[` and `]` contains multiple `:` but only the first and last are considered, the function behaves as intended.
- The function does not handle cases where the string starts or ends with `:` or `|` outside the brackets, which might be a missing edge case depending on the expected input format.
