According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 2
- `n` must be greater than 2
- `ans` is 2 because `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i - 1]`

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `i = 3`. Additionally, `n` must still be greater than 3 (since `i` was previously 2 and now is 3).

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `i` becomes 3
- `n` must still be greater than 3

The state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:
State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, and `ans` is 2 because `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i - 1]`**
