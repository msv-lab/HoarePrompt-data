`is_unrated` is set to `True`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer and must be greater than 1, `ratings` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers `(a_i, b_i)` with `1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 4126`, `is_rated` is False, `is_unrated` is True, `ratings[n-1][0] < ratings[n][0]` must hold true.
