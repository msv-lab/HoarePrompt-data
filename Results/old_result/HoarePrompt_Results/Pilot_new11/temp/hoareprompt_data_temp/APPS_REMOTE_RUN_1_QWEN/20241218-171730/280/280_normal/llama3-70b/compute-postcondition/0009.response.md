The code `max_length += max_speed` increments the value of `max_length` by `max_speed`. 

From the initial state:
- `v1` is an integer input
- `v2` is an integer input
- `t` must be greater than or equal to 2
- `d` is an integer such that \(0 \leq d \leq 10\)
- `max_speed` is `max(v2 - d, v1)`
- `min_speed` is `min(v1 + d, v2 - d)`
- `min_length` is `min_speed * t`

After the code executes, `max_length` is updated to `max_length + max_speed`.

The values of the other variables (`v1`, `v2`, `t`, `d`, `max_speed`, `min_speed`, `min_length`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`v1` is an integer input, `v2` is an integer input, `t` must be greater than or equal to 2, `d` is an integer such that \(0 \leq d \leq 10\), `max_speed` is `max(v2 - d, v1)`, `min_speed` is `min(v1 + d, v2 - d)`, `min_length` is `min_speed * t`, `max_length` is `max_length + max_speed`**
