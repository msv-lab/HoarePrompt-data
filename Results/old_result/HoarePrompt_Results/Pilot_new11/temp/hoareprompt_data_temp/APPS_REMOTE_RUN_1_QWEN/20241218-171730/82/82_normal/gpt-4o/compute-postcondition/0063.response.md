`min_lcm` is updated to the value of `current_lcm`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is the same, `b` is the same, `diff` is the same, `min_lcm` is the same as `current_lcm`, `min_k` is the same, `k` is 2, `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.

Output State: **`a` is the same, `b` is the same, `diff` is the same, `min_lcm` is the same as `current_lcm`, `min_k` is the same, `k` is 2, `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`**
