To understand the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's break down the given conditions and constraints:

1. The loop iterates over `j` from `1` to `M + 1`.
2. The update rule for `dp[i][j]` is based on the value of `j` relative to `t[i - 1]`.

Let's assume we are at the end of the previous iteration where `j` was some value, say `j = k`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `j < M + 1`.
   - Therefore, the loop will continue until `j` reaches `M + 1`.

2. **Update Rule for `dp[i][j]`:**
   - If `j < t[i - 1]`, then `dp[i][j]` is set to `dp[i][j - 1]`.
   - If `j >= t[i - 1]`, then `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i][j - 1]` and `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`.

3. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - We know that the previous `j` value was such that the loop just completed an iteration.
   - Let's denote this previous `j` value as `k`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the next iteration, `j` will be `k + 1`.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - `dp[i][j]` will now be updated based on the value of `j + 1`.
   - We need to check if `j + 1 < t[i - 1]` or `j + 1 >= t[i - 1]` to apply the appropriate update rule.

### Conclusion:

At the start of the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `j` is now `j + 1`.

Given the initial state at the end of the previous iteration, we need to ensure that the state is correctly set for the next `j` value.

State: **`dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i][j - 1]` if `j - 1` is less than `t[i - 1]`. If `j - 1` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`, `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i][j - 1]` and `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `k`, so at the start of the next iteration, `j` is `k + 1`.**

State: **`dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i][j - 1]` if `j` is less than `t[i - 1]`. If `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`, `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i][j - 1]` and `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`.** 

Since the exact previous `j` value (`k`) is not specified, we express the state in terms of `j` being the next value (`j + 1`).

State: **`dp[i][j + 1]` is equal to `dp[i][j]` if `j` is less than `t[i - 1]`. If `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`, `dp[i][j + 1]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i][j]` and `dp[i - 1][j + 1 - t[i - 1]] + 1`.**
