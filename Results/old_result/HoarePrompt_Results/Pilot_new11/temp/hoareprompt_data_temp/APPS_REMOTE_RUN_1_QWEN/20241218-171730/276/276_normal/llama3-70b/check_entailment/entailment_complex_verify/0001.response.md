Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code. The program correctly implements the conversion from the golden system to the decimal system using the formula \( q^2 = q + 1 \), where \( q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \). The function `func_1` processes each digit of the input string in reverse order, correctly calculates the decimal value by multiplying each digit by \( q \) raised to the appropriate power, and returns the result. The main part of the program then compares these decimal values and prints the appropriate symbol ('>', '<', or '=').

The annotated version further clarifies the steps taken by the program and ensures that all states and variables are understood correctly. Since the program handles all provided examples accurately and follows the problem description without any issues, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained as **True**.
