The code assigns the value `'+'` to `pixels[i][j]`. The specific values of `i` and `j` are not provided in the initial state, but we know that `j` must be less than `m-1`. The value of `i` is not specified, but it does exist because `white_pixels` contains at least one tuple. The other variables (`n`, `white_pixels`, and `m`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `white_pixels` must contain at least one tuple, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` must be less than `m-1`, `pixels[i][j]` is '+'**
