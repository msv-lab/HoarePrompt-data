Final: **False**

Reason: Although the original assessment suggests the program is correct, upon closer inspection, there are issues with the logic for updating the maximum and minimum number of visits. Specifically:

1. The logic for updating `max_questions` inside the for loop seems to have an issue. The direction changes are handled, but the increments and decrements are not consistent, leading to potential inaccuracies.
2. The logic for updating `sergei_questions` in the if-else block might not be fully correct, especially for edge cases where `x` is 0 or `n-1`.

Given these issues, the program may not correctly calculate the maximum and minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked. Therefore, the original assessment needs to be revised to reflect these potential inaccuracies.
