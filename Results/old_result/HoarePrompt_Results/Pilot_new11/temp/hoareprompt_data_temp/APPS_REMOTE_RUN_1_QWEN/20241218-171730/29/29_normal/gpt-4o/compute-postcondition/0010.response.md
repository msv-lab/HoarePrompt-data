The code `name, type_ = file.split()` splits the string `file` into two parts using whitespace as the delimiter and assigns these parts to the variables `name` and `type_` respectively. This changes the values of `name` and `type_`, but the conditions on `n` and `files` remain unchanged.

Since `file` is split into `name` and `type_`, the value of `name` is the first part of `file` and the value of `type_` is the second part of `file`. The preconditions that `n` must be greater than 0 and `files` must have at least two elements are still valid.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `files` must have at least two elements, `name` is the first part of `file`, `type_` is the second part of `file`.**
