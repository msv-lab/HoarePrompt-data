The code updates `min_length` by comparing it with `i - position_map[target_pos]`. Given the initial state where `i` is 2 and `target_pos` is `current_x + dx, current_y + dy`, we need to determine the new value of `min_length`.

Since `i` is 2, the expression `i - position_map[target_pos]` simplifies to `2 - position_map[target_pos]`. The value of `min_length` will be updated to this value if it is smaller than the current `min_length`.

However, without knowing the exact value of `min_length` and `position_map[target_pos]`, we can only express the updated `min_length` in terms of these variables.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is 2, `min_length` is the minimum of its current value and `2 - position_map[target_pos]`, `position_map` is updated based on the value of `operations[i]`, `target_pos` is `current_x + dx, current_y + dy`.**
