The code `additional_marks.append(i + j)` appends the value of `i + j` to the list `additional_marks`. Based on the initial state, `i` is the next element in the `marks` list, and `j` is the second element in the `additional_marks` list. Since `additional_marks` is a non-empty list, it contains its previous elements plus the sum of `i` and the first element (`j`). After appending `i + j`, the value of `additional_marks` changes.

Output State: **`additional_marks` is its previous elements plus the sum of `i` and the first element (`j`), and it now includes `i + j`.**
