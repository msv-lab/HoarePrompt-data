`new_state` is assigned the value of `current`, which means `new_state` is now a list identical to `current`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`directions` is a non-empty list; `current` is a valid puzzle state with an 'X' position; `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc); `new_state`, `new_state_str`, `visited`, and `queue` remain unchanged; `new_state` is a list identical to `current`.**
