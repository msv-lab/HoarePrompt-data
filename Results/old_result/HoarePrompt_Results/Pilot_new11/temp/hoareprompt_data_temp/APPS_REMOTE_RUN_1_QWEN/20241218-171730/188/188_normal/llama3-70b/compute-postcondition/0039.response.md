The variable `c` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `c` is 0 or 1, so after incrementing, `c` will be 1 or 2 respectively. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`d` is a list of integers, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an integer, `c` is 1 or 2, `a1` is `i`, `a2` is as it was at the end of the previous iteration**
