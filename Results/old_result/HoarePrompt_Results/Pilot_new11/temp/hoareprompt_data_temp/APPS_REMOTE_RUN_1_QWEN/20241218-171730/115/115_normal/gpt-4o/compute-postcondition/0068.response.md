According to the given code and the initial state, the loop iterates over the variable `j` within the range specified by `m`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `m`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are known:
- `total` is 0
- `i` is 1
- `n` is at least 2
- `m` is at least 2
- `A` is a 2D list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1
- `operations` is a list of tuples representing the positions (i+1, j+1) of the top-left corners of the 2x2 submatrices in `A` that satisfied the condition and were flipped in `B`
- `B` is a 2D list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1
- For every `j` in the range `[0, m)`, `A[i][j]` is equal to `B[i][j]`
- For every `i` and `j` in the range `[0, n)` and `[0, m)`, `A[i][j]` is equal to `B[i][j]`
- If `A[i][j]` is not equal to `B[i][j]`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, the function continues without returning anything.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `j < m` must hold true. Since `i` is 1 and `n` is at least 2, and `m` is at least 2, the only variable that needs to be incremented is `j`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be increased by 1. Given that `j` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be 2 at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, `A` is a 2D list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, `operations` is a list of tuples representing the positions (i+1, j+1) of the top-left corners of the 2x2 submatrices in `A` that satisfied the condition and were flipped in `B`, `B` is a 2D list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, and for every `j` in the range `[0, m)`, `A[i][j]` is equal to `B[i][j]`, and for every `i` and `j` in the range `[0, n)` and `[0, m)`, `A[i][j]` is equal to `B[i][j]`. If `A[i][j]` is not equal to `B[i][j]`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, the function continues without returning anything. At the start of the next iteration, `j` is 2.**
