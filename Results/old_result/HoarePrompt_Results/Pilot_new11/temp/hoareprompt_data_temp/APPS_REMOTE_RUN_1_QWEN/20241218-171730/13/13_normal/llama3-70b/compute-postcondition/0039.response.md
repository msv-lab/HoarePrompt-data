The code `curr_beauty += 1` increments the value of `curr_beauty` by 1. This operation directly modifies the `curr_beauty` variable without affecting the other variables. The initial conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' or 'S', `golden` is a list of integers containing the indices of all characters in `s` that are equal to 'G', `max_beauty` is the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`, `left` is either the index of the first 'G' in the string `s` (if there is at least one 'G') or `n` (if there are no 'G's), and `right` is `k + 1`; `curr_beauty` is increased by 1.**
