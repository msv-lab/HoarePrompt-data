Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code appears to correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Function `func_1`:** This function correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. It handles all cases as described in the hints, including the special case where one of the numbers is 0.

2. **Function `func_2`:** This function correctly computes `f_max_n` as the maximum value of \(f(p)\) for permutations of length \(n\). It iterates through the range [1, \(n\)] and uses `func_1` to compute the GCD of prefixes, updating the maximum value accordingly.

3. **Function `func_3`:** This function correctly counts the number of permutations \(p\) such that \(f(p)\) equals \(f_{max}(n)\). It uses a dynamic programming approach to accumulate the count of permutations that meet the criteria. The DP array `dp` is initialized correctly, and the loop updates the array as required.

Since the code handles all the necessary computations and logical steps as described in the problem statement and the hints, it should work correctly for every potential case within the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
