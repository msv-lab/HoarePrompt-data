`b` is assigned the value `s - a`. However, the value of `a` is not specified in the initial state, so it remains undefined. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` must be greater than 1, `x` is an integer between 0 and 10^12 inclusive, `count` is 0, `b` is `s - a`.

Output State: **`s` must be greater than 1, `x` is an integer between 0 and 10^12 inclusive, `count` is 0, `b` is `s - a`**
