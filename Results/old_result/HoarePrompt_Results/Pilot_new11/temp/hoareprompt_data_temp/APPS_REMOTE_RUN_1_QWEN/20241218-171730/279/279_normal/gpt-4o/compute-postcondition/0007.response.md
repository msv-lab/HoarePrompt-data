To determine the necessary states to adjust for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop itself.

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5).
- `p` is a list of n integers obtained from converting the corresponding elements of `data[1:n+1]` to integers.
- `b` is a list of integers obtained from converting the corresponding elements of `data[n + 1:2 * n + 1]` to integers.
- `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.
- `visited` is a list of n elements all set to `False`.
- `cycles` is an empty list.

### For Loop Statement:
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will iterate over the range from `0` to `n-1`. Therefore, the loop will execute as long as `i < n`.

2. **Variable `i`**: Initially, `i` starts at `0`.

3. **Variable `n`**: Since `n` determines the number of iterations, we need to ensure `n` is at least `1` (since the loop condition is `i < n`, and `i` starts at `0`).

4. **Other Variables**: The variables `p`, `b`, `data`, `visited`, and `cycles` are not directly involved in the loop condition but may affect the loop's behavior or the state within the loop body.

### Required Adjustments:
- The loop will start with `i = 0`.
- To ensure the loop executes at least once, `n` must be greater than `0`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `n` must be greater than `0`.
- `i` should be `0` initially.

### Final State:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
