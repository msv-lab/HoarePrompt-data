The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. It does not affect the values of any variables outside of the loop context. Given the initial state, the values of `n`, `white_pixels`, `m`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `white_pixels` must contain at least one tuple, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2**
