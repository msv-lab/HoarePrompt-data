Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the program checks if \(M \ge N - K + 1\) and \(M \ge L\) but does not consider the case where \(M < N - K + 1\). If \(M < N - K + 1\), even though \(M \ge L\) might be true, it is still not possible to ensure that all friends can gift different coins because there are not enough unique coins available. 

For example, consider the input \(N = 10\), \(M = 2\), \(K = 3\), and \(L = 1\). Here, \(M < N - K + 1\) (since \(2 < 10 - 3 + 1 = 8\)), so the condition \(M \ge N - K + 1\) is false, and the program incorrectly prints `-1`.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that \(M \ge N - K + 1\) to guarantee that there are enough unique coins to distribute among the friends. The current implementation is missing this crucial check.
