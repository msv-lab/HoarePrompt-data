The code `in_degree[neighbor] -= 1` decrements the `in_degree` value of the `neighbor` by 1. Based on the initial state:

- `node` is the value that was at the front of the queue and removed
- `queue` is the original queue with the front element removed
- `count` is increased by 1
- `graph[node]` must contain at least one neighbor

After executing the code, the `in_degree` value of the `neighbor` is decreased by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`node` is the value that was at the front of the queue and removed, `queue` is the original queue with the front element removed, `count` is increased by 1, `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1**
