The code snippet `ans = min(ans, times[K - 1])` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and `times[K - 1]`. Since the initial state of `ans` is defined as the minimum of `ans_initial` and the last element of `times`, and it has been updated to be the minimum of its current value and `times[K - 1]`, the value of `ans` will now be the minimum of the previous `ans` value and `times[K - 1]`.

The other variables (`x`, `y`, `times`) remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`x` is -999, `y` is -997, `times` is sorted, `ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` value and `times[K - 1]`**
