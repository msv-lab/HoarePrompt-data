Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to ensure that the output sequence is lexicographically largest when there are multiple valid sequences with the same maximum value. Consider the following test case:

Input:
```
23 5
```

Expected Output:
```
Yes
3 3 2 1 0
```

However, the program outputs:
```
No
```

This is incorrect because there exists a valid sequence (3, 3, 2, 1, 0) that satisfies the conditions. The program incorrectly determines that no valid sequence exists when one does exist. This indicates that the program does not correctly handle the requirement to output the lexicographically largest sequence when there are multiple valid sequences with the same maximum value.
