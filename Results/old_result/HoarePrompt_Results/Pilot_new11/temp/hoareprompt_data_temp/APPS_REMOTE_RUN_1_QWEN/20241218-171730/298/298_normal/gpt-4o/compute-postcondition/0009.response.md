The print statement does not change the values of the variables. It only outputs 'YES' to the console. Therefore, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `area` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `area` is `n * m / k`, and the console prints 'YES'**
