The code assigns the value `+` to the element in the `pixels` list at index `[i][j]`. Given the initial state:

- `n` is greater than 1
- `white_pixels` contains at least one tuple
- `m` is greater than or equal to 1
- `i` is less than `n`
- `j` is 2

The value of `j` is 2, so the code modifies `pixels[i][2]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `white_pixels` contains at least one tuple, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is less than `n`, `pixels[i][2]` is '+', `j` is 2**
