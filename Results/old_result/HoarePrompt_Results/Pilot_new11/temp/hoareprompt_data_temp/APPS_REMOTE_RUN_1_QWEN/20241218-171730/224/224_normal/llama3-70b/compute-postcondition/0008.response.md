The code `dp[j] += dp[j - 1]` increments the value of `dp[j]` by `dp[j - 1]`. Given that `j` is `f_max_n - 1`, and `dp[j]` is initially the remainder of its previous value plus `dp[j - 1]` divided by `MOD`, the new value of `dp[j]` will be the previous value of `dp[j]` (which is the remainder of `dp[j - 1]` divided by `MOD`) plus the value of `dp[j - 1]`. This sum is then taken modulo `MOD` to ensure it fits within the same range.

Since the exact value of `dp[j - 1]` is not specified, we keep it as `dp[j - 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `f_max_n` must be at least 2, `dp[j]` is the previous value of `dp[j]` plus `dp[j - 1]` modulo `MOD`, and `j` is `f_max_n - 1`**
