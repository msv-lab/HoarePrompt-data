`ratings_before` is ['a'], `ratings_after` is [b], `n` is greater than 1. The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `a` and `b` respectively. The initial states of `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ratings_before` is ['a'], `ratings_after` is [b], `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `n` is greater than 1**
