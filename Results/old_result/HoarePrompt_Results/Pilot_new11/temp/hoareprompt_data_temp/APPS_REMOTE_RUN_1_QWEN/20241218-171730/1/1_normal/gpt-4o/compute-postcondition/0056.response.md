Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `ind` is not -1.
   - `bind` is not -1.
   - `ind` is less than `bind`.
   - `bind - 1` must be greater than or equal to `ind`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over the range `range(bind - 1, ind, -1)`.
   - This means the loop starts at `bind - 1` and decrements until it reaches `ind`.

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - Inside the loop, if `s[i]` equals `':'`, then `end_colon` is set to `i` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. No further iterations of this loop occur.
   - If `s[i]` does not equal `':'`, no changes occur.

4. **Determining the Next State:**
   - Since the loop decrements from `bind - 1` to `ind`, we need to consider the condition for the loop to continue executing.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` (which starts at `bind - 1`) must be greater than `ind`.

5. **Considering the Loop Body:**
   - If `s[i]` equals `':'`, the loop exits immediately.
   - If `s[i]` does not equal `':'`, the loop continues to the next iteration.

6. **Adjusting the State:**
   - If `s[i]` equals `':'`, `end_colon` is set to `i`, but the loop still needs to check the next value of `i` (decremented by 1).
   - If `s[i]` does not equal `':'`, `i` is decremented by 1.

Given the above considerations, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the decrement of `i` unless `s[i]` equals `':'`.

Since the loop decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration, the only change is in the value of `i` itself. All other variables (`ind`, `bind`, `end_colon`) remain unchanged unless `s[i]` equals `':'`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `i` will be `bind - 2` (decremented by 1 from `bind - 1`).
- `ind` remains the same.
- `bind` remains the same.
- `end_colon` remains the same unless `s[i]` equals `':'` in the current iteration.

If `s[i]` does not equal `':'`, then:
- `i` is `bind - 2`.

Since the problem does not specify the exact value of `s[i]` or the result of the loop body, we assume the general case where the loop continues.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is bind - 2, `ind` is not -1, `bind` is not -1, `ind` is less than `bind`, `bind - 1` must be greater than or equal to `ind`**.
