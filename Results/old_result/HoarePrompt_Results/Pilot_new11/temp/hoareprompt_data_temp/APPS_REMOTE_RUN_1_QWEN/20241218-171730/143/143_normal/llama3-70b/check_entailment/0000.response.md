Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements a dynamic programming solution to minimize the cost of purchasing at least L liters of lemonade. The program initializes a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the minimum cost to buy exactly i liters of lemonade. It iterates through each possible volume of bottles and updates the DP array accordingly. The program handles all given examples and potential cases within the constraints. The logic ensures that the minimum cost is found by considering all possible combinations of bottle types up to the required liters, making it correct for the given problem description.
