The code `px, py = nx, ny` updates the values of `px` and `py` to be equal to `nx` and `ny` respectively. The values of `nx` and `ny` are defined as \((v - 1) // y\) and \((v - 1) \% y\) respectively, where `v` is the same as `v_{next}` used to define `px` and `py`. 

Given that \(|nx - px| + |ny - py| \neq 1\), the function would have returned `False` before this line of code was executed. Since this condition is not met here, it implies that the function did not return and is continuing its execution. After executing `px, py = nx, ny`, the values of `px` and `py` are updated to be equal to `nx` and `ny`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `px` is \((v - 1) // y\), `py` is \((v - 1) \% y\), `numbers` is a list containing `n` integers where \(1 \leq n \leq 200000\) and \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `nx` is \((v - 1) // y\), `ny` is \((v - 1) \% y\), `px` is updated to `nx`, `py` is updated to `ny`.**
