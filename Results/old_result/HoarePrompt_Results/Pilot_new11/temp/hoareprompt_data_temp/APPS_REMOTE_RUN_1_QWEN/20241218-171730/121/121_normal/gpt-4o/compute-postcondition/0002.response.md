The code assigns the first element of the list `data` (which is an integer) to the variable `n`. The list `data` initially contains `[integer n, string s]`.

After executing the line `n = int(data[0])`, the variable `n` is updated to the integer value of the first element of `data`. The second element of `data`, which is a string, remains unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is a list containing [integer value of `data[0]`, string `s`]**
