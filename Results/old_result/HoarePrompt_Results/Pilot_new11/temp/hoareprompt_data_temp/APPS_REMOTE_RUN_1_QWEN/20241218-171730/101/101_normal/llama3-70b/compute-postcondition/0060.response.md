The code `pixels[i][j] = '+'` assigns the value `'+'` to the element in the `pixels` list at index `i` and column `j`. Given the initial state, the value of `i` is not specified, but since `j` is explicitly set to `2`, we know the column index. The value of `j` is updated to `2`, and the element in `pixels` at position `[i][2]` is now `'+'`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `white_pixels` must contain at least one tuple, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, and `pixels[i][2]` is `'+'`**
