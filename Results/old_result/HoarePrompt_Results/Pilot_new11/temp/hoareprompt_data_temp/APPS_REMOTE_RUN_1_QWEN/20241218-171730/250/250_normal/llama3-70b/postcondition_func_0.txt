The function `func` accepts parameters `n` (an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l` (an integer such that 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` and `y` (integers such that 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), and `a` (a list of n integers representing the positions of the marks on the ruler, where 0 = a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] = l). It first checks if there are any pairs `(i, j)` in the list `a` such that `a[j] - a[i] == x` or `a[j] - a[i] == y`. If no such pairs exist for `x`, it adds `x` to `additional_marks`. Similarly, if no such pairs exist for `y`, it adds `y` to `additional_marks`. Then, it iterates through the `marks` set and for each mark, it adds to `additional_marks` any value that can be formed by adding an element from `additional_marks` to the current mark, ensuring the sum is less than or equal to `l` and not already in `marks`. Finally, it prints the length of `additional_marks` followed by its elements in space-separated form.
