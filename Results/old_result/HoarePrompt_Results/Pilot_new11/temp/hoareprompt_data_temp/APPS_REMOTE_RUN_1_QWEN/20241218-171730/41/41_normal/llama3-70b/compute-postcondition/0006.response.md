`ratings_after` is appended with the value of `b`. The value of `b` is an input integer. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ratings_before` is ['a'], `ratings_after` is [b], `n` is greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer.

Output State: **`ratings_before` is ['a'], `ratings_after` is [b], `n` is greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**
