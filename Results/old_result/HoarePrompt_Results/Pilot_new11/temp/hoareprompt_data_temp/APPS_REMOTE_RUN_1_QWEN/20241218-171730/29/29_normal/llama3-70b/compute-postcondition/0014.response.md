The code creates a new list `regular` containing the first elements of the tuples in `files` where the second element is 0. Since `files` is initially sorted in descending order by the second element of each tuple, and `examples` contains the first elements of the tuples in `files` where the second element is 1, the `regular` list will contain elements from `files` where the second element is 0.

After the code execution, the variable `examples` remains unchanged because it was not affected by the code. The variable `files` also remains unchanged. The only new variable created is `regular`, which contains the first elements of the tuples in `files` where the second element is 0.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- `files` is a list of tuples sorted in descending order by the second element of each tuple
- `examples` is a list of the first elements of the tuples in `files` where the second element is 1

The output state after running the code is:
- `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- `files` is a list of tuples sorted in descending order by the second element of each tuple
- `examples` is a list of the first elements of the tuples in `files` where the second element is 1
- `regular` is a list of the first elements of the tuples in `files` where the second element is 0

Output State: **`n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `files` is a list of tuples sorted in descending order by the second element of each tuple; `examples` is a list of the first elements of the tuples in `files` where the second element is 1; `regular` is a list of the first elements of the tuples in `files` where the second element is 0**
