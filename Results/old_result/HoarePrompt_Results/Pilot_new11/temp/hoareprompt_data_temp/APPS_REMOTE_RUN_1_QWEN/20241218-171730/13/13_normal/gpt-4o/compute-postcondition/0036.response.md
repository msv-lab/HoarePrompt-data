`i` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` was previously such that `i + 2` is less than `n - 1`. After incrementing `i` by 1, `i + 2` will still be less than `n - 1` because adding 1 to both sides of the inequality `i + 2 < n - 1` results in `i + 3 < n`. The conditions for `trophies`, `segments`, and `start` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is either an empty list or a list containing at least one element which is the sublist ['G'] and may now include the tuple (1, i-1) or (1, n) depending on the condition, the character `trophies[i+2]` must be 'G', `start` is equal to `i`, and `i + 3` is less than `n - 1`**
