`low` is reassigned the value of `mid + 1`. The value of `mid` is \((low + high) // 2\), so `low` becomes \((low + high) // 2 + 1\). The values of `m`, `high`, `mid`, and `zeroes` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `low` is \((low + high) // 2 + 1\); `high` is equal to its initial value; `mid` is equal to \((low + high) // 2\); `zeroes` is equal to `func_1(mid)`**
