Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Understanding the Loop**: The given for loop is `for i in range(1, x + 1):`. This means the loop will start with `i = 1` and continue as long as `i <= x`.

2. **Loop Execution Conditions**:
   - For the loop to start executing, the value of `i` must be within the range defined by `range(1, x + 1)`.
   - Specifically, when `i = 1`, the loop should be able to proceed since it is the starting point.

3. **Current State Before Loop**:
   - `x` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\).
   - `max_sum` is currently 0.
   - `max_num` is currently 0.

4. **Ensuring the Loop Starts**:
   - The loop will start if `x` is at least 1 (since the range starts from 1 and goes up to `x` inclusive).
   - At the start of the loop, `i` will be set to 1.

Given these points, we need to ensure:
- `x` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `i` is set to 1 at the start of the loop.

Since the problem specifies that `x` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\), it inherently ensures that `x` is at least 1. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `x`.

The initial values of `max_sum` and `max_num` (both being 0) do not affect the loop's ability to start.

**Final State:**
- `x` must be at least 1.
- `i` must be set to 1 at the start of the loop.

However, since `x` is guaranteed to be a positive integer and the loop starts with `i = 1`, we only need to explicitly mention `i`.

**State:**
**`i` is 1, `x` must be at least 1**
