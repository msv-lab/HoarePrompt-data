The code updates the `prefix_sum` list such that each element `prefix_sum[i + 1]` is set to the sum of the current element `prefix_sum[i]` and `a[i]`. However, the initial state does not provide specific values for `prefix_sum` or `a`. The only condition given is that `n` must be greater than 0.

Since the exact values of `prefix_sum` and `a` are not specified, we cannot determine their updated values. But we know that `prefix_sum[i + 1]` is updated to `prefix_sum[i] + a[i]`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `prefix_sum[i + 1]` is updated to `prefix_sum[i] + a[i]`**
