Postcondition: ***`ways` remains unchanged unless the condition `a != b` and `2 * (a + b) == n` is met, in which case `ways` is increased by 1. `a` remains 3, `n` remains at least 7, and `b` becomes \(b_{\text{current}} + 2\). If the condition is not met, `ways`, `a`, `n`, and `b` remain in their initial states.***
