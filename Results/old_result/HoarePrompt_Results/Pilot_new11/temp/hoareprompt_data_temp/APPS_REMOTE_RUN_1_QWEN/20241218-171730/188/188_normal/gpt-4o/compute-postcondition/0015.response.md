Functionality: **The function accepts an even integer `n` between 2 and 100 (inclusive) and a list of `n` integers, each between 1 and 100 (inclusive). It counts the frequency of each integer in the list, sorts the unique integers by their frequency in descending order, and checks if there are at least two unique integers that appear exactly `n // 2` times each. If such integers exist, it prints 'YES' followed by these two integers; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. Potential edge cases include scenarios where `n` is 2, resulting in only two integers being provided, and situations where no two integers meet the condition of appearing exactly `n // 2` times.**
