Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `m` is an integer between 1 and 100, `k` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\), `x` is an integer between 0 and `n-1`, `y` is an integer between 0 and `m-1`, `full_cycles` is \(\left( k // (2 * n - 2) \right) * m\), `max_questions` is \(\left( (k // (2 * n - 2)) * m + n - 1 \right) // (2 * n - 2)\), if `x == 0` or `x == n - 1`, `sergei_questions` is \(\left( k // (2 * n - 2) \right) * m // (2 * n - 2) + \left( k // (2 * n - 2) \right) * m \% (2 * n - 2) >= 1\); otherwise, `sergei_questions` is \(\left( (k // (2 * n - 2)) * m + n - 1 \right) // (2 * n - 2)\). All other variables remain unchanged.***
