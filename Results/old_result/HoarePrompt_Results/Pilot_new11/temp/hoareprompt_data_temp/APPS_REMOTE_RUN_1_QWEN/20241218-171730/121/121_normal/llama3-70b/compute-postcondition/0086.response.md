Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 4 and 255, `s` is a non-empty string obtained by removing the first character from the original string, `count` is updated based on the new first character of `s`, and `res` is a string that either contains the sequence of characters added according to the rules inside the loop until no more characters can be added (i.e., when `count[nc] <= 0` for all `nc` in `'ACGT'`), or it is updated to include `c` if the new first character of `s` is not `'?'`.***
