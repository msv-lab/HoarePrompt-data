Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code provides a clear understanding of the state of the program at different points, and it aligns with the logic implemented in the program. The program correctly initializes `stones` to 0 and iterates through the operations, updating `stones` based on whether the operation is '+' or '-'. The logic ensures that the pile never becomes empty, as required by the problem statement. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the annotations support its correctness.
