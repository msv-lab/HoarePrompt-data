Since the loop has already completed all its iterations, there are no specific states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute because it has already done so. The loop runs from 1 to M (inclusive) and would have incremented the variable `j` in each iteration until it reaches `M`.

Given that the loop has completed all its iterations, we can conclude that the final value of `j` is `M`, and all previous states related to the loop have been modified accordingly.

State: **No additional states need to be adjusted as the loop has completed all its iterations.**
