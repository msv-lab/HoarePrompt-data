The code updates the value of `dy` to `(y1 - y2) / 2`. Based on the initial state, `y1` and `y2` are defined as follows:
- `y1` is `meats[j][1]`
- `y2` is `meats[i][1]`

Therefore, the updated value of `dy` is \((meats[j][1] - meats[i][1]) / 2\). All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d` is \((c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)\), `meats` is unchanged, `K` is unchanged, `T` is unchanged, `N` is unchanged, `i` is unchanged, `j + 1` is unchanged, `x1` is `meats[j][0]`, `y1` is `meats[j][1]`, `c1` is `meats[j][2]` if `c1 * T < c2 * T` else `meats[i][2]`, `x2` is `meats[i][0]`, `y2` is `meats[i][1]`, `c2` is `meats[i][2]` if `c1 * T < c2 * T` else `meats[j][2]`, `cx` is \((meats[j][0] + meats[i][0]) / 2\), `dy` is \((meats[j][1] - meats[i][1]) / 2\), `d2` is unchanged, `mx` is unchanged, `my` is unchanged, `count` is unchanged, `cy` is \((y1 + y2) / 2\), `dx` is \((meats[j][0] - meats[i][0]) / 2\)**
