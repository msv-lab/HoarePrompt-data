`n` is assigned the value `int(data[0])`. This means `n` now holds the integer value of the first element in the list `data`. The other variables (`cakes` and `data`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `cakes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers representing the radius and height of the i-th cake, respectively, and `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.**
