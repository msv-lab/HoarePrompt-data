Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down the key points:

1. **GCD Calculation**: The function `func_1` correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm. This step is crucial for simplifying the problem by reducing the values of `a` and `b` to their coprime form.

2. **Recursive Reduction**: If the GCD of `m`, `a`, and `b` is not 1, the function `func_2` recursively reduces the problem by dividing `m`, `a`, and `b` by their GCD. This ensures that the problem is simplified to a form where `a` and `b` are coprime, making the subsequent calculations more straightforward.

3. **Sum Calculation**: When `m` is less than `k` (where `k = a + b - 1`), the function returns \(((m + 1) * (m + 2)) // 2\). This part correctly calculates the sum of the first `m + 1` natural numbers.

4. **Large `m` Case**: For larger values of `m`, the function calculates two parts:
   - `sum_k`: The sum of the first `k` natural numbers.
   - `sum_m`: The difference between the sum of the first `m` natural numbers and the sum of the first `k - 1` natural numbers.

The function then returns the sum of these two parts, ensuring that the calculation is correct for larger values of `m`.

Based on the problem description and the output hints, the code correctly implements the logic to compute the sum of `f(i)` for `i` from `0` to `m`. There are no apparent edge cases or examples where the code fails to meet the requirements. Thus, the code is correct.
