The function `func` accepts no parameters. The functionality of the function is to return a value based on the constraints that `k_1`, `k_2`, and `k_3` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k_i ≤ 1500 for i in {1, 2, 3}. However, since no specific logic or return conditions are provided in the problem statement, we cannot specify what the function returns without additional information.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters, and returns a value based on the constraints that \( k_1 \), \( k_2 \), and \( k_3 \) are positive integers such that 1 ≤ \( k_i \) ≤ 1500 for \( i \) in {1, 2, 3}.**
