Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- \( n \) is an integer between 2 and 100.
- \( k \) is an integer between 1 and \( n-1 \).
- \( s \) is a string of length \( n \) containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T'.
- \( i \) is 1.
- \( g \) is 1 if \( s[1] \) is 'G' and -1 otherwise.
- \( t \) is 1 if \( s[i] \) is 'T', and remains -1 if \( s[i] \) is 'G' or any other character.

### Loop Analysis:
The for loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Key Points:
1. The loop starts from \( i = 1 \).
2. The loop will run until \( i < n \).

### Current Values:
- \( i \) is currently 1.
- Therefore, \( i + 1 = 2 \).

For the loop to execute one more time, \( i \) must be incremented to 2. Since the loop increments \( i \) by 1 each time it runs, the next value of \( i \) will be 2.

### Adjusting the States:
- \( n \) remains unchanged.
- \( k \) remains unchanged.
- \( s \) remains unchanged.
- \( i \) changes to 2.
- \( g \) remains unchanged because it depends on \( s[1] \), which does not change.
- \( t \) remains -1 because \( s[i] \) is still not 'T' (since \( i \) was just 1, and now it is 2).

### Updated State:
- \( n \) is an integer between 2 and 100.
- \( k \) is an integer between 1 and \( n-1 \).
- \( s \) is a string of length \( n \) containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T'.
- \( i \) is 2.
- \( g \) is 1 if \( s[1] \) is 'G' and -1 otherwise.
- \( t \) is -1 if \( s[2] \) is not 'T'.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1`, `s` is a string of length `n` containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', `i` is 2, `g` is 1 if `s[1]` is 'G' and -1 otherwise, `t` is -1**.
