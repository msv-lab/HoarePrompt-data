Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 0, `curr_lat` remains within the range of -90 to 90, the output remains 'NO', `dir` is the second part of the input string, the value of `t` remains unchanged. If `curr_lat` is outside the range of -90 to 90, the program does nothing (since the if condition ensures that the program flow reaches this point only when `curr_lat` is already out of the valid range).***
