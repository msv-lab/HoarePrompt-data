Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for certain cases. Specifically, it does not account for the fact that turning a skewer can affect skewers beyond the range of \(2k+1\) skewers. 

Consider the following example:
- Input: \(n = 5\), \(k = 1\)

According to the problem description, if Miroslav turns skewer number 1, the skewers 1, 2, and 3 will be turned over. If he then turns skewer number 4, the skewers 3, 4, and 5 will be turned over. This means that all skewers can be turned over in two steps. However, the provided program would suggest turning skewers 1 and 3, which is incorrect because skewer 2 would remain in its initial state.

The correct solution involves turning skewers in such a way that all skewers are affected within the specified range. The provided program incorrectly assumes that turning skewers at intervals of \(2k+1\) will cover all skewers, which is not always true.
