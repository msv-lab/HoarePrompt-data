Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not correctly implement the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not account for the restriction that a cake with a larger volume can only be placed on a cake with a smaller volume. Instead, it uses dynamic programming to maximize the sum of volumes without considering the stacking constraint. This means that it does not ensure that cakes are stacked in increasing volume order, which is a critical requirement of the problem.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
1 1
9 7
1 4
```

The correct output should be the volume of the stack consisting of cakes with indices 2 and 4 (cakes with volumes 203.58 and 12.57 respectively), because they satisfy the condition that the volume of the upper cake is strictly greater than the volume of the lower cake. However, the current implementation would incorrectly sum the volumes of all cakes, leading to a volume of approximately 3983.54, which is incorrect.

To fix this, the dynamic programming approach needs to be modified to ensure that the cakes are stacked in non-decreasing order of their volumes. This can be achieved by sorting the cakes by their volumes before applying the dynamic programming solution.
