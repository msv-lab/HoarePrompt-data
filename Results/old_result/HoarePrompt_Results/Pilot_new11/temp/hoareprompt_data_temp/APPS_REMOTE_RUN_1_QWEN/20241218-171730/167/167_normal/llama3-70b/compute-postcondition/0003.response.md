Postcondition: ***`x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `px` is 0, `py` is 0, `numbers` is a list containing `n` integers where `1 <= n <= 200000` and `1 <= a_i <= 10^9`, and `n` must be at least 1; `nx` is (v - 1) // y, `ny` is (v - 1) % y. The absolute difference between `nx` and `px` plus the absolute difference between `ny` and `py` is not equal to 1.***
