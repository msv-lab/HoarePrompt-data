`y` is assigned the value of `(n - x * a) // b`. The value of `x` is unknown, but it is a variable used in the calculation. The other variables are not directly affected by this line of code. The condition that `(n - (x_end + 1) * a) % b` is not equal to 0 remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer obtained from input, `a` is an integer obtained from input, `b` is an integer obtained from input, `y` is equal to `(n - x * a) // b`, `x` is a variable used in the calculation, and `(n - (x_end + 1) * a) % b` is not equal to 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer obtained from input, `a` is an integer obtained from input, `b` is an integer obtained from input, `y` is equal to `(n - x * a) // b`, `x` is a variable used in the calculation, and `(n - (x_end + 1) * a) % b` is not equal to 0**
