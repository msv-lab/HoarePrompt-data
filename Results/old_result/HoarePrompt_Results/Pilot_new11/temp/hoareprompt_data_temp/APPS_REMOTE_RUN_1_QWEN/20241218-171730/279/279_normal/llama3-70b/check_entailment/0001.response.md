Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Specifically, the program does not account for the requirement that each skewer must visit every of the 2n placements. The program only checks if the permutation is not in order and if the sequence `b` contains zeros, but it does not ensure that the skewers will visit all required placements.

For instance, consider the following input:
```
4
1 2 3 4
1 0 0 0
```
The program would output `1`, suggesting that only one change is needed. However, this is incorrect because the permutation and sequence do not guarantee that each skewer will visit all required placements. Specifically, with the given permutation and sequence, skewer 1 will never be reversed, and thus it will not visit the reverse placements. Therefore, at least one change (either in the permutation or the sequence) is necessary to ensure all skewers visit all placements. The program fails to identify this requirement, hence it is incorrect.
