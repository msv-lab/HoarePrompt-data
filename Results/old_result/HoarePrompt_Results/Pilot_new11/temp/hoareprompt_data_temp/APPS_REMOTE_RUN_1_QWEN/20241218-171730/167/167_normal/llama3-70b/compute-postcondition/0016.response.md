The code snippet updates the variables `px` and `py` to be equal to `nx` and `ny` respectively. Given the initial conditions:

- `px` is \((v' - 1) // y\)
- `py` is \((v' - 1) \% y\)
- `nx` is \((v - 1) // y\)
- `ny` is \((v - 1) \% y\)

The code simply assigns `nx` to `px` and `ny` to `py`. Therefore, the new values of `px` and `py` are the same as `nx` and `ny` respectively.

The states of the other variables (`x`, `y`, `numbers`, `v`, `ny`) are not affected.

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `px` is \((v - 1) // y\), `py` is \((v - 1) \% y\), `numbers` is a list containing `n` integers where \(1 \leq n \leq 200000\) and \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `v` is the next element in the list `a`, `nx` is \((v - 1) // y\), `ny` is \((v - 1) \% y\), `px` is now equal to `nx`, `py` is now equal to `ny`.**
