`visited[node]` is set to `True`, which means the node is marked as visited. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`node` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph; `graph` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex and its value is a list of vertices that have a directed edge coming out from the key vertex; `visited` is a list where `visited[node]` is `True`; `rec_stack` is an empty list.**
