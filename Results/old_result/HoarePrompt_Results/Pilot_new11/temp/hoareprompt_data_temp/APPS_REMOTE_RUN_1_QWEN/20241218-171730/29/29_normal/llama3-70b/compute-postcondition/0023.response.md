Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial States:
- `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- `files` is a list of tuples sorted in descending order by the second element of each tuple
- `examples` is a list of the first elements of the tuples in `files` where the second element is 1
- `regular` is a list of the first elements of the tuples in `files` where the second element is 0
- `script` is a list containing the moves for all files in `examples`
- `i` is `len(examples)`

### Loop Statement:
```python
for (i, file) in enumerate(regular, start=len(examples) + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - According to the loop statement, `i` should be initialized to `len(examples)` before the loop starts.
   - The loop will increment `i` starting from `len(examples) + 1`.

2. **Variable `file`:**
   - In each iteration, `file` should be a tuple from the `regular` list.
   - The loop will iterate over the `regular` list starting from the element at index `len(examples) + 1`.

3. **List `regular`:**
   - The `regular` list should contain at least one element because the loop starts from `len(examples) + 1` and should be able to access the first element of this list.

### Required Adjustments:
- Ensure that `i` is `len(examples)` at the start of the loop.
- Ensure that the `regular` list contains at least one element.

### Final State Adjustment:
State: **`n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `files` is a list of tuples sorted in descending order by the second element of each tuple, `examples` is a list of the first elements of the tuples in `files` where the second element is 1, `regular` is a list of the first elements of the tuples in `files` where the second element is 0 and must contain at least one element, `script` is a list containing the moves for all files in `examples`, `i` is `len(examples)`**

This ensures that the loop can execute as expected.
