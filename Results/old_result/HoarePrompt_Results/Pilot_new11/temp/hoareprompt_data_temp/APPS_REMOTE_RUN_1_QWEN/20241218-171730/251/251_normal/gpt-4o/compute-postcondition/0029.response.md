The code `dp[i] = volumes[i]` assigns the value of `volumes[i]` to `dp[i]`. Given the initial state, `dp[i]` was previously updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + volumes[i]` for all `j` such that `volumes[j] < volumes[i]`, and `dp[0]` remained `volumes[0]`. Now, this assignment overwrites the previous value of `dp[i]` with the direct value of `volumes[i]`.

Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `dp` is a list of length `n` where each element `dp[i]` is now equal to `volumes[i]`, `dp[0]` remains `volumes[0]`, and `volumes` remains unchanged.**
