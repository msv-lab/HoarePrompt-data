The code snippet `substr = s[i:j]` assigns a substring of the string `s` from index `i` to index `j-1` (non-inclusive) to the variable `substr`. However, the values of `i` and `j` are not provided in the initial state, which means we cannot determine the exact value of `substr` without knowing these values. Therefore, we can only say that `substr` is now a substring of `s` starting from index `i` up to but not including index `j`.

The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state: `i` is an integer such that `i + 1 < n`, `s` is a non-empty string, `n` must be greater than 0, and `max_len` is the maximum of its current value and 1, regardless of whether `substr` is a palindrome or not.

Output State: **`i` is an integer such that `i + 1 < n`, `s` is a non-empty string, `n` must be greater than 0, `substr` is a substring of `s` from index `i` to index `j-1`, `max_len` is the maximum of its current value and 1.**
