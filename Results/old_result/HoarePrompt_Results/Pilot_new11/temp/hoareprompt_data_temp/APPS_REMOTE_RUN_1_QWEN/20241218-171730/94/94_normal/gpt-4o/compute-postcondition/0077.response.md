To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition of the `while` loop and the state of the variables at the end of the previous iteration.

Given:
- The loop condition is `while queue:`.
- The variables are `queue`, `visited`, `directions`, `current`, `empty_row`, `empty_col`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `queue` is non-empty as long as there are still unique states to explore.
- `directions` remains unchanged.
- `current` is the leftmost element of the updated `queue`.
- `empty_row` and `empty_col` are determined by `divmod(empty_pos, 2)` where `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`.
- `queue` is a list containing all unique states reachable from `start` through valid moves, and `visited` is a set containing all unique states reachable from `start` through valid moves.

For the loop to execute one more time, `queue` must not be empty. Since the loop continues as long as `queue` is non-empty, the only thing that needs adjustment is to ensure that `queue` is non-empty at the start of the next iteration.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that `queue` remains non-empty.

State: **`queue` must not be empty**
