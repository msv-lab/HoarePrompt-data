The code initializes a 2D list (or matrix) `B` such that the elements at indices `(i, j)`, `(i, j+1)`, `(i+1, j)`, and `(i+1, j+1)` are all set to `1`. 

From the initial state:
- `n` is at least 2
- `i` is \( n - 1 \)
- `m` is at least 2
- `j` is \( m - 1 \)

After executing the code, the specified elements in the 2D list `B` are set to `1`. However, the values of `n`, `i`, `m`, and `j` themselves do not change.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2; `i` is \( n - 1 \); `m` is at least 2; `j` is \( m - 1 \); `B[i][j]` is `1`; `B[i][j + 1]` is `1`; `B[i + 1][j]` is `1`; `B[i + 1][j + 1]` is `1`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2; `i` is \( n - 1 \); `m` is at least 2; `j` is \( m - 1 \); `B[i][j]` is `1`; `B[i][j + 1]` is `1`; `B[i + 1][j]` is `1`; `B[i + 1][j + 1]` is `1`.**
