The variable `subtasks_solved` is assigned the value 0. This initializes `subtasks_solved` but does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the output state will include the updated value of `subtasks_solved` and the unchanged values of all other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 45, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, `M` is an integer such that 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9, `t` is a list of k integers where each t_j is an integer such that 1 ≤ t_j ≤ 1000000, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in the list `t`, `time_used` is greater than `M`, `max_points` is 0, `points` is `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `remaining_time` is `M - time_used`, `subtasks_solved` is 0**.
