`y` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`. Given that `index` is 2, `data[index + 1]` refers to `data[3]`. So, `y` is converted to an integer from the string at `data[3]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`K` is the integer obtained from `data[1]`, `meats` is an empty list, `data` is a list of strings resulting from the split input, `N` must be greater than 0, `index` is 2, `x` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `y` is the integer value of `data[3]`**
