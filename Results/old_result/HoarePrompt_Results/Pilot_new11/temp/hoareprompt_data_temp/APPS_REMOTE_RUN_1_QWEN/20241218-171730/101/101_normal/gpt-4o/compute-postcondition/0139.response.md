Postcondition: ***`i` is `n + 1`, `j` is 1, `m` must be greater than 0, `top` is `n + 1`, `bottom` is `n + 1`, `left` is 1, and `right` is 0. This is because if `j < left` is true, `j` will be set to `left`, which is 1 in this case. If `j < left` is false, the values remain unchanged. Given the initial conditions, `j < left` is false, so the values do not change.***
