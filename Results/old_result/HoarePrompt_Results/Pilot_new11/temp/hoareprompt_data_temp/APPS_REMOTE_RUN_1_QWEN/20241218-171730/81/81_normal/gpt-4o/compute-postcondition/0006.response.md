Postcondition: **`l` is an integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^9\), `r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^9\), `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq y \leq 10^9\), `y` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq y \leq 10^9\) and `y` is divisible by `x`, `z` is an integer equal to `y // x`, `count` is 0, and `z` must be greater than 0, the current value of `i` satisfies `z % i == 0`**
