#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers such that a >= b > 0.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`, `b` is 0
    return a
    #The program returns a which is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of a and b, and b is 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, where `a` is greater than or equal to `b` and both are greater than 0. It computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. After the loop completes, `a` contains the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`, and `b` is set to 0. This process handles the case where `a` and `b` are equal (both become the GCD), and also ensures that `b` is always reduced until it reaches 0, making `a` the GCD. The function returns the computed GCD (`a`) and sets `b` to 0.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9 and func_1(a, b) is a function that returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b.
def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b // func_1(a, b)
    #`a * b // func_1(a, b)` where `func_1(a, b)` returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\). It computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the function `func_1(a, b)`. The function then returns the result of `a * b // func_1(a, b)`. This means the function returns the product of `a` and `b` divided by their GCD. 

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- If `a` or `b` is 1, the GCD will be 1, and the result will be `a * b`, since \(1 * n // 1 = n\) for any integer `n`.
- If both `a` and `b` are the same, the GCD will be `a` (or `b`), and the result will be `a^2 // a = a`.
- If either `a` or `b` is 0, the function will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` because `a * b // func_1(a, b)` would involve division by zero, as the GCD of any number and 0 is the number itself, leading to a division by the number when `a` or `b` is 0. Therefore, the function should handle such cases appropriately to avoid errors.
