Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information
- The initial state of `num` is such that `1 <= num <= 1000` and `num >= 2`.
- The for loop iterates over `i` from `2` to `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `2 <= i <= int(num ** 0.5) + 1`.
2. **Range Calculation**: The upper bound of the range is `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`. For the loop to execute, this value must be at least 2 (since `i` starts from 2).

### Determining the Necessary Adjustments
- **Lower Bound Check**: Since the loop starts from `i = 2`, `num ** 0.5` must be at least 1. This means `num` must be at least 2 (which is already given).
- **Upper Bound Check**: For the loop to execute at all, `int(num ** 0.5) + 1` must be at least 2. This implies that `int(num ** 0.5)` must be at least 1. Therefore, `num ** 0.5` must be at least 1, which again means `num` must be at least 2.

### Conclusion
The only additional state we need to ensure for the loop to execute is that `num` must be at least 2. However, since the initial state already specifies that `num` is greater than or equal to 2, no further adjustments are needed.

### Final Answer
State: **`num` is an integer such that 1 <= num <= 1000 and num >= 2** (no additional adjustments needed based on the loop condition).
