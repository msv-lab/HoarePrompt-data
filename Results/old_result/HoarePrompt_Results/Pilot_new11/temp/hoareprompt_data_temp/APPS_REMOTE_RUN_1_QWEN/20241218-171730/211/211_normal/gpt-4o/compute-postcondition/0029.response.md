Postcondition: ***`i` is 4, `n` is greater than 3, `total_sum` is 0, and the console outputs 'YES', '1', '2', '1 2', '3', '2', '1 6', '1 4'. If `A[i]` is not zero, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, the state remains unchanged if `A[i]` is zero.***
