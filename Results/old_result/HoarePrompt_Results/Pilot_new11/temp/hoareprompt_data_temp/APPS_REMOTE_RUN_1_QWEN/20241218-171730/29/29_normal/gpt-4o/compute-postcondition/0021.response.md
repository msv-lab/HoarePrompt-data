`temp_counter` is assigned the value of `n + 1`. The value of `n` is a non-negative integer, so `temp_counter` will be a non-negative integer incremented by 1. The states of the other variables (`files`, `examples`, `regulars`, and `moves`) are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `temp_counter` is `n + 1`, `files` is a list of strings where each string represents a file in the format "name_i type_i", `examples` is a list of names of files that contain example tests, `regulars` is a list of names of files that contain regular tests, `moves` is an empty list**
