Final: **True**

Reasoning:
The original assessment was initially marked as **False**, but upon reviewing the provided annotated code, it becomes clear that the program has been correctly implemented to solve the problem. The `func_2` function generates all reachable configurations from the initial state using a breadth-first search approach, ensuring that no configurations are duplicated. The main logic then compares the sets of reachable configurations from both puzzles to determine if they share any common states.

The annotated code clarifies that the program:
1. Reads the initial configurations of Bessie's and Elsie's puzzles.
2. Uses `func_1` to extract the top row of each puzzle.
3. Uses `func_2` to generate all reachable configurations from each puzzle's initial state.
4. Compares the sets of reachable configurations to determine if they overlap.
5. Outputs "YES" if the sets overlap, indicating that the puzzles can reach the same configuration, and "NO" otherwise.

The annotations confirm that the program correctly implements the required functionality and does not have the issues identified in the original assessment. Therefore, the original assessment is no longer applicable, and the program is now assessed as **True**.
