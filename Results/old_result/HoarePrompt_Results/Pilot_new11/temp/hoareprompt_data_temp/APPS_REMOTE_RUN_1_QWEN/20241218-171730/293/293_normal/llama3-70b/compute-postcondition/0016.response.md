`n` is updated to `n // 2`, which means `n` is divided by 2 and the result is an integer. The value of `n // 2` must be greater than 1. Since `h` is an integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 50\) and `n` is updated to `n // 2`, the value of `n // 2` after the update will be an integer less than or equal to 25 but greater than 1. The value of `ans` is incremented by `n // 2`. Therefore, `ans` will be `ans + (n // 2)`.

Since the initial value of `n` was an integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 50\), after updating `n` to `n // 2`, the new value of `n` is an integer between 2 and 25. The value of `ans` is updated accordingly.

Output State: **`h` is an integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 50\), `n` is an integer between 2 and 25, `ans` is updated to `ans + (n // 2)`**
