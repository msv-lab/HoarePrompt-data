The variable `current_level` is assigned the value `0`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`h` is an integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 50; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^h; `total_leaves` is 2; `visited_count` is 0; `path` is the binary representation of `n - 1`, padded with leading zeros to a length of `h`; `current_level` is 0.**
