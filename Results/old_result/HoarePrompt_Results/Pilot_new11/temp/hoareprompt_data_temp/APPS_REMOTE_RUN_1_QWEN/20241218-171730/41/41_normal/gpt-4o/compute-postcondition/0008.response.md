`is_rated` is assigned the value `True`. The value of `n` is greater than 0, `ratings` remains as `[('a', 'b')]`, `is_rated` is now `True`, `is_unrated` is still `False`, `a` is an input integer, and `b` is an input integer. The condition that the current value of `a` is not equal to `b` is still valid.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `ratings` is [('a', 'b')], `is_rated` is True, `is_unrated` is False, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, and the current value of `a` is not equal to `b`**
