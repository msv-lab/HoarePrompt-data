The code `empty_row, empty_col = divmod(empty_pos, 2)` calculates the quotient (`empty_row`) and remainder (`empty_col`) when `empty_pos` is divided by 2 using the `divmod` function. The values of `current` and `queue` remain unchanged. The `empty_row` and `empty_col` variables are assigned new values based on `empty_pos`.

Given the initial state:
- `current` is the first element of the queue (before popleft)
- `queue` is the original queue minus its first element
- `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`

After executing the code, `empty_row` and `empty_col` are calculated from `empty_pos`. Since `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, and `divmod(empty_pos, 2)` returns the quotient and remainder of `empty_pos` divided by 2, the values of `empty_row` and `empty_col` are updated.

Output State: **`current` is the first element of the queue (before popleft), `queue` is the original queue minus its first element, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is the quotient of `empty_pos` divided by 2, `empty_col` is the remainder of `empty_pos` divided by 2**
