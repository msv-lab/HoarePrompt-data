The code updates the `remaining_time` variable by assigning it the value of `M - time_used`. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Given the initial conditions:
- `n`, `k`, `complete_tasks + 1`, `total_time_per_task`, `time_used` is `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`
- `points` is `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`
- `remaining_time`, `num_processed`, and `t` are integers within their specified ranges
- `subtasks_solved` is the minimum of its original value and `(n - (complete_tasks + 1)) * k`
- `max_points` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `points + subtasks_solved`

After the code runs, the following changes occur:
- `remaining_time` is now set to `M - time_used`

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, `complete_tasks + 1`, `total_time_per_task`, `time_used` is `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `points` is `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `remaining_time` is `M - time_used`, `num_processed`, `t` are integers within their specified ranges; `subtasks_solved` is the minimum of its original value and `(n - (complete_tasks + 1)) * k`; `max_points` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `points + subtasks_solved`.
