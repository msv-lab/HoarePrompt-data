`beauty` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` is unchanged, and the values of `s`, `j`, and `n` remain the same. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is a non-negative integer, `s` is a string, `beauty` is the count of 'G' characters in the substring of `s` starting from index `i` and going backwards until the first non-'G' character is encountered plus 1, `j` is `i + 3`, and `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.
