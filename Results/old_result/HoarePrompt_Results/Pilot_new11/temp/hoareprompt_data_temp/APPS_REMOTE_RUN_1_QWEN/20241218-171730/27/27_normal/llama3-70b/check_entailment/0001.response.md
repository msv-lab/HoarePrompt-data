Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It calculates all twelve possible expressions, finds the maximum value among them, and prints the corresponding expression. The program handles the input and output formats as specified, and it uses the correct order of operations for exponentiation. Given the nature of the problem and the specific constraints, it is unlikely that there are edge cases that the program does not handle correctly based on the provided examples and the general structure of the solution.
