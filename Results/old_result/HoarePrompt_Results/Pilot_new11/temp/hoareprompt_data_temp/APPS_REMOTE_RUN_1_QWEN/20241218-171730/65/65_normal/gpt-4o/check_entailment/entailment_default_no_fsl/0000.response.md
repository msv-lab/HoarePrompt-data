Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. It counts the frequency of each color (character) in the input string and checks if any color frequency exceeds the number of friends \( k \). If no color frequency exceeds \( k \), it prints 'YES', indicating that it is possible to distribute the balloons according to the given conditions. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The code handles all potential cases within the constraints \( 1 \leq n, k \leq 100 \) and \( s \) being a string of lowercase letters. Given the problem description and the provided examples, the code appears to work correctly for all cases.
