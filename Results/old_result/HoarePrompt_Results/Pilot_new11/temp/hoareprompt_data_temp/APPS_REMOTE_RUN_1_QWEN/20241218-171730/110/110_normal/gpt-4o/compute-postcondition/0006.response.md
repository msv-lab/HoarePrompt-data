According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. For the loop to execute again, `m` must be at least 2. At the end of the last iteration, `m` must be at least 2, and the `heap` contains tuples of the form `(-coverage(x, 1), x, 1)`. For the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be at least 3 because the loop increments `y` from 0 to `m-1`.

So, at the start of the next iteration, `m` must be at least 3.

State: **`m` must be at least 3; `heap` contains tuples including `(-coverage(x, 1), x, 1)`**
