Functionality: **The function takes two integers `n` and `L` (with 1 ≤ n ≤ 30 and 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9), and a list `costs` of `n` integers (each 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9). It then calculates the minimum cost to obtain exactly `L` liters of liquid using bottles of various volumes (2^j - 1 liters for j from 0 to n-1), where the cost of each bottle type is specified in the `costs` list. If it's possible to obtain exactly `L` liters, it returns the minimum cost; otherwise, it returns -1. The function uses dynamic programming to solve this problem efficiently. Potential edge cases include when `L` is 0, which is handled by setting `dp[0] = 0` initially. However, the function does not explicitly handle cases where no combination of bottle volumes can sum up to `L`, which is why the final check `if dp[L] != float('inf')` ensures that -1 is returned in such scenarios.**
