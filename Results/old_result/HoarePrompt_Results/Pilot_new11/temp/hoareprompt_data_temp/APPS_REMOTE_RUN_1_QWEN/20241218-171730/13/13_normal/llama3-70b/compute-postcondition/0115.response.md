The code `beauty += 1` increments the value of `beauty` by 1. Since `beauty` was incremented by 1 if `s[j]` was 'G' and remains unchanged otherwise, and now it is being incremented again, the value of `beauty` will be increased by 1 from its previous state.

Output State: **`j` is `i + 3`, `beauty` is incremented by 1 from its previous state (either it was already incremented if `s[j]` was 'G' or it is incremented now), `left`, `right`, `max_beauty`, `max_beauty_one_swap`, and `golden` remain unchanged.**
