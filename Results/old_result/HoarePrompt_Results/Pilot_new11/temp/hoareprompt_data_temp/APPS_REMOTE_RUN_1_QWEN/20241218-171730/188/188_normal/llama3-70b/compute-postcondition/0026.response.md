The code assigns the value `-1` to both `a1` and `a2`. This does not affect the values of the other variables such as `a`, `i`, `d`, `total`, `n`, and `c`.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers, `i` is the last element of `a`, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `a` and the value is the count of occurrences of that integer in `a`, `total` is undefined, `n` is an even number between 2 and 100 inclusive, `c` is 0, `a1` is -1, `a2` is -1**
