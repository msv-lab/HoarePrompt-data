Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the given problem. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input, representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears, respectively. This part is correct and matches the problem description.

2. **Calculation of Maximum Lemons**: 
   - The line `max_lemons = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)` ensures that the maximum number of lemons that can be used is the minimum value among the number of lemons available (`a`), the number of apples divided by 2 (`b // 2`), and the number of pears divided by 4 (`c // 4`). This correctly reflects the requirement that for each lemon, there must be exactly 2 apples and exactly 4 pears.

3. **Total Number of Fruits Calculation**:
   - The line `total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4` calculates the total number of fruits that can be used based on the maximum number of lemons (`max_lemons`). This calculation ensures that for each lemon, there are exactly 2 apples and 4 pears, adhering to the ratio 1:2:4.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the total number of fruits, which is the sum of the lemons, apples, and pears that can be used under the given conditions. If no fruits can be used (i.e., `max_lemons` is 0), the output will be 0, as required.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the logic needed to solve the problem and meets all the requirements specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
