Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is an integer, `x` and `y` are integers such that if the loop executed, the final values of `x` and `y` satisfy the equation `x * a + y * b == n`. If the loop does not execute, `x` remains 0 and `y` remains 0.**

### Explanation:
- **Loop Execution**: The loop iterates over `x` from `0` to `n // a`. For each iteration, it calculates `y` based on the current value of `x` and checks if `x * a + y * b == n`.
- **Condition Check**: If the condition `x * a + y * b == n` is true, the loop prints 'YES' and the values of `x` and `y` and exits the program. This means that if the loop completes at least once, the values of `x` and `y` will be such that they satisfy the equation `x * a + y * b == n`.
- **No Condition Match**: If the condition is never met during the loop iterations, `x` and `y` remain at their initial values, which are `0` for both. The loop will exit without printing anything.

Thus, the final state of the variables after the loop finishes (either by finding a solution or by exhausting all possible values of `x`) is that if a solution exists, `x` and `y` will satisfy the equation. If no solution exists, `x` and `y` will remain `0`.
