Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle the case where there are no 'G's in the `trophies` string correctly. According to the problem description, if there are no segments of 'G's, the function should return 0. However, the code currently returns the maximum length of any segment of 'G's, which would be 0 if there are no 'G's. This is incorrect because the problem specifically states that if no segments of 'G's are found, the function should return 0.

To fix this, you need to add a check at the beginning of the `func_1` function to return 0 if no segments of 'G's are found. Here is the corrected code:

```python
def func_1(n, trophies):
    segments = []
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if trophies[i] == 'G':
            start = i
            while i < n and trophies[i] == 'G':
                i += 1
            segments.append((start, i - 1))
        else:
            i += 1
    if not segments:
        return 0
    max_length = max((end - start + 1 for (start, end) in segments))
    if len(segments) == 1:
        return max_length
    for i in range(1, len(segments)):
        (prev_start, prev_end) = segments[i - 1]
        (curr_start, curr_end) = segments[i]
        if curr_start - prev_end == 2:
            max_length = max(max_length, curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end - prev_start + 1) + 1)
    return min(max_length + 1, n)
```

With this addition, the function will now correctly return 0 if there are no segments of 'G's, thus satisfying the problem description for every potential case.
