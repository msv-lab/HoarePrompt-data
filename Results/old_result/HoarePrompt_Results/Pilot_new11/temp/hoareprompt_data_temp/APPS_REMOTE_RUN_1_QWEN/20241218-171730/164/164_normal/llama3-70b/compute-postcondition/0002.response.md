The code initializes two variables `g` and `t` to `-1`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, or `s`. Therefore, the output state includes the updated values of `g` and `t`, and retains the original values of `n`, `k`, and `s`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1`, `s` is a string of length `n` containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', `g` is -1, `t` is -1**
