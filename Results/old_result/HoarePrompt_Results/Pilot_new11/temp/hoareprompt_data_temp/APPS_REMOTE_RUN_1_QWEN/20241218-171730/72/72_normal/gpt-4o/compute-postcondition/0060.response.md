The code `row -= 2` decrements the value of `row` by 2. Initially, `row` was incremented by `direction`, which is `-1`. So, the previous value of `row` was `row + (-1) = row - 1`.

Let's calculate the new value of `row`:
- Initial value of `row` before incrementing by `direction`: `row - 1`
- After decrementing by 2: `(row - 1) - 2 = row - 3`

The states of the other variables (`sergei_questions`, `max_questions`, `col`, and `direction`) are not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`sergei_questions` is incremented by 1, `max_questions` is incremented by 1, `col` is incremented by 1, `row` is `row - 3`, `direction` is -1**.
