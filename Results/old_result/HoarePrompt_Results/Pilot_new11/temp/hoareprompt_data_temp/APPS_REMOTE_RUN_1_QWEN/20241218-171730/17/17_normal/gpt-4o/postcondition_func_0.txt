The function accepts four integers through separate input lines, representing counts of "((", "()", "(})", and "))" respectively. It then checks if the sum of counts of "((" and "()" is equal to the sum of counts of "(}" and "))", and also ensures that the count of "()" is greater than or equal to the count of "(}". If both conditions are met, it prints `1`; otherwise, it prints `0`. The function does not return any value but modifies the state of `cnt2` and `cnt3` by checking their values against the given conditions.
