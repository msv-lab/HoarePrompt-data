Postcondition: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `marks` is a list of integers (potentially empty), `marks_set` is a set of unique elements from `marks`, `x_found` and `y_found` are boolean flags indicating whether `x` and `y` were found respectively, and `new_marks` is a set containing the updated results based on the final iteration through all `marks`. If `new_marks` is not empty, the last element of `new_marks` has been printed. If `new_marks` is empty, `result` is a list containing `x` and `y`, and `len(result)` is printed.**
