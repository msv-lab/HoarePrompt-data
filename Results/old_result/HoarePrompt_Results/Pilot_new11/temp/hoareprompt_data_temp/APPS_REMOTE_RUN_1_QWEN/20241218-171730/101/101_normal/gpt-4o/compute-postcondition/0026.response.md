Postcondition: ***`screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string is of length `m` and consists of characters "." and "w". If `i < top`, then `top` is set to `i`, `bottom` is set to `i`, `left` is `j+1` if `j+1 > left`, otherwise it remains `None`. `right` is `j+1` if `j+1 > right`, otherwise it remains `None`. The values of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` do not change if `i >= top`.***
