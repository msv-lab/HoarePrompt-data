The code swaps the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` in the `new_state` list. Let's break down the changes:

- `new_state[empty_pos]` is the value at the current empty position.
- `new_state[new_pos]` is the value at the new position after calculating `new_row` and `new_col`.

After swapping these two values, the new state of the `new_state` list will reflect this change.

Output State: **`directions` is a non-empty list; `current` is a valid puzzle state with an 'X' position; `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is `new_row * 2 + new_col`; `new_state` is a copy of `current` with the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped.**
