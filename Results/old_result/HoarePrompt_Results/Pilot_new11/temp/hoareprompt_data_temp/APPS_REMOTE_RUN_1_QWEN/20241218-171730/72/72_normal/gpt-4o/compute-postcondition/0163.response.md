`row` is initially calculated as `2 * direction + 1`, and since `direction` is 1, `row` is 3. The code `row += 2` increments `row` by 2, making `row` equal to 5. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`col` is 2, `sergei_questions` is increased by 1, `max_questions` is `max_questions - 1`, `row` is 5, `direction` is 1**
