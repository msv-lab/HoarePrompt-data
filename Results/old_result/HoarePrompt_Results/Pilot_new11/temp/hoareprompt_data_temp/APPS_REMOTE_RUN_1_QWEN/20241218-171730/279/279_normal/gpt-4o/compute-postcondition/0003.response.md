The code `p = list(map(int, data[1:n + 1]))` impacts the program by converting each element in the slice of `data` from index 1 to `n` (inclusive) into an integer and assigning this new list to `p`. 

- Initially, `p` is a list of n integers representing a permutation.
- `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.

After executing the code, `p` is updated to a list of integers obtained from the sliced part of `data`, while `n` remains unchanged and `b` and `data` are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), `p` is a list of n integers obtained from converting the corresponding elements of `data[1:n+1]` to integers, `b` is a list of n integers consisting only of 0s and 1s, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input**
