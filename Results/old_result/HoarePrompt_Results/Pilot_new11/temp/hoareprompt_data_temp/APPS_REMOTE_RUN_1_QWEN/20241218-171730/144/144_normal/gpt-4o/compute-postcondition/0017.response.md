Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers from standard input. It then sorts the list and calculates the smallest positive integer that is not present in the list. The function prints this integer. The function handles the case where the input list might contain duplicates and negative numbers, although these are ignored since only positive integers are considered in the calculation of the smallest missing positive integer. If the input list is empty or contains only zeroes, the function correctly identifies `1` as the smallest missing positive integer.**
