The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters but reads input from the user. Specifically, it reads an integer `n` from the first line of input, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 100`, and then reads `n` integers from the second line of input, each ranging from `-100` to `100`. The function does not return anything directly but is expected to process the sequence of integers read from the input.

Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` and then reads `n` integers from the input, processes the sequence of integers, and does not return any value.**
