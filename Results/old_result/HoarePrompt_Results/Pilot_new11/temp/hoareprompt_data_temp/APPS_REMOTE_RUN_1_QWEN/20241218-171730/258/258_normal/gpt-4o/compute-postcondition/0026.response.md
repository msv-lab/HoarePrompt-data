The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `N` and `K`, both of which are integers, with the constraints that `1 <= K <= N` and `1 <= N <= 60`. It also accepts a parameter `meats`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple in the `meats` list contains three integers representing the coordinates `(x, y)` and hardness `(c)` of a piece of meat, with the constraints `-1000 <= x, y <= 1000` and `1 <= c <= 100`.

Based on the given information, there are no specific return values mentioned for the different cases. Therefore, we will focus on the parameters accepted by the function.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `N` and `K` (both integers with specified constraints), and a list `meats` of tuples, each containing coordinates and hardness of a piece of meat.**
