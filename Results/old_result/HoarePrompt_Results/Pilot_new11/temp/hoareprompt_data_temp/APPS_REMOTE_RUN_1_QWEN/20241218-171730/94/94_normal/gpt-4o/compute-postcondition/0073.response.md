The code `queue.append(new_state_str)` appends the value of `new_state_str` to the list `queue`. This means that `queue` now contains all its original elements plus the new element `new_state_str`. 

Output State: **`queue` is a non-empty list containing its original elements plus `new_state_str`, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `new_row * 2 + new_col`, `new_state_str` is a string representation of the list `new_state` (which is `current` with the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped), `new_row` remains `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` remains `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` remains `new_row * 2 + new_col`, `directions` remains consistent, `new_state` is a list identical to `current` except the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` are swapped, `visited` includes the new state represented by `new_state_str`.**
