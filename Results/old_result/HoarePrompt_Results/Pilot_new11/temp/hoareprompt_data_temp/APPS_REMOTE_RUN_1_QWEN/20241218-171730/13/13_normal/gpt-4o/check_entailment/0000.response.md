Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where there are exactly two segments of golden trophies, and the gap between them is exactly 1. In this case, swapping the trophies would not increase the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies. For example, consider the input:

```
Input
5
GGSGS
```

The program will output `3`, but the maximum possible beauty of the arrangement is `4`. Vova can swap the trophies at positions 2 and 4 to get the sequence "GGGGS", which has a subsegment of length 4. The current implementation does not account for this scenario, hence it is incorrect.
