The function takes an integer `n` as input, where \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\). It iterates over all integers `i` from 1 to \(n//2\) and checks if the sum of `i` and `n-i` is divisible by the last non-zero digit of the sum. If the condition is met, it increments the counter `ans`. Finally, it prints the value of `ans`, which represents the count of such integers `i`. The function does not handle any edge cases explicitly; however, the input `n` is assumed to be within the specified range.
