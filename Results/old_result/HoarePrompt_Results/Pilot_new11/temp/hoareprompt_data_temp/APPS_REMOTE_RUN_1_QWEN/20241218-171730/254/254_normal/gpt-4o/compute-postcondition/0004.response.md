The code `print('YES')` does not affect any of the variables. It simply prints the string 'YES' to the console. The variables `k1`, `k2`, `k3`, and `gcd_all` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k1` is an integer between 1 and 1500, `k2` is an integer between 1 and 1500, `k3` is an integer between 1 and 1500, `gcd_all` is the GCD of `gcd_k1_k2` and `k3`, the value of `gcd_all` is 1.**
