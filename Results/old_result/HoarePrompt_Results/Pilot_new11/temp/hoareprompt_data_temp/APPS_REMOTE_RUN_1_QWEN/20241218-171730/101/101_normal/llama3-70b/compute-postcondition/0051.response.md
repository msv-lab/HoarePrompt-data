Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 1, `white_pixels` must contain at least one tuple, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 0 at the start of the first iteration. After executing the if-else block, if `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', it remains unchanged. Otherwise, `pixels[i][j]` is set to '.'.***
