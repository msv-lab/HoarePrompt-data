The code snippet updates `min_x` and `min_y` to be the minimum of their current values and the values `x` and `y` from the tuple `(x, y)` in `white_pixels`. Since `x` and `y` represent the coordinates of a white pixel, they must be within the bounds defined by `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y`.

Given that `min_x` and `min_y` are initially set to the `x` and `y` values of the first tuple in `white_pixels`, and since `x` and `y` are part of the tuples in `white_pixels`, the values of `min_x` and `min_y` cannot decrease. Therefore, the updated values of `min_x` and `min_y` remain the same as their initial values.

The output state is:
Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `pixels` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` characters ('.' or 'w'), `white_pixels` is a list of tuples representing the coordinates `(i, j)` of all 'w' characters in the `pixels` grid and must contain at least one tuple, `min_x` is the `x` value from the tuple in `white_pixels`, `min_y` is the `y` value from the tuple in `white_pixels`, `max_x` is the maximum `x` value from the tuples in `white_pixels`, `max_y` is the maximum `y` value from the tuples in `white_pixels`**.
