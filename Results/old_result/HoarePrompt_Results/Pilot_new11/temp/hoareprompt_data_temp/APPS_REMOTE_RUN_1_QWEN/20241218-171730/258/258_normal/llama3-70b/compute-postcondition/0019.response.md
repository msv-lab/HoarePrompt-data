The code `ans = min(ans, times[K - 1])` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `times[K - 1]`. However, the initial value of `ans` is not specified in the initial state, and neither is the value of `K` or the contents of the `times` list. Since these values are not provided, we cannot determine the exact updated value of `ans`.

The only thing we know for sure is that `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and the last element of the `times` list.

Output State: **`x` is -999, `y` is an integer within the range \([-1000, 1000]\), `times` is a sorted list of values returned by `func_2(-999, y, -999, y)` for each `y` in the range \([-1000, 1000]\), `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and the last element of the `times` list.**
