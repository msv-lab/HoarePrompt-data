The code `break` is used to exit the loop. Since the loop was continuing to execute based on the condition `j < 0` and the character at index `j` in string `s` is not 'G', the `break` statement will terminate the loop. However, the `break` statement itself does not modify any variables; it only exits the loop.

Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged after the `break` statement is executed. 

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 0, the loop will continue to execute because `j` is less than 0, and the character at index `j` in string `s` is not 'G' and we break out of the loop.**
