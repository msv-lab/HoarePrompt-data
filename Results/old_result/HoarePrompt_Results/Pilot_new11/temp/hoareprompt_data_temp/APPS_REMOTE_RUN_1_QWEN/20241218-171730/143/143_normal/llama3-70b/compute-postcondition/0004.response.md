State before the loop starts: `costs` is a list of integers read from input, `L` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^9\), `dp` is a list of length `L + 1` where each element is `float('inf')`, `dp[0]` is 0.

Now, let's think step by step:

1. **Initialization**: The given code initializes `dp` as a list of length `L + 1` where each element is `float('inf')`, and sets `dp[0]` to 0.
2. **Loop Execution**: The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `L` (inclusive).

For the loop to execute properly:
- The variable `i` should start from 1 and go up to `L`.
- The variable `L` must be a positive integer since the loop runs from 1 to `L`.

The initial state provided already includes `dp[0]` being set to 0, which is correct for initializing dynamic programming problems. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the `dp` list or its initial value.

Since the loop depends on the values of `i` and `L`, and the initial conditions for these variables must be met for the loop to execute, we need to ensure:
- `L` is greater than 0.
- `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `L`.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are `L` must be greater than 0, and `i` starts from 1.

State: **`costs` is a list of integers read from input, `L` is an integer greater than 0, `dp` is a list of length `L + 1` where each element is `float('inf')`, `dp[0]` is 0, `i` is 1**
