Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program simply calculates the absolute difference between `x` and `y`, which is not the correct approach. According to the problem description, Memory needs to modify the length of a single side of the current triangle in each second to ensure that the triangle remains non-degenerate (i.e., the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side). 

The given solution fails to account for this constraint and simply outputs the difference between `x` and `y`, which is not the minimum number of seconds required to achieve the transformation. For example, consider the input `(6, 3)`:

- The correct minimum number of seconds required is `4` as shown in the problem statement.
- However, the program would output `3`, which is incorrect because it does not take into account the need to maintain a valid triangle at each step.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
