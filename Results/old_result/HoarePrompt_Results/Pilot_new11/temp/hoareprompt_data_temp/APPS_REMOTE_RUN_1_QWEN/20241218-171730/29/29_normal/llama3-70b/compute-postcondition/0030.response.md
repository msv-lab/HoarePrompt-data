The code `print(len(script))` prints the length of the `script` list. The length of the `script` list is determined by the number of moves specified in `script`. Since no changes are made to the `script` list within the given code snippet, the length of `script` remains unchanged.

The initial state is:
- `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- `files` is a list of tuples sorted in descending order by the second element of each tuple
- `examples` is a list of the first elements of the tuples in `files` where the second element is 1
- `regular` is a list of the first elements of the tuples in `files` where the second element is 0 and must contain at least one element
- `script` is a list containing the moves for all files in `regular` starting from the position `len(examples)`
- `i` is `len(examples) + len(regular)`

Since no changes are made to the `script` list, the output will be the length of the `script` list as it was before the code execution.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `files` is a list of tuples sorted in descending order by the second element of each tuple, `examples` is a list of the first elements of the tuples in `files` where the second element is 1, `regular` is a list of the first elements of the tuples in `files` where the second element is 0 and must contain at least one element, `script` is a list containing the moves for all files in `regular` starting from the position `len(examples)`, `i` is `len(examples) + len(regular)`, and the length of `script` is printed.**
