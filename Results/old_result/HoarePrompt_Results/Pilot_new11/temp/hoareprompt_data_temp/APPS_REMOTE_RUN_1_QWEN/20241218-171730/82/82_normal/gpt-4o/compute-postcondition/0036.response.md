The code `current_lcm = func_2(new_a, new_b)` assigns the result of calling the function `func_2` with `new_a` and `new_b` as arguments to the variable `current_lcm`. However, the function `func_2` is not defined in the given code snippet, and its implementation is not provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `current_lcm`. 

Given this, the only changes are to the introduction of the `current_lcm` variable and its assignment based on the function call. The initial conditions for `new_a` and `new_b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`new_a` is the largest multiple of `candidate` that is less than or equal to `a + candidate - 1`, `a` and `candidate` remain unchanged, `new_b` is the largest multiple of `candidate` that is less than or equal to `b + candidate - 1`, `current_lcm` is assigned the value of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`**
