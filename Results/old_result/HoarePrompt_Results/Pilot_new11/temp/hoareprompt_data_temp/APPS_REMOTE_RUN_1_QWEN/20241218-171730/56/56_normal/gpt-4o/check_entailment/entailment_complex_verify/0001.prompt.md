You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Jamie is preparing a Codeforces round. He has got an idea for a problem, but does not know how to solve it. Help him write a solution to the following problem:

Find k integers such that the sum of two to the power of each number equals to the number n and the largest integer in the answer is as small as possible. As there may be multiple answers, you are asked to output the lexicographically largest one. 

To be more clear, consider all integer sequence with length k (a_1, a_2, ..., a_{k}) with $\sum_{i = 1}^{k} 2^{a_{i}} = n$. Give a value $y = \operatorname{max}_{1 \leq i \leq k} a_{i}$ to each sequence. Among all sequence(s) that have the minimum y value, output the one that is the lexicographically largest.

For definitions of powers and lexicographical order see notes.


-----Input-----

The first line consists of two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5) — the required sum and the length of the sequence.


-----Output-----

Output "No" (without quotes) in a single line if there does not exist such sequence. Otherwise, output "Yes" (without quotes) in the first line, and k numbers separated by space in the second line — the required sequence.

It is guaranteed that the integers in the answer sequence fit the range [ - 10^18, 10^18].


-----Examples-----
Input
23 5

Output
Yes
3 3 2 1 0 

Input
13 2

Output
No

Input
1 2

Output
Yes
-1 -1 



-----Note-----

Sample 1:

2^3 + 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0 = 8 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 23

Answers like (3, 3, 2, 0, 1) or (0, 1, 2, 3, 3) are not lexicographically largest.

Answers like (4, 1, 1, 1, 0) do not have the minimum y value.

Sample 2:

It can be shown there does not exist a sequence with length 2.

Sample 3:

$2^{-1} + 2^{-1} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1$

Powers of 2:

If x > 0, then 2^{x} = 2·2·2·...·2 (x times).

If x = 0, then 2^{x} = 1.

If x < 0, then $2^{x} = \frac{1}{2^{-x}}$.

Lexicographical order:

Given two different sequences of the same length, (a_1, a_2, ... , a_{k}) and (b_1, b_2, ... , b_{k}), the first one is smaller than the second one for the lexicographical order, if and only if a_{i} < b_{i}, for the first i where a_{i} and b_{i} differ.
Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().strip().split()
n = int(data[0])
k = int(data[1])
print(func_1(n, k))

def func_1(n, k):
    if k > n:
        return 'No'
    bits = []
    for i in range(60, -1, -1):
        if n >> i & 1:
            bits.append(i)
    if len(bits) > k:
        return 'No'
    while len(bits) < k:
        smallest = bits.pop()
        bits.append(smallest - 1)
        bits.append(smallest - 1)
    bits.sort(reverse=True)
    return 'Yes\n' + ' '.join(map(str, bits))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to ensure that the output sequence is lexicographically largest when there are multiple valid sequences with the same maximum value. Consider the following test case:

Input:
```
23 5
```

Expected Output:
```
Yes
3 3 2 1 0
```

However, the program outputs:
```
No
```

This is incorrect because there exists a valid sequence (3, 3, 2, 1, 0) that satisfies the conditions. The program incorrectly determines that no valid sequence exists when one does exist. This indicates that the program does not correctly handle the requirement to output the lexicographically largest sequence when there are multiple valid sequences with the same maximum value.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().strip().split()
n = int(data[0])
k = int(data[1])
print(func_1(n, k))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, and k is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5.
def func_1(n, k):
    if (k > n) :
        return 'No'
        #The program returns 'No'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, k is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5, and k is less than or equal to n
    bits = []
    for i in range(60, -1, -1):
        if n >> i & 1:
            bits.append(i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\) and the bits in `bits` list are the positions of the 1-bits in the binary representation of `n` from the most significant bit to the least significant bit where the bit is set, `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\), and `bits` is a list containing the positions of all the 1-bits in the binary representation of `n` from the most significant bit to the least significant bit.
    if (len(bits) > k) :
        return 'No'
        #The program returns 'No'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), and the bits in `bits` list are the positions of the 1-bits in the binary representation of `n` from the most significant bit to the least significant bit where the bit is set, `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\), and `bits` is a list containing the positions of all the 1-bits in the binary representation of `n` from the most significant bit to the least significant bit. The length of `bits` list is less than or equal to `k`.
    while len(bits) < k:
        smallest = bits.pop()
        
        bits.append(smallest - 1)
        
        bits.append(smallest - 1)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), `bits` is the list of positions of the 1-bits in the binary representation of `n` with all the `smallest - 1` values added to it, `smallest` is reduced by the number of iterations the loop has executed, `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k > \text{len}(bits)\)
    bits.sort(reverse=True)
    return 'Yes\n' + ' '.join(map(str, bits))
    #The program returns 'Yes' followed by the bits list converted to a space-separated string of integers
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, both of which are positive integers with the constraints \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\). It processes these inputs to determine if a specific condition is met, and returns one of three possible results:

1. If `k > n`, the function returns 'No'.
2. If the number of 1-bits in the binary representation of `n` (denoted by the length of the `bits` list) is greater than `k`, the function also returns 'No'.
3. Otherwise, the function constructs a list of the positions of the 1-bits in the binary representation of `n` and ensures that this list has exactly `k` elements by adding the value `smallest - 1` multiple times until the list reaches the required length. It then sorts the list in reverse order and returns 'Yes' followed by the sorted list of bit positions as a space-separated string of integers.

Potential edge cases include:
- When `n` is 0, the function will still check if `k` is greater than the number of 1-bits in `n` (which would be 0), and return 'No' if `k > 0`.
- When the number of 1-bits in `n` is already less than or equal to `k`, no modifications are needed, and the function directly returns 'Yes' followed by the sorted list of bit positions.

Missing functionality or potential issues:
- The function does not handle the case where `n` is a power of 2 (i.e., only one bit is set in its binary representation) and `k` is exactly 1. In such cases, the function should still return 'Yes' without modifying the list, but it currently does so after potentially modifying the list.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
