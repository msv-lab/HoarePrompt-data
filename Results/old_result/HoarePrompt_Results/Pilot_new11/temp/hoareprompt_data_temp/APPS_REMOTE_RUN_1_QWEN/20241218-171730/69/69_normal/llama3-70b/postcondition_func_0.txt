The function `func()` takes a sequence of operations (`ops`) as a string and two integer coordinates `(x, y)` as inputs. It calculates the final coordinates `(ux, uy)` after processing the operations and then checks if these new coordinates can be reached from the original coordinates `(x, y)` by performing the same operations. If the new coordinates cannot be reached, the function prints `-1`. Otherwise, it counts the number of invalid operations (those that would not help in reaching the target coordinates) and prints this count.
