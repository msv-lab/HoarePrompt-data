Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if a given directed graph can be made acyclic by removing at most one edge. Here's a breakdown of how the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description:

1. **Graph Representation**: 
   - The program reads the input, constructs a graph using adjacency lists (`defaultdict(list)`), and processes the edges accordingly.

2. **Cycle Detection**:
   - The `has_cycle` function checks if there is a cycle in the graph. It uses a topological sort approach by calculating the in-degrees of all vertices and then performing a breadth-first search (BFS) starting from all nodes with zero in-degree. If the number of nodes processed (topologically sorted) is not equal to the total number of nodes, it indicates the presence of a cycle.

3. **Edge Removal and Cycle Check**:
   - The main function `func_1` first checks if the graph is already acyclic using `has_cycle`. If it is, it immediately returns "YES".
   - If the graph contains a cycle, it attempts to remove each edge one by one and recheck if the graph becomes acyclic. If removing any edge makes the graph acyclic, it returns "YES"; otherwise, it returns "NO".

4. **Handling Valid Inputs**:
   - The program assumes valid inputs, as stated in the prompt, and does not explicitly handle invalid cases like non-list inputs or non-positive integers for the number of vertices and edges.

By following these steps, the program correctly determines whether it is possible to make the graph acyclic by removing at most one edge, adhering to the problem description.
