Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `m` from the input, which is the required number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of some integer `n`.

2. **Function `func_1`**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of a given integer `n`. It correctly implements the formula for counting the number of factors of 5 in the factorial, which determines the number of trailing zeroes. This function works correctly for any non-negative integer `n`.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function aims to find all integers `n` such that the factorial of `n` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes.
   - It uses binary search to efficiently narrow down the range of possible values for `n`.
   - The binary search maintains two pointers, `low` and `high`, to define the current search range.
   - For each midpoint `mid` in the current range, it calls `func_1(mid)` to check the number of trailing zeroes in `mid!`.
   - If `func_1(mid)` is less than `m`, it adjusts the lower bound (`low`) to `mid + 1`.
   - If `func_1(mid)` is greater than `m`, it adjusts the upper bound (`high`) to `mid - 1`.
   - If `func_1(mid)` equals `m`, it performs additional checks to find the exact range of `n` values that satisfy the condition.
   - It then returns the list of integers within this range.

4. **Main Execution Flow**:
   - After reading the input `m`, the program calls `func_2(m)` to get the list of integers `n` that satisfy the condition.
   - If `func_2(m)` returns a non-empty list, it prints the length of the list followed by the list itself.
   - If `func_2(m)` returns an empty list, it prints `0`.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the logic required to find all integers `n` such that the factorial of `n` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes, adhering to the problem description in all cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
