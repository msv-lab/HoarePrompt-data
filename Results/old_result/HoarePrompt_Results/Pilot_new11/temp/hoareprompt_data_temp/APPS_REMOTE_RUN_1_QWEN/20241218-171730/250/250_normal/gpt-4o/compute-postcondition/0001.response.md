The code `marks = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes input from the user, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and then assigns these integers to the list `marks`. The initial values of `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are derived from this input. Since the exact input is not specified, we can only say that `marks` is now a list of integers derived from the input.

Output State: **`n` is the length of `marks`, `l` is the maximum value in `marks`, `x` is its original value, `y` is its original value, and `marks` is a list of integers derived from the input.**
