The function `func` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `x`, `y`. The constraints are as follows:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 100\).
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\).
- `x` and `y` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq x \leq n\) and \(1 \leq y \leq m\).

Based on the given output cases, the function does not return any explicit value but rather seems to perform some operation or validation. However, since no specific return values or conditions for returning values are mentioned, we can only describe the parameters accepted by the function.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept the parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` under the specified constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y`, where `n` and `m` are positive integers between 1 and 100, `k` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\), and `x` and `y` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq x \leq n\) and \(1 \leq y \leq m\).**
