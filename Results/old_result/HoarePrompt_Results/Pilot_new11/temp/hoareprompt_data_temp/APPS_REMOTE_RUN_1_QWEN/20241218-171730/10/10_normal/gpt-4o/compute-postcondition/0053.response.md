`right_count[i]` is updated by incrementing its current value by 1. Given that `i` is 0, `right_count[0]` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[2]`, `y1_j` is the second element of `sofas[2]`, `x2_j` is the third element of `sofas[2]`, `y2_j` is the fourth element of `sofas[2]`, `top_count[0]` is unchanged, `right_count[0]` is incremented by 1.**
