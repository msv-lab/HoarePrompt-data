Output State: **`sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, `i` is `d-1`, `j` ranges from 0 to `d-1`, `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[j]`, `y1_j` is the second element of `sofas[j]`, `x2_j` is the third element of `sofas[j]`, and `y2_j` is the fourth element of `sofas[j]`; for each `j` from 0 to `d-1`:
- If `i != j`, then `right_count[i]` is incremented if `x1 < x1_j` and `x2 < x1_j`.
- `left_count[i]` is incremented if `x1 > x2_j` and `x2 > x2_j`.
- `bottom_count[i]` is incremented if `y1 < y1_j` and `y2 < y1_j`.
- `top_count[i]` is incremented if `y1 > y2_j` and `y2 > y2_j`.

Additionally, if the loop did not execute at all (i.e., `d` is 0), then `sofas` is an empty list, `i` is 0, and `right_count`, `left_count`, `bottom_count`, and `top_count` are all empty lists or zero depending on their context (e.g., possibly `[0]` if they are initialized as such).
