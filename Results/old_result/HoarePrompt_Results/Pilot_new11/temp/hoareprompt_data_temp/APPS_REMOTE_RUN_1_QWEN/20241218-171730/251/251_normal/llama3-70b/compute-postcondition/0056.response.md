The function `func` accepts a parameter which is a list of tuples. Each tuple in the list contains two positive integers representing the radius and height of a simple cake. The length of the list is `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000), and for each tuple `(r_i, h_i)`, 1 ≤ r_i, h_i ≤ 10 000. 

The output of the function depends on the specific implementation, but based on the provided constraints and relationships, we can describe the return value as follows:

- Case_1: The function returns a list of volumes of the cakes. Each volume is calculated as π * r_i^2 * h_i.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two positive integers representing the radius and height of a simple cake, and return a list of volumes of the cakes.
