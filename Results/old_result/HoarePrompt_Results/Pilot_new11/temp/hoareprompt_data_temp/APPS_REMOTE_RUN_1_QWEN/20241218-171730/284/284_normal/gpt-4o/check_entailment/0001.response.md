Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to meet the requirements of the problem description. It iterates through values of `m` from 1 to 1000 and checks if `n * m + 1` is a prime number using the `func_1` function. If a non-prime number is found, it prints the corresponding `m` and breaks the loop. Given the constraints and the guarantee that an answer exists, the program will always find and print a valid `m` for any input `n` within the specified range. Therefore, the program correctly finds a counterexample for PolandBall's hypothesis for any given `n`.
