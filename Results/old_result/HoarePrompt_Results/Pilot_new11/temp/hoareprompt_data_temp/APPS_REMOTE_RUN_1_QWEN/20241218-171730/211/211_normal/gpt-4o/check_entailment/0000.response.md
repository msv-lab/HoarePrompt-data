Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the array can be split into multiple segments such that each segment's sum is non-zero. For example, consider the input:

```
8
9 -12 3 4 -4 -10 7 3
```

The program incorrectly outputs:

```
YES
2
1 2
3 8
```

However, the correct output should be:

```
YES
2
1 2
3 8
```

But the program logic only considers breaking the array into two parts if the first element is non-zero and does not check for other valid splits. For instance, another valid split could be:

```
YES
2
1 3
4 8
```

This split ensures each subarray has a non-zero sum. Therefore, the program does not cover all potential cases where the array can be split into multiple segments with non-zero sums.
