Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the given problem. Here’s why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads an integer \( n \) from the standard input and passes it to the function `func_1`.
   - The input \( n \) is within the specified range (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9), and the program does not need to handle invalid inputs as per the assumption.

2. **Function Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` aims to count the number of ways to split the stick into four parts such that a rectangle can be formed but not a square.
   - It iterates over possible values of \( a \) and \( b \) where \( a \) and \( b \) represent two of the four segments.
   - The conditions for forming a rectangle but not a square are:
     - \( 2 * (a + b) == n \): This ensures the sum of the lengths of the other two parts is also \( a + b \), making it possible to form a rectangle.
     - \( a \neq b \): This ensures the sides of the rectangle are different, preventing the formation of a square.
   - The loops ensure \( a \) and \( b \) are positive integers and \( 1 \leq a < b \leq \frac{n}{2} \).

3. **Counting Valid Configurations**:
   - For each valid pair \( (a, b) \), the program increments the `ways` counter.
   - The final value of `ways` is returned, representing the number of valid configurations.

### Why It Meets the Requirements:

- **Rectangle Formation**: By ensuring \( 2 * (a + b) == n \), the program guarantees that the four parts can form a rectangle.
- **Non-Square Condition**: By ensuring \( a \neq b \), the program prevents the formation of a square.
- **All Possible Configurations**: The nested loops iterate over all possible values of \( a \) and \( b \) that satisfy the conditions, covering all valid configurations.

Thus, the program correctly implements the logic required by the problem statement and meets all the requirements specified. Therefore, the program is correct, and the answer is **True**.
