Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the white pixels form a disconnected shape, meaning they do not form a single continuous boundary. For example, consider the following input:

```
5 6
......
.w.....
.w.....
......
......
```

In this case, the white pixels form two separate regions. The program will only consider the bounding box of the top-left region and ignore the bottom region, which leads to an incorrect output. Specifically, the program will output:

```
......
+w+...
+.+...
++++++
++++++
```

However, the correct output should include both regions:

```
......
+w+...
+w+...
++++++
++++++
```

Therefore, the program fails to handle this case correctly, making it incorrect.
