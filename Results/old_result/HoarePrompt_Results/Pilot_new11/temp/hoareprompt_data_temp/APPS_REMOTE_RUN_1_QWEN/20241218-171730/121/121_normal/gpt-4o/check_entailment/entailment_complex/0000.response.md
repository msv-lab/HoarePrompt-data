Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the given problem. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program meets the problem description:

1. **Input Processing**:
   - The program reads the input correctly, splitting the first line into an integer `n` and the second line into a string `s`.
   - The program checks if `n` is divisible by 4 (`n % 4 == 0`). If not, it immediately prints `==='`, which matches the problem description.

2. **Count Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the target count (`n // 4`) and initializes a dictionary to keep track of the counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.
   - It iterates through the string `s` and updates the counts for each character. If a '?' is encountered, it does not increment the count.

3. **Validation**:
   - The program then checks if any character count in the dictionary exceeds the target count. If so, it prints `==='` and exits, adhering to the problem description.

4. **Decoding**:
   - If the validation passes, the program proceeds to decode the string by replacing '?' characters with the appropriate nucleotide. It ensures that the count of the chosen nucleotide is less than or equal to the target count and increments the count accordingly.
   - The program then prints the resulting string.

Given these steps, the program handles all cases as specified in the problem description:
- It checks the basic condition of `n % 4 == 0`.
- It validates the presence of each nucleotide count being within the allowed limit.
- It decodes the string by replacing '?' with the appropriate nucleotide while maintaining the balance of nucleotides.

Thus, the program always follows the problem description, ensuring it meets all required conditions and produces the correct output.
