The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `ticket`. `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `ticket` is a string consisting of `n` digits where each digit is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive.

The function has four possible return values:
- Case_1: The program returns 'YES'
- Case_2: The program returns 'YES'
- Case_3: The program returns 'YES'
- Case_4: The program returns 'NO'

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` and a string `ticket`, and return 'YES' in three cases and 'NO' in one case.
