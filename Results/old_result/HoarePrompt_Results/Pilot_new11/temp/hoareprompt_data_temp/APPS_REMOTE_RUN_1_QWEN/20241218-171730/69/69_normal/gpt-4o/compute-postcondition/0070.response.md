`current_x` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `i` is 1, and the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `current_x` is `current_x` - 1, `current_y` is adjusted based on `operations[0]`, `position_map` includes {(0, 0): -1, (new_current_x, new_current_y): 1}, `target_pos` is `(new_current_x + dx, new_current_y + dy)`**
