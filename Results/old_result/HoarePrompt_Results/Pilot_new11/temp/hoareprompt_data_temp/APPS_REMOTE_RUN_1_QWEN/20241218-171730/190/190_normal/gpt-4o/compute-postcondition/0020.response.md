The given code updates the `current_cost` by adding the expression `t - 1 - length` to it. Given the initial conditions and the value of `t` being 1, let's analyze the impact on the variables.

- `t` remains 1.
- `current_cost` is updated based on the new `length`, which is the next element in the list `a`. 

Since `t` is 1, the expression simplifies to:
\[ \text{current\_cost} += 1 - 1 - \text{length} = -\text{length} \]

If the new `length` is the next element in the list `a`, then the new value of `current_cost` will be the previous value of `current_cost` minus the new `length`.

Let's denote the new `length` as `new_length`, which is the next element in the list `a`.

Therefore, the new value of `current_cost` will be:
\[ \text{current\_cost} = \text{previous\_current\_cost} - \text{new\_length} \]

Since the exact value of `previous_current_cost` is not specified, we can only express it in terms of the previous state.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `current_cost` is `previous_current_cost - new_length`**
