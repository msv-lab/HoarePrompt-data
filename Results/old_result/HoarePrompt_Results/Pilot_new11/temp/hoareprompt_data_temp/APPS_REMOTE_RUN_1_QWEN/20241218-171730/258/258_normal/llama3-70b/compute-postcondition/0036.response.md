The `times.sort()` line sorts the list `times`. Given that `times` is the return value of `func_2(x, y, x, y)` and `x` is -998, `y` is -997, we need to consider what `func_2(-998, -997, -998, -997)` returns. However, since the function definition is not provided, we cannot determine the exact elements of `times`. But we know that sorting will reorder these elements in ascending order.

Since the original values of `x` and `y` are -998 and -997 respectively, and they are used twice each as arguments to `func_2`, we can infer that `times` likely contains two occurrences of -998 and two occurrences of -997. After sorting, the elements will be in ascending order.

Thus, the sorted `times` will be: [-998, -998, -997, -997].

Given that `ans` was previously `times[K - 1]`, after sorting, `ans` will be the K-1th element of the sorted list `times`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`x` is -998, `y` is -997, `times` is [-998, -998, -997, -997], `ans` is the K-1th element of [-998, -998, -997, -997]**
