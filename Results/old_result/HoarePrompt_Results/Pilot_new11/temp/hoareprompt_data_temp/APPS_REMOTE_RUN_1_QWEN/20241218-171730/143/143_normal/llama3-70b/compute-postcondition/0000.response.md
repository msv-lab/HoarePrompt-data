The code reads two integers from input and assigns them to `n` and `L`. The values of `c` and its elements are not affected by this code. Therefore, the updated values of `n` and `L` are the results of the input, and the list `c` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`c` is a list of n integers where each c_i represents the cost of a bottle of type i, and 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9; `n` is an input integer between 1 and 30; `L` is an input integer between 1 and 10^9**
