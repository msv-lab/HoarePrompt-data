Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 1000\) and \(num \geq 2\).
   - `i` is `int(num)`.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 2` to `i = int(num ** 0.5) + 1`.

3. **Loop Execution**: 
   - If `num` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `num % i == 0`), the function returns `False` and the loop terminates without further iterations.
   - If `num` is not divisible by `i`, the loop continues to the next value of `i`.

4. **Current Iteration**:
   - We need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.
   - The current value of `i` is the last value checked before the end of the previous iteration.
   - Since we don't know if the loop returned `False` or continued, we assume it continued to the next value of `i`.

5. **Next Value of `i`**:
   - The next value of `i` would be `i + 1`.
   - Therefore, the new value of `i` at the start of the next iteration will be `i + 1`.

6. **State Adjustment**:
   - The variable `num` remains unchanged unless the function returns `False` prematurely. Since we are continuing the loop, `num` stays the same.
   - The variable `i` is incremented by 1.

**Final State**:
- `num` remains the same as the previous iteration.
- `i` is updated to `i + 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 1000\) and \(num \geq 2\).
- `i` is `int(num)`.

The state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 1000\) and \(num \geq 2\).
- `i` is updated to `i + 1`.

So, the final state is:
State: **`num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 1000\) and \(num \geq 2\), and `i` is `int(num) + 1`**.
