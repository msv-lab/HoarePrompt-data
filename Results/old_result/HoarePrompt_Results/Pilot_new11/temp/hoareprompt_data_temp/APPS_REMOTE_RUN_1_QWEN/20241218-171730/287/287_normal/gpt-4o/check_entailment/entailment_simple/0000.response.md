Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem asks for the number of different weights of splits of a given integer \( n \). However, the program implemented calculates the number of distinct divisors of \( n \).

To elaborate further:
- The problem definition specifies that a split of \( n \) is a nonincreasing sequence of positive integers that sum up to \( n \).
- The weight of a split is defined as the number of elements in the split that are equal to the first element.
- The goal is to determine the number of different weights that can be achieved by the splits of \( n \).

The function `func_1` provided counts the number of distinct divisors of \( n \). While this is mathematically related (as each divisor \( d \) of \( n \) can contribute to a split with a weight of \( d \)), it does not fully capture the required logic to determine the different weights of splits of \( n \).

Hereâ€™s a more appropriate approach to solve the problem:
1. Identify the range of possible weights: The smallest weight is 1 (since every number is a split of itself with weight 1).
2. Determine the maximum possible weight: This would be the largest integer \( k \) such that \( k \cdot k \leq n \), because if \( k \) were larger, the sum would exceed \( n \).

Given these observations, the correct solution should generate all possible weights from 1 to the largest integer \( k \) such that \( k \cdot k \leq n \), and count the unique weights. The provided code does not perform this logic correctly.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not compute the number of different weights of splits of \( n \) as specified in the problem description.
