Output State: **`graph` must have at least one key remaining, `in_degree` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex and the corresponding value is the total number of incoming edges for that vertex incremented by the number of times the vertex was iterated over, `u` is a vertex such that `graph[u]` is not empty and contains at least one vertex.**
