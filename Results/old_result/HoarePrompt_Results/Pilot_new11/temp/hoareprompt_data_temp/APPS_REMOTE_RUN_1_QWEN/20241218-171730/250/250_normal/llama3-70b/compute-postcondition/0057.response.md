The code `need_y = True` assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `need_y`. The values of the other variables (`i`, `n`, `j`, and `need_x`) are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 6, `n` is 10, `j` is 11, `need_x` remains unchanged, and `need_y` is `True`.

Output State: **`i` is 6, `n` is 10, `j` is 11, `need_x` remains unchanged, `need_y` is `True`**
