`subtasks_solved` is increased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`. Given the initial state, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is equal to `(r - m * s) // subtask_time`. Therefore, `subtasks_solved` becomes `m + (r - m * s) // subtask_time`. The values of `t`, `remaining_time`, and `max_subtasks_for_this_task` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must have at least one element, `remaining_time` is `r - m * s`, `subtasks_solved` is `m + (r - m * s) // subtask_time`, and `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `(r - m * s) // subtask_time`**
