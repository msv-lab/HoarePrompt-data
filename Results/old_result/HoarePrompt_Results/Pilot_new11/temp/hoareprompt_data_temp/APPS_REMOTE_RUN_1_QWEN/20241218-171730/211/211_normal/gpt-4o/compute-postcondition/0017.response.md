The code `print('YES')` simply prints the string 'YES' to the console. This does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `total_sum`, or `i`. The console output mentioned in the initial state is not altered by this print statement.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 1, and the console outputs 'YES' and '1' followed by 2**
