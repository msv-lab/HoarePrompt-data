The code updates the value of `max_erase` to be the maximum between its current value and `j - i - 1`. Given the initial state where `i` is 1 and `j` is 4, the value of `j - i - 1` is `4 - 1 - 1 = 2`.

Since `max_erase` can be either 1 or its previous value (at most 2), and the new value `j - i - 1` is 2, `max_erase` will be updated to 2.

The output state is:
Output State: **`a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, `max_erase` is 2, `n` must still be greater than 0.**
