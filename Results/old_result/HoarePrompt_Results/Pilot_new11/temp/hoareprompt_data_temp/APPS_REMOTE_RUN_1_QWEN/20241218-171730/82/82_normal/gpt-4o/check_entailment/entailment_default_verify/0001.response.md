Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment stated that the program's correctness was **False** due to an incorrect handling of the case where \(a\) and \(b\) are equal. However, after reviewing the provided code and the output hints, it appears that the issue has been addressed. The function now checks if \(a\) equals \(b\) and returns 0 in that case, which aligns with the problem description. Therefore, the program now correctly handles all cases as described, including the edge case where \(a\) and \(b\) are equal. The output hints also confirm that the function properly handles this scenario and minimizes the LCM as required. Thus, the original assessment can be revised to reflect the corrected program.
