The function `func` accepts two parameters: `h` and `n`. 

- `h` is an integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 50.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^h.

Case_1: `n` is an integer and `h` is an integer. If `n` is outside the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^h, the function returns an error message indicating that `n` is out of range.
Case_2: `n` is an integer and `h` is an integer. If `n` is within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^h, the function does not specify a return value, so no specific return value is mentioned for this case.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two parameters `h` and `n`, where `h` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, and `n` is an integer between 1 and 2^h inclusive. If `n` is out of range, the function returns an error message. If `n` is within the specified range, the function does not return any specific value.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `h` and `n`, where `h` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, and `n` is an integer between 1 and 2^h inclusive. If `n` is out of range, the function returns an error message. If `n` is within the specified range, the function does not return any specific value.**
