The code snippet `substr = s[i:j]` assigns the substring of `s` from index `i` to index `j - 1` to the variable `substr`. According to the initial state, `j` is defined as `j_prev + 2`. This means that `substr` will now hold the substring from `i` to `j - 1`, where `j = j_prev + 2`.

Let's update the variables accordingly:

- `i` remains unchanged.
- `s` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `max_len` remains unchanged since no calculation involving `max_len` has been done.
- `j` is updated to `j_prev + 2`.
- `substr` is updated to the substring of `s` from index `i` to index `j - 1`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`i` is a valid starting index such that `i + 1` is within bounds of `s`; `s` is a non-empty string; `n` is greater than `i + 1`; `max_len` is the maximum of its current value and the length of `substr` (where `substr` is the substring of `s` from index `i` to index `j - 1` and is not equal to its reverse); `j` is `j_prev + 2`; `substr` is the substring of `s` from index `i` to index `j - 1`.**
