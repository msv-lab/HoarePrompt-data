Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The code follows the problem description for every potential case. Let's break down the analysis:

1. **Input Handling**: The code reads input correctly and handles it within the specified constraints (both \(a\) and \(b\) are between 1 and \(10^9\)).

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - When \(a = b\), the code correctly returns 0.
   - When \(a \neq b\), the code iterates through possible values of \(k\) up to the square root of the absolute difference between \(a\) and \(b\). For each \(k\), it calculates the adjusted values of \(a\) and \(b\) to the nearest multiples of \(k\) and finds their least common multiple (LCM).

3. **Function `func_1` (GCD Calculation)**:
   - This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm. It handles the case where one of the inputs is 0 and correctly finds the GCD for positive integers.

4. **Function `func_2` (LCM Calculation)**:
   - This function correctly computes the least common multiple (LCM) using the formula \(\text{LCM}(x, y) = \frac{x \cdot y}{\text{GCD}(x, y)}\). Although it doesn't explicitly handle the case where GCD is 0, this case is not relevant here because the LCM calculation will still produce the correct result in valid cases.

5. **Function `func_3` (Finding Minimum K)**:
   - The function iterates through possible values of \(k\) and checks if the adjusted values of \(a\) and \(b\) lead to a smaller LCM. If it finds a smaller LCM, it updates the minimum LCM and the corresponding \(k\).
   - The function correctly handles the case where no valid \(k\) is found that reduces the LCM, returning 0 in such cases.

Given the problem description and the provided code and annotations, the code correctly implements the required functionality for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness of the code is **True**.
