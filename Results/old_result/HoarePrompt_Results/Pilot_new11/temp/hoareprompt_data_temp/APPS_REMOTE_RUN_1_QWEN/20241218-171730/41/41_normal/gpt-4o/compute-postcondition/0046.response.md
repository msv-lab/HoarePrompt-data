The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It processes input data where the input consists of n lines, with n being an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000. Each line contains two space-separated integers \(a_{i}\) and \(b_{i}\) such that 1 ≤ \(a_{i}\), \(b_{i}\) ≤ 4126. The lines are ordered such that the first line represents the top participant and the last line represents the bottom participant of the standings.

Based on the given output cases, the function does not return a specific value directly from its body but rather processes the input data according to some unspecified logic (which is not detailed in the provided information).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process input data consisting of n lines, each containing two space-separated integers \(a_{i}\) and \(b_{i}\), and handle them according to an unspecified logic.
