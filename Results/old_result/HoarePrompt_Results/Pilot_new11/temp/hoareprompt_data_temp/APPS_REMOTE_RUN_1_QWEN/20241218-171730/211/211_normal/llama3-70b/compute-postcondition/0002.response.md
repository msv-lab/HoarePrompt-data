The code initializes a list called `prefix_sum` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. This does not affect the values of `n` or the list `a`. Therefore, the output state includes the updated `prefix_sum` list and retains the initial state of `n` and `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input where \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `a` is a list of integers based on the input, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0, the initial state of the array `A` remains unchanged.**
