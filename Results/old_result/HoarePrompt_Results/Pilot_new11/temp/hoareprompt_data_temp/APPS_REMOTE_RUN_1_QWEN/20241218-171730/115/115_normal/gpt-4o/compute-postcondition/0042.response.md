Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is at least 2.
   - `i` is `n - 2`.
   - `m` is at least 2.
   - `j` is incremented by 1.
   - If \( A[i][j] \), \( A[i][j + 1] \), \( A[i + 1][j] \), and \( A[i + 1][j + 1] \) are all equal to 1, then \( B[i][j] \), \( B[i][j + 1] \), \( B[i + 1][j] \), and \( B[i + 1][j + 1] \) are all set to 1, and `operations` contains the tuple \((n - 1, j + 1)\).
   - Otherwise, \( B[i][j] \), \( B[i][j + 1] \), \( B[i + 1][j] \), and \( B[i + 1][j + 1] \) remain unchanged and `operations` remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs over `range(m - 1)`, meaning it iterates from `0` to `m - 2`.

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, we need to determine the new value of `j` for the next iteration.
   - If `j` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then for the next iteration, `j` will be `k + 1`.

4. **Checking the Loop Condition:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `m - 1`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - If `j` was incremented from `n - 2` to `n - 1` (as per the initial state), then for the loop to continue, `j` must be `n - 1` and less than `m - 1`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `n` is at least 2.
- `i` is `n - 2`.
- `m` is at least 2.
- `j` is `n - 1`.
- If the conditions inside the loop were met for the previous iteration, then `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` are all set to 1, and `operations` contains the tuple \((n - 1, j + 1)\).
- Otherwise, `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` remain unchanged and `operations` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state for the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is `n - 2`, `m` is at least 2, `j` is `n - 1`**.
