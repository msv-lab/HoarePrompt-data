Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `i` is \( n - 1 \), `m` is at least 2, and `j` is \( m - 1 \). If `A[i][j] == 1` and `A[i][j + 1] == 1` and `A[i + 1][j] == 1` and `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1`, then `B[i][j]` is `1`, `B[i][j + 1]` is `1`, `B[i + 1][j]` is `1`, `B[i + 1][j + 1]` is `1`, and `operations` is a list containing the element `(n, m)`. Otherwise, the state of `B` and `operations` remains unchanged.***
