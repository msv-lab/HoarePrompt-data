Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if two sliding puzzles can reach the same configuration. Specifically, the `func_1` function only returns the first two characters of the input string, which is not sufficient to represent the entire state of the puzzle. Instead, it should return the initial configuration of the puzzle as a single string.

Additionally, the `func_2` function does not compare the reachable states of Bessie's and Elsie's puzzles. It generates all reachable states from a single puzzle and checks if they overlap. However, the problem requires checking if the two puzzles can reach the same configuration independently. The current implementation does not account for this requirement.

To illustrate, consider the following example:

**Input:**
```
AB
XC
XA
BC
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

However, the provided code would incorrectly output "NO" because it does not compare the reachable states of both puzzles.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
