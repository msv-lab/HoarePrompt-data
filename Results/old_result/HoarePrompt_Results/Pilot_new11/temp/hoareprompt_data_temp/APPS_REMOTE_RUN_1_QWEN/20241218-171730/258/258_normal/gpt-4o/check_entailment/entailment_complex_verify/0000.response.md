Final: **False**

Reasoning:
Based on the annotated version of the code and the original assessment, the program does not correctly solve the problem. The original assessment correctly points out that the `func_1` function has logical flaws in calculating the new position `(mx, my)` for the heat source and counting the number of pieces that can be cooked within time `T`. Specifically, the condition `if d * d2 > d2:` is incorrect and does not ensure the heat source is optimally placed to cook the maximum number of pieces of meat. 

The annotations provide a clear breakdown of the state of the program at different points, confirming that the logic used to determine the optimal heat source position is flawed. While the `func_2` function correctly implements a binary search, it relies on the incorrect logic in `func_1`, leading to an incorrect overall solution.

Therefore, despite the binary search being implemented correctly, the core issue with `func_1` ensures that the program cannot provide the correct solution to the problem as described. Hence, the original assessment remains accurate.
