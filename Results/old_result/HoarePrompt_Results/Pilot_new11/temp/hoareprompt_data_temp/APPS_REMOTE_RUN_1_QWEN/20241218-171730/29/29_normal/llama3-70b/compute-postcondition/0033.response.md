According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `script`. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more lines in `script` to iterate over.

At the end of the last iteration, the variable `line` was printed. This means that the loop had at least one line to iterate over. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more line in `script`.

Therefore, we need to ensure that there is at least one more line left in `script` to be iterated over in the next iteration. The current state does not provide information about the specific content of `script`, but it confirms that there is at least one line available.

State: **`line` is printed, `script` must have at least two lines**
