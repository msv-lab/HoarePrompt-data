Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where there are no example tests. In such a scenario, the program will incorrectly move regular tests to the beginning, which violates the requirement that examples should come first, followed by regular tests. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
11 0
12 0
13 0
```

The program would output:
```
3
move 11 1
move 12 2
move 13 3
```

This is incorrect because it does not place any files as examples (since there are no examples). The correct output should be:
```
0
```

Since the program fails to handle the case where there are no example tests, it is not fully correct according to the problem description.
