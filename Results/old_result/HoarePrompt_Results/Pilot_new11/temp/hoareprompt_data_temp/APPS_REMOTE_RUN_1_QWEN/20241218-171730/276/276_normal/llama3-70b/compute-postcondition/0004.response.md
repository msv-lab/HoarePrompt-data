Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `s` is a non-empty string.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `c` is the first character of the reversed string `s`.
   - `q` is approximately 1.618033988749895.
   - `decimal` is `int(s[-1])`.

2. **Loop Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over the characters of the reversed string `s` using `enumerate()`.
   - `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration.
   - `c` is the character at the current index `i` in the reversed string.

3. **Current Values:**
   - `i` is currently 0.
   - `c` is the first character of the reversed string `s`.

4. **Next Iteration Requirements:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented from 0 to 1.
   - Therefore, `i` should be 1 at the start of the next iteration.
   - `c` should be the second character of the reversed string `s`.

5. **Other Variables:**
   - `s` remains unchanged.
   - `q` remains unchanged (approximately 1.618033988749895).
   - `decimal` remains unchanged (it is based on the last character of the original string `s`, which does not change during the loop).

Based on the above analysis, we can update the states as follows:

**State: `s` is a non-empty string, `i` is 1, `c` is the second character of the reversed string `s`, `q` is approximately 1.618033988749895, `decimal` is `int(s[-1])`**
