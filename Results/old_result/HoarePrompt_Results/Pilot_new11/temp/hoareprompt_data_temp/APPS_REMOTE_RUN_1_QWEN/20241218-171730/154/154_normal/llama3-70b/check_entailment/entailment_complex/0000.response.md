Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Reading and Constraints Handling**: The program reads the input values `n`, `k`, and `M` as well as the list `t` of subtask times. While the annotations do not explicitly handle invalid inputs, we are assuming that the inputs are valid according to the problem constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 45, 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, and 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9).

2. **Dynamic Programming Table Initialization**: The program initializes a 2D list `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum number of subtasks that can be completed using up to `j` minutes from the first `i` subtasks. This matches the problem requirement to calculate the maximum number of points Polycarp can earn within the given time `M`.

3. **DP Table Filling**: The nested loops correctly populate the `dp` table by considering whether to include the current subtask or skip it. The transition `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j - 1], dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1)` ensures that the maximum number of subtasks is calculated while respecting the time constraint `j`.

4. **Final Calculation**: After populating the `dp` table, the program sums the values in the last row (`dp[k][M]`) and adds the count of indices `i` where `dp[i][M]` equals `i`. This calculation correctly accounts for the additional point gained for completing a full task.

5. **Output**: The program prints the result, which is the total number of points Polycarp can earn within the given time `M`.

Given the assumptions about valid inputs and the detailed implementation matching the problem requirements, the program is correct and follows the problem description accurately.
