Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the problem description. Specifically, the logic for selecting which skewers to turn is flawed. The code increments `i` by \(2 \cdot k + 1\) starting from 1, which means it skips many skewers and does not ensure that all skewers will eventually be turned over. For example, consider the following cases:

1. **Case 1: \(n = 5, k = 1\)**

   According to the problem, turning skewer 1 would turn over skewers 1, 2, and 3. Turning skewer 4 would turn over skewers 3, 4, and 5. However, the provided code would only select skewers 1 and 4, missing skewers 2 and 5.

2. **Case 2: \(n = 6, k = 1\)**

   The problem states that turning skewer 3 would turn over skewers 2, 3, and 4. The code would incorrectly select skewers 1 and 6, which does not turn over all skewers.

To fix this, the code needs to iteratively select skewers such that each skewer is turned over exactly once. A correct approach would involve using a more dynamic method to ensure all skewers are covered.
