The line `min_cost = cost` assigns the current value of `cost` to `min_cost`. This does not change the value of `cost`, but it does create a new variable `min_cost` with the value of `cost`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is `mid - 2`, `cost` is the sum of `min(abs(x - (mid - 2)), abs(x - (mid - 1)))` for each `x` in `sticks`, and `min_cost` is the value of `cost`.**
