Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' or 'S'.
- `golden` is a list of integers containing the indices of all characters in `s` that are equal to 'G'.
- `max_beauty` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`.
- `curr_beauty` is 0.
- `left` is 2.
- `right` must be greater than 1 and `s[right]` is not 'G'.

### Loop Condition:
The loop condition is:
```python
while left < right and s[left] != 'G':
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Condition `left < right`:**
   - This condition ensures that `left` must be less than `right`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `left` is 2, and `right` must be greater than 1. Therefore, `left < right` is true.

2. **Condition `s[left] != 'G'`:**
   - This condition ensures that `s[left]` must not be 'G'.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `s[right]` is not 'G', and since `left < right`, `s[left]` is also not 'G'.

### Next Iteration Requirements:
For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions must still hold true:
1. `left < right` should remain true.
2. `s[left] != 'G'` should remain true.

### Adjusting States:
- Since `left` is currently 2, to keep `left < right`, `right` must be greater than 2.
- To ensure `s[left] != 'G'` remains true, `s[right]` should not be 'G'. However, we already know this is true from the given condition.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes one more time, `right` must be greater than 2.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' or 'S', `golden` is a list of integers containing the indices of all characters in `s` that are equal to 'G', `max_beauty` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is 2, `right` must be greater than 2 and `s[right]` is not 'G'.**
