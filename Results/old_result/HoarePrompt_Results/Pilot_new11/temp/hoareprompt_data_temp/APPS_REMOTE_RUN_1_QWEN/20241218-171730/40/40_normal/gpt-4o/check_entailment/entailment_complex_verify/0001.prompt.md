You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A string is a palindrome if it reads the same from the left to the right and from the right to the left. For example, the strings "kek", "abacaba", "r" and "papicipap" are palindromes, while the strings "abb" and "iq" are not.

A substring $s[l \ldots r]$ ($1 \leq l \leq r \leq |s|$) of a string $s = s_{1}s_{2} \ldots s_{|s|}$ is the string $s_{l}s_{l + 1} \ldots s_{r}$.

Anna does not like palindromes, so she makes her friends call her Ann. She also changes all the words she reads in a similar way. Namely, each word $s$ is changed into its longest substring that is not a palindrome. If all the substrings of $s$ are palindromes, she skips the word at all.

Some time ago Ann read the word $s$. What is the word she changed it into?


-----Input-----

The first line contains a non-empty string $s$ with length at most $50$ characters, containing lowercase English letters only.


-----Output-----

If there is such a substring in $s$ that is not a palindrome, print the maximum length of such a substring. Otherwise print $0$.

Note that there can be multiple longest substrings that are not palindromes, but their length is unique.


-----Examples-----
Input
mew

Output
3

Input
wuffuw

Output
5

Input
qqqqqqqq

Output
0



-----Note-----

"mew" is not a palindrome, so the longest substring of it that is not a palindrome, is the string "mew" itself. Thus, the answer for the first example is $3$.

The string "uffuw" is one of the longest non-palindrome substrings (of length $5$) of the string "wuffuw", so the answer for the second example is $5$.

All substrings of the string "qqqqqqqq" consist of equal characters so they are palindromes. This way, there are no non-palindrome substrings. Thus, the answer for the third example is $0$.
Program:
```
s = input().strip()
if len(s) <= 1:
    print(0)
elif not func_1(s):
    print(len(s))
elif not func_1(s[1:]):
    print(len(s) - 1)
elif not func_1(s[:-1]):
    print(len(s) - 1)
else:
    print(0)

def func_1(s):
    return s == s[::-1]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description:

1. The function `func_1` checks if a string is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse. However, the main logic of the program is flawed because it only checks three specific slices of the input string `s` (i.e., `s[1:]`, `s[:-1]`) instead of checking all possible substrings.

2. The program does not actually generate all possible substrings of `s` to check if they are palindromes. It only checks three specific cases: the whole string, the string without the first character, and the string without the last character.

3. To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to iterate through all possible substrings of `s` and find the longest one that is not a palindrome. The current implementation does not achieve this.

For example, consider the input "aabb":
- The program would check "aabb", "aabb", and "aab".
- None of these checks would correctly identify that "aabb" is not a palindrome, and the program would incorrectly output `0`.

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and is thus incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
s = input().strip()
if len(s) <= 1:
    print(0)
elif not func_1(s):
    print(len(s))
elif not func_1(s[1:]):
    print(len(s) - 1)
elif not func_1(s[:-1]):
    print(len(s) - 1)
else:
    print(0)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string with a length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters.
def func_1(s):
    return s == s[::-1]
    #The program returns True if the string 's' is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward) or False otherwise
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and checks whether it is a palindrome. It returns `True` if the string reads the same backward as forward, and `False` otherwise. The function handles strings of maximum length 50, consisting only of lowercase English letters. The function correctly checks for palindromes by comparing the original string with its reverse (`s[::-1]`). The function does not have any missing logic or edge cases as described in the annotations, and it accurately reflects the intended behavior as stated in the return postconditions.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
