The code initializes `prev_pos` to -1. This does not affect the values of `s`, `vowels`, or `max_jump`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions for these variables.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, and the length of `s` does not exceed 100; `vowels` is a set containing {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}; `max_jump` is 1; `prev_pos` is -1.**
