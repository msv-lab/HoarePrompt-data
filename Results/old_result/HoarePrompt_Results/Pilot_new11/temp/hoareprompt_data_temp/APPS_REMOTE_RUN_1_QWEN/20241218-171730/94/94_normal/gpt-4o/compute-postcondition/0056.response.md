To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

### Given Information:
- The state at the end of the previous iteration is as follows:
  - `queue` is a non-empty list.
  - If `new_state_str` is not in `visited` and `new_row` is either 0 or 1 and `new_col` is either 0 or 1, then `new_state_str` is appended to `queue`.
  - `directions` remains unchanged as `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`.
  - Otherwise, the list `queue` remains unchanged.

### For Loop Analysis:
The for loop iterates over each direction in `directions`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `queue`.
2. **Loop Body**: Inside the loop, the code will process each direction `(dr, dc)` from `directions`.
3. **Condition for Appending to Queue**: 
   - `new_state_str` should not be in `visited`.
   - `new_row` should be either 0 or 1.
   - `new_col` should be either 0 or 1.
4. **Unchanged Conditions**: 
   - `queue` is updated based on the above conditions.
   - `directions` remains unchanged.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute again, `queue` must contain at least one element that meets the conditions inside the loop. Therefore, the key state that needs to be maintained is the presence of an eligible `new_state_str` in `queue` for the next iteration.

### Adjusted States:
- `queue` must still be a non-empty list.
- The specific elements in `queue` must meet the conditions: `new_state_str` not in `visited`, and `new_row` and `new_col` being either 0 or 1.

### Final Answer:
State: **`queue` is a non-empty list containing elements where `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, and `new_row` and `new_col` are either 0 or 1. `directions` remains unchanged as [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]**.
