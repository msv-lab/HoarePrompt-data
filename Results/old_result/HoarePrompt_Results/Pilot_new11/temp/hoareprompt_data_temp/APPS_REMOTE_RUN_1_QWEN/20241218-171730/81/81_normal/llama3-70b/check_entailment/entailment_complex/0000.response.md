Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the case when either `a` or `b` is 0, which is a valid input according to the problem description. The function `func_1` and `func_2` will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` when either `a` or `b` is 0 because the GCD of any number and 0 is the number itself, leading to a division by zero when calculating `a * b // func_1(a, b)`. For example, if `l = 1`, `r = 1`, `x = 0`, and `y = 0`, the code will raise an error because the GCD of 1 and 0 is 1, and `1 * 1 // 1` is calculated, but this case is not handled in the code. Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
