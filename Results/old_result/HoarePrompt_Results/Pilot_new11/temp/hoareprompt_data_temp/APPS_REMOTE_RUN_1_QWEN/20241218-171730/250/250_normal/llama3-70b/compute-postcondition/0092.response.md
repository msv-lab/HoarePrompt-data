To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze how the variables change within the loop and ensure the loop condition remains valid.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element in the `marks` list using `i`.
2. **Initial State**:
   - `additional_marks` is a non-empty list containing elements that satisfy \(i + j \leq l\) and are not already present in `marks`.
   - `i` is the next element in the `marks` list.

3. **Changes During Loop Execution**:
   - Each iteration processes an element from `marks` and potentially adds new elements to `additional_marks`.
   - After processing an element, `i` moves to the next element in the `marks` list.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, there must be another element in `marks` after the current `i`.

5. **State Adjustments**:
   - `i` will be the next element in the `marks` list after the current `i`.
   - `additional_marks` remains the same unless the loop body modifies it (which isn't specified here).

### Final State:

- `additional_marks` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration because no modification is specified in the problem statement.
- `i` will be the next element in the `marks` list after the current `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`additional_marks` is a non-empty list containing elements that satisfy \(i + j \leq l\) and are not already present in `marks`, `i` is the next element in the `marks` list.**
