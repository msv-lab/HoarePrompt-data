The code `left = j` assigns the value of `j` to the variable `left`. Based on the initial state, `j` is `j + 1`, so `left` is now `j + 1`. All other variables (`screen`, `i`, `top`, `right`, `bottom`) remain unchanged according to the given conditions.

Output State: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is `j + 1`, `top` is `i`, `right` is `j + 1` if `j + 1 > right`, `bottom` is `i`, and `left` is `j + 1`.**
