Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-empty list of integers, `i` is the first element of `a`, `n` is an even number between 2 and 100 inclusive, `total` is undefined, and `d` is a dictionary. If `i` is already a key in `d`, the value of `i` in `d` is incremented by 1. If `i` is not a key in `d`, `d` is updated to contain the key-value pair `{i: 1}`.***
