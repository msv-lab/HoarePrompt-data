Postcondition: **`regulars` has at least one element, `i` is `(initial i) + 1`, `target` is `len(examples) + (initial i) + 2`, `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 1`, and `regulars[i]` is not equal to `str(target)`, since the if condition is true, `moves` contains the string 'move regulars[(initial i) + 1] temp_counter'**
