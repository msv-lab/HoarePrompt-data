The function `func()` takes no explicit parameters but reads three inputs from the user: an integer `n` and two lists of integers `x` and `y` of length `n`. It first checks if the sums of the elements in `x` and `y` are equal. If they are not equal, it prints 'No'. If they are equal, it sorts both `x` and `y` and then checks if the sorted lists are identical. If the sorted lists are identical, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not return anything but modifies and prints the results based on the comparison of the lists and their sums. Potential edge cases include when `n` is less than 1 or greater than 50, which is not checked within the function, and the possibility of empty lists or non-integer inputs, which could cause issues with the input parsing.
