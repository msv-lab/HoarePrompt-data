Postcondition: **`dx` is `x - ux`, `dy` is `y - uy`, `ops` is a non-empty string, `ux` is the final x-coordinate after processing all operations in `ops`, `uy` is the final y-coordinate after processing all operations in `ops`, `res` is `0`, `op` is the current operation in `ops`, and the index of the current operation in `ops` is 0, where `op` is not 'U', and `dy` is greater than or equal to 0**
