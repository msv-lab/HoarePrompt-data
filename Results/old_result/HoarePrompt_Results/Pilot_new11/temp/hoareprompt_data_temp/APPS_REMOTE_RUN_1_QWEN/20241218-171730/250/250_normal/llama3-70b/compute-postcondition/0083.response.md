The code appends `i + j` to the `additional_marks` list. Given the initial state, `additional_marks` is a non-empty list containing elements that satisfy \(i + j \leq l\) and are not already present in `marks`, and `i` is the next element in the `marks` list. After executing the code, `additional_marks` will include its current elements plus the new element `i + j`.

Output State: **`additional_marks` is a non-empty list containing its original elements plus `i + j`, and `i` is the next element in the `marks` list.**
