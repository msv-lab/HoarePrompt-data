The code `positions.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `positions`. However, the initial value of `i` is not specified, nor is the initial state of the `positions` list. Given the initial state that `n` must be at least `4 * k + 5`, we know this condition holds true but no changes are made to `n` by the provided code snippet.

Therefore, the only variable that has been updated is `positions`, which now includes the value of `i`.

Output State: **`n` is at least `4 * k + 5`; `positions` contains `i`; `i` is the last value appended to `positions`.**
