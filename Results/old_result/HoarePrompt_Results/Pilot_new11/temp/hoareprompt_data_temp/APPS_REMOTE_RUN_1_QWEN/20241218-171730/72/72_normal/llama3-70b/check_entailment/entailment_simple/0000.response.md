Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the number of questions asked to each pupil, including the maximum, minimum, and the specific count for Sergei. Let's analyze why the program is incorrect:

1. **Order of Asking Pupils:**
   - The problem specifies that the teacher asks pupils in a specific pattern: first the first row, then the second, and so on until the last row, then reverses back. The pattern repeats until \( k \) questions are asked.
   - The current implementation calculates `max_asked` and `min_asked` using the formula \((k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)\) and \(\max(1, max_asked - (n - 1))\), which is overly simplified and does not account for the specific pattern of asking pupils.

2. **Sergei's Count Calculation:**
   - The calculation for `sergei_asked` uses \((k + x - 1) // (2 * n) + ((k + x - 1) % (2 * n) >= n - x + 1)\), which again does not accurately reflect the pattern of asking pupils.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to simulate the pattern of asking pupils and keep track of the count for each pupil. Here is a more accurate approach:

```python
def func():
    n, m, k, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    
    # Initialize counts
    total_rows = 2 * (n - 1) + 1
    max_count = 0
    min_count = float('inf')
    sergei_count = 0
    
    current_row = 1
    current_direction = 1  # 1 for forward, -1 for backward
    
    while k > 0:
        if current_row == x and y <= k:
            sergei_count += 1
        
        # Calculate how many pupils can be asked in the current row
        if current_direction == 1:
            num_pupils = min(m, k)
        else:
            num_pupils = min(m, k)
        
        # Update counts
        for i in range(num_pupils):
            max_count = max(max_count, (k + i) // total_rows + 1)
            min_count = min(min_count, (k + i) // total_rows + 1)
            k -= 1
        
        # Move to the next row
        if current_row < n:
            current_row += 1
        elif current_row > 1:
            current_row -= 1
            current_direction *= -1
        else:
            break
    
    print(max_count, min_count, sergei_count)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Correct Approach:
1. **Initialization:**
   - We initialize the necessary variables to keep track of the counts.
   
2. **Pattern Simulation:**
   - We use a loop to simulate the pattern of asking pupils. We maintain the current row and direction.
   - For each row, we calculate how many pupils can be asked in that row based on the remaining questions (`k`).
   - We update the counts for each pupil being asked.

3. **Sergei's Count:**
   - We check if the current pupil being asked is Sergei and increment his count accordingly.

This approach ensures that we accurately simulate the pattern of asking pupils and compute the required counts for each pupil.
