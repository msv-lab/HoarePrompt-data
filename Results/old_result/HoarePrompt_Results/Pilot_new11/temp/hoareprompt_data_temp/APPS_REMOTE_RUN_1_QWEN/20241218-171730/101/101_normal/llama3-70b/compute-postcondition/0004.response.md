According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `white_pixels`. The loop will execute if there is at least one tuple in `white_pixels` representing the coordinates of a 'w' character.

Let's break down the necessary conditions:

1. **`white_pixels`**: This list contains tuples representing the coordinates of 'w' characters in the `pixels` grid. For the loop to execute, this list must contain at least one tuple. If it is empty, the loop will not execute.

2. **Tuples in `white_pixels`**: Each tuple in `white_pixels` consists of `(x, y)` coordinates. These coordinates are derived from the `'w'` characters in the `pixels` grid. Therefore, there must be at least one `'w'` character in the `pixels` grid for `white_pixels` to have a tuple.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `white_pixels` is not an empty list. This means that there must be at least one `'w'` character in the `pixels` grid.

State: **`n` is the first integer input, `pixels` is a list of n lists, each containing m characters ('.' or 'w'), `white_pixels` is a list of tuples representing the coordinates (i, j) of all 'w' characters in the `pixels` grid and must contain at least one tuple, `min_x` is `float('inf')`, `min_y` is `float('inf')`, `max_x` is `float('-inf')`, `max_y` is `float('-inf')**.
