Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the described movement pattern for Lara. According to the problem description, Lara's path involves moving down to the bottom-left corner, then moving in a snake-like fashion to the right and up. The code, however, does not accurately simulate this path.

Let's analyze the given code and compare it to the expected behavior:

1. **Initial Path Down**: The code does not simulate the initial downward movement to the bottom-left corner. Instead, it immediately starts the snake-like movement.

2. **Snake-like Movement**: The code attempts to simulate the snake-like movement but does not correctly handle the transition from the downward path to the snake-like movement. Specifically, the code does not account for the correct row and column transitions during the snake-like movement.

For example, consider the following test cases:

- **Input**: `4 3 0`
  - Expected Output: `(1, 1)`
  - Actual Output: `(1, 1)` (Correct)

- **Input**: `4 3 1`
  - Expected Output: `(2, 1)`
  - Actual Output: `(1, 1)` (Incorrect)

- **Input**: `4 3 5`
  - Expected Output: `(3, 1)`
  - Actual Output: `(1, 1)` (Incorrect)

- **Input**: `4 3 7`
  - Expected Output: `(3, 2)`
  - Actual Output: `(1, 1)` (Incorrect)

The code does not handle the transition from the downward movement to the snake-like movement correctly, leading to incorrect results for certain values of \( k \). Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
