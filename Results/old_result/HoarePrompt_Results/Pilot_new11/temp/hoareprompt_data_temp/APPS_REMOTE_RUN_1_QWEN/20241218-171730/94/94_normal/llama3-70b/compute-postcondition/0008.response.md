The code `x1 = i` assigns the value of `i` to `x1`. However, the initial value of `i` is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `x1` without knowing the value of `i`. The values of other variables (`puzzle1`, `puzzle2`, and `x2`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`puzzle1` is a string of four characters, `puzzle2` is a string of four characters, `x2` is equal to the index of 'X' in `puzzle2`, `x1` is equal to the value of `i`**
