The code `heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))` pushes a new tuple into the heap. Given the initial state:

- `m` is at least 0
- `n` is at least 0
- `heap` contains the tuples `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for all `0 ≤ y < m`
- `x` is `x_end + 1`
- `y` is 0

The code updates the heap by adding a new tuple `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)`. Since `y` is 0, the tuple added to the heap is `(-coverage(x_end + 1, 0), x_end + 1, 0)`. The values of `m` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is at least 0, `n` is at least 0, `heap` contains the tuples `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for all `0 ≤ y < m` and `(-coverage(x_end + 1, 0), x_end + 1, 0)`, `x` is `x_end + 1`, `y` is 0**
