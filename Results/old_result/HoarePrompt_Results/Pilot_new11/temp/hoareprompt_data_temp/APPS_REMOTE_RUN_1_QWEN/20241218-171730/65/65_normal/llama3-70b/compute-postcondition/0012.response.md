Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `s` is a non-empty input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with one less character, and `color_count` is a dictionary. If `c` is already in `color_count`, its count is increased by 1. Otherwise, `color_count` is updated to contain `{c: 1}` where `c` is one of the characters in `s`.***
