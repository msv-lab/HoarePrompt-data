Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The given program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, the program attempts to solve the problem by using a GCD-based approach, but it fails to consider all necessary constraints and edge cases. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Input Validation**:
   - The program checks if \(n \times m \mod k\) is non-zero, which correctly identifies cases where a solution is impossible. However, this check alone is insufficient because it only determines if the area condition is achievable, not if a valid set of points exists.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Finding Points**:
   - The program uses the GCD functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`) to find integers \(x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2, x_3, y_3\) such that the area of the triangle is \(\frac{nm}{k}\). However, these functions are not directly used to generate the required points, and the logic for generating the points is flawed.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The program prints "NO" if the area condition cannot be met, but it does not correctly handle the case where a solution exists. Even if a solution exists, the program does not provide a valid set of points as required.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Case When \( \frac{nm}{k} \) is an Integer**:
  - If \( \frac{nm}{k} \) is an integer, the program should be able to find and print valid points \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), \((x_3, y_3)\) such that the area of the triangle is exactly \(\frac{nm}{k}\).

- **Case When \( \frac{nm}{k} \) is Not an Integer**:
  - If \( \frac{nm}{k} \) is not an integer, the program should print "NO" since it is impossible to form a triangle with the given area.

- **Current Implementation Flaws**:
  - The program incorrectly assumes that finding the GCD and its related values will directly lead to the points. It does not validate whether the points it calculates actually form a triangle with the desired area.
  - The points generated by the current logic might not satisfy the area requirement or might not even form a valid triangle.

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly implement the logic required to find and print valid points that satisfy the given conditions. Therefore, it fails to meet the problem description in all cases, making it incorrect.
