Functionality: **The function reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the user input where each integer is between 1 and 1000. It then calculates the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. The function prints the result of adding the minimum value to itself twice and four times, which is equivalent to printing `8 * min_lemon`, where `min_lemon` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. The function does not return any value explicitly.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `b` or `c` is 0, the values `b // 2` and `c // 4` will be 0, making `min_lemon` equal to `a` (assuming `a` is non-zero).
- If `a` is 0, `min_lemon` will be 0 regardless of the values of `b` and `c`.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not handle the case where the inputs are outside the specified range (1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1000). This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or errors if invalid inputs are provided.
