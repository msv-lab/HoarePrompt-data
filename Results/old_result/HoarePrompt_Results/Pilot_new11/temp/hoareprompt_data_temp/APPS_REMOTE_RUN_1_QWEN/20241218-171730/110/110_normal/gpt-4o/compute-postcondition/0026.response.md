The code initializes the variable `total_coverage` to 0. This does not affect the values of `m`, `n`, or the contents of the `heap` list. Therefore, the output state remains as follows:

Output State: **`m` is at least 0, `n` is at least 0, `heap` is a list containing tuples of the form `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for all `0 ≤ y < m` and `0 ≤ x < n`, `total_coverage` is 0.**
