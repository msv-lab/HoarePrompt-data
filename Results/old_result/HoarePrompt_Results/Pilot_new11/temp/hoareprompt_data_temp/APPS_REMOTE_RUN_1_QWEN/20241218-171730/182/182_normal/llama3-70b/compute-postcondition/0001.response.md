The code `x = x % 360` takes the current value of `x` and assigns it the remainder when divided by 360. Since `x` is an input integer within the range \(-10^{18} \leq x \leq 10^{18}\), the operation `x % 360` will ensure that the new value of `x` will be within the range \([0, 359]\). The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`x` is an integer within the range [0, 359]**
