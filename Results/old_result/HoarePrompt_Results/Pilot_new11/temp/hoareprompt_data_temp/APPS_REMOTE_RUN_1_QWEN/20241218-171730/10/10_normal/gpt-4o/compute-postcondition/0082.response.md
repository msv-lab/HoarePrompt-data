The `continue` statement in the provided code does not affect the values of any variables; it simply skips to the next iteration of the enclosing loop, if there is one. Since no variables are modified or reassigned within the scope of this statement, the values of `i`, `j`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j`, and `d` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is `k + 1`, `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[k + 1]`, `y1_j` is the second element of `sofas[k + 1]`, `x2_j` is the third element of `sofas[k + 1]`, `y2_j` is the fourth element of `sofas[k + 1]`, and `d` is greater than 0.**
