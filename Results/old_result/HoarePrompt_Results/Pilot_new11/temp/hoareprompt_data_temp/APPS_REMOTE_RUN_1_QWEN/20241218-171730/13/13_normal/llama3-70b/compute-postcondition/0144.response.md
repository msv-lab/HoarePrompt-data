The code `beauty += 1` increments the value of `beauty` by 1. Since `beauty` was previously defined as the count of 'G' characters in the substring of `s` starting from index `i` and going backwards until the first non-'G' character is encountered, and now it is incremented by 1, the new value of `beauty` is the previous value plus 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer, `s` is a string, `beauty` is the count of 'G' characters in the substring of `s` starting from index `i` and going backwards until the first non-'G' character is encountered plus 1, `j` is the index of the last 'G' character found in this substring or -1 if no 'G' character is found, and `n` must be greater than `i + 1`. The value of `s[j]` is 'G'.**
