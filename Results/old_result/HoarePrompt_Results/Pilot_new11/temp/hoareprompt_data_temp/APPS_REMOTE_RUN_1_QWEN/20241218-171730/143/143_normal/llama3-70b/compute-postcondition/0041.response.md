The code assigns `2 ** j - 1` to the variable `vol`. Given that `j` is initially 1, `vol` is calculated as `2 ** 1 - 1`, which equals 1. The values of the other variables (`dp[i]`, `n`, `j`, and `costs[0]`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is 1, `vol` is 1, `dp[i]` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `dp[i - vol] + costs[0]`, and `n` is a positive integer.**
