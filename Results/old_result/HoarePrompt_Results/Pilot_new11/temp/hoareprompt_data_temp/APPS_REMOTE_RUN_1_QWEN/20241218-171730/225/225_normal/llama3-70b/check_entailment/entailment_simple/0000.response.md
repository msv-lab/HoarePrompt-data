Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads a string as input, which is consistent with the problem statement that the input is a non-empty string of capital English letters.

2. **Vowel Identification**: The program identifies vowels using the predefined string `vowels = 'AEIOUY'`. This ensures that only these specific characters are considered as valid vowels.

3. **Jump Calculation Logic**:
   - The program initializes `max_jump` to 0 and `last_vowel` to -1.
   - For each character in the string, if it is a vowel, it updates `max_jump` to be the maximum of its current value and either:
     - The distance from the start of the string to the current vowel (if this is the first vowel encountered).
     - Half the distance between the current vowel and the previous vowel, rounded up, plus 1.
   - After the loop, if the last vowel is not the last character of the string, the program calculates the final jump required to cover the remaining distance to the end of the string.

4. **Output**: The program prints the calculated `max_jump`, which represents the minimum jump ability required for the Grasshopper to reach the end of the string, jumping only on vowels.

### Why the Program Meets the Requirements:

- The program handles all cases where the input string may or may not contain vowels.
- It correctly calculates the maximum jump required by considering the distances between consecutive vowels and the distance from the start to the first vowel.
- The program logic ensures that the Grasshopper can jump to the end of the string by only landing on vowels, adhering to the problem constraints.

Since the program accurately implements the specified logic and meets all the requirements outlined in the problem description, the correctness of the program is **True**.
