The code `volumes = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes user input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns these integers to the list `volumes`. The initial value of `v` is now stored in `volumes`, while `n` and `s` remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^3\)
- `s` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{12}\)
- `v` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq v_i \leq 10^9\) for each \(i\) in range `n`.

After executing the code, the value of `v` is updated to the values in `volumes`. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^3\); `s` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{12}\); `volumes` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq v_i \leq 10^9\) for each \(i\) in range `n`.**
