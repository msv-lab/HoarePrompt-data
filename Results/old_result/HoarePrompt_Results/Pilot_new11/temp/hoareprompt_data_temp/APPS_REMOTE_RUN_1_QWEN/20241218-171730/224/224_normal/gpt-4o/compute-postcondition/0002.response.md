The code updates the `result` variable by multiplying it with `i` and taking the modulo with `mod`. Initially, `result` is 1, `i` is 2, and `mod` is \(10^9 + 7\). After executing the line `result = result * i % mod`, `result` becomes \(1 \times 2 \mod (10^9 + 7)\), which simplifies to 2.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `mod` is \(10^9 + 7\), and `result` is 2**
