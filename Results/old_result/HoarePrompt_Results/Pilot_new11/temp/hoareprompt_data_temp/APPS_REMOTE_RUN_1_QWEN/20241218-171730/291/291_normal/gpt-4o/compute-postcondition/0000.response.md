The code initializes `min_segments_needed` to infinity (`float('inf')`). The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that `1 <= n <= 10^9`. This value does not affect the initialization of `min_segments_needed`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9; `min_segments_needed` is infinity.**
