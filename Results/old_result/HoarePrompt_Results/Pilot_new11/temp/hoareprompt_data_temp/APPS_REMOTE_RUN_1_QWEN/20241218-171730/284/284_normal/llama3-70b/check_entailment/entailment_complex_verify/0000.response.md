Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided annotated version of the code. The program correctly identifies a counterexample for PolandBall's hypothesis for any given \( n \). The annotated version clearly describes the states of the program at different points, showing that the function `func_1` correctly checks if a number is prime by iterating up to the square root of the number. If `n * m + 1` is not a prime number for some \( m \) in the range 1 to 1000, the program will print that \( m \) and break out of the loop. Given the guarantees in the problem statement, the program will always find and print a valid \( m \), thus meeting the requirements of the problem.
