The code snippet appends a new move to the `moves` list. The new move is formatted as a string with the value of `examples[i]` and `i + 1`.

From the initial state:
- `i` is 1
- `examples[i]` is "2"
- `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 2`
- `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`
- `n` must be at least 1
- `moves` is a list containing the string `'move {examples[i]} {temp_counter}'`

Given `i` is 1, `examples[i]` will be `examples[1]`, which is "2". The new move will be `'move 2 2'`.

After the code executes, `moves` will contain two elements: `'move 2 2'` and `'move {examples[i]} {temp_counter}'` (which is `'move 2 {temp_counter}'`).

The output state is:
Output State: **`i` is 1, `examples[i]` is "2", `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 2`, `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`, `n` must be at least 1, and `moves` is a list containing the strings `'move 2 {temp_counter}'` and `'move 2 2'`.**
