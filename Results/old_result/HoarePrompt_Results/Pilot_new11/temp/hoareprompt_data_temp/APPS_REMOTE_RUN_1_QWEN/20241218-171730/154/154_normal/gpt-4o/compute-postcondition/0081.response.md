Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 45\); `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 45\); `complete_tasks` is an integer such that \(0 \leq complete_tasks \leq n\); `max_points` is the maximum value achieved by updating `max_points` to be the maximum of its current value and `points + subtasks_solved`; `total_time_per_task`, `time_used`, `points`, `remaining_time`, `num_processed`, and `t` remain as per their initial conditions; `subtasks_solved` is the minimum of its original value and \((n - complete_tasks) * k\).**
