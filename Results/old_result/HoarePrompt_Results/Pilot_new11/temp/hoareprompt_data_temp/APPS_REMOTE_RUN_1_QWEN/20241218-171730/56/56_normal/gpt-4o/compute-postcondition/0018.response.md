To ensure that the `while` loop executes at least once, we need to consider the condition `len(bits) < k`. This means the loop will continue until the length of the `bits` list is at least `k`.

Here are the steps to determine which states need to be adjusted:

1. **Initial Condition**: `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), and the `bits` list contains the positions of the 1-bits in the binary representation of `n` from the most significant bit to the least significant bit where the bit is set.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `len(bits) < k`.

3. **Current State**: 
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `bits` is a list containing the positions of the 1-bits in the binary representation of `n`.
   - `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\).

4. **Ensuring the Loop Executes Once**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, the initial length of `bits` must be less than `k`.
   - Since `k` is given to be within the range \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\), the initial length of `bits` must be less than this value for the loop to start executing.

Therefore, we need to ensure that the initial length of the `bits` list is less than `k`. Given that the length of `bits` is less than or equal to `k` initially, we only need to ensure it is strictly less than `k`.

**State Adjustment**:
- The current state already ensures that the length of `bits` is less than or equal to `k`, but to guarantee the loop executes at least once, the length of `bits` must be less than `k`.

Thus, the state adjustment required is that the length of `bits` must be less than `k`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), and the `bits` list contains the positions of the 1-bits in the binary representation of `n`, `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k > len(bits)\)**.
