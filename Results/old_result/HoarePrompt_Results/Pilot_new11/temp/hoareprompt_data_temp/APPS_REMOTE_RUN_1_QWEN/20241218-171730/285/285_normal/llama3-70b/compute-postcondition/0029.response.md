The code `exit()` causes the program to terminate immediately without changing any variables or performing any further operations. Therefore, the values of the existing variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `1234567`, `a` is `a_initial + 1`, `b` is `b_final + 1`, and `c` is \((n - (a_initial + 1) * 1234567 - (b_final + 1) * 123456) // 1234'**
