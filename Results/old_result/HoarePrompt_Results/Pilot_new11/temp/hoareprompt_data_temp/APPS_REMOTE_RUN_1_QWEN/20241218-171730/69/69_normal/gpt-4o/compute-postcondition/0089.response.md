The given code snippet updates the `target_pos` based on the values of `dx` and `dy`. However, the code snippet itself does not change any variable values or perform any operations that would alter the state beyond what was already described in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is the calculation of `target_pos`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 2
- `min_length` remains unchanged
- `position_map` is updated based on the value of `operations[i]`
- If `operations[i] == 'U'`, `current_y` is updated to `new_current_y + 1` and `position_map` includes either {(0, 0): -1, (new_current_x, new_current_y + 1): 2} or {(0, 0): -1, (new_current_x - 1, new_current_y + 1): 2}
- If `operations[i] == 'D'`, `min_length` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `1 - position_map[target_pos]`, and `position_map` includes either {(0, 0): -1, (new_current_x, new_current_y - 1): 1} or {(0, 0): -1, (new_current_x - 1, new_current_y - 2): 1} and now includes {(current_x, current_y - 1): 2} with `(current_x, current_y - 1)` added to `position_map` with the value `2`
- If `operations[i]` is neither 'U' nor 'D', `min_length` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `1 - position_map[target_pos]`, and `position_map` includes either {(0, 0): -1, (new_current_x, new_current_y): 1} or {(0, 0): -1, (new_current_x - 1, new_current_y - 1): 1} and now includes either {(current_x, current_y): 2}, {(current_x - 1, current_y): 2}, or {(current_x + 1, current_y): 2} based on whether `operations[i]` is 'L', 'R', or not

The code snippet:
```python
target_pos = current_x + dx, current_y + dy
```
updates the `target_pos` to the sum of `current_x`, `dx`, and `current_y`, `dy`. This does not change any other variables.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `min_length` remains unchanged, `position_map` is updated based on the value of `operations[i]`, `target_pos` is `current_x + dx, current_y + dy`.**
