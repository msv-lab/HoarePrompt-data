The code `new_row, new_col = empty_row + dr, empty_col + dc` updates the values of `new_row` and `new_col` based on the current values of `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `dr`, and `dc`. 

- `new_row` is assigned the value of `empty_row + dr`.
- `new_col` is assigned the value of `empty_col + dc`.

The other variables (`directions`, `current`, `new_pos`, `new_state`, `new_state_str`, `visited`, and `queue`) remain unchanged because the code does not affect them.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`new_row` is updated to `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is updated to `empty_col + dc`; directions is a non-empty list; current is a valid puzzle state with an 'X' position; new_pos is recalculated for each direction; new_state is updated if new position is within bounds; new_state_str is updated; visited either includes the new state or remains unchanged; queue either includes the new state or remains unchanged.**
