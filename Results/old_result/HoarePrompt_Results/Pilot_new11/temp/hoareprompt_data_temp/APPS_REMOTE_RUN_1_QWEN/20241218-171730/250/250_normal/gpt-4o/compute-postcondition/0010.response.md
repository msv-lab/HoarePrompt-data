The variable `y_found` is assigned the value `True`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `marks`, `mark`, `y`, `x_found`, or `marks_set`. Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `marks` must be a non-empty list, `mark` and `y` are such that either `mark + y` or `mark - y` is an element of `marks_set`, `x_found` is set to True, `y_found` is True**
