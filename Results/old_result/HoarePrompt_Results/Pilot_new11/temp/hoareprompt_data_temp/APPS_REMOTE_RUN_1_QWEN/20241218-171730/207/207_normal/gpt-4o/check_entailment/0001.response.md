Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not accurately calculate the value of \( f(i) \) for each \( i \) from 0 to \( m \).

To illustrate this, consider the following example:

For \( m = 6 \), \( a = 4 \), and \( b = 5 \):

- According to the problem, \( f(0) = 1 \) (the frog can only stay at 0).
- For \( f(1) \), the frog cannot reach 1 since the smallest possible jump is 4 (from 0 to 4 or -4 which is not within [0, 1]).
- Similarly, \( f(2) = 1 \), \( f(3) = 1 \), and \( f(4) = 1 \).
- For \( f(5) \), the frog can jump from 0 to 4 and then from 4 to 5, so \( f(5) = 2 \).
- For \( f(6) \), the frog can jump from 0 to 4 and then from 4 to 9 (but 9 is out of range), or from 0 to -1 (not valid), or from 0 to 4 and back to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. So \( f(6) = 7 \).

Thus, the correct values are \( f(0) = 1 \), \( f(1) = 1 \), \( f(2) = 1 \), \( f(3) = 1 \), \( f(4) = 1 \), \( f(5) = 2 \), and \( f(6) = 7 \). Summing these gives \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 7 = 14 \).

However, the provided program outputs 10 for this input, indicating that the logic is flawed. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
