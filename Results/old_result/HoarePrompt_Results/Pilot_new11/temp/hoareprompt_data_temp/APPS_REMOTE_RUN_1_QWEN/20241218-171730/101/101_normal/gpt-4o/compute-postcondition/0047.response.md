Postcondition: ***`screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string is of length `m` and consists of characters "." and "w". If `screen[i][j]` is 'w', `top` is set to `i + 1` if `i >= top`, otherwise `top` remains unchanged; `bottom` is set to `i`; `left` is set to `j` if `j > left`, otherwise `left` remains unchanged; `right` is set to `j`. If `screen[i][j]` is not 'w', `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged.***
