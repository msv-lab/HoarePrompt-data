The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply exits the current loop or block of code. In this case, it would exit the loop or block of code that was checking the condition for `s[j]` being 'G'. The values of the other variables (`j`, `beauty`, `left`, `right`, `max_beauty`, `max_beauty_one_swap`, and `golden`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is `i + 4`, `beauty` is incremented by 1 if `s[j]` is 'G', otherwise `beauty` remains unchanged, `left`, `right`, `max_beauty`, `max_beauty_one_swap`, and `golden` remain unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or block of code.**
