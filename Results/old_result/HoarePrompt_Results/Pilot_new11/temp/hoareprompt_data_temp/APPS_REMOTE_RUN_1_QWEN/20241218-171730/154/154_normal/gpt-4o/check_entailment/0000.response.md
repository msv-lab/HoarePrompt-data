Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where solving additional subtasks after completing all tasks is possible within the remaining time. Specifically, the program breaks out of the loop when `time_used` exceeds `M`, but it does not consider whether solving more subtasks from the incomplete tasks could yield more points.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3 4 15
1 2 3 4
```

- Completing all 3 tasks gives \(3 \times (4 + 1) = 15\) points, which exactly matches the available time.
- However, if we solve one more subtask from the third task, we get an additional point since the time taken (1 minute) is less than the remaining time (1 minute).

The correct output should be 16 points, but the current implementation will output 15 points because it does not account for this scenario.
