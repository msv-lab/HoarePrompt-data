Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The given program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem described. Here's a detailed breakdown of why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three integers \( k_1 \), \( k_2 \), and \( k_3 \) from the input. These integers represent the time intervals of the garlands and are within the specified range (1 to 1500).

2. **GCD Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \( k_1 \) and \( k_2 \) using `math.gcd(k1, k2)`.
   - It then calculates the GCD of the result and \( k_3 \) using `math.gcd(gcd_k1_k2, k3)`.

3. **Decision Logic**:
   - If the final GCD (`gcd_all`) is 1, the program prints 'YES', indicating that Mishka can switch on the garlands in such a way that each second after switching them on at least one garland will be lit.
   - If the GCD is not 1, the program prints 'NO', indicating that it is impossible to satisfy the condition.

4. **Reasoning**:
   - The problem requires finding a moment in time \( x_1 \), \( x_2 \), and \( x_3 \) such that each second after switching the garlands on, at least one garland is lit.
   - For this to be true, the intervals \( k_1 \), \( k_2 \), and \( k_3 \) must have a GCD of 1. If their GCD is 1, it means that there is a common period after which all garlands will align and light up together, ensuring that at least one garland is lit every second.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles all valid inputs as specified in the problem statement. It assumes valid input (integers within the specified range) and correctly processes it.
   - There are no edge cases handled separately, as the problem specifies that the input will always be valid.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the solution and meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
