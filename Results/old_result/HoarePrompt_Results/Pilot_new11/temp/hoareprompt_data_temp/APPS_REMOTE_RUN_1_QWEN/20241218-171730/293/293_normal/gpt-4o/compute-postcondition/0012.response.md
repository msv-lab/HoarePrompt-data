The code `current_node = 2 * current_node + 2` updates the value of `current_node` by multiplying its current value by 2 and then adding 2. Given the initial state where `current_node` is 0, the new value of `current_node` will be \(2 \times 0 + 2 = 2\). The values of the other variables (`total_leaves`, `visited_count`, `path`, `current_level`, and `direction`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total_leaves` is 2, `visited_count` is 1, `path` is non-empty, `current_level` is 0, `current_node` is 2, and the direction is not '0'**
