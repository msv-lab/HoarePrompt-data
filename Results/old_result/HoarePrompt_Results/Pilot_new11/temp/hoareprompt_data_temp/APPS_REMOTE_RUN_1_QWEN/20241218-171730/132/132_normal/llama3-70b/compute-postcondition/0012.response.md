Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer input from the user, `x` is a sorted list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of length `n` with elements converted from the input integers, the sum of the elements in `x` is equal to the sum of the elements in `y`, and `y` is sorted. If `x` is equal to `y`, the console displays 'Yes'. Otherwise, the console displays 'No'.***
