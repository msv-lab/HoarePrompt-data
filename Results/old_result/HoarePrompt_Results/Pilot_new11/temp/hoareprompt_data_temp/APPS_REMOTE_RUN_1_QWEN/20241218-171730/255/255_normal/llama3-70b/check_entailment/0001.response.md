Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to delete the entire string. The logic in the program increments `ans` whenever it encounters a different character than the previous one, which does not account for deleting contiguous substrings of the same character. 

For example, consider the input:
```
5
aaaaa
```

The program will output:
```
2
```

However, the correct answer should be:
```
1
```

This is because the entire string can be deleted in one operation by removing all 'a' characters. The current logic only counts transitions between different characters and does not consider deleting blocks of the same character in one operation.
