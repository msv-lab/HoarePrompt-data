The function `func` accepts a parameter which is a list of integers representing the array \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) where \(1 \le n \le 100\) and \(1 \le a_1 < a_2 < \ldots < a_n \le 10^3\). 

Case_1: The function returns the list itself.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a list of integers representing an increasing sequence of length between 1 and 100, and return the list itself.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers representing an increasing sequence of length between 1 and 100, and returns the list itself.**
