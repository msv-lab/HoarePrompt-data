The code `n //= 2` divides `n` by 2 and assigns the floor division result back to `n`. This operation affects only the variable `n`. Since `n` was initially an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2^h\), after performing the operation, `n` will be half of its original value (rounded down). The variable `h` remains unchanged.

To summarize:
- If `n` was even, `ans` would be `n // 2 - 1`.
- If `n` was odd, `ans` would be `n // 2`.

After executing `n //= 2`, the new value of `n` will be `n // 2` (for both even and odd cases), which is a new integer. The variable `ans` is no longer relevant because it depends on the original value of `n`, and now `n` has changed.

Output State: **`h` is an integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 50\); `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2^{(h-1)}\); `ans` is no longer applicable.**
