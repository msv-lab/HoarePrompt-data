Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the original assessment is accurate. The `has_cycle` function correctly implements Kahn's algorithm for detecting cycles in a directed graph. The `func_1` function properly iterates through each edge, temporarily removes it, and checks if the graph becomes acyclic. The logic in both functions aligns with the requirements of the problem, and the output hints confirm that the functions handle various cases, including graphs with cycles and those without. Therefore, the program correctly determines whether the graph can be made acyclic by removing at most one edge, as evidenced by the examples provided.
