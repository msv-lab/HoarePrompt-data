The code `right += 1` increments the value of `right` by 1. Given the initial state where `right` is set as \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2} + 1\), the new value of `right` will be \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2} + 2\).

The precondition is that `func_1(right) == m` must be true, which means the function `func_1` must be correctly implemented to return `m` when evaluated at this new value of `right`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`right` is \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2} + 2\)**
