`i` is incremented by `2 * k + 1`. The initial state shows that `i` is the last value appended to `positions`, and `n` is at least `4 * k + 5`. After the code executes, the value of `i` changes, but the value of `n` and the contents of `positions` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least `4 * k + 5`; `positions` contains `i`; `i` is increased by `2 * k + 1`.**
