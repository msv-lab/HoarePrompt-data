`current_cost` is incremented by the difference between the length of `a` and `t + 1`. Since `a` is a non-empty list containing at least two elements, its length is at least 2. However, the exact value of `t` is not specified, so we cannot determine the exact value of the increment. But we know the increment is `length - (t + 1)`. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a non-empty list containing at least two elements; `current_cost` is adjusted by adding `length - (t + 1)`.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list containing at least two elements; `current_cost` is adjusted by adding `length - (t + 1)`**
