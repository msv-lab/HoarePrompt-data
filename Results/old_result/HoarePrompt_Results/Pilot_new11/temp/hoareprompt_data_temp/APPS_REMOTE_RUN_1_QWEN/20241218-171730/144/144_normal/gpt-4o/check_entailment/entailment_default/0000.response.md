Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the problem description. The function aims to find the maximum possible value of the mex after Alyona can decrease any element of the array to any positive integer less than or equal to its current value. However, the current implementation simply finds the smallest missing positive integer in the sorted array, which does not account for the ability to decrease elements.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
2 3 3 3
```
The correct output should be 4 because Alyona can decrease the second element to 1, making the array [2, 1, 3, 3], and thus the mex would be 4. However, the current code would output 3 because it simply finds the smallest missing positive integer in the sorted array, which is 3.

The code needs to consider the possibility of decreasing elements to achieve the maximum possible mex value.
