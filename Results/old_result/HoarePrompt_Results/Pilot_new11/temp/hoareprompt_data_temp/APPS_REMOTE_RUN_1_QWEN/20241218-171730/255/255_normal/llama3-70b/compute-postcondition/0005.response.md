The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. The initial value of `ans` is 1, so after executing this line of code, `ans` becomes 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `ans` is 2, the current value of `s[i]` is not equal to the value of `s[i - 1]`**
