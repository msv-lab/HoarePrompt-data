Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the requirement to ensure that there are no uppercase letters between the selected lowercase letters. The code simply counts the number of lowercase letters in the string without checking the condition about the absence of uppercase letters between them. For example, consider the input:

```
11
aaaaBaabAbA
```

The code will output `4`, but the correct output should be `2` because the maximum number of elements in a pretty set of positions is 2 (positions 6 and 8 or 7 and 8).

To fix this, the code needs to keep track of the last position of a lowercase letter and ensure that any subsequent lowercase letter is not followed by an uppercase letter until the next lowercase letter.
