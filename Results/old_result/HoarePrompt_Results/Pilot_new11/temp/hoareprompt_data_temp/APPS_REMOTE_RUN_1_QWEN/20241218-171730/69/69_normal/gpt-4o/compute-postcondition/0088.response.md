Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `min_length` remains unchanged, and `position_map` is updated based on the value of `operations[i]`. If `operations[i] == 'U'`, `current_y` is updated to `new_current_y + 1` and `position_map` includes either {(0, 0): -1, (new_current_x, new_current_y + 1): 2} or {(0, 0): -1, (new_current_x - 1, new_current_y + 1): 2}. If `operations[i] == 'D'`, `min_length` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `1 - position_map[target_pos]`, and `position_map` includes either {(0, 0): -1, (new_current_x, new_current_y - 1): 1} or {(0, 0): -1, (new_current_x - 1, new_current_y - 2): 1} and now includes {(current_x, current_y - 1): 2} with `(current_x, current_y - 1)` added to `position_map` with the value `2`. If `operations[i]` is neither 'U' nor 'D', `min_length` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `1 - position_map[target_pos]`, and `position_map` includes either {(0, 0): -1, (new_current_x, new_current_y): 1} or {(0, 0): -1, (new_current_x - 1, new_current_y - 1): 1} and now includes either {(current_x, current_y): 2}, {(current_x - 1, current_y): 2}, or {(current_x + 1, current_y): 2} based on whether `operations[i]` is 'L', 'R', or not.***
