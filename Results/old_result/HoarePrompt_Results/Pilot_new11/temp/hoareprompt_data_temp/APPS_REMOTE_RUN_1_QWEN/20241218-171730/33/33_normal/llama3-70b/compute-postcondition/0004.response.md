`t` is assigned the value of `int(t)`. This means that `t` is converted to an integer from its original string form. The value of `n` remains at least 1, `curr_lat` remains 90, and `dir` remains the second value from input.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `curr_lat` is 90, `t` is an integer, `dir` is the second value from input**
