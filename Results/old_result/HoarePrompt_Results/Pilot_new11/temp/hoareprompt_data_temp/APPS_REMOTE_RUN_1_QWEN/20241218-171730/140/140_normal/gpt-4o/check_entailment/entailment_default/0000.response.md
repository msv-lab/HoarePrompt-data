Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The `func_1` function iterates through each edge and checks if removing that edge makes the graph acyclic. This approach ensures that the function can determine whether the graph can be made acyclic by removing at most one edge.

1. **Graph Construction**: The function constructs the graph using the provided edges.
2. **Cycle Detection**: It uses the `has_cycle` function to detect if the graph contains a cycle.
3. **Edge Removal and Cycle Check**: For each edge, it temporarily removes the edge and checks if the graph becomes acyclic. If removing an edge breaks the cycle, it returns 'YES'. If no such edge is found and the graph remains cyclic, it returns 'NO'.

The `has_cycle` function correctly implements the topological sorting algorithm to detect cycles in the graph. It handles both cyclic and acyclic graphs appropriately, ensuring that the main function `func_1` can accurately determine whether the graph can be made acyclic by removing at most one edge.

Given the problem description and the provided code, the function correctly implements the required logic for all potential cases.
