`current_cost` is assigned the value of `t - 1 - length`. The initial state mentions that `a` is a non-empty list with at least one element, and the length of `a` is less than `t - 1`. The length of `a` is denoted as `length`, so `current_cost` is updated to be `t - 1 - length`.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list with at least one element, the length of `a` is less than `t - 1`; `current_cost` is `t - 1 - length`**
