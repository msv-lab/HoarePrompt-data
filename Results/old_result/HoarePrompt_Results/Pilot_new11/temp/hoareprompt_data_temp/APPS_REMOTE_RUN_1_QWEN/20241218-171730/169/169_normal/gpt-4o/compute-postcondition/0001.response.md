The code `s = input()` assigns the value of the input to the variable `s`. Since `n` was initially an integer value of the input, and `s` was a string of length `n` consisting only of "-" and "+", the input here should be a string. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and `s` now holds the new string value.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of the input, `s` is the string input from the user**
