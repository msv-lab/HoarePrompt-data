The function `func` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, which are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 100, and a parameter `s`, which is a string consisting of lowercase letters representing the colors of the balloons. The function has two cases for its output:

Case_1: If the conditions on `n` and `k` are not met (i.e., they are not within the range of 1 to 100), the function returns an error message indicating that the values of `n` and `k` are out of the allowed range.

Case_2: If the conditions on `n` and `k` are met, the function returns information about the string `s`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k` within the range of 1 to 100, and a string `s` consisting of lowercase letters, and either return an error message if the conditions on `n` and `k` are not met or provide information based on the string `s` if the conditions are met.
