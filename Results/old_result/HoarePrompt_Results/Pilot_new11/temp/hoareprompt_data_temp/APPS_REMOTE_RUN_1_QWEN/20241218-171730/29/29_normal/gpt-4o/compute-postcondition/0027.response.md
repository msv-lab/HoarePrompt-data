The code `temp_counter += 1` increments the value of `temp_counter` by 1. Given the initial conditions and the impact of the code, the updated state is as follows:

- `len(examples)` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `i` is 0.
- `examples[i]` is not equal to `str(i + 1)`.
- `temp_counter` is now `temp_counter + 1`.
- `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`.
- `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`.

Since `temp_counter` is incremented by 1, we need to ensure that `temp_counter` is still within the required range for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the updated output state is:

Output State: **`len(examples)` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `examples[i]` is not equal to `str(i + 1)`, `temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 1`, and `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`**
