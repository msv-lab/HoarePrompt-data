Postcondition: ***`l` is an integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^9\); `r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^9\); `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq y \leq 10^9\); `y` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq y \leq 10^9\) and `y` is divisible by `x`; `z` is an integer equal to `y // x`; `count` is either 1 or `count + 2` depending on the condition `a == b` where `a` and `b` satisfy certain constraints related to `x` and `y`. If `z % i == 0`, `count` is incremented by 1 or 2.***

This postcondition summarizes the overall state of the program variables after the execution of the if-else block, considering both the if and else parts as well as the conditions under which each branch is executed.
