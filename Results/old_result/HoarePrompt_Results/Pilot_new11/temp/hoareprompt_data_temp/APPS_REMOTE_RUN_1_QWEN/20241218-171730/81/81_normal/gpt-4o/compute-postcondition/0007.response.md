The code `a = i * x` assigns the value of `i * x` to the variable `a`. Since `i % z == 0`, `i` is a divisor of `z`. The previous values of the affected variables are as follows:

- `l` is an integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^9\)
- `r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^9\)
- `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq y \leq 10^9\)
- `y` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq y \leq 10^9\) and `y` is divisible by `x`
- `z` is an integer equal to `y // x`
- `count` is 0
- `z` must be greater than 0
- The current value of `i` satisfies `z % i == 0`

After executing the code, `a` is assigned the value of `i * x`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is an integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^9\), `r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^9\), `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq y \leq 10^9\), `y` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq y \leq 10^9\) and `y` is divisible by `x`, `z` is an integer equal to `y // x`, `count` is 0, and `z` must be greater than 0; `a` is `i * x`.**
