`ratings` is a list of tuples, and it appends the tuple `(a, b)` to itself. Since `a` and `b` are integers from input, the new tuple will be `(a, b)`. The original tuple `('a', 'b')` remains in the list, and the length of the list increases by one. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2; `ratings` is `[('a', 'b'), ('a', 'b'), (a, b)]; `is_rated` is True; `is_unrated` is False; `a` is an integer from input; `b` is an integer from input**
