`total_x` is assigned the value of the sum of the elements in the list `x`. The value of `total_x` depends on the values of the elements in `x`, but the lengths of `x` and `y` remain the same, and the elements of `y` are unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is the length of the list `x`, `x` is a list of integers entered by the user, each between 0 and 1000 (inclusive), `y` is a list of integers entered by the user, each between 0 and 1000 (inclusive), with the same length as `x`, `total_x` is the sum of the elements in the list `x`**
