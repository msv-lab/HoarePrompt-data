Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the case where multiple example files already have names that match their intended positions. Specifically, the code attempts to use temporary indices to place files, but it does not properly handle the scenario where multiple example files are already in the correct positions. This can lead to incorrect renaming and misplaced files.

For example, consider the following input:
```
5
1 1
2 1
3 0
4 0
5 0
```

The correct output should be:
```
3
move 3 1
move 4 2
move 5 3
```

However, the provided code might produce an incorrect output due to its handling of temporary indices. Hereâ€™s why:

1. The code initializes `temp_counter` to `n + 1`.
2. When it finds an example file that needs to be moved, it tries to find a temporary index that is not yet used.
3. If multiple example files are already in their correct positions, the code might incorrectly move another example file to a position that is already occupied by another example file.

To fix this, the code needs to ensure that it correctly handles the case where multiple example files are already in their correct positions without needing to use temporary indices.
