The code `high = mid - 1` updates the value of `high` to `mid - 1`. The other variables (`m`, `low`, `mid`, and `zeroes`) remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `low` is less than or equal to `mid - 1`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`**
