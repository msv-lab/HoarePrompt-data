The given code initializes an empty list called `ratings`. Since no elements are added to this list in the provided snippet, the only change is the state of the `ratings` list. The initial state of `n` remains unchanged, as no operation was performed on `n`. 

Output State: **`n` is the integer input provided, representing the number of lines to be read; each line contains two space-separated integers `a_i` and `b_i` such that 1 ≤ `a_i`, `b_i` ≤ 4126; `ratings` is an empty list**
