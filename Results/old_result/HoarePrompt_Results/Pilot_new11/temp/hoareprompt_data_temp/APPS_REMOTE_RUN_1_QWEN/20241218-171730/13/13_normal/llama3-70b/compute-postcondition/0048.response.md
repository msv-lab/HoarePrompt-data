Output State: **`left` is the original value of `left` + `n` (since the loop continues until `left` is equal to `right`), `right` is `k + 1`, `s[left]` is 'G' (if there is at least one 'G' in the string `s`), `golden` is unchanged, `max_beauty` is unchanged, `curr_beauty` is 0**

Explanation:
- The loop continues as long as `left < right` and `s[left] != 'G'`. This means that the loop will increment `left` until it either reaches `right` or finds a 'G'.
- Since the loop condition involves `right` being `k + 1`, the loop will continue until `left` equals `k + 1` (i.e., `left` becomes `right`).
- Once `left` reaches `right`, the loop stops, and `s[left]` will be 'G' if there is at least one 'G' in the string `s`. If there are no 'G's, `left` will effectively become `n`.
- The variables `golden`, `max_beauty`, and `curr_beauty` are not modified within the loop and retain their original values.
