The code initializes a list `dp` with `0` for each index from `0` to `f_max_n`. This means that `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1`, where all elements are set to `0`. The variables `n`, `f_max_n`, and `MOD` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `f_max_n` is the maximum value of f(p) for permutations of length n as defined in the problem description; `MOD` is 1000000007, `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1` where all elements are 0**
