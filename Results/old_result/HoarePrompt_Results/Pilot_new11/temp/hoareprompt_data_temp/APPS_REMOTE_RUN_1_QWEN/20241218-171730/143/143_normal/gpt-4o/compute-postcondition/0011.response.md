The code snippet `dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] * 2)` updates the value of `dp[i]` to be the minimum of its current value and `dp[i - 1] * 2`. However, since the initial state only specifies that `i` is 1, we need to consider the implications for `dp` at index `i` and `i-1`.

Given that `i` is 1, `i - 1` would be 0. For the code to run without error, `dp` should be initialized such that `dp[0]` exists. Let's assume `dp` is a list initialized with some values, and `dp[0]` has a value, say `dp[0] = x`. Since the exact value of `dp[0]` is not specified, we will use `x` to represent it.

The code will set `dp[1]` to be the minimum of `dp[1]` (which is not specified and will be taken as it is) and `dp[0] * 2`.

Output State: **`i` is 1; `dp[1]` is the minimum of `dp[1]` and `dp[0] * 2`**
