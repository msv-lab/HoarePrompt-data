Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `p` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `data` is a list of strings, `visited` is a list of boolean values where each element indicates if the corresponding index was visited during the loop, `cycles` is a list of lists representing the cycles found in the graph defined by `p`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each index `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
- During each iteration, if `visited[i]` is `False`, it starts a new cycle by marking `visited[i]` as `True` and appending `i` to the `cycle` list.
- It then follows the directed edge from `i` to `p[i] - 1` and continues to mark nodes as visited and append them to the `cycle` list until it encounters a previously visited node.
- Once a cycle is completed, it appends the `cycle` list to the `cycles` list.
- After all iterations, every node in the graph will either be part of a cycle or have `visited` set to `True`.

Since the loop processes all indices from `0` to `n-1`, the final state will reflect that all cycles in the graph have been identified and stored in the `cycles` list, with each `visited` element indicating whether its corresponding node was part of a cycle.
