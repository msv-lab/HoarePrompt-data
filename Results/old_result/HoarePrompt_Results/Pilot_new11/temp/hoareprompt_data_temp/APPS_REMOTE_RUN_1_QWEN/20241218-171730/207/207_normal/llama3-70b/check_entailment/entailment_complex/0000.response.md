Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three integers \( m \), \( a \), and \( b \) from the input. These inputs are validated to ensure \( 1 \leq m \leq 10^9 \) and \( 1 \leq a, b \leq 10^5 \), as specified in the problem description.

2. **Dynamic Programming Array Initialization**: The program initializes a dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` of length \( m + 1 \). The initial value `dp[0]` is set to 1, indicating that there is one way to reach position 0 (starting point).

3. **DP Array Filling**: The program uses a for loop to fill the DP array. For each index \( i \) from 0 to \( m \):
   - If \( i + a \leq m \), it updates `dp[i + a]` by adding `dp[i]` to it. This step ensures that if the frog can jump to position \( i + a \) from position \( i \), the count of reachable positions is incremented.
   - If \( i - b \geq 0 \), it updates `dp[i]` by adding `dp[i - b]` to it. This step ensures that if the frog can jump to position \( i - b \) from position \( i \), the count of reachable positions is incremented.

4. **Output Calculation**: After the DP array is filled, the program prints the sum of all elements in `dp`, which represents the total number of distinct positions the frog can reach from 0 up to each index from 0 to \( m \).

5. **Handling Edge Cases**: 
   - If \( a > m \) or \( b > m \), the corresponding operations are not performed, and the initial `dp` values remain unchanged. This ensures that the program handles large values of \( a \) and \( b \) appropriately.
   - If \( b > m \), the subtraction operation is effectively ignored for indices less than \( b \), ensuring that the program does not attempt invalid operations.

Since the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement, it meets all the requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
