The code `break` does not assign any new values to variables or perform any operations that would change the state of the variables `n`, `i`, or `s`. It simply breaks out of the innermost loop or switch-case structure. Since no changes are made to the variables, the preconditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to `i - 1`, and `s[j]` is not equal to 'G', and we break out of the most internal loop or switch-case structure.**
