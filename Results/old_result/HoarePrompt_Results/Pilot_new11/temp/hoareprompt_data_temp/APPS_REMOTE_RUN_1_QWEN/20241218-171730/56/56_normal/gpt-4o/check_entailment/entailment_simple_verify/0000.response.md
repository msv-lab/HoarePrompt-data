Final: **True**

Reasoning:
Based on the problem description and the provided code, the original assessment of correctness being **False** was due to a missing check for the condition where `k` is greater than the number of bits set in `n`. However, after reviewing the annotated version of the code, it is clear that the program now includes this necessary check:

1. The function starts by checking if `k` is greater than `n`. If so, it returns `'No'`.
2. It then proceeds to find the positions of the 1-bits in the binary representation of `n` and stores them in the `bits` list.
3. If the length of `bits` is greater than `k`, it returns `'No'`.
4. If the length of `bits` is less than `k`, it adds additional `-1` values to the `bits` list until its length matches `k`.
5. Finally, it sorts the `bits` list in reverse order and returns the result.

This ensures that the program handles all cases correctly according to the problem description. Specifically:
- If `k` is greater than the number of bits set in `n`, the program correctly returns `'No'`.
- If `k` is less than or equal to the number of bits set in `n`, the program attempts to form a sequence of length `k` using the highest available bits first and then pads with `-1` values if necessary.

Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the annotated version supports its correctness.
