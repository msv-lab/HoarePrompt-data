Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of how the program aligns with the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input as specified in the problem description. It correctly captures the number of digits (`n` and `m`), the base (`bx` and `by`), and the digits of both numbers (`x_digits` and `y_digits`).

2. **Conversion Function**: The `func_1` function correctly converts a list of digits representing a number in a specific base to its integer equivalent. The function iterates through each digit, multiplying the current result by the base and adding the digit. This approach ensures that the conversion is done correctly, regardless of the base or the number of digits.

3. **Edge Case Handling**: The function initializes `result` to 0, which is essential for handling an empty list of digits correctly. Even though the annotation mentions that `digits` becomes an empty list after the loop, the initialization of `result` to 0 ensures that the function returns 0 when the input list is empty. This is consistent with the problem statement, which requires handling all valid inputs correctly.

4. **Comparison Logic**: After converting both numbers to their integer equivalents, the program compares them using the appropriate relational operators (`<`, `>`, `=`) and prints the corresponding character. This logic matches the problem statement's requirement to output a single character based on the comparison result.

Since the program correctly processes all valid inputs according to the problem description, it meets all the specified requirements and hence is correct.
