The code snippet `substr = s[i:j]` assigns a substring of `s` from index `i` to index `j-1` (inclusive) to the variable `substr`. The values of `i`, `s`, `n`, and `max_len` remain unchanged since they are not directly affected by this assignment.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`i` is a valid starting index such that `i + 1` is within bounds of `s`, `s` is a non-empty string, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, and `max_len` is the maximum length of any non-palindromic substring found in `s` from index `i + 1` to any valid end index `j` where `i + 2 <= j <= n`; `substr` is the substring of `s` from index `i` to index `j-1`**.
