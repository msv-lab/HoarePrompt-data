The code `print(ans)` prints the value of `ans`. Since `ans` was already determined based on the conditions given in the initial state, printing it does not change its value. The other variables (`n`, `pos`, `l`, `r`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is specific, `pos` is specific, `l` is specific, `r` is specific, `ans` is `pos - r + min(pos - 1, n - r) + max(0, l - 1)` if `pos > r`, otherwise `ans` is `n - r + max(0, l - 1)`**
