You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A string is called bracket sequence if it does not contain any characters other than "(" and ")". A bracket sequence is called regular if it it is possible to obtain correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters "+" and "1" into this sequence. For example, "", "(())" and "()()" are regular bracket sequences; "))" and ")((" are bracket sequences (but not regular ones), and "(a)" and "(1)+(1)" are not bracket sequences at all.

You have a number of strings; each string is a bracket sequence of length $2$. So, overall you have $cnt_1$ strings "((", $cnt_2$ strings "()", $cnt_3$ strings ")(" and $cnt_4$ strings "))". You want to write all these strings in some order, one after another; after that, you will get a long bracket sequence of length $2(cnt_1 + cnt_2 + cnt_3 + cnt_4)$. You wonder: is it possible to choose some order of the strings you have such that you will get a regular bracket sequence? Note that you may not remove any characters or strings, and you may not add anything either.


-----Input-----

The input consists of four lines, $i$-th of them contains one integer $cnt_i$ ($0 \le cnt_i \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

Print one integer: $1$ if it is possible to form a regular bracket sequence by choosing the correct order of the given strings, $0$ otherwise.


-----Examples-----

-----Note-----

In the first example it is possible to construct a string "(())()(()((()()()())))", which is a regular bracket sequence.

In the second example it is possible to construct a string "", which is a regular bracket sequence.
Program:
```
def func():
    cnt1 = int(input())
    cnt2 = int(input())
    cnt3 = int(input())
    cnt4 = int(input())
    if cnt1 + cnt2 == cnt3 + cnt4 and cnt2 >= cnt3:
        print(1)
    else:
        print(0)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program checks only two conditions:
1. `cnt1 + cnt2 == cnt3 + cnt4`
2. `cnt2 >= cnt3`

However, the problem requires ensuring that the resulting sequence is a regular bracket sequence. The current logic does not guarantee that the sequence will be balanced or correctly nested, which is necessary for a regular bracket sequence.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
2
3
4
```
According to the program's logic, since `1 + 2 != 3 + 4` and `2 < 3`, it would print `0`. However, a valid arrangement of the strings could be `()(())()`, which is a regular bracket sequence. Thus, the program incorrectly returns `0`.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that the number of opening brackets `(` is always greater than or equal to the number of closing brackets `)` at any point in the sequence, and that the total counts of `()` and `)("` are balanced appropriately with `(()` and `))`. The current implementation fails to handle these constraints.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of four lines, where the i-th line contains one integer cnt_i representing the number of strings of type i ("((") or i+1 ("()", "(})", "))"), with 0 ≤ cnt_i ≤ 10^9 for i = 0, 1, 2, 3.
def func():
    cnt1 = int(input())
    cnt2 = int(input())
    cnt3 = int(input())
    cnt4 = int(input())
    if (cnt1 + cnt2 == cnt3 + cnt4 and cnt2 >= cnt3) :
        print(1)
    else :
        print(0)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`cnt0` is 0, `cnt1` is an input integer, `cnt2` is the integer input from the user, `cnt3` is an integer input from the user, `cnt4` is an integer input from the user. If the condition `(cnt1 + cnt2 == cnt3 + cnt4 and cnt2 >= cnt3)` is true, no changes are made to `cnt2`, `cnt3`, or `cnt4`. Otherwise, either `cnt1 + cnt2` is not equal to `cnt3 + cnt4` or `cnt2` is less than `cnt3`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four integers through separate input lines, representing counts of "((", "()", "(})", and "))" respectively. It then checks if the sum of counts of "((" and "()" is equal to the sum of counts of "(}" and "))", and also ensures that the count of "()" is greater than or equal to the count of "(}". If both conditions are met, it prints `1`; otherwise, it prints `0`. The function does not return any value but modifies the state of `cnt2` and `cnt3` by checking their values against the given conditions.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
