The function accepts two non-negative integers `s` and `x` as input, where `2 ≤ s ≤ 10^12` and `0 ≤ x ≤ 10^12`. It iterates through all possible pairs `(a, b)` such that `a + b = s` and counts how many of these pairs satisfy the condition `a ⊕ b = x`, where `⊕` denotes the bitwise XOR operation. If `x` is 0, the function directly prints `s`. Otherwise, it prints the count of valid pairs `(a, b)`. The function does not return anything explicitly but prints the result. Potential edge cases include when `s` is exactly 2 or `x` is 0, which are handled correctly by the code.
