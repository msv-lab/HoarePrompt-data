The `print('YES')` statement does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `a`, `b`, `x`, or `y`. It simply prints 'YES' to the console. Therefore, the only change is that the program will print 'YES', but the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a non-negative integer, `b` is an integer, `x` is the original value of `x` + 1, and `y` is `(n - (original value of x + 1) * a) // b. The program prints 'YES' to the console.**
