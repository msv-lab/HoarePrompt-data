Postcondition: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is incremented by 1, `top` and `bottom` both remain unchanged and equal `i`, `right` is updated to `j + 1` if `j + 1 > right`. Additionally, if `i > bottom`, then `bottom` is updated to `i`. If `screen[i][j] == 'w'`, these updates are applied; otherwise, the values of `i`, `j`, `top`, `bottom`, and `right` remain as they were before the if-else block executes.**
