Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem. The problem requires that every skewer visits every of its 2n placements, considering both original and reversed directions. The code simply counts the number of positions where the permutation `p[i]` is not equal to `i + 1` or where `b[i]` is `0`. This does not guarantee that every skewer will visit all 2n placements.

For instance, consider the following input:
```
4
4 3 2 1
0 0 0 0
```
The current code will output `4`, suggesting that all four elements need to be changed. However, this is incorrect because the permutation `p` is already a valid permutation and the sequence `b` can be changed to fit the requirements with fewer changes.

A correct solution would involve ensuring that the permutation and the sequence `b` are adjusted such that every skewer visits all its placements. This typically involves finding cycles in the permutation and adjusting the sequence `b` to ensure all necessary reversals occur. The current implementation does not address these requirements.
