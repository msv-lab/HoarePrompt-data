The code assigns the values of `sofas[j]` to `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j`. Since `sofas[j]` is a tuple containing four elements, these elements will be unpacked into `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` respectively. The other variables (`i`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, and `d`) are not affected by this assignment.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` ranges from 0 to `d-1`, `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[j]`, `y1_j` is the second element of `sofas[j]`, `x2_j` is the third element of `sofas[j]`, `y2_j` is the fourth element of `sofas[j]`, and `d` must be greater than 0.**
