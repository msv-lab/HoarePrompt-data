Postcondition: **`dp[2]` is the maximum value between `dp[2]` and `dp[0] + cakes[2][0]`; `i` is 3; `j` starts from 0; `dp[3]` is the maximum value between `dp[3]` and `dp[0] + cakes[3][0]`. If `cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]` holds true, then these conditions are preserved. Otherwise, the conditions remain unchanged as there is no else part provided.**
