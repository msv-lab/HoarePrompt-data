According to the code, the loop iterates `n` times. At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions hold:

- `n` is at least 1.
- `curr_lat` is within the range of -90 to 90.
- The output remains 'NO'.
- The direction `dir` is not 'South'.
- If `curr_lat` equals 90 and `dir` is not 'South', the function does nothing.

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `n` must be decremented by 1 since the loop has already completed one iteration. The other conditions (`curr_lat`, `output`, and `dir`) remain unchanged unless specified otherwise within the loop body, but no such changes are mentioned.

Thus, we adjust the state as follows:

State: **`n` is at least 0, `curr_lat` is within the range of -90 to 90, the output remains 'NO', and the direction `dir` is not 'South'**.
