The code adds `mark - x` to the set `new_marks`. Since `new_marks` was initially an empty set, after adding `mark - x`, it now contains this single element. The value of `mark - x` is not specified, so we keep it in terms of `mark` and `x`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `marks` is a list of integers that must not be empty, `marks_set` is a set of unique elements from `marks`, `x_found` is `False`, `y_found` is `False`, `new_marks` is a set containing `mark - x`, and the condition `mark - x + y in marks_set or mark - x - y in marks_set` holds true.**
