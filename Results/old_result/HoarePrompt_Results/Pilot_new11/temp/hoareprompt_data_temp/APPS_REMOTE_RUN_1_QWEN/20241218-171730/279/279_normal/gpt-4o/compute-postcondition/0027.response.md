The code initializes the variable `cycle` as an empty list. This does not affect the values of `n`, `i`, `visited[0]`, `cycle`, `i`, or `cycles`. Therefore, the only change is that `cycle` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `visited[0]` is True, `cycle` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `cycles` includes the `cycle` list.**
