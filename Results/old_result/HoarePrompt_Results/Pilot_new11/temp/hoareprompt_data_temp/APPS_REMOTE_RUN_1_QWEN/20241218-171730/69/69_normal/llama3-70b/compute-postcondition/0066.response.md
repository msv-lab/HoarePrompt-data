`dx` is incremented by 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is as follows:

Output State: **`dx` is `dx + 1`, `dy` is the same as the initial state, `ops` (next operation) is the same as the initial state, `ux` is the same as the initial state, `uy` is the same as the initial state, `res` is the same as the initial state, `op` (next operation) is the same as the initial state.**
