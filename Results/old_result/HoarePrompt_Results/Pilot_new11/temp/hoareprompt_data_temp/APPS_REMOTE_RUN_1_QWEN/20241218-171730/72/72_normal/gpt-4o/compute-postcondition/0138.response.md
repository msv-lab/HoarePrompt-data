According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `col` and `m`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `col` is less than `m`. At the end of the previous iteration, `col` is 0 and `m` is greater than 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `col` needs to be increased by 1, making it 1. Additionally, since `m` is greater than 0, the condition `col < m` will still hold true, allowing the loop to continue.

State: **`col` is 1, `m` is greater than 0**
