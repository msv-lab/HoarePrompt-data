`final_y` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`final_x` is 0; `final_y` is 1; `operations` is a non-empty string; `x` and `y` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5; and the current operation in `operations` is 'U'.**
