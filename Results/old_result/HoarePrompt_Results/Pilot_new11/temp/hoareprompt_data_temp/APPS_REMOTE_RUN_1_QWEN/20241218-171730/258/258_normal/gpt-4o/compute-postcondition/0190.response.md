Postcondition: ***`x1` is `meats[j][0]`, `y1` is `meats[j][1]`, `c1` is `meats[j][2]`, `x2` is `meats[N][0]`, `y2` is `meats[N][1]`, `c2` is `meats[N][2]`, `count` is the sum of `c` for each entry `(x, y, c)` in `meats` such that the distance between `(x, y)` and `(mx, my)` is less than or equal to `T`, `d` is \(\left(\frac{c1 \cdot T - c2 \cdot T}{c1 \cdot c2}\right)\), `dx` is \(\left(\frac{x1 - x2}{2}\right)\), `dy` is \(\left(\frac{y1 - y2}{2}\right)\), `d2` is \(\left(\left(\frac{x1 - x2}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y1 - y2}{2}\right)^2\right)\), `cx` is \(\left(\frac{x1 + x2}{2}\right)\), `cy` is \(\left(\frac{y1 + y2}{2}\right)\), `my` is \(cy - dx \cdot \sqrt{\left(\left(\frac{x1 - x2}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y1 - y2}{2}\right)^2\right) \cdot d - d^2} / \left(\left(\frac{x1 - x2}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y1 - y2}{2}\right)^2\right)\).***

This postcondition covers both the if and else parts (in this case, the else part is empty). The values of the variables are updated based on the condition `c1 * T < c2 * T`, ensuring that the overall state of the program is correctly described.
