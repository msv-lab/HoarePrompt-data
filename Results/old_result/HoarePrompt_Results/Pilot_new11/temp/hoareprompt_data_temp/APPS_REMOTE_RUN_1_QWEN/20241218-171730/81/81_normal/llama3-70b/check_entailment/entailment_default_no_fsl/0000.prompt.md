You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Today on Informatics class Nastya learned about GCD and LCM (see links below). Nastya is very intelligent, so she solved all the tasks momentarily and now suggests you to solve one of them as well.

We define a pair of integers (a, b) good, if GCD(a, b) = x and LCM(a, b) = y, where GCD(a, b) denotes the greatest common divisor of a and b, and LCM(a, b) denotes the least common multiple of a and b.

You are given two integers x and y. You are to find the number of good pairs of integers (a, b) such that l ≤ a, b ≤ r. Note that pairs (a, b) and (b, a) are considered different if a ≠ b.


-----Input-----

The only line contains four integers l, r, x, y (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 10^9).


-----Output-----

In the only line print the only integer — the answer for the problem.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 2 1 2

Output
2

Input
1 12 1 12

Output
4

Input
50 100 3 30

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example there are two suitable good pairs of integers (a, b): (1, 2) and (2, 1).

In the second example there are four suitable good pairs of integers (a, b): (1, 12), (12, 1), (3, 4) and (4, 3).

In the third example there are good pairs of integers, for example, (3, 30), but none of them fits the condition l ≤ a, b ≤ r.
Functions with output description for each function:
(l, r, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
count = 0
for a in range(l, r + 1):
    for b in range(a, r + 1):
        if func_1(a, b) == x and func_2(a, b) == y:
            count += 1
print(count)

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, where `a` is greater than or equal to `b` and both are greater than 0. It computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. After the loop completes, `a` contains the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`, and `b` is set to 0. This process handles the case where `a` and `b` are equal (both become the GCD), and also ensures that `b` is always reduced until it reaches 0, making `a` the GCD. The function returns the computed GCD (`a`) and sets `b` to 0.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b // func_1(a, b)
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\). It computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the function `func_1(a, b)`. The function then returns the result of `a * b // func_1(a, b)`. This means the function returns the product of `a` and `b` divided by their GCD. 

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- If `a` or `b` is 1, the GCD will be 1, and the result will be `a * b`, since \(1 * n // 1 = n\) for any integer `n`.
- If both `a` and `b` are the same, the GCD will be `a` (or `b`), and the result will be `a^2 // a = a`.
- If either `a` or `b` is 0, the function will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` because `a * b // func_1(a, b)` would involve division by zero, as the GCD of any number and 0 is the number itself, leading to a division by the number when `a` or `b` is 0. Therefore, the function should handle such cases appropriately to avoid errors.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
