According to the given for loop and the conditions described, we need to determine how each variable will change at the start of the next iteration.

1. **`remaining_questions`**: The problem does not specify any changes to this variable within the loop, so it remains the same.
2. **`col`**: The loop increments `col` by 1 at each iteration, so at the start of the next iteration, `col` will be `col + 1`.
3. **`m`**: The value of `m` remains unchanged within the loop.
4. **`max_questions`**: The value of `max_questions` can either be increased by 1 or decreased by 1, but without specific conditions provided, we cannot determine its exact value at the start of the next iteration.
5. **`row`**: The value of `row` can change based on certain conditions:
   - If `row != -1`, `row` is set to `row + 3`.
   - If `direction == 1` and `row != -1`, `row` could be set to `row_initial - 3` or `row_initial + direction`.
6. **`sergei_questions`**: The value of `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1 only if `row == x` and `col == y` and `row != -1`.

Given that the loop iterates over `col` from 0 to `m-1`, the first thing to note is that `col` will increase by 1 at the start of the next iteration. Therefore, we need to adjust `col` accordingly.

Since `row` and `sergei_questions` can change based on specific conditions and there is no clear indication of their exact new values, we will consider them as they are. However, `max_questions` can change but we cannot determine its exact new value without more information.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

- `remaining_questions` remains the same.
- `col` increases by 1.
- `m` remains the same.
- `max_questions` can either be increased by 1 or decreased by 1.
- `row` and `sergei_questions` remain as they were unless specific conditions apply.

State: **`remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `col` is 2, `m` is greater than 0, `max_questions` is either increased by 1 or decreased by 1, `row` is either `row_initial - 3` or `row_initial + direction` (only if `direction == 1`), `row` is equal to `row + 3` (only if `row != -1`), and `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1 if `row == x` and `col == y` (only if `row != -1`). If `row` equals `-1`, no changes occur to the variables' values.**
