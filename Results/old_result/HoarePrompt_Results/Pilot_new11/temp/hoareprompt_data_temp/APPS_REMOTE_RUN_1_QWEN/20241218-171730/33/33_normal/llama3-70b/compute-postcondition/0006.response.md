`curr_lat` is updated by adding `t / 111.195` to its current value. The initial value of `curr_lat` is 90. Since `t` is an integer, `t / 111.195` will result in a floating-point number. The output state will show the new value of `curr_lat` after this operation.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `curr_lat` is 90 + t / 111.195, `t` is an integer, `dir` is 'North'**
