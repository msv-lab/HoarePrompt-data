#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers, where x and y represent the positive integers \(a\) and \(b\) from the problem description.
def func_1(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`; `y` is 0.
    return x
    #The program returns x, which is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of x and y, given that y is 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integers `x` and `y`. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. The function iteratively updates `x` and `y` such that `x` becomes `y` and `y` becomes `x % y` until `y` is 0. At this point, `x` holds the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`. The function then returns `x`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `x` is the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`, and `y` is 0. An edge case to consider is when either `x` or `y` is 0; in such cases, the function still correctly computes the GCD.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: m, a, and b are integers such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\) and \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^5\).
def func_2(m, a, b):
    g = func_1(a, b)
    if (g != 1) :
        return func_2(m // g, a // g, b // g) * g
        #The program returns the value of `func_2(m // g, a // g, b // g)` multiplied by `g`
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\), `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^5\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 10^5\), `g` is the return value of `func_1(a, b)`, and \(g\) is equal to 1
    k = a + b - 1
    if (m < k) :
        return (m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2
        #The program returns ((m + 1) * (m + 2)) // 2, where m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9 and the current value of m is less than k, and k is equal to a + b - 1, with a and b being integers such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ b ≤ 10^5
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\), `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^5\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 10^5\), `g` is equal to 1, `k` is `a + b - 1`, and \(m \geq a + b - 1\)
    sum_k = k * (k + 1) // 2
    sum_m = m * (m + 1) // 2 - k * (k - 1) // 2
    return sum_k + sum_m
    #`The program returns sum_k + sum_m where sum_k is (a + b - 1) * (a + b) // 2 and sum_m is m * (m + 1) // 2 - (a + b - 1) * (a + b - 2) // 2`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts three integers `m`, `a`, and `b` such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\) and \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^5\). It performs the following actions based on the GCD of `m`, `a`, and `b`:

1. If the GCD of `m`, `a`, and `b` (stored in `g`) is not 1, the function recursively calls itself with `m`, `a`, and `b` divided by `g` and multiplies the result by `g`. This ensures that `m`, `a`, and `b` are reduced to their coprime form.
2. If the current value of `m` is less than `k` (where `k` is `a + b - 1`), the function returns \(((m + 1) * (m + 2)) // 2\).
3. Otherwise, the function calculates two sums: `sum_k` as \((a + b - 1) * (a + b) // 2\) and `sum_m` as \(m * (m + 1) // 2 - (a + b - 1) * (a + b - 2) // 2\), then returns their sum.

This function effectively computes a specific mathematical expression based on the initial values of `m`, `a`, and `b`, reducing the problem size in the first case and performing calculations in the other cases.
