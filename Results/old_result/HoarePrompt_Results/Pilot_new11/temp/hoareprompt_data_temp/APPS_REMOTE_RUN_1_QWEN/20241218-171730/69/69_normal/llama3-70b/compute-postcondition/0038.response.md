Output State: **`ops` is a non-empty string, `ux` is the final x-coordinate after processing all operations in `ops`, `uy` is the final y-coordinate after processing all operations in `ops`.**

Explanation:
- The loop processes each operation in the string `ops`.
- For each 'U' operation, `uy` is incremented by 1.
- For each 'D' operation, `uy` is decremented by 1.
- For each 'R' operation, `ux` is incremented by 1.
- For each 'L' operation, `ux` is decremented by 1.
- If `ops` is an empty string, the loop does not execute, and the values of `ux` and `uy` remain their initial values (0).

After all iterations of the loop, `ux` and `uy` will reflect the net movement based on the operations in `ops`. Therefore, the output state after the loop executes is that `ux` is the final x-coordinate and `uy` is the final y-coordinate after processing all operations in `ops`.
