`a` is multiplied by 3. Since `a` is initially less than or equal to 2, multiplying it by 3 results in a new value for `a` which is less than or equal to 6. The value of `b` and `years` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is less than or equal to 6, `b` is either 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10, and `years` is 1**
