Let's analyze the given information step by step to determine what needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given Information
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\).
- `low` and `high` are set such that `low <= high`.
- `left` is `mid - 2`.
- `func_1(left)` must be equal to `m`.

### Loop Condition
The loop condition is `while func_1(left) == m:`.

### Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `m` is an integer within the specified range.
- `low` and `high` satisfy `low <= high`.
- `left = mid - 2`.
- `func_1(left) == m`.

### Analysis
For the loop to continue executing, the condition `func_1(left) == m` must remain true after the loop body executes. This means that the function `func_1` must still return the value `m` when evaluated at `left`.

### What Needs to Be Adjusted
Since the loop continues based on the result of `func_1(left)`, and we know `func_1(left) == m` at the end of the previous iteration, the only thing that could change is the value of `left` in the loop body. However, since no modifications to `left` are mentioned, and the loop condition directly references `func_1(left)`, there is no direct modification to the state that would break the condition `func_1(left) == m`.

Therefore, the state remains unchanged from the previous iteration as long as the loop body does not alter the value of `left` in a way that would make `func_1(left) != m`.

### Conclusion
No adjustments are necessary to the current state because the loop condition `func_1(left) == m` is already satisfied and there are no changes to `left` that would break this condition.

### Final Answer
State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `low` and `high` are set such that `low <= high`; `left` is `mid - 2`; and `func_1(left)` must be equal to `m`**.
