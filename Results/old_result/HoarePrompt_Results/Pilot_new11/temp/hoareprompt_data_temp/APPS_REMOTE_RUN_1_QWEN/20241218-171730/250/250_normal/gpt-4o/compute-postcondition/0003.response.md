The code initializes the variable `x_found` to `False`. This assignment does not affect the values of `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `marks_set`, or `marks`. Therefore, the only change is the assignment of `False` to `x_found`.

Output State: **`n` is the length of `marks` before removing duplicates, `l` is the maximum value in `marks`, `x` is its original value, `y` is its original value, `marks_set` is a set containing unique elements from `marks`, `marks` is a list of integers derived from the input, `x_found` is `False`.**
