`bits.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 58) to the list `bits`. The initial value of `bits` is a list containing the value 60. After appending 58, the list `bits` will contain both 60 and 58.

Output State: **`i` is 58, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\), and `bits` is a list containing the values 60 and 58**
