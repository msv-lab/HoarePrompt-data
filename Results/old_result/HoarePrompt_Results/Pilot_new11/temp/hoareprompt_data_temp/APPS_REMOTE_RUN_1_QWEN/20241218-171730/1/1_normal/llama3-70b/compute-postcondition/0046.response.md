The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or conditional block. Since there is no loop or conditional block specified in the given code snippet, the only effect of the `break` statement is to indicate that the program would exit the nearest loop or conditional block. However, since no such structure is present, the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is the input string, `n` must be greater than 0, `ind` is the index of the first `:` after the first `[` in the string, `f` is a boolean value which became `True` if the character at position `i` in `s` was `':'` and `bind` was set to `i`, otherwise `f` remains `False` and `bind` remains `-1`, `i` is `n - 2`, `bind` is `n - 2`. We break out of the nearest loop or conditional block.**
