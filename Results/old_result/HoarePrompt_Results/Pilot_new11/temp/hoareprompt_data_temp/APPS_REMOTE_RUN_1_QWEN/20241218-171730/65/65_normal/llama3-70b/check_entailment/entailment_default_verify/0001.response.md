Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is not entirely accurate because the program does not explicitly handle the case where `n` and `k` are outside the range 1 to 100. Although the provided code implicitly assumes valid inputs, the problem description specifically states that `n` and `k` should be within the range 1 to 100. If `n` or `k` are outside this range, the program should either raise an error or handle these cases appropriately. Since the program does not do so, it fails to fully meet the problem requirements. Therefore, the final assessment is **False**.
