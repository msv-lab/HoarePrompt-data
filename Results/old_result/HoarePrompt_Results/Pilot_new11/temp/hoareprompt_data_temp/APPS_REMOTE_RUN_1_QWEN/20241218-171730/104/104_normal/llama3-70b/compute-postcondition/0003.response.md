According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, we know that `n` is an integer input, and the list `a` is a list of integers entered by the user; `max_erase` is 0. To ensure the loop can execute, `n` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `n` must be greater than 0.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `max_erase` is 0**
