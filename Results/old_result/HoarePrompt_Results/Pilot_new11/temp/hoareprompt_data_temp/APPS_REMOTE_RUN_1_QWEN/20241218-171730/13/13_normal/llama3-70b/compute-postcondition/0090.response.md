Postcondition: ***`i` is a non-negative integer, `j` is `n`, `beauty` is the number of consecutive 'G's from index `i-1` to the first 'S' or the end of the string `s`, `left` is the index of the last 'G' in the string `s`, or `n` if there are no 'G's, `right` is `n`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is 0, `max_beauty_one_swap` is `beauty` if `beauty` > 0, else 0, and `golden` is a list of indices of all characters in `s` that are equal to 'G'. If `s[i]` is 'G' and `s[i+1]` is 'S', `max_beauty_one_swap` is updated to `beauty`; otherwise, `max_beauty_one_swap` remains unchanged.***
