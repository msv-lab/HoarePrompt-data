`ux` is decremented by 1. Since the initial value of `ux` is not specified in the initial state, let's denote it as `ux_initial`. After executing the code, `ux` becomes `ux_initial - 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`ux` is `ux_initial - 1`, `ops` is a non-empty string, and `op` is not equal to 'U', `op` is not equal to 'D', `op` is not equal to 'R'. The current value of `op` is 'L'.**
