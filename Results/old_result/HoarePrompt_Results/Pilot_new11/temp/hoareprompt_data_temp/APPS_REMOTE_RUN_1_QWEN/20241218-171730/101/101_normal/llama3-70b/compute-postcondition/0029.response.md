Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `white_pixels` must contain at least one tuple.
   - `m` must be greater than or equal to 1.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`.

3. **Loop Body**: The loop body is omitted, but we need to consider how the conditions and states change based on the given rules.

4. **Key Conditions to Check**:
   - For each `j` in the range `[0, m-1]`, we need to ensure that the conditions related to `white_pixels` and the pixel values (`pixels[i][j]`) hold true or fail as needed.

5. **Analyzing the Loop**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `j` and the only condition we need to ensure is related to `j` changing, we need to check if `j` can be incremented to the next value.

6. **State Changes**:
   - `n` remains unchanged because the loop does not affect `n`.
   - `white_pixels` remains unchanged because the loop does not modify `white_pixels`.
   - `m` remains unchanged because the loop does not modify `m`.

7. **Incrementing `j`**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was some value within the range `[0, m-1]`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `m-1` (so it can increment to `j+1`).

Given these points, let's update the state:

- Since `j` needs to be incremented and the loop should continue, `j` must be less than `m-1`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `white_pixels` must contain at least one tuple, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` must be less than `m-1`**.
