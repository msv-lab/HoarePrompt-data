`left` is incremented by 1. The initial values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is: `sofas` must have at least one tuple, `left` is 1, `right` is 0, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, and the current value of `s` is not equal to `sofa`. Additionally, the first tuple in `sofas` has its first element less than the first element of `s` and its second element equal to the second element of `s`.

Output State: **`sofas` must have at least one tuple, `left` is 1, `right` is 0, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, and the current value of `s` is not equal to `sofa`. Additionally, the first tuple in `sofas` has its first element less than the first element of `s` and its second element equal to the second element of `s`.**
