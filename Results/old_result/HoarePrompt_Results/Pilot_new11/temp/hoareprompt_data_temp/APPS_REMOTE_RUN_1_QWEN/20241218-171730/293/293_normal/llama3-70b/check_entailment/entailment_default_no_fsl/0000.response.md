Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the described algorithm. According to the problem description, Amr follows a specific path through the binary tree by alternating between moving left ('L') and right ('R'), and skipping commands if the destination node is already visited. However, the code simply divides `n` by 2 and adjusts the `ans` variable based on whether `n` is even or odd, which does not accurately simulate the described traversal logic.

For example, consider the input `2 3`. The correct path should be: root (1) -> right (3) -> parent (2) -> left (1) -> parent (2) -> right (3). This results in visiting 5 nodes (excluding the exit node). However, the code would incorrectly compute the result as 3, because it only counts the necessary steps without considering the skipping and backtracking rules.

To correctly implement the algorithm, the code needs to simulate the path step-by-step, considering the skipping and backtracking rules. The current implementation does not handle these rules, leading to incorrect results for many cases.
