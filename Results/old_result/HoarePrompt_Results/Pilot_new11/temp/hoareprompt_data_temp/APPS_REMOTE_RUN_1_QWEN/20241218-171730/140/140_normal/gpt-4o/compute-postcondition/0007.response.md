The code `in_degree[v] += 1` increments the value of `in_degree[v]` by 1. Since `in_degree[v]` can be 0, 1, or 2 initially, after incrementing it by 1, the new value of `in_degree[v]` will be 1, 2, or 3 respectively. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`graph` must have at least one key, `in_degree` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex and the corresponding value is now 1, 2, or 3 (depending on the original value which was incremented by 1), `u` is a vertex in `graph`, and `v` is the next adjacency vertex of `u` in `graph`.**
