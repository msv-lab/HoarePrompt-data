The code snippet updates the `max_len` variable by taking the maximum of its current value and the length of the `substr` substring. Given the precondition, `substr` is a non-palindromic substring, and `max_len` is the maximum length of any non-palindromic substring found from index `i + 1` to any valid end index `j`.

Since the code directly updates `max_len` to be the maximum of its current value and the length of `substr`, we know the following:
- `max_len` will now be at least the length of `substr`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `max_len` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the length of `substr`.
- `i` remains a valid starting index such that `i + 1` is within bounds of `s`.
- `s` remains a non-empty string.
- `n` remains greater than `i + 1`.
- `substr` remains the substring of `s` from index `i` to index `j-1` and is not equal to its reverse (`substr != substr[::-1]`).

Output State: **`max_len` is the maximum of its current value and the length of `substr`, `i` is a valid starting index such that `i + 1` is within bounds of `s`, `s` is a non-empty string, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, and `substr` is the substring of `s` from index `i` to index `j-1` and is not equal to its reverse (`substr != substr[::-1]`).**
