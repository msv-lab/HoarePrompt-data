Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The program attempts to calculate the Least Common Multiple (LCM) using a flawed formula. The formula used in the `lcm` calculation is incorrect because it does not properly compute the LCM for multiple numbers. Specifically, the program incorrectly assumes that the product of the numbers divided by their pairwise GCDs gives the LCM, which is not valid. This leads to incorrect results, as demonstrated by the example input `(4, 2, 3)`, where the program outputs 'YES' but the correct output should be 'NO'. The output hints confirm that the `func_1` function correctly computes the GCD using the Euclidean algorithm, but this is insufficient to correct the overall LCM calculation. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description and produces incorrect results.
