The code `data = input().split()` takes user input and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. The initial state values of `n` and `cakes` remain unchanged. The variable `data` is assigned the result of splitting the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of simple cakes, `cakes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers representing the radius and height of the i-th cake, respectively, and `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.**
