The code `in_degree[neighbor] -= 1` decreases the value of `in_degree[neighbor]` by 1. Based on the initial state, `neighbor` is the next neighbor in `graph[node]`, and `in_degree[node]` is decreased by 1. The other variables are not directly affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `node` is the next neighbor in `graph[node]`
- `queue` contains all the remaining elements from its initial state except for the first element and possibly includes the neighbor whose in-degree became 0
- `count` is increased by 1
- `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1 from its original value

Output State: **`node` is the next neighbor in `graph[node]`, `queue` contains all the remaining elements from its initial state except for the first element and possibly includes the neighbor whose in-degree became 0, `count` is increased by 1, `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1 from its original value**
