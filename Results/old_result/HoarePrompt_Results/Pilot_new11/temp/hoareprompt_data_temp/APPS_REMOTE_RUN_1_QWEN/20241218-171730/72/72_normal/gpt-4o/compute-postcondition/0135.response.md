The code `row += 2` increments the value of `row` by 2. Given that the initial state of `row` is -1, after the code execution, `row` will be `-1 + 2`, which is `1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`col` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `row` is 1, `col` is not equal to `y`, and `max_questions` is `max_questions - 1`; `direction` is 1**
