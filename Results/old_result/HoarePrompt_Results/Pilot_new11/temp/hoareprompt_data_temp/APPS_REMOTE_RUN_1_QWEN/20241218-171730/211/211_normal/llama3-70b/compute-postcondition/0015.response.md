`l` is assigned the value `1`. The value of `l` is now 1, but the values of the other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is calculated as the cumulative sum of the first `i` elements of the list `a`, `a` is a list of integers based on the input, `prefix_sum[0]` is always 0, `prefix_sum[i + 1]` for `0 <= i < n` is the sum of the first `i + 1` elements of `a`, `prefix_sum[n]` is not equal to 0, `k` is 1, `l` is 1**
