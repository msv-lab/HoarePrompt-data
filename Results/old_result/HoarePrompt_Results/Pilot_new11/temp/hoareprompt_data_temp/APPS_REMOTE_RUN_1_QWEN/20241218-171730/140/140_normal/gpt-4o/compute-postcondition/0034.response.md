`queue` is appended with the value of `neighbor`. The other variables are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state includes the updated queue and the unchanged other variables.

Output State: **`node` is the value that was at the front of the queue and removed, `queue` is the original queue with the front element removed and then appended with `neighbor`, `count` is increased by 1, `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1 and is now 0**
