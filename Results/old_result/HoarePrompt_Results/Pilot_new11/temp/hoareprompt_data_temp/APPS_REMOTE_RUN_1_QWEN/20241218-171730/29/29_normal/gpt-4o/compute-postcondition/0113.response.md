`temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The previous value of `temp_counter` was \(2 \times n + 1\), so after incrementing by 1, `temp_counter` is now \(2 \times n + 2\).

Output State: **`regulars` still has at least one element, `i = (\text{initial } i) + 2`, `target` is \(\text{len(examples)} + (\text{initial } i) + 3\), `temp_counter = 2 \times n + 2`, `str(temp_counter - 1)` must be in `files_set`, `moves` now contains a new element: `f'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}'`.**
