Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iteratively triples Limak's weight and doubles Bob's weight until Limak's weight becomes strictly greater than Bob's weight. The number of years required is counted and printed. The code handles all given examples and potential cases within the constraints \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10\). The loop will terminate once Limak's weight exceeds Bob's weight, ensuring the correct output for every valid input within the specified range.
