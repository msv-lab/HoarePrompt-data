Postcondition: ***`i` is 2. If `examples[i]` is "4", then `temp_counter` is 8, `n` must be at least 1, `moves` is a list containing the strings `'move 2 5'`, `'move 2 2'`, `'move 2 8'`, and `'move 4 3'`. If `examples[i]` is "3", then `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 2`, `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`, `n` must be at least 1, and `moves` is a list containing the strings `'move 2 {temp_counter}'` and `'move 2 2'`.***
