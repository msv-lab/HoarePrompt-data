The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers with the constraint that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000 and 0 ≤ `k` ≤ 1000. The function has two cases:
- Case_1: If `k` is less than `n`, the function returns `k`.
- Case_2: If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the function returns `n`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, and return `k` if `k` is less than `n`, otherwise return `n`.
