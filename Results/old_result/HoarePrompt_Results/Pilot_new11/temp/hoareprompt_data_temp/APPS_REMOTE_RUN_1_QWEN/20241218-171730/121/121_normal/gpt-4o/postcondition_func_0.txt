The function processes a genome string \(s\) and determines if replacing '?' characters with 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T' results in each character having a count less than or equal to \(n/4\), where \(n\) is the length of the genome string. If any character count exceeds \(n/4\), the function prints '===' and returns. Otherwise, it replaces each '?' in the string with the character that has the smallest count and increments its count until all '?' are replaced. Finally, it prints the modified genome string.
