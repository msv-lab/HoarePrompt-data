Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic to check if it is possible to buy some amount of bottles of Ber-Cola and Bars bars and spend exactly \( n \) burles. The code iterates through possible values of \( x \) (number of Ber-Cola bottles) and checks if the remaining amount of money can be exactly divided by \( b \) (cost of one Bars bar). If such a combination is found, it prints "YES" along with the values of \( x \) and \( y \) (where \( y = \frac{n - x \cdot a}{b} \)). If no such combination is found, it prints "NO".

The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. It correctly checks all possible combinations of \( x \) and \( y \) without missing any possibilities. Therefore, the code meets the requirements for every potential case.
