The code initializes the `in_degree` dictionary with keys ranging from 1 to `n`, and assigns each key an initial value of 0. This means that for every vertex in the graph, the initial in-degree is set to 0. The graph itself is not modified by this code.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex (an integer between 1 and n inclusive) and the corresponding value is a list of vertices representing the outgoing edges from that vertex; `in_degree` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex (an integer between 1 and n inclusive) and the corresponding value is 0.**
