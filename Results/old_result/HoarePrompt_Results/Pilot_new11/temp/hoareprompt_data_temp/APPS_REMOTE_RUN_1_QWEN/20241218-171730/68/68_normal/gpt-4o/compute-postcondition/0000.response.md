The code `x, y, z = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `x`, `y`, and `z`. Since the initial state specifies that `x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers between 0 and 100, the output state will reflect this constraint after the input is taken.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, `z` are non-negative integers between 0 and 100, they are assigned values from the input split and converted to integers**
