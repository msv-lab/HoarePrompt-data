The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. Since the initial values of `a` and `b` are not modified by this line of code, they retain their initial state. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `n` and the unchanged values of `a` and `b`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10 000 000, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10 000 000**
