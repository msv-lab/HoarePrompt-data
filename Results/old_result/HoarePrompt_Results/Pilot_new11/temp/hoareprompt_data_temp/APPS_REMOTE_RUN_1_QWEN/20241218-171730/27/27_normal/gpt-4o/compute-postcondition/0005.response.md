The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to handle real numbers `x`, `y`, and `z` with exactly one digit after the decimal point, ranging from 0.1 to 200.0 inclusive, but since these parameters are not passed to the function, we can only describe the constraints on the parameters without detailing the function's behavior.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and deals with real numbers x, y, and z with exactly one digit after the decimal point, ranging from 0.1 to 200.0 inclusive.**
