Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It processes two positive integers \(a\) and \(b\) (where \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10\)) and calculates the minimum number of years required for \(a\) to become greater than \(b\) through repeated tripling of \(a\) and doubling of \(b\). The output hints align with the code, indicating that the function correctly updates the weights of Limak and Bob until \(a > b\), and then prints the number of years required. The code handles all given examples and potential cases within the constraints specified, ensuring that Limak's weight will eventually exceed Bob's weight. Therefore, the program is correct for every potential case.
