Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic for determining the number of times each pupil is asked. Specifically, the formula for `sergei_asked` is incorrect. The formula `(k + x - 1) // (2 * n) + ((k + x - 1) % (2 * n) >= n - x + 1)` does not accurately reflect the pattern of asking pupils in the described manner. 

To illustrate, consider the second test case from the examples:
- For \( n = 4 \), \( m = 2 \), \( k = 9 \), \( x = 4 \), \( y = 2 \), the correct answer should be \( 1, 1, 1 \). However, the given code produces incorrect results because it does not properly account for the back-and-forth pattern of asking pupils across rows.

A correct implementation would need to accurately track the number of times each pupil is asked, taking into account the back-and-forth nature of the questioning pattern.
