The code prints the list `a` using `' '.join(map(str, a))`. This operation converts each element of the list `a` to a string and joins them with a space. However, this operation does not modify any variables. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is 0, `a` is a sorted list in descending order, `i` is the length of the original list `a`, `k` is an integer obtained from input(), `x` is `i - 1`, printed 'Yes'**
