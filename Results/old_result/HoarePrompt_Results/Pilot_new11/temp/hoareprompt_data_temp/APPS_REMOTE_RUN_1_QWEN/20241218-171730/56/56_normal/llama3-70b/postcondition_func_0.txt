The function processes two inputs, `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) and `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5). It first checks if `n` is less than `k`. If true, it prints 'No'. Otherwise, it iterates to find the highest powers of 2 that can be subtracted from `n` until `n` becomes 0, storing these values in a list `a`. After the iteration, it checks if the length of `a` is less than `k`. If true, it prints 'No'. Otherwise, it sorts the list `a` in descending order and prints 'Yes' followed by the elements of `a` in the sorted order. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return anything. An edge case is when `n` is exactly equal to `2
