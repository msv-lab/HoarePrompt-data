`b` is multiplied by 2. Initially, `b` can be one of the values 4, 8, 12, 16, or 20. After multiplying by 2, the new values of `b` will be 8, 16, 24, 32, or 40 respectively. The condition that `a` must be less than or equal to the current value of `b` in the next iteration remains valid.

Output State: **`a` is less than or equal to 6 \* 3, `b` is either 8, 16, 24, 32, or 40, and `a` must be less than or equal to the current value of `b` in the next iteration.**
