The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the constraints and relationships provided, the function should process an integer `n` such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), and a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'. 

Given the output cases, the function returns a specific value based on the input string.

Step-by-step:
- The function processes an integer `n` where \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- It also processes a string of length `n` where each character is either 'G' (representing golden trophies) or 'S' (representing silver trophies).

The output cases indicate:
- Case_1: The function returns a value based on the string. If the string contains at least one 'G', the function returns 'Golden'.
- Case_2: If the string contains no 'G' only 'S', the function returns 'Silver'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept an integer `n` and a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S', and return 'Golden' if there is at least one 'G' in the string, otherwise return 'Silver'.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` and a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S', and returns 'Golden' if there is at least one 'G' in the string, otherwise returns 'Silver'.**
