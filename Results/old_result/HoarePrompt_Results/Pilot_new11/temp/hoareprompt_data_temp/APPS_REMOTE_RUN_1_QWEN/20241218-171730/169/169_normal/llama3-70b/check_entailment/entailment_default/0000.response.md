Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the problem description. Specifically, the code calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' in the string and prints 0 if the number of '-' is greater than the number of '+'. However, the problem requires finding the minimal possible number of stones in the pile after performing the operations, starting from some initial number of stones.

For instance, consider the following cases:

1. **Input:**
   ```
   3
   ---
   ```
   - The code would print `0`, but the correct answer should be `0` because the pile starts with at least 3 stones, and after removing 3 stones, the pile will have 0 stones.

2. **Input:**
   ```
   5
   +++-
   ```
   - The code would print `2`, but the correct answer should be `2` because the pile starts with at least 2 stones, and after the sequence of operations, the pile will have 2 stones remaining.

3. **Input:**
   ```
   4
   ----
   ```
   - The code would print `0`, but the correct answer should be `0` because the pile starts with at least 4 stones, and after removing all 4 stones, the pile will have 0 stones.

The code fails to account for the initial number of stones in the pile, which must be at least the maximum number of stones removed. Therefore, the provided code does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
