The code `cycle.append(x)` appends the value of `x` to the `cycle` list. Given the initial state, `x` is 1, and `cycle` is initially `[2]`. After appending `x` (which is 1) to `cycle`, the new value of `cycle` will be `[2, 1]`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `visited[0]` is True, `visited[2]` is True, `cycle` is [2, 1], `x` is 1, `visited[1]` is True, all nodes in the cycle have `visited` set to False, `cycles` now includes the `cycle` list.**
