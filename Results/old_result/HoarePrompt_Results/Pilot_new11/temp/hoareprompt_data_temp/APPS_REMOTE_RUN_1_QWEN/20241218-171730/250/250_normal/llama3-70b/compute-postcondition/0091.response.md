Output State: **`additional_marks` is a non-empty list containing elements that satisfy \(i + j \leq l\) and are not already present in `marks`, and includes all such elements that meet the conditions during the loop execution. `i` is the next element in the `marks` list.**

### Explanation:
- **`additional_marks`**: This list starts as a non-empty list containing elements that satisfy the conditions \(i + j \leq l\) and are not already present in `marks`. During each iteration of the loop, if the condition `i + j <= l` and `i + j not in marks` is met, the value `i + j` is appended to `additional_marks`. Therefore, after all iterations, `additional_marks` will contain all elements that satisfy these conditions.
- **`i`**: The value of `i` changes to the next element in the `marks` list after each iteration. By the end of the loop, `i` will be the last element in `marks`.

Since the loop continues until there are no more elements in `additional_marks` that meet the conditions, the final state of `additional_marks` will be such that it contains all possible elements derived from `i` and any `j` in `additional_marks` that satisfy the conditions \(i + j \leq l\) and are not already in `marks`. If the loop does not execute at all (i.e., `additional_marks` is empty from the start), then `additional_marks` remains an empty list.
