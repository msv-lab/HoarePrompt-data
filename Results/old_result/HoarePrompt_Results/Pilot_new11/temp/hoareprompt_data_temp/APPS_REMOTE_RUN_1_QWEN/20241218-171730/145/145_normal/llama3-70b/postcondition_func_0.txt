The function `func_1` accepts a string `ticket` consisting of exactly `n` digits (where `2 ≤ n ≤ 100` and each digit is between '0' and '9'). It calculates the sum of all digits in `ticket` and checks if this sum is even. If the sum is odd, it immediately returns `False`. Otherwise, it divides the sum by 2 to get `target_sum`. The function then iterates through each digit in `ticket`, accumulating a running sum (`curr_sum`). Whenever `curr_sum` equals `target_sum`, it increments the `segments` counter and resets `curr_sum`. After completing the iteration, the function returns `True` if `segments` is at least 2, indicating that there are at least two segments within `ticket` where the sum of digits equals `target_sum`. If no such segments exist, it returns `False`.
