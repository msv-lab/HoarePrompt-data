You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: While Grisha was celebrating New Year with Ded Moroz, Misha gifted Sasha a small rectangular pond of size n × m, divided into cells of size 1 × 1, inhabited by tiny evil fishes (no more than one fish per cell, otherwise they'll strife!).

The gift bundle also includes a square scoop of size r × r, designed for fishing. If the lower-left corner of the scoop-net is located at cell (x, y), all fishes inside the square (x, y)...(x + r - 1, y + r - 1) get caught. Note that the scoop-net should lie completely inside the pond when used.

Unfortunately, Sasha is not that skilled in fishing and hence throws the scoop randomly. In order to not frustrate Sasha, Misha decided to release k fishes into the empty pond in such a way that the expected value of the number of caught fishes is as high as possible. Help Misha! In other words, put k fishes in the pond into distinct cells in such a way that when the scoop-net is placed into a random position among (n - r + 1)·(m - r + 1) possible positions, the average number of caught fishes is as high as possible.


-----Input-----

The only line contains four integers n, m, r, k (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m), 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n·m, 10^5)).


-----Output-----

Print a single number — the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes.

You answer is considered correct, is its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 9}. Namely, let your answer be a, and the jury's answer be b. Your answer is considered correct, if $\frac{|a - b|}{\operatorname{max}(1,|b|)} \leq 10^{-9}$.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3 2 3

Output
2.0000000000

Input
12 17 9 40

Output
32.8333333333



-----Note-----

In the first example you can put the fishes in cells (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3). In this case, for any of four possible positions of the scoop-net (highlighted with light green), the number of fishes inside is equal to two, and so is the expected value. [Image]
Functions with output description for each function:
import heapq
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
(n, m, r, k) = map(int, input().split())
print(f'{func_1(n, m, r, k):.10f}')

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(n, m, r, k):

    heap = []
    for x in range(n):
        for y in range(m):
            heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))
    total_coverage = 0
    for _ in range(k):
        (cov, x, y) = heapq.heappop(heap)
        total_coverage -= cov
    total_positions = (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)
    return total_coverage / total_positions
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts four integer parameters `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k`, where `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5`, `1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m)`, and `1 ≤ k ≤ min(n * m, 10^5)`. It calculates and returns the average coverage per position. The average coverage is determined by populating a min-heap with the negative coverage values for each cell `(x, y)` in an `n` by `m` grid, where each cell's coverage is given by the `coverage` function, which returns the number of possible scoop-net positions covering the cell `(x, y)`. The function then pops `k` elements from the heap and subtracts their coverage values from the total coverage. After these operations, it returns the total coverage divided by the total number of possible positions `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
1. If `k` is greater than the number of cells in the grid, the function will only process as many cells as available in the heap.
2. If `r` is equal to `min(n, m)`, the `coverage` of each cell would be 1, and the total coverage calculation would reflect this.
3. If `r` is 1, the grid effectively becomes a linear array, and the total coverage calculation would reflect this change in dimensions.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def coverage(x, y):
    return (min(x + 1, n - r + 1) - max(x - r + 1 + 1, 0)) * (min(y + 1, m - r + 1) - max(y - r + 1 + 1, 0))
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `coverage` accepts four parameters: `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m`, representing the coordinates of a cell in the pond, the dimensions of the pond, and the side length of the scoop-net, respectively. It returns the number of cells that can be covered by the scoop-net centered at the cell `(x, y)` within the pond dimensions `(n, m)`.

Given the constraints \(1 \leq n, m \leq 10^5\) and \(1 \leq r \leq \min(n, m)\), the function calculates the area of overlap between the scoop-net and the pond. Specifically, it computes the number of cells in the pond that fall within the scoop-net's boundaries, which are defined by the radius `r` from the center cell `(x, y)`.

The function returns the value \((\min(x + 1, n - r + 1) - \max(x - r + 2, 0)) \times (\min(y + 1, m - r + 1) - \max(y - r + 2, 0))\). This expression ensures that the calculation respects the boundaries of the pond and correctly accounts for the cells covered by the scoop-net.

Potential edge cases include when the center cell `(x, y)` is close to the edges of the pond, where the minimum values might reach the edge of the pond, leading to a non-positive width or height for the coverage area. In such cases, the function will correctly compute the number of cells within the valid boundaries.

There are no apparent missing functionalities in the provided code, as it accurately implements the intended logic.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
