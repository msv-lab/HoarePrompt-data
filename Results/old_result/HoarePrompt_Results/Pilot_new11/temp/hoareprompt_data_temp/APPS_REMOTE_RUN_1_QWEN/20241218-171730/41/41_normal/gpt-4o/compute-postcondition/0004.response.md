Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `n` is an integer input provided.
   - Each line contains two space-separated integers `a_i` and `b_i` such that \(1 \leq a_i, b_i \leq 4126\).
   - `ratings` is an empty list.
   - `is_rated` is `False`.
   - `is_unrated` is `False`.

2. **Loop Execution Condition**:
   - The loop runs for `n` iterations.
   - For each iteration, the loop reads one line containing two integers `a_i` and `b_i`.

3. **State Adjustments Required**:
   - Since the loop needs to run `n` times, `n` must be a positive integer (greater than 0).
   - Inside the loop, `a_i` and `b_i` are read from the input, but the initial state does not specify what values these variables will take during the loop.
   - The list `ratings` will be populated with the pairs `(a_i, b_i)` over the course of the loop.
   - The flags `is_rated` and `is_unrated` are not directly involved in the loop condition but might change inside the loop.

Given this analysis, the key states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `n` must be greater than 0.
- The list `ratings` will contain `n` pairs of integers after the loop completes.
- The flags `is_rated` and `is_unrated` are not specified to change due to the loop itself, so they can remain as `False`.

Therefore, the final state needed for the loop to execute is:

**`n` is greater than 0, `ratings` is an empty list that will contain `n` pairs of integers after the loop, `is_rated` is False, `is_unrated` is False.**

Putting this into the required format:

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `ratings` is an empty list, `is_rated` is False, `is_unrated` is False**
