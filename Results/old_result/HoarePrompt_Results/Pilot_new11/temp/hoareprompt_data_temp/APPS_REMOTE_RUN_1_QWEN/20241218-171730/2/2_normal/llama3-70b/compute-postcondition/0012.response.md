The code `max_num = i` assigns the current value of `i` (which is `i + 1`) to `max_num`. The initial state indicates that `max_sum` is the `digit_sum` of `i + 1`, and `max_num` remains unchanged. After executing the code, `max_num` will hold the value of `i + 1`.

Output State: **`digit_sum` is the sum of the digits of `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `max_sum` is `digit_sum`, `max_num` is `i + 1`**
