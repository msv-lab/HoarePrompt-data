`right_count[i]` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the range of `j` from `0` to `d-1` also remains unchanged. The values of `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j`, `d`, `x1`, and `x2` remain unchanged as well.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` ranges from 0 to `d-1`, `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[j]`, `y1_j` is the second element of `sofas[j]`, `x2_j` is the third element of `sofas[j]`, `y2_j` is the fourth element of `sofas[j]`, `d` is greater than 0, `right_count[i]` is 1, and `x1` is less than `x1_j` and `x2` is less than `x1_j`**
