The code `x = int(data[index])` assigns the value of `data[index]` converted to an integer to the variable `x`. Given that `index` is 5, `x` will take the value of `data[5]` converted to an integer. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`K` is the integer obtained from `data[1]`, `meats` is a list containing one element which is the tuple (`x`, `y`, `c`), `data` is a list of strings resulting from the split input, `N` must be greater than 1, `index` is 5, `x` is the integer value of `data[5]`, `y` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[4]`**
