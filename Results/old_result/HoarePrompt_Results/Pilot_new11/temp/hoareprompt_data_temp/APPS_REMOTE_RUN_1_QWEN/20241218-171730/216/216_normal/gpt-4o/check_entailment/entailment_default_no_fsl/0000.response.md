Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the conditions specified in the problem description. Specifically, the code does not ensure that there are no uppercase letters between the selected lowercase letters. Here is an example that demonstrates this issue:

For the input:
```
11
aaaaBaabAbA
```

The expected output is 2, as the positions 6 and 8 (or 7 and 8) can be chosen, containing the lowercase 'a' characters without any uppercase letters in between. However, the current implementation will not correctly identify this set of positions because it only checks for the absence of uppercase letters after each lowercase character, rather than ensuring there are no uppercase letters between any two selected lowercase characters.

To fix this, the code needs to keep track of the last selected position and ensure that any new position added to the set does not have an uppercase letter in between. This requires maintaining an additional variable to track the last selected position and checking for uppercase letters between this position and the new position before adding it to the set.
