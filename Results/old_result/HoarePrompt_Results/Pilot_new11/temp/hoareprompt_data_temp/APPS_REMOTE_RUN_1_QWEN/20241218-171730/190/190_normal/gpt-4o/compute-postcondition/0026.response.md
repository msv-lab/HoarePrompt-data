`min_cost` is reassigned to the value of `current_cost`. The value of `current_cost` is the minimum cumulative cost calculated during the loop execution, which remains unchanged. The value of `t` is `n + 1`, and the value of `best_t` is still `t`. The list `a` and its last element `length` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers, `min_cost` is `current_cost`, `best_t` is `t`, `t` is `n + 1`, `current_cost` is the minimum cumulative cost calculated during the loop execution based on the conditions given, and `length` is the last element in the list `a`.**
