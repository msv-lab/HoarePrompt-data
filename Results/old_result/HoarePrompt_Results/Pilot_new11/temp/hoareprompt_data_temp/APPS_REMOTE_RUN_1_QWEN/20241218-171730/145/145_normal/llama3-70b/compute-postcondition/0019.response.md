`curr_sum` is assigned the value of `curr_sum` plus the current `digit`. The initial value of `curr_sum` is not specified, but it starts from 0 if no previous value is given. The other variables (`ticket`, `total_sum`, `target_sum`, and `segments`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`curr_sum` is increased by the value of `digit`, `ticket` is a non-empty string of exactly `n` digits, `total_sum` is the sum of all digits in `ticket`, `target_sum` is `total_sum // 2`, and `segments` is either increased by 1 or remains unchanged.**
