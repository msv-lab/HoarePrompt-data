The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the user input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state mentions that `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5`. After executing this line of code, the value of `n` will be the integer input provided by the user within the specified range.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input provided by the user such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5`, the sequence of operations is a string consisting of 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R' characters, and the target coordinates (x, y) are integers such that `-10^9 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9`.**
