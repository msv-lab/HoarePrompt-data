Postcondition: **`n` is at least 0, `curr_lat` is within the range of -90 to 90, the output remains 'NO', `dir` is the second part of the input string, the value of `t` remains unchanged. If `dir` is 'North', then `curr_lat` is updated to `curr_lat + t / 111.195`. If `dir` is 'South', then `curr_lat` is updated to `curr_lat - t / 111.195`.**
