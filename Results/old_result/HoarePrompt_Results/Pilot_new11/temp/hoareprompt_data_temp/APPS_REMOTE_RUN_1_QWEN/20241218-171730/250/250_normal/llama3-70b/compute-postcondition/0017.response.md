The code sets `need_x` to `True`. This does not affect the values of `marks`, `i`, `j`, `need_x`, or `need_y`. Therefore, the only change is to the value of `need_x`.

Output State: **`marks` is a list of integers, `i` is the same as before, `j` is `j_end + 2`, `need_x` is `True`, and `need_y` is `True`.**
