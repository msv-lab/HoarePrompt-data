Postcondition: ***`nc` will be set to the next character in the sequence `'ACGT'`, `count` remains unchanged except for the value of `count[nc]` which is decreased by 1, and `res` is the concatenation of its current value with the next character in the sequence `'ACGT'` if `count[nc] > 0`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.***
