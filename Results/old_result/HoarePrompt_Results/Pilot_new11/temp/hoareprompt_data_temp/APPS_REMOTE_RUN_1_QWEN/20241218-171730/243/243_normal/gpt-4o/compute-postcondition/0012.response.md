The line `result = []` initializes the variable `result` as an empty list. This does not change the values of the other variables, but updates `result` to an empty list.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `low` is 0; `high` is \(5 \times (m + 1)\); `mid` is \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2}\); `result` is an empty list; `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`, and `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`.**
