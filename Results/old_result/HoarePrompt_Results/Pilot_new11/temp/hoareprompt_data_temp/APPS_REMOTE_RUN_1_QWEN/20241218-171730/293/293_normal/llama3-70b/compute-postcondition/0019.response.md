Let's analyze the given loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after the loop has executed.

### Initial State
- `h` is an integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 50\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2^h\).
- `ans` is `0`.

### Loop Code
```python
while n > 1:
    if n % 2 == 0:
        ans += n // 2 - 1
    else:
        ans += n // 2
    n //= 2
```

### Analysis of the Loop
1. **First Iteration:**
   - If `n` is even, `ans` is updated to `ans + (n // 2 - 1)`.
   - If `n` is odd, `ans` is updated to `ans + (n // 2)`.
   - `n` is halved (`n //= 2`).

2. **Second Iteration:**
   - If `n` was even in the first iteration, it becomes `n // 2` (which is still even or odd depending on the previous value).
   - If `n` was odd in the first iteration, it becomes `n // 2` (which is now even).

3. **General Iteration:**
   - The loop continues to halve `n` and update `ans` based on whether `n` is even or odd.
   - After each iteration, `n` is halved, so eventually, `n` will become 1 or less, and the loop will terminate.

### Final State
- After the loop terminates, `n` will be 1 (since it is halved until it reaches 1 or less).
- `ans` will be the sum of the contributions from each iteration based on the conditions described above.

Given the constraints:
- `h` remains unchanged since it does not affect the loop directly.
- `n` will be 1 after the loop.

### Determining the Value of `ans`
To find the exact value of `ans`, we need to consider the binary representation of `n` at the start. Each bit in the binary representation of `n` contributes to the value of `ans` based on its position.

- If `n` is even, `ans` is incremented by `n // 2 - 1`.
- If `n` is odd, `ans` is incremented by `n // 2`.

For `n = 2^k` (where `k` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `n`):
- The value of `ans` will be the sum of the positions of the 1s in the binary representation of `n`, minus the count of 1s (since each 1 contributes `1` and each 0 contributes `-1`).

### Final Output State
Since `n` will be 1 after the loop, and considering the binary representation, the final value of `ans` is derived from the binary representation of `n` at the start.

Output State: **`n` is 1, `h` is unchanged, `ans` is the sum of the positions of the 1s in the binary representation of the original value of `n`, minus the count of 1s**.
