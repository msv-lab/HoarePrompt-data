The value of `w` is increased by 1, meaning `w` is now 2. The code snippet `n //= 10` divides `n` by 10 and assigns the quotient back to `n`. However, since the initial value of `n` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact new value of `n` after the operation. We only know that `n` is now the integer quotient of its original value divided by 10.

Output State: **`w` is 2; `n` is the integer quotient of its original value divided by 10**
