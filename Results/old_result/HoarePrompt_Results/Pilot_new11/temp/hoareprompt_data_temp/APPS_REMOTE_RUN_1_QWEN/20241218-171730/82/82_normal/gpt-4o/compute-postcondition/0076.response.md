`current_lcm` is assigned the value returned by the function `func_2(new_a, new_b)`. The variables `new_a` and `new_b` are updated to \((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\). However, since the initial values of `candidate`, `a`, and `b` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `new_a` and `new_b`. But we know that `new_a` and `new_b` are adjusted such that they are multiples of `candidate`.

The output state is:
Output State: **`a` is `a`, `b` is `b`, `diff` is `diff`, `min_lcm` is `min_lcm`, `min_k` is `min_k`, `k` is `k`, `current_lcm` is `func_2(new_a, new_b)` where `new_a` and `new_b` are equal to \((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate**
