`temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Initially, `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 2`. Since `n` must be at least 1, let's assume the smallest value for `n`, which is 1, to determine the exact value of `temp_counter`. So, `temp_counter` is `2 * 1 + 2 = 4`. After incrementing by 1, `temp_counter` becomes `5`.

The states of the other variables (`i`, `examples[i]`, `moves`) are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `examples[i]` is "4", `temp_counter` is 5, `n` must be at least 1, and `moves` is a list containing the strings `'move 2 5'`, `'move 2 2'`, and `'move 2 {2 * n + 2}'`.**
