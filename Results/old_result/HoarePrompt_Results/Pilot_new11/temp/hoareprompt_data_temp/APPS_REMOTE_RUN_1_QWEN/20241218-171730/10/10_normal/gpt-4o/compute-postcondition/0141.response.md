`right_count[i]` is incremented by 1. Since `i` is equal to `j + 1`, the value of `right_count[i]` is updated accordingly. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` equals `j + 1`, `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[j]`, `y1_j` is the second element of `sofas[j]`, `x2_j` is the third element of `sofas[j]`, `y2_j` is the fourth element of `sofas[j]`, and `right_count[i]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`i` equals `j + 1`, `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[j]`, `y1_j` is the second element of `sofas[j]`, `x2_j` is the third element of `sofas[j]`, `y2_j` is the fourth element of `sofas[j]`, `right_count[i]` is incremented by 1**
