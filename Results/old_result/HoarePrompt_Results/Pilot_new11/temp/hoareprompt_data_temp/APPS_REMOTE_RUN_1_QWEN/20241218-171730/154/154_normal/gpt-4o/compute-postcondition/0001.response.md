The line `max_points = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `max_points`. This is the only assignment made in the given code snippet. The values of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `M`, `t`, and `total_time_per_task`) remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 45, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, `M` is an integer such that 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9, `t` is a list of k integers where each t_j is an integer such that 1 ≤ t_j ≤ 1000000, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in the list `t`, `max_points` is 0**.
