Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `left` is the original value of `left` + 1.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `left < right` and `s[left] != 'G'`.

3. **Analysis:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, two conditions must be satisfied:
     - `left < right`
     - `s[left] != 'G'`

4. **Current State:**
   - `left` is the original value of `left` + 1.
   - This means `left` has already incremented by 1 from its original value.

5. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since `left` is now `original_left + 1`, for the loop to continue, `left` must still be less than `right` and `s[left]` must not be 'G'.
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that `left < right` and `s[left] != 'G'`.

Given these considerations, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `left` must be such that `left < right` and `s[left] != 'G'`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`left` must be such that `left < right` and `s[left] != 'G'`**
