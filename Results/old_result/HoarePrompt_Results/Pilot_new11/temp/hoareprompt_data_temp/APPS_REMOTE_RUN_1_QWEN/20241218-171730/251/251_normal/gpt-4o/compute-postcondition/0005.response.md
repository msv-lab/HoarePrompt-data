The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is an integer representing the number of simple cakes, and `cakes`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple in the list represents the radius and height of the i-th cake, respectively. The function does not return an error message directly related to invalid input but rather returns a value based on the given parameters.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept an integer `n` and a list of tuples `cakes`, where each tuple contains the radius and height of a cake, and based on these inputs, return a certain value (the specific value is not detailed in the provided information).

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` and a list of tuples `cakes`, where each tuple contains the radius and height of a cake, and returns a value based on these inputs.**
