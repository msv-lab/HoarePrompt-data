The `break` statement is encountered, which means the loop or if-else block it is in is exited without further execution of the code inside it. Since the code does not specify which loop or if-else block this `break` statement belongs to, we assume it exits the most internal loop or if-else block. The values of the variables `i`, `s`, and `beauty` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is at least 2, `s` is a string with at least `i - 2` characters, `beauty` is incremented by 1 if the character at index `j` of `s` is 'G', otherwise the loop or if-else block is exited without changing the value of `beauty`.**
