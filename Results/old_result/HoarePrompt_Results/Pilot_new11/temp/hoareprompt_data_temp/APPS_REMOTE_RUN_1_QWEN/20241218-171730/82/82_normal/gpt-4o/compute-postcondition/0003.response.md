The code calculates the absolute difference between `a` and `b` and assigns it to the variable `diff`. Since `a` and `b` are positive integers and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` will be a positive integer representing the absolute difference between `a` and `b`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer and not equal to `a`, `diff` is the absolute difference between `a` and `b`**
