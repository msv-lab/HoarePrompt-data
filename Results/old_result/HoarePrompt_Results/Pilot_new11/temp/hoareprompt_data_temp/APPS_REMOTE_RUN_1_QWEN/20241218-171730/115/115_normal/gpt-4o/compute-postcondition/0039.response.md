Let's go through the code step by step:

- Initial State: `n` is at least 2, `i` is `n - 2`, `m` is at least 2, and \( B[i][j] \), \( B[i][j + 1] \), \( B[i + 1][j] \), and \( B[i + 1][j + 1] \) are all equal to 1; \( A[i][j] \), \( A[i][j + 1] \), \( A[i + 1][j] \), and \( A[i + 1][j + 1] \) are unchanged and are still equal to 1; `operations` contains the tuple \((i + 1, j + 1)\) if the condition is met; otherwise, it remains unchanged; `j` is incremented by 1.

- The code snippet is: 
  ```python
  B[i][j] = B[i][j + 1] = B[i + 1][j] = B[i + 1][j + 1] = 1
  ```

- This line sets the values of \( B[i][j] \), \( B[i][j + 1] \), \( B[i + 1][j] \), and \( B[i + 1][j + 1] \) to 1. Since these values were already 1 in the initial state, setting them to 1 does not change their values.

- The values of `n`, `i`, `m`, `A[i][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i + 1][j + 1]`, and `operations` remain unchanged because the code snippet does not affect these variables.

- The only variable that changes is `j`, which is incremented by 1.

- So, the new state of `j` is `j + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is `n - 2`, `m` is at least 2, \( B[i][j] \), \( B[i][j + 1] \), \( B[i + 1][j] \), and \( B[i + 1][j + 1] \) are all equal to 1; \( A[i][j] \), \( A[i][j + 1] \), \( A[i + 1][j] \), and \( A[i + 1][j + 1] \) are unchanged and are still equal to 1; `operations` contains the tuple \((i + 1, j + 1)\) if the condition is met; otherwise, it remains unchanged; `j` is `j + 1`.**
