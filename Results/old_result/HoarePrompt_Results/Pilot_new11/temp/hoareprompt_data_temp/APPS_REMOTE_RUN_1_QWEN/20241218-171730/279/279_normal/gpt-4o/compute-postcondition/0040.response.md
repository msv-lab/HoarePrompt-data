The code `x = p[x] - 1` updates the value of `x` to `p[x] - 1`. Given that `x` was initially `p[p[1] - 1] - 1`, we need to find `p[x]` first.

From the initial state, we know:
- `x` is `p[p[1] - 1] - 1`

So, `p[x]` would be `p[p[p[1] - 1] - 1]`.

Therefore, the new value of `x` is `p[p[p[1] - 1] - 1] - 1`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `visited[0]` is True, `cycle` contains the value [1, p[1] - 1, p[p[1] - 1] - 1], `x` is p[p[p[1] - 1] - 1] - 1, `visited[1]` is True, `cycles` includes the `cycle` list, `visited[p[1] - 1]` is True, `visited[x]` is True**
