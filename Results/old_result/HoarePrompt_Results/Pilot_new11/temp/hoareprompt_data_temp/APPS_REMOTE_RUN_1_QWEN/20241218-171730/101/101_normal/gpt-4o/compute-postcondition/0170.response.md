Let's analyze the loop step-by-step to determine the final output state after all iterations have finished.

### Initial State:
- `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string is of length `m` and consists of characters ".", "w".
- `top` is the smallest row index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`.
- `bottom` is the largest row index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`.
- `left` is the smallest column index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`.
- `right` is the largest column index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`.
- `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1`.
- `frame_width` is `right - left + 1`.
- `frame_height` is greater than or equal to 2.
- `frame_width` is greater than or equal to 2.
- `result` is a list of `n` lists, each list is a copy of the corresponding string in `screen`.

### Loop Code:
```python
for j in range(left, right + 1):
    if i == top or i == bottom or j == left or j == right:
        if result[i][j] == '.':
            result[i][j] = '+'
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initialization**: The loop iterates over the columns from `left` to `right`. For each row `i` and each column `j` within this range, if the condition `i == top or i == bottom or j == left or j == right` is met and the corresponding position in `result` is `'.'`, it updates that position to `'+'`.

2. **First Iteration**:
   - `j` starts at `left`.
   - For each row `i` where `i` is `top` or `bottom` and each column `j` from `left` to `right`, the loop updates the border cells of the frame in `result` to `'+'` if they are currently `'.'`.

3. **Subsequent Iterations**:
   - The loop continues to iterate over the same range of columns (`left` to `right`).
   - Each time the loop runs, it checks the conditions and updates the appropriate cells in `result`.

4. **Final State**:
   - After all iterations, `j` will have incremented through all columns from `left` to `right`.
   - All cells on the borders (rows `top` and `bottom`, columns `left` and `right`) in `result` will be updated to `'+'` if they were originally `'.'`.

### Output State After the Loop Executes:
- `screen` remains unchanged.
- `top` remains the smallest row index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`.
- `bottom` remains the largest row index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`.
- `left` remains the smallest column index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`.
- `right` remains the largest column index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`.
- `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1`.
- `frame_width` is `right - left + 1`.
- `frame_height` is greater than or equal to 2.
- `frame_width` is greater than or equal to 2.
- `result` is a list of `n` lists, each list is a copy of the corresponding string in `screen` with all border cells (rows `top` and `bottom`, columns `left` and `right`) updated to `'+'` if they were originally `'.'`.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string is of length `m` and consists of characters ".", "w"; `top` is the smallest row index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`; `bottom` is the largest row index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`; `left` is the smallest column index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`; `right` is the largest column index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`; `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1`; `frame_width` is `right - left + 1`; `frame_height` is greater than or equal to 2; `frame_width` is greater than or equal to 2; `result` is a list of `n` lists, each list is a copy of the corresponding string in `screen` with all border cells (rows `top` and `bottom`, columns `left` and `right`) updated to '+' if they were originally '.'.**
