You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Takahashi wants to grill N pieces of meat on a grilling net, which can be seen as a two-dimensional plane. The coordinates of the i-th piece of meat are \left(x_i, y_i\right), and its hardness is c_i.
Takahashi can use one heat source to grill the meat. If he puts the heat source at coordinates \left(X, Y\right), where X and Y are real numbers, the i-th piece of meat will be ready to eat in c_i \times \sqrt{\left(X - x_i\right)^2 + \left(Y-y_i\right)^2} seconds.
Takahashi wants to eat K pieces of meat. Find the time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready if he put the heat source to minimize this time.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq N \leq 60
 - 1 \leq K \leq N
 - -1000 \leq x_i , y_i \leq 1000
 - \left(x_i, y_i\right) \neq \left(x_j, y_j\right) \left(i \neq j \right)
 - 1 \leq c_i \leq 100

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
x_1 y_1 c_1
\vdots
x_N y_N c_N

-----Output-----
Print the answer.
It will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error from our answer is at most 10^{-6}.

-----Sample Input-----
4 3
-1 0 3
0 0 3
1 0 2
1 1 40

-----Sample Output-----
2.4

If we put the heat source at \left(-0.2, 0\right), the 1-st, 2-nd, and 3-rd pieces of meat will be ready to eat within 2.4 seconds. This is the optimal place to put the heat source.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is `N`, `j` is `N - 1`, `x1` is `meats[j][0]`, `y1` is `meats[j][1]`, `c1` is `meats[j][2]`, `x2` is `meats[k + (N - i - 1)][0]`, `y2` is `meats[k + (N - i - 1)][1]`, `c2` is `meats[k + (N - i - 1)][2]`, `count` is the number of meat entries within distance \(T\) from the calculated point \((mx, my)\) if a valid combination is found, otherwise `count` is the maximum number of meat entries checked during the loop, `d`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `cx`, `cy`, `mx`, `my` hold the values calculated for the last pair of meat entries compared. If no valid combination is found, the function returns `None`.
    return False
    #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of meat pieces represented by tuples `(x_i, y_i, c_i)`, an integer `K`, and a non-negative float `T`. It iterates over all pairs of meat pieces and checks if there exists a combination where the count of meat pieces within a distance `T` from a specific calculated point is greater than or equal to `K`. If such a combination is found, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

The function performs the following actions:
1. Initializes the length of the `meats` list as `N`.
2. Iterates over all pairs of meat pieces `(i, j)` where `i < j`.
3. For each pair, it swaps the meat pieces if the hardness of the first piece is less than the hardness of the second piece.
4. Calculates the distance `d` between the two pieces based on their hardness and time threshold.
5. If the distance `d` is negative or zero, it continues to the next iteration.
6. Computes the midpoint `cx` and `cy` between the two pieces, and the differences `dx` and `dy`.
7. Calculates the squared distance `d2` between the two pieces.
8. Checks if the calculated point `(mx, my)` lies within a certain distance from the midpoint.
9. Counts the number of meat pieces within the distance `T` from the calculated point `(mx, my)`.
10. If the count is greater than or equal to `K`, the function returns `True`.

If no valid combination is found after checking all pairs, the function returns `False`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function assumes that `meats` is a non-empty list and `K` is within the bounds of the list length.
- If all meat pieces have the same hardness and the time threshold `T` is not considered in the calculations, the function might not behave as expected.
- The function does not handle the case where the list `meats` is empty, which should result in an immediate return of `False`.
- The function does not account for the possibility that `K` could be `1`, which means it only needs to find one meat piece within the distance `T` from the calculated point.

After the function concludes, it will return either `True` or `False` based on whether a valid combination of meat pieces was found.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N and K are positive integers such that 1 <= K <= N <= 60, meats is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers representing the coordinates \(x_i\) and \(y_i\) of the i-th piece of meat and its hardness \(c_i\) such that -1000 <= \(x_i\), \(y_i\) <= 1000 and 1 <= \(c_i\) <= 100, and the coordinates of different pieces of meat are distinct.
def func_2(N, K, meats):
    low, high = 0, 1000000000.0
    while high - low > 1e-07:
        mid = (low + high) / 2
        
        if func_1(meats, K, mid):
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: Output State: `low` and `high` are extremely close to each other, and `mid` is also very close to them. The exact value depends on the outcome of `func_1(meats, K, mid)`, and `low` and `high` will converge to a value such that `high - low < 1e-07`.
    return high
    #The program returns high, which is very close to low and mid, with the condition that high - low < 1e-07
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `N`, `K`, and `meats`. `N` and `K` are positive integers such that 1 <= K <= N <= 60, and `meats` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers representing the coordinates \(x_i\) and \(y_i\) of the i-th piece of meat and its hardness \(c_i\) such that -1000 <= \(x_i\), \(y_i\) <= 1000 and 1 <= \(c_i\) <= 100, and the coordinates of different pieces of meat are distinct. The function uses binary search to find a value `high` that satisfies the condition `high - low < 1e-07`.

After the function concludes, the program state is as follows:
- The function calls another function `func_1(meats, K, mid)` within a loop, adjusting the range between `low` and `high` based on the return value of `func_1(meats, K, mid)`.
- The loop continues until the difference between `high` and `low` is less than 1e-07.
- The final value returned by the function is `high`, which is very close to `low` and `mid`, ensuring that `high - low < 1e-07`.

Potential edge cases:
- If `N` or `K` are out of the specified bounds (i.e., `K > N` or `N > 60`), the function should ideally raise an error or handle it appropriately, although the current code does not explicitly check these conditions.
- If the list `meats` is empty, the function would still execute but would need to handle this case, possibly raising an error or returning a default value.
- If `func_1(meats, K, mid)` does not return a boolean value or behaves unexpectedly, the function may enter an infinite loop or produce incorrect results.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N and K are integers such that 1 <= K <= N and 1 <= N <= 60. meats is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers representing the coordinates (x, y) and hardness (c) of a piece of meat, with -1000 <= x, y <= 1000 and 1 <= c <= 100.
def func_3():
    data = input().split()
    N = int(data[0])
    K = int(data[1])
    meats = []
    index = 2
    for _ in range(N):
        x = int(data[index])
        
        y = int(data[index + 1])
        
        c = int(data[index + 2])
        
        meats.append((x, y, c))
        
        index += 3
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `K` is the integer obtained from `data[1]`, `meats` is a list containing `N` elements each of which is a tuple `(x, y, c)`, `data` is a list of strings resulting from the split input, `N` is the integer value obtained from `int(data[0])`, `index` is `3 * N + 2`, `x` is the integer value of `data[index - 3]`, `y` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`.
    result = func_2(N, K, meats)
    print(f'{result:.6f}')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` reads two integers `N` and `K` from user input, followed by `N` tuples each containing the coordinates `(x, y)` and hardness `c` of a piece of meat. It then calls another function `func_2` with these inputs to process the data and calculates a result. Finally, it prints the result formatted to six decimal places. Potential edge cases include invalid input formats or values outside the specified ranges, which would raise errors if not handled externally. If `func_2` is not defined or does not return a numeric value, the function will print an unexpected output or error message.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
