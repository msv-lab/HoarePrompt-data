The `exit()` function is used to terminate the program immediately. Since the function does not modify any variables and simply exits the program, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to `a * 1234567`, `b` is `b_current - 1`, and the new value of `c` is \(\frac{n - a \times 1234567 - b \times 123456}{1234}\)**
