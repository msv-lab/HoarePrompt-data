The code splits the string `file` into two parts and assigns them to `name` and `type_`. The original value of `file` is split into `name` and `type_`, so `file` is no longer accessible in its original form. However, the exact values of `name` and `type_` depend on the content of `file`. Since the initial state does not provide the specific content of `file`, we cannot determine the exact values of `name` and `type_`. The only information we can be certain of is that `name` and `type_` are derived from `file`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `files` must have at least one element; `name` is part of the split string from `file`; `type_` is the other part of the split string from `file`.**
