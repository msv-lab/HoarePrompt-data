The code reads two integers from input and assigns them to `h` and `n` respectively. Given the initial constraints:

- `h` is an integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 50.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^h.

After running the code, `h` and `n` will be assigned the values from the input, and they will still satisfy the given constraints. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`h` is an integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 50; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^h**
