The given code does not assign any value to `target_sofa` or any other variable, it only calls the `print()` function with `target_sofa` as an argument. Since no value is assigned to `target_sofa`, the print statement will not change the value of `target_sofa` and will simply print its current value.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with `target_sofa` holding its initial value (which is unspecified in the initial state).

Output State: **`target_sofa` holds its initial value**
