The code snippet `print(len(result))` simply prints the length of the `result` list. The `result` list contains `x` and `y`. Since no operations are performed on `result` within the given code snippet, its length remains unchanged. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a non-negative integer
- `marks` is a list of integers (potentially empty)
- `marks_set` is a set of unique elements from `marks`
- `x_found` is `False`
- `y_found` is `False`
- `new_marks` is a set containing the updated results based on the final iteration through all `marks`
- `result` is a list containing `x` and `y`

After executing the code snippet, the only thing that changes is the output of the length of `result`, which is `2` because `result` contains `x` and `y`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `marks` is a list of integers (potentially empty), `marks_set` is a set of unique elements from `marks`, `x_found` is `False`, `y_found` is `False`, `new_marks` is a set containing the updated results based on the final iteration through all `marks`, and `result` is a list containing `x` and `y`, with the additional information that `len(result)` is printed.**
