The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, since `i` is equal to `j`, the `continue` statement will simply skip any further execution of the current loop iteration and move to the next one. However, the values of the variables are not affected by the `continue` statement.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` ranges from 0 to `d-1`, `x1` is `x1_0`, `y1` is `y1_0`, `x2` is `x2_0`, `y2` is `y2_0`, and `d` must be greater than 0. The current value of `i` equals `j`.**
