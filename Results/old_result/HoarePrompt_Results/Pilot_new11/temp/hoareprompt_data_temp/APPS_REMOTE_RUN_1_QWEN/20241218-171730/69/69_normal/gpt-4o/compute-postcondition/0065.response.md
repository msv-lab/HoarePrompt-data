Postcondition: ***`dx` is `x - final_x`, `final_x` is the number of 'R' operations minus the number of 'L' operations, `final_y` is the number of 'U' operations minus the number of 'D' operations, `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R', `x` and `y` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `dy` is `y - final_y`, `min_length` is either updated to `min(min_length, i - position_map[target_pos])` if `target_pos` is found in `position_map`, or remains `min_length` unchanged, `current_x` and `current_y` are adjusted based on the value of `operations[i]`, `position_map` remains `{(0, 0): -1}`, `target_pos` is `(current_x + dx, current_y + dy)`***
