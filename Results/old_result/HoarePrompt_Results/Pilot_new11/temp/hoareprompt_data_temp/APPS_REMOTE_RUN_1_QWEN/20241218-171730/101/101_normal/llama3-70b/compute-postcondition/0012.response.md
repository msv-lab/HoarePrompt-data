The code updates the values of `max_x` and `max_y` by comparing them with the current `x` and `y` values of the tuple in `white_pixels`. Since `max_x` and `max_y` are initially set to the minimum `x` and `y` values from the `white_pixels` list, and these values are updated by taking the maximum of the existing values and the current `x` and `y` values of the tuple, the updated `max_x` and `max_y` will be the maximum `x` and `y` values from the `white_pixels` list.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `pixels` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` characters ('.' or 'w'), `white_pixels` is a list of tuples representing the coordinates `(i, j)` of all 'w' characters in the `pixels` grid and must contain at least one tuple, `max_x` is the maximum `x` value from the tuples in `white_pixels`, `max_y` is the maximum `y` value from the tuples in `white_pixels`.**
