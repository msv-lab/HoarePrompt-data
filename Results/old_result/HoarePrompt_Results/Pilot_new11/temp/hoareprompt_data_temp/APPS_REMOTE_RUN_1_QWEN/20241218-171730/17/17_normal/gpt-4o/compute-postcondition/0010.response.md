Functionality: **The function accepts four integers through separate input lines, representing counts of "((", "()", "(})", and "))" respectively. It then checks if the sum of counts of "((" and "()" is equal to the sum of counts of "(}" and "))", and also ensures that the count of "()" is greater than or equal to the count of "(}". If both conditions are met, it prints `1`; otherwise, it prints `0`. The function does not return any value but modifies the state of `cnt2` and `cnt3` by checking their values against the given conditions.**

**Potential edge cases and missing functionality:**
- If the counts of the input do not satisfy the condition `(cnt1 + cnt2 == cnt3 + cnt4 and cnt2 >= cnt3)`, the function still prints `0` even though it does not modify the values of `cnt2` and `cnt3` in this case.
- The function does not validate that the inputs are within the specified range (`0 ≤ cnt_i ≤ 10^9`). If invalid inputs are provided, the function may behave unpredictably or raise errors.
