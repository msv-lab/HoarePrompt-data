Functionality: **The function `func()` takes a sequence of operations (`ops`) as a string and two integer coordinates `(x, y)` as inputs. It calculates the final coordinates `(ux, uy)` after processing the operations and then checks if these new coordinates can be reached from the original coordinates `(x, y)` by performing the same operations. If the new coordinates cannot be reached, the function prints `-1`. Otherwise, it counts the number of invalid operations (those that would not help in reaching the target coordinates) and prints this count.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- If the input string `ops` is empty, the function should handle this case appropriately. However, the current implementation assumes `ops` is non-empty.
- The function does not validate the input values of `n`, `x`, and `y` to ensure they fall within the specified ranges.
- There is no handling for invalid operation characters in the string `ops` (i.e., characters other than 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R').
- The function does not explicitly handle the case where the operations perfectly align with the target coordinates `(x, y)` without any invalid operations. In this case, the count of invalid operations should be `0`.
