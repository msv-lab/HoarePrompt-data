Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `j` is `k + 2`, `right_count[0]` is either 2 or 3, `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[k + 2]`, `y1_j` is the second element of `sofas[k + 2]`, `x2_j` is the third element of `sofas[k + 2]`, `y2_j` is the fourth element of `sofas[k + 2]`. If `x1 > x2_j` and `x2 > x2_j` is true, `right_count[0]` is set to 3. Otherwise, `right_count[0]` remains as 2 or 3.***
