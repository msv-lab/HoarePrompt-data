According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `m`. The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `m` is at least 2.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration:

1. `i` remains unchanged since it is not involved in the loop.
2. `j` is incremented by 1 from the previous value (0), so `j` becomes 1.
3. `m` remains unchanged since it is not modified within the loop.

The condition `A[i][j]` is equal to `B[i][j]` must hold true for the next iteration as well. Since `i` is fixed at 2, we need to ensure that `A[2][1]` is equal to `B[2][1]`.

State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, `A` is a 2D list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, `operations` is a list of tuples representing the positions (i+1, j+1) of the top-left corners of the 2x2 submatrices in `A` that satisfied the condition and were flipped in `B`, `B` is a 2D list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, and `j` is 1, `A[2][1]` is equal to `B[2][1]`**
