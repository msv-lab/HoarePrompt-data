Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program fails to handle cases where the calculated area is not an integer but close to an integer due to floating-point precision issues. Specifically, the program checks if `area` is an integer by comparing it to `int(area)`, which may not always be accurate due to the inherent imprecision of floating-point arithmetic. This can lead to incorrect outputs for certain values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.

For example, consider the input `n=5`, `m=7`, and `k=3`. The area of the triangle should be \( \frac{5 \times 7}{3} = \frac{35}{3} \approx 11.6667 \), which is not an integer. However, the program will incorrectly conclude that the area is an integer and proceed to generate points, leading to an invalid solution.

To fix this, the program should use a more precise method to check if the area is an integer, such as checking if the remainder of the division by `k` is zero. Hereâ€™s an improved version of the program:

```python
def func():
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    area = n * m / k
    if area % 1 != 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        area = int(area)
        if area == 0:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            print('0 0')
            if 2 * area <= n:
                print(f'{2 * area} 1')
                print(f'0 1')
            elif 2 * area <= m:
                print(f'1 {2 * area}')
                print(f'1 0')
            else:
                print(f'{n} {m // 2}')
                print(f'0 {m // 2}')
```

This version uses `area % 1 != 0` to check if the area is exactly an integer, ensuring the program works correctly for all valid inputs.
