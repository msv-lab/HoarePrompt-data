`ans` is incremented by 1. Initially, `ans` is 1, so after the increment, `ans` becomes 2. The states of the other variables (`n`, `b`, `i`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `ans` is 2, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 0.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `ans` is 2, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 0.**
