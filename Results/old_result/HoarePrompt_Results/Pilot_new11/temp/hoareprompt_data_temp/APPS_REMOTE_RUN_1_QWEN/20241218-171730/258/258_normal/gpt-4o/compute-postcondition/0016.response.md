The value of `index` is incremented by 3, starting from its initial value of 5. Therefore, the new value of `index` is 8. The states of the other variables are not affected. Thus, the Output State is:

Output State: **`K` is the integer obtained from `data[1]`, `meats` is a list containing two elements which are the tuple (`x`, integer value of `data[6]`, `c`) and the tuple (`x`, `y`, `c`), `data` is a list of strings resulting from the split input, `N` must be greater than 1, `index` is 8, `x` is the integer value of `data[5]`, `y` is the integer value of `data[6]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[7]`**
