You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Nauuo is a girl who loves writing comments.

One day, she posted a comment on Codeforces, wondering whether she would get upvotes or downvotes.

It's known that there were $x$ persons who would upvote, $y$ persons who would downvote, and there were also another $z$ persons who would vote, but you don't know whether they would upvote or downvote. Note that each of the $x+y+z$ people would vote exactly one time.

There are three different results: if there are more people upvote than downvote, the result will be "+"; if there are more people downvote than upvote, the result will be "-"; otherwise the result will be "0".

Because of the $z$ unknown persons, the result may be uncertain (i.e. there are more than one possible results). More formally, the result is uncertain if and only if there exist two different situations of how the $z$ persons vote, that the results are different in the two situations.

Tell Nauuo the result or report that the result is uncertain.


-----Input-----

The only line contains three integers $x$, $y$, $z$ ($0\le x,y,z\le100$), corresponding to the number of persons who would upvote, downvote or unknown.


-----Output-----

If there is only one possible result, print the result : "+", "-" or "0".

Otherwise, print "?" to report that the result is uncertain.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 7 0

Output
-
Input
2 0 1

Output
+
Input
1 1 0

Output
0
Input
0 0 1

Output
?


-----Note-----

In the first example, Nauuo would definitely get three upvotes and seven downvotes, so the only possible result is "-".

In the second example, no matter the person unknown downvotes or upvotes, Nauuo would get more upvotes than downvotes. So the only possible result is "+".

In the third example, Nauuo would definitely get one upvote and one downvote, so the only possible result is "0".

In the fourth example, if the only one person upvoted, the result would be "+", otherwise, the result would be "-". There are two possible results, so the result is uncertain.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x, y, and z are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100.
def func():
    x, y, z = map(int, input().split())
    if (x > y + z) :
        print('+')
    else :
        if (x < y) :
            print('-')
        else :
            if (x == y) :
                if (z == 0) :
                    print('0')
                else :
                    print('?')
                #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers from input(). After executing the if-else block, if `z` is 0, the output is '0'. Otherwise, if `z` is not 0, the output is '?' and the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged as per the precondition.
            else :
                print('?')
            #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers from input(). If `x` equals `y` and `z` is 0, the output is '0'. Otherwise, the output is '?' and the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged as per the precondition.
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers from input(). If `x` is less than `y`, the condition holds as it is. If `x` equals `y` and `z` is 0, the output is '0'. Otherwise, the output is '?' and the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged as per the precondition.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers from input(). If `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`, the condition holds as it is. If `x` is less than `y`, the condition remains unchanged. If `x` equals `y` and `z` is 0, the output is '0'. Otherwise, the output is '?' and the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged as per the precondition.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes three non-negative integers \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) as input, each ranging from 0 to 100. It then evaluates these inputs according to specific conditions and prints one of four possible outputs: '+', '-', '0', or '?'. The function does not return a value but modifies the console output based on the conditions met. If \(x\) is greater than \(y + z\), it prints '+'. If \(x\) is less than \(y\), it prints '-'. If \(x\) equals \(y\) and \(z\) is 0, it prints '0'. In all other cases, it prints '?'. The values of \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) remain unchanged after the function executes.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
