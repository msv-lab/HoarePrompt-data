To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the conditions and changes that occur within the loop based on the given information.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - `marks` is a list of integers.
   - `i` and `j` are indices into the list `marks`.
   - `need_x` is `True` if `marks[j] - marks[i] == x`.
   - `need_y` is `True` if `marks[j] - marks[i] == y`.
     - If `marks[j] - marks[i] == y`, then `need_y` remains `True`.
     - If `marks[j] - marks[i] != y`, then `need_y` is unchanged.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `i` to `n-1`.

3. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - Let's assume the current value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration is `j_end`.

4. **Changes in the Loop:**
   - In each iteration, `j` is incremented by 1.
   - For the next iteration, `j` will be `j_end + 1`.

5. **Determining `need_x` and `need_y`:**
   - Since `need_x` and `need_y` depend on the values of `marks[i]` and `marks[j]`, these flags will only change if the condition `marks[j] - marks[i] == x` or `marks[j] - marks[i] == y` is met.
   - If `need_y` was `True` in the previous iteration and `marks[j] - marks[i] == y` is still true, `need_y` remains `True`.
   - If `marks[j] - marks[i] != y`, `need_y` remains unchanged (either `False` or `True`).

6. **Next Iteration:**
   - To enter the next iteration, `j` must satisfy the loop condition, i.e., `j < n`.

### Conclusion:

- At the start of the next iteration, `i` remains the same as it was in the previous iteration.
- `j` is incremented by 1, so `j` becomes `j_end + 1`.
- `need_x` and `need_y` remain the same unless the new condition `marks[j_end + 1] - marks[i] == y` is met, in which case `need_y` would become `True`.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`marks` is a list of integers, `i` is the same as before, `j` is `j_end + 1`, `need_x` is the same as before, and `need_y` is the same as before unless `marks[j_end + 1] - marks[i] == y`, in which case `need_y` is `True`.**

Since the exact value of `j_end` is not specified, we can denote it as `j_end` in the state description.

Final State: **`marks` is a list of integers, `i` is the same as before, `j` is `j_end + 1`, `need_x` is the same as before, and `need_y` is the same as before unless `marks[j_end + 1] - marks[i] == y`, in which case `need_y` is `True`.**
