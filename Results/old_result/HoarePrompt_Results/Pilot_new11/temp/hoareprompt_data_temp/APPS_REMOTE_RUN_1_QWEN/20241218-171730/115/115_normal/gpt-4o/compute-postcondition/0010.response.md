The code snippet `operations.append((i + 1, j + 1))` does not affect any of the predefined variables (`n`, `m`, or `B`). Instead, it appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the `operations` list. Since `i` and `j` are not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine their values, but we know that they will be used to form a tuple that is appended to `operations`.

The output state remains unchanged from the initial state because no values of `n`, `m`, or `B` are modified. The only thing added to the `operations` list is a tuple of the form `(i + 1, j + 1)`, but since `i` and `j` are not specified, we can only say that this tuple will be appended to `operations`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, `B` is a 2x2 matrix with `B[0][1] = 1`, `B[0][2] = 1`, `B[1][1] = 1`, `B[1][2] = 1`, and other elements unspecified, `operations` contains a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` where `i` and `j` are integers.**
