Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment is accurate. The annotated version clearly shows that the program does not handle the exact case when `k` is equal to `n * 2 - 2`. According to the problem description, after reaching the end of the snake-like movement pattern, Lara should be in cell (1, 2). However, the current implementation does not explicitly handle this case, leading to incorrect outputs for certain values of `k`.

For instance, consider the input:
```
4 3 13
```
The annotated version indicates that when `k` is exactly `n * 2 - 2`, the program should output (1, 2), but it does not do so. Instead, it incorrectly handles this boundary condition, which means the program does not fully meet the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment remains accurate.
