The code `top = i` assigns the value of `i` to the variable `top`. The previous value of `top` was `None`, and the value of `i` is directly assigned to `top`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string is of length `m` and consists of characters "." and "w", `top` is `i`, `bottom` is `i + 1`, `left` is `0`, and `right` is `0**
