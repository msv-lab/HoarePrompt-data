Postcondition: ***`col` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `sergei_questions` is increased by 1 if `row == x` and `col == y`, `max_questions` is increased by 1, `row` is increased by the value of `direction`. If `row == n`, then `row` is set to -2 and `direction` is set to -1. Otherwise, the conditions remain as in the precondition.***
