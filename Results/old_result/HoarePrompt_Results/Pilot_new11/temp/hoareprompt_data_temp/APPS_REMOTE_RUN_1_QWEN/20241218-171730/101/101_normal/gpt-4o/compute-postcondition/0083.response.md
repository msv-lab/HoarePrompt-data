Let's analyze the given information step by step to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

### Given Information:

- `screen` is a 2D list of characters.
- `i` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.
- `j` is incremented by 1.
- `top` and `bottom` both remain unchanged and equal `i`.
- `right` is updated to `j + 1` if `j + 1 > right`.
- If `i > bottom`, then `bottom` is updated to `i`.
- If `screen[i][j] == 'w'`, these updates are applied; otherwise, the values of `i`, `j`, `top`, `bottom`, and `right` remain as they were before the if-else block executes.

### Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:

- `i` remains unchanged.
- `j` is incremented by 1.
- `top` and `bottom` both remain unchanged and equal `i`.
- `right` may or may not be updated based on the condition `j + 1 > right`.
- If `i > bottom`, then `bottom` is updated to `i`.

### Analysis:

1. **Increment of `j`:**
   - Since `j` is incremented by 1, the new value of `j` will be `j + 1`.

2. **Check for Update of `right`:**
   - If `j + 1 > right`, then `right` is updated to `j + 1`.

3. **Check for Update of `bottom`:**
   - If `i > bottom`, then `bottom` is updated to `i`.

### Conclusion:

- The only values that might change are `j`, `right`, and `bottom`.
- `i` remains unchanged.
- `top` remains unchanged and equal to `i`.

Given these points, we need to consider the possible scenarios for the next iteration.

### Possible States:

- If `j + 1 > right`, then `right` is updated to `j + 1`.
- If `i > bottom`, then `bottom` is updated to `i`.

Since we don't know the exact values of `j`, `right`, and `bottom` from the previous iteration, we need to account for both possible states.

### Final Answer:

The state at the start of the next iteration of the loop could be either:
- `j` is `j + 1`, `right` is `j + 1` if `j + 1 > right`, `bottom` is `i` if `i > bottom`, and `top` is `i`.
- `j` is `j + 1`, `right` remains unchanged if `j + 1 <= right`, `bottom` remains unchanged if `i <= bottom`, and `top` is `i`.

To represent this concisely:
State: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is `j + 1`, `top` is `i`, `right` is `j + 1` if `j + 1 > right`, and `bottom` is `i` if `i > bottom`**
