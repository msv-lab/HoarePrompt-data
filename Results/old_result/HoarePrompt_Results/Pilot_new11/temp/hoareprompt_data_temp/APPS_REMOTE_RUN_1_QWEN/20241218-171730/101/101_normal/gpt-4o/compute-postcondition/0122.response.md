Postcondition: ***`i` is `n + 1`, `j` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `top` is `n + 1`, `bottom` is `n + 1`, `left` is 0, and `right` is 0. Since the if condition `i < top` does not change these variables, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition when the if part is executed.***

Given that the else part is absent, the postcondition simply stays as the precondition when the if condition is evaluated.
