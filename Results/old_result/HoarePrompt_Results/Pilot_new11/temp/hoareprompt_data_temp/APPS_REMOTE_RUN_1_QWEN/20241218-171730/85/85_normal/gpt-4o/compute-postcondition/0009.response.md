The value of `max_9s` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `max_9s` is 2, so after executing `max_9s += 1`, the value of `max_9s` becomes 3. The state of `n` remains unchanged, as it only being mentioned that `n` must end in 9 does not get updated or assigned any new value by the code.

Output State: **`n` must end in 9, `max_9s` is 3**
