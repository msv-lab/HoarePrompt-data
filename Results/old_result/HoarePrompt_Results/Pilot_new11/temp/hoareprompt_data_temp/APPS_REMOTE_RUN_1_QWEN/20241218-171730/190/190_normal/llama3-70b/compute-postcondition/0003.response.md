`mid` is assigned the value of the element at index `n // 2` in the list `sticks`. Since `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `mid` will be the median of the list. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` integers; `mid` is the element at index `n // 2` in `sticks`.**
