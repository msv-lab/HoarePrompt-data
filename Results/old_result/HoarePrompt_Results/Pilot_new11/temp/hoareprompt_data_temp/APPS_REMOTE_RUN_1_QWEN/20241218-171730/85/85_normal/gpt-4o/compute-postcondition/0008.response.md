Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information
- The loop condition is `(n + 1) % 10 == 0`.
- This means the loop continues as long as adding 1 to `n` results in a number that ends in 0.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is the integer obtained by removing the last digit (which was 8) from the original value of `n`.
- `max_9s` is currently 2.

### Analyzing the Loop Condition
- For the loop to continue, `(n + 1) % 10 == 0` must be true.
- This implies that `n + 1` must end in 0, meaning `n` must end in 9.

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Current State**:
   - `n` ends in 9 (since removing 8 makes it end in 9).
   - `max_9s` is 2.

2. **Next Iteration**:
   - To satisfy the loop condition in the next iteration, `n` must still end in 9.
   - Since we are removing the last digit in each iteration, the new `n` must also end in 9 to ensure the loop continues.

3. **Modifying States**:
   - We need to ensure that the new `n` ends in 9.
   - `max_9s` is already 2, which means we can handle one more iteration where `n` ends in 9.

### Final State
- `n` must end in 9 for the loop to continue.
- No other states need adjustment based on the given information.

### Final Answer
State: **`n` must end in 9, `max_9s` is 2**
