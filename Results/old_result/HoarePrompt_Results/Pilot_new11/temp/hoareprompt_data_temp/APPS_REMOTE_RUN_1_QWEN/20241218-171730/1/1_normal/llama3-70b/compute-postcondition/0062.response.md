The code `print(-1)` prints the value `-1` to the console. However, this does not affect the values of the variables `s`, `n`, `ind`, `f`, and `bind`. Therefore, the only change is that the console will display `-1`.

Output State: **`s` is the input string, `n` is the length of `s`, `ind` is the index of the first `:` after the first `[` in the string, `f` is `False`, and `bind` is `-1`. After executing the code, the console displays `-1`.**
