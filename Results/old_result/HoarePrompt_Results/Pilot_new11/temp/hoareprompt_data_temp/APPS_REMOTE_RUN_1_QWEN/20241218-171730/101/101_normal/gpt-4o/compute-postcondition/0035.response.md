To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the current values of the variables and how they change within the loop.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string is of length `m` and consists of characters "." and "w".
   - `top` and `bottom` are indices representing the top and bottom boundaries of the rectangle in the `screen`.
   - `left` and `right` are indices representing the left and right boundaries of the rectangle in the `screen`.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(m):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Body Behavior:**
   - The loop iterates over the columns (`j`) from 0 to `m-1`.
   - Inside the loop, based on the value of `top`, the boundaries (`top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`) are updated as follows:
     - If `top` is `None`, then `top` is set to `i`, `bottom` is set to `i`, `left` is set to `j`, and `right` is set to `j`.
     - Otherwise, `top` remains unchanged, `bottom` is set to `i`, `left` is updated to `j`, and `right` is updated to `j`. If `j > right`, the `right` boundary is also updated to `j`.

4. **State Adjustments:**
   - Since the loop increments `j` from the previous value to the next column, we need to adjust the state accordingly.
   - The variable `i` (which was used in the if-else block but not explicitly shown in the loop) is incremented by 1 at the end of the iteration.
   - Therefore, `i` becomes `i + 1`.

5. **New State for the Next Iteration:**
   - `top` and `bottom` are reset or updated based on the new row `i`.
   - `left` and `right` are reset or updated based on the new column `j`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string is of length `m` and consists of characters "." and "w", `top` is `None`, `bottom` is `i + 1`, `left` is `0`, and `right` is `0**.

This is because at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, and the boundaries will be reset to the new row `i + 1` and the first column `0`.
