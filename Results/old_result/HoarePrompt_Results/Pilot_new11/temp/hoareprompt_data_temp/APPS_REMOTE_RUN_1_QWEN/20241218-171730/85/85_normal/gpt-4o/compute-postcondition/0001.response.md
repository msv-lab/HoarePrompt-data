The code assigns the value `0` to the variable `max_9s`. The value of `n` remains unchanged because no operation affects it. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer input by the user, and 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `max_9s` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user, and 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `max_9s` is 0**
