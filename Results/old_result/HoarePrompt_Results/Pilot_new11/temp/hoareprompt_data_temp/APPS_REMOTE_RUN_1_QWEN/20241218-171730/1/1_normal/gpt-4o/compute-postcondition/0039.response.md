The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables but indicates that the program will exit the current loop or block of code. Since there is no loop or block being exited in this context, the only thing impacted is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were inside.

The states of the other variables (`s`, `n`, `ind`, `bind`, `start_colon`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters `[`, `]`, `:`, and `|`, `n` is the length of `s`, `ind` is not -1, `bind` is not -1, `ind` is less than `bind`, `ind + 1` is a valid index, `bind` is the last index of the string, `start_colon` is equal to `i` (which is such that `s[i]` is `':'`), and `i` is such that `s[i]` is `':'`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
