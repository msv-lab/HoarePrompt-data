Postcondition: ***`unrated` is `False`, `rated` is `False`, `maybe` is `True`, `ratings_before` is a list containing `n` input integers, `ratings_after` is a list containing `n` input integers, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `i` is less than `n`. If `ratings_before[i]` is less than `ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i]` is greater than `ratings_after[j]`, then we break out of the loop or conditional statement. Otherwise, the conditions remain as initially stated within the if part.***
