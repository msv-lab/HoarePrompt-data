The function `func` accepts two integers `n` and `k`, and a string `line` representing the layout of cells. It determines if a grasshopper starting at a certain position can jump to a target position using jumps of size `k` without encountering obstacles ('#'). The function returns either 'YES' if the grasshopper can reach the target within `k` moves, or 'NO' if it cannot. The function also checks for valid input constraints, ensuring `2 ≤ n ≤ 100` and `1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1`.

- The function first reads `n` and `k` from input, followed by the string `line`.
- It then swaps the positions of 'G' and 'T' if 'G' is positioned after 'T' to ensure 'G' always comes before 'T'.
- The function iterates through the range from `G_pos` to `T_pos` in steps of `k`, checking for obstacles.
- If the grasshopper encounters an obstacle ('#'), the function breaks out of the loop and returns 'NO'.
- If the grasshopper reaches the target position (`pos == T_pos`), the function sets `reachable` to `True` and returns 'YES'.
- If the loop completes without finding the target or encountering an obstacle, the function returns 'NO'.

Potential edge cases:
- If `n` or `k` do not meet the specified constraints (i.e., `n < 2` or `k > n - 1`), the function should handle these cases and return an appropriate error message. However, the provided code does not explicitly check for these conditions, leading to undefined behavior for invalid inputs.

Missing functionality:
- The function should validate the input constraints for `n` and `k` before proceeding with the main logic to avoid potential errors or undefined behavior.
