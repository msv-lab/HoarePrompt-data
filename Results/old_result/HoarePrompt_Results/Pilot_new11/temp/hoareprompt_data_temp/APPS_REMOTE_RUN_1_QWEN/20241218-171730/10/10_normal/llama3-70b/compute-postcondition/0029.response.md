The code `right += 1` increments the value of `right` by 1. Since the initial state is given as `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `top` is 1, and `bottom` is either 1 or 0, the condition for updating `left` is not checked in this code snippet because it does not depend on `right`. Therefore, the values of `left`, `top`, and `bottom` remain unchanged.

The only variable that is updated is `right`, which is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`left` is 0, `right` is 1, `top` is 1, `bottom` is either 1 or 0**
