The code sets `max_lemons` to the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. Since `a`, `b`, and `c` are integer inputs, `b // 2` and `c // 4` will also be integers. The value of `max_lemons` will be the smallest of these three values. The initial states of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`a` is an integer input from the user within the range 1 to 1000, `b` is an integer input from the user, `c` is an integer input from the user; `max_lemons` is the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.**
