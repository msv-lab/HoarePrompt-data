The code `curr_beauty += 1` increments the value of `curr_beauty` by 1. Since `curr_beauty` was previously set to 0, it is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `curr_beauty`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^5 \), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' or 'S', `golden` is a list of integers containing the indices of all characters in `s` that are equal to 'G', `max_beauty` is the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`, `left` is the index of the first 'G' in the string `s` if there is at least one 'G', otherwise `left = n`, `right = 1`, and `curr_beauty = 1`, and the current value of `left` is less than `right`**
