The code assigns the value of `i` to `min_t`. This means that `min_t` now holds the same value as `i`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `mid + 3`, `min_t` is `mid + 3`, `min_cost` is the current value of `cost`, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `t` is equal to `mid`, `cost` is the sum of the minimum distances between each element in `sticks` and either `i` or `i-1`**
