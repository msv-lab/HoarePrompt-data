To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze how the loop variable `i` changes and what conditions must hold for the loop to continue.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and \(n > 2\).
   - `divisors` is a list containing all unique divisors of `n` from 2 to \(\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor + 1\) along with their corresponding quotients, ensuring no duplicates.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 2` to `i = \(\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor + 1\)`.
   - For each value of `i` within this range, the loop body is executed, and if `n % i == 0`, the quotient is added to `divisors`.

3. **Loop Variable `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value \(k\) where \(2 \leq k \leq \lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor\).
   - In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes \(k + 1\).

4. **Condition for Continuing the Loop:**
   - The loop will continue as long as \(k + 1 \leq \lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor + 1\).
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, \(k + 1\) must be less than or equal to \(\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor + 1\).

5. **State Adjustment:**
   - Since `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, in the next iteration, `i` will be \(k + 1\).
   - The condition \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and \(n > 2\) remains unchanged.
   - The `divisors` list will remain the same unless the loop adds a new element based on the new value of `i`.

### Final State:

Given that `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration and it will be incremented to `k + 1` in the next iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- `divisors` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now \(k + 1\).

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and \(n > 2\), `divisors` is a list containing all unique divisors of `n` from 2 to \(\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor + 1\) along with their corresponding quotients, ensuring no duplicates, and `i` is \(k + 1\)**.
