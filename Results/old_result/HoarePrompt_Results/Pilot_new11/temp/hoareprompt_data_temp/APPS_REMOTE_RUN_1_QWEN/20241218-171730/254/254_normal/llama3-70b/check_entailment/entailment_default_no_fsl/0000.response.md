Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case. Specifically, the logic used to determine if Mishka can switch on the garlands such that at least one is lit every second after switching them on is flawed.

The key issue lies in the calculation of the Least Common Multiple (LCM) using the product and GCD, which is not the correct approach for determining if the garlands will cover all seconds after their last switch-on time. Instead, the LCM should be calculated directly using the formula involving the GCD:

\[ \text{lcm}(a, b, c) = \frac{a \times b \times c}{\text{gcd}(a, b, c) \times \text{gcd}(\text{gcd}(a, b), c)} \]

However, the program incorrectly attempts to use a simplified form that does not account for all necessary conditions. Additionally, the logic for checking if the calculated LCM covers all required seconds is also incorrect.

To illustrate the failure, consider the input (4, 2, 3):

- The program calculates the LCM using the provided method, which results in an incorrect value.
- The program checks if this LCM is divisible by k1, k2, and k3, which is not the correct way to ensure coverage.

A correct solution would involve checking if the maximum of the initial times plus the periodic intervals covers all seconds. A more appropriate approach would be to check if the maximum of the initial times plus the least common multiple of the intervals covers all subsequent seconds, ensuring at least one garland is lit at any given time.

Thus, the program fails to meet the problem description for every potential case, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
