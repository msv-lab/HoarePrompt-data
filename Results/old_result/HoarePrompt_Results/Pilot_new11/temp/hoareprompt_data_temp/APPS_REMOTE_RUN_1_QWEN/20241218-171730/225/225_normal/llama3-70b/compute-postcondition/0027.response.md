Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of capital English letters 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y', with a length not exceeding 100; `vowels` is 'AEIOUY'; `n` is the length of `s`; `i` is the index of the last vowel encountered; `last_vowel` is the index of the last vowel encountered; `max_jump` is the maximum of its current value and the distance between consecutive vowels divided by 2 rounded up plus 1. `last_vowel` is not equal to `n - 1`. If no vowels are present in `s`, `last_vowel` remains -1 and `max_jump` remains 0.***
