The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `A`. `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 2 <= n, m <= 50, and `A` is a 2D list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1. Based on the provided output cases, the function always returns -1. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept `n`, `m`, and `A` and return -1.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, and `A`, and returns -1.**
