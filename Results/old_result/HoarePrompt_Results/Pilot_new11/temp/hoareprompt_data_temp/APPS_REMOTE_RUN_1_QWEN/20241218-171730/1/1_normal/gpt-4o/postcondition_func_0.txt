The function processes a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters `[`, `]`, `:`, and `|`. It aims to find the first occurrence of `[` and the last occurrence of `]` within the string. Then, it searches for the first and last occurrences of `:` within the substring between these two brackets. If any of these characters do not exist in the specified order or positions, the function prints `-1`. Otherwise, it counts the number of `|` characters between the first and last `:` found within the bracketed substring and adds 4 to this count, then prints the result.
