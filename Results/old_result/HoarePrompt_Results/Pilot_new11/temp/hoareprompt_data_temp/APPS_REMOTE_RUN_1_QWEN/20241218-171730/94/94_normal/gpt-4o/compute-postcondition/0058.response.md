The code `new_pos = new_row * 2 + new_col` assigns the value of `new_pos` based on the current values of `new_row` and `new_col`. Given that `new_row` and `new_col` are either 0 or 1, the value of `new_pos` will be one of the following: 0, 1, 2, or 3. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`queue` is a non-empty list containing elements where `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, `new_row` and `new_col` are either 0 or 1, `new_pos` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `directions` remains unchanged as [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]**
