According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y`. The loop iterates over the range from -1000 to 1000 inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is -998, `y` is an integer within the range \([-1000, 1000]\), `times` is a non-empty list for each `y` and contains at least `K` elements (sorted in ascending order), and `ans` is `times[K - 1]`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `y` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `y` should be -997.

The state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be as follows:

State: **`x` is -998, `y` is -997, `times` is a non-empty list for each `y` and contains at least `K` elements (sorted in ascending order), `ans` is `times[K - 1]`**
