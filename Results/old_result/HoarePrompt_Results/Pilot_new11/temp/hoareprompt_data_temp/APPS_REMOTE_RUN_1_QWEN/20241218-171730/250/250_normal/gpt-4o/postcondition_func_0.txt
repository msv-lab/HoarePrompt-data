- The function assumes that the input sequence \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) is provided as a list of integers via the `input()` function. If the input is not correctly formatted, the function may behave unpredictably.
- The function also assumes that \(x\) and \(y\) are provided as integers via the `input()` function. If non-integer inputs are provided for \(x\) or \(y\), the function will raise a `ValueError`.
- The function does not handle cases where the sequence \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) is not strictly increasing or does not satisfy the given constraints (i.e., \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), \(2 \leq l \leq 10^9\), and \(1 \leq x < y \leq l\)). If these constraints are violated, the function's behavior is undefined.
