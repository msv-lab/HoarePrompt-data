Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to turn over all \(n\) skewers with the minimal number of actions as specified in the problem description. Specifically, the logic for calculating the number of actions \(l\) and the sequence of skewers to be turned over is flawed.

#### Issues:

1. **Calculation of Actions \(l\)**:
   - The formula used to calculate \(l\) is \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + k - 1}{k * 2 + 1} \right\rfloor\).
   - However, this formula does not correctly account for the requirement to turn over all \(n\) skewers with the minimal number of actions.

2. **Sequence of Skewers to Turn Over**:
   - The sequence of skewers stored in `res` is generated using \(i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1\), which does not ensure that all skewers are turned over with the minimal number of actions.
   - For instance, consider \(n = 6\) and \(k = 1\):
     - The program would generate the sequence `[1, 3, 5]`.
     - According to the problem description, turning skewers 2 and 5 is a valid solution, but the program does not generate this sequence.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases properly, especially when \(n \leq k + 2\). For example, if \(n = 3\) and \(k = 1\), the program incorrectly generates a sequence that does not turn over all skewers.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to:
- Determine the minimum number of actions \(l\) needed to turn over all \(n\) skewers.
- Generate a sequence of skewers that ensures all skewers are turned over in the minimum number of steps.

A correct implementation would involve a more complex algorithm, such as a breadth-first search or dynamic programming approach, to find the optimal sequence of actions. The current implementation does not meet these requirements and thus is incorrect.
