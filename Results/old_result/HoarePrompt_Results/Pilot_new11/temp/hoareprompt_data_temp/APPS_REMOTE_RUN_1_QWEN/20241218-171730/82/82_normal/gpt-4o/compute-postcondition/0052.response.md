The code assigns the value of `current_lcm` to `min_lcm`. This means `min_lcm` now holds the same value as `current_lcm`, and no other variables are affected. The initial conditions for `new_a`, `a`, `candidate`, `new_b`, `current_lcm`, `min_lcm`, and `min_k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `a` and `candidate` remain unchanged, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` is `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `current_lcm` remains unchanged, `min_lcm` is `current_lcm`, `min_k` remains unchanged**
