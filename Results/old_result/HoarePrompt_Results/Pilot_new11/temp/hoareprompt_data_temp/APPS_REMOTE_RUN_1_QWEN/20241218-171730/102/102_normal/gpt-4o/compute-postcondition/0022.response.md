Let's analyze the given loop step-by-step to determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State
- `n` is an integer obtained from input.
- `a` is an integer obtained from input.
- `b` is an integer obtained from input.

### Loop Analysis
The loop runs for `x` in the range `n // a + 1`. For each iteration, it checks if \((n - x * a) \% b == 0\). If this condition is met, it sets \(y\) to \((n - x * a) // b\) and prints 'YES' followed by the values of \(x\) and \(y\), then returns. If the condition is not met, the loop continues to the next iteration.

### Key Observations
1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will only execute if \((n - x * a) \% b == 0\) is true for some \(x\) in the range \(0\) to \(n // a\).
2. **Return Statement**: The loop returns immediately when the condition is satisfied, so the loop can only execute once.
3. **No Further Iteration**: Once the loop finds a valid pair \((x, y)\), it exits without further iterations.

### Output State After All Iterations

#### Case 1: Loop Executes
- If the loop executes, it means there exists an integer \(x\) such that \((n - x * a) \% b == 0\). When this happens:
  - \(y = (n - x * a) // b\)
  - The function prints 'YES' and the values of \(x\) and \(y\)
  - The function returns

Since the loop only executes once, the values of \(n\), \(a\), and \(b\) do not change.

#### Case 2: Loop Does Not Execute
- If the loop does not execute, it means for all \(x\) in the range \(0\) to \(n // a\), the condition \((n - x * a) \% b == 0\) is false.
- In this case, the function does not print 'YES' or any values and simply returns without changing the values of \(n\), \(a\), and \(b\).

### Final Output State

- If the loop executes at least once, the function will have printed 'YES' and the values of \(x\) and \(y\), and returned. Hence, \(n\), \(a\), and \(b\) retain their original values.
- If the loop does not execute, the function simply returns without printing or changing the values of \(n\), \(a\), and \(b\).

Thus, the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:

**Output State: **`n` is an integer obtained from input, `a` is an integer obtained from input, `b` is an integer obtained from input. The function will either print 'YES' along with the values of `x` and `y` and return, or it will return without any print statements and the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
