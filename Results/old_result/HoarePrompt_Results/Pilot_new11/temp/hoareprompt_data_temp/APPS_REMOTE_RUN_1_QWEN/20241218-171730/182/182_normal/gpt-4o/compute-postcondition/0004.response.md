The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to handle a camera angle represented by an integer `x` where `-10^18 ≤ x ≤ 10^18`. If `x` is within the specified range, the function does not return anything (or returns a specific value depending on the context, but no indication is given). If `x` is outside the specified range, the function returns an error message indicating that the camera angle is out of bounds.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and returns an error message if the camera angle `x` is outside the range `-10^18 ≤ x ≤ 10^18`. If `x` is within the range, it does not return anything.**
