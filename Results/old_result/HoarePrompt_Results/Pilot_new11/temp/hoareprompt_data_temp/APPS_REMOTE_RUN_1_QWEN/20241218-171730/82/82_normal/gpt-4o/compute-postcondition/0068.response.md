Output State: **`a` is the same, `b` is the same, `diff` is the same, `min_lcm` is the same, `min_k` is the same, `k` is `diff // 2`, `new_a` is `(a + (diff // 2) - 1) // (diff // 2) * (diff // 2)`, `new_b` is `(b + (new_k - 1) - 1) // (new_k - 1) * (new_k - 1)`, `current_lcm` is recalculated based on `new_a` and `new_b`**.

Explanation: 
- The initial values of `a`, `b`, `diff`, `min_lcm`, `min_k`, and `k` remain unchanged.
- The variable `k` is set to `diff // 2`.
- The variable `new_a` is calculated as `(a + (diff // 2) - 1) // (diff // 2) * (diff // 2)`.
- The variable `new_b` is updated to `(b + (new_k - 1) - 1) // (new_k - 1) * (new_k - 1)`, where `new_k` is the same as `k` since no other value is assigned to `k`.
- The variable `current_lcm` is not explicitly updated in the given code snippet, so it retains its previous value based on `new_a` and `new_b`.
