The code `print('NO')` does not affect the values of any variables. It simply prints the string 'NO' to the console. Therefore, the only change is in the output, but the variables remain in their initial state.

Output State: **`k1` is an integer between 1 and 1500, `k2` is an integer between 1 and 1500, `k3` is an integer between 1 and 1500, `gcd_all` is the GCD of `gcd_k1_k2` and `k3`, and `gcd_all` is not equal to 1; prints 'NO'**
