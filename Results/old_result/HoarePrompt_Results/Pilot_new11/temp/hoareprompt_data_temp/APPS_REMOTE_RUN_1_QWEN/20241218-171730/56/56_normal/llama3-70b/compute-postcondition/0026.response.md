`n` is decremented by \(2^x\), where \(x\) is the bit length of \(n\) minus 1. Given the initial conditions, the bit length of \(n\) is \(x+1\). After decrementing, the new value of `n` is \(n - 2^{x+1}\). The states of the other variables (`x`, `a`) are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is `n - 2^(x+1)`, `x` is the bit length of `n` minus 1, if `x <= i` we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; `a` is `[x]`**
