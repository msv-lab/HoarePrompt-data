The code swaps the values of `a` and `b` where `b` gets the original value of `a % b`. Given that both `a` and `b` are non-zero, `a % b` will give the remainder when `a` is divided by `b`.

Since `a` and `b` are non-zero, let's denote their initial values as `a_initial` and `b_initial`. After executing `a, b = b, a % b`, `b` will take the value of `a_initial % b_initial`, and `a` will take the value of `b_initial`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`a` is `b_initial`, `b` is `a_initial % b_initial`**
