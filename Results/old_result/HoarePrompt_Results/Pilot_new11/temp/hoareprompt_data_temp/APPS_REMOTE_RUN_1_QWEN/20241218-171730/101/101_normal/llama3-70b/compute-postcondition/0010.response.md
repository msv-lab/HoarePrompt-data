To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the requirements for the loop to continue.

### Given Information:
- `n` is the first integer input.
- `pixels` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` characters ('.' or 'w').
- `white_pixels` is a list of tuples representing the coordinates `(i, j)` of all 'w' characters in the `pixels` grid and must contain at least one tuple.
- `min_x` is the `x` value from the tuple in `white_pixels`.
- `min_y` is the `y` value from the tuple in `white_pixels`.
- `max_x` is the maximum `x` value from the tuples in `white_pixels`.
- `max_y` is the maximum `y value` from the tuples in `white_pixels`.
- `max_x` and `max_y` are updated to be the maximum values between their current values and the `x` and `y` coordinates of the last 'w' pixel added to `white_pixels`.

### Loop Condition:
The loop iterates over each tuple `(x, y)` in `white_pixels`.

### Current States at the End of Previous Iteration:
- `n` is the first integer input.
- `pixels` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` characters ('.' or 'w').
- `white_pixels` is a list of tuples representing the coordinates `(i, j)` of all 'w' characters in the `pixels` grid and contains at least one tuple.
- `min_x` is the `x` value from the tuple in `white_pixels`.
- `min_y` is the `y` value from the tuple in `white_pixels`.
- `max_x` is the maximum `x` value from the tuples in `white_pixels`.
- `max_y` is the maximum `y` value from the tuples in `white_pixels`.
- `max_x` and `max_y` are updated to be the maximum values between their current values and the `x` and `y` coordinates of the last 'w' pixel added to `white_pixels`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Execution**: The loop iterates over each tuple `(x, y)` in `white_pixels`.
2. **Loop Continuation Condition**: For the loop to continue, there must be at least one tuple left in `white_pixels`.
3. **State Adjustments**:
   - `white_pixels` must still contain at least one tuple because the loop requires at least one element to iterate over.
   - `min_x` and `min_y` might change based on the current tuple being processed, but they will be updated accordingly.
   - `max_x` and `max_y` will also be updated if the current tuple `(x, y)` has larger `x` or `y` values compared to the current `max_x` and `max_y`.

### Final State:
For the loop to execute one more time, `white_pixels` must still contain at least one tuple. The values of `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` will be updated based on the current tuple `(x, y)` being processed.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `white_pixels` must contain at least one tuple.
- `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` will be updated based on the current tuple `(x, y)`.

### Updated State:
State: **`n` is the first integer input, `pixels` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` characters ('.' or 'w'), `white_pixels` is a list of tuples representing the coordinates `(i, j)` of all 'w' characters in the `pixels` grid and must contain at least one tuple, `min_x` is the `x` value from the tuple in `white_pixels`, `min_y` is the `y` value from the tuple in `white_pixels`, `max_x` is the maximum `x` value from the tuples in `white_pixels`, `max_y` is the maximum `y` value from the tuples in `white_pixels`**.

Note: The exact values of `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` will be updated during the current iteration but are not specified here as they depend on the specific tuple being processed.
