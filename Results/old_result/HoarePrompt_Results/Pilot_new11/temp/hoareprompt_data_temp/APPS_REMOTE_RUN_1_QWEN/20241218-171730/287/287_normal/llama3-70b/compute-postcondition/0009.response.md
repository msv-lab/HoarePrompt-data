To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop continues to execute and how the variables change with each iteration.

Given:
- The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = int(n ** 0.5)`.
- Initially, `res` is 2 unless `i * i == n`, in which case `res` becomes 1.

Let's break down the steps:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(n ** 0.5)`.
2. **Determine the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration**: We need to know the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.
3. **Check if `res` changes based on the previous `i` value**: If `i * i == n`, then `res` becomes 1; otherwise, it remains 2.

Since we don't have the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, let's denote it as `i_prev`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue if `i_prev + 1 <= int(n ** 0.5)`.
2. **Update `i`**: At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_prev + 1`.
3. **Update `res`**: `res` remains 2 unless `(i_prev + 1) * (i_prev + 1) == n`, in which case `res` becomes 1.

### Conclusion:

- If `(i_prev + 1) * (i_prev + 1) != n`, then `res` remains 2.
- If `(i_prev + 1) * (i_prev + 1) == n`, then `res` becomes 1.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

- `i` is `i_prev + 1`.
- `res` is either 2 or 1 depending on the condition `(i_prev + 1) * (i_prev + 1) == n`.

Since we do not have the exact value of `i_prev`, we express it symbolically.

### Final Answer:

State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 1 <= n <= 10^9, `i` is i_prev + 1, and `res` is 2 unless (i_prev + 1) * (i_prev + 1) == n, in which case `res` is 1**.
