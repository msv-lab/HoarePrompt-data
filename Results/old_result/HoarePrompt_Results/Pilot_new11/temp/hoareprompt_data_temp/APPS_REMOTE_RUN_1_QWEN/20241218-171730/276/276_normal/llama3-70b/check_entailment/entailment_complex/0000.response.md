Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the solution for comparing two numbers represented in the golden system. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires comparing two numbers represented in the golden system (base \(\frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2}\)) and determining which has a larger decimal value.

2. **Function Implementation**: The function `func_1` accurately converts a string representing a number in the golden system to its decimal equivalent. It iterates over the string in reverse, multiplying each digit by the appropriate power of the golden ratio \( q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \), and sums these values to get the decimal representation. This covers all possible inputs, including edge cases like single-digit strings.

3. **Main Logic**: The main part of the program reads two strings, converts them to their decimal equivalents using `func_1`, and then compares these decimal values. Based on the comparison, it prints `>`, `<`, or `=` as required.

4. **Handling Valid Inputs**: The assumption is made that the inputs are valid strings consisting only of '0' and '1'. Since the problem description states that the input is valid, the program correctly processes these inputs.

5. **Correct Output**: For any valid input, the program correctly determines the relationship between the two numbers in terms of their decimal values and outputs the appropriate symbol.

Given that the program adheres to the described logic and correctly handles all aspects of the problem without any omissions or errors under valid input conditions, it meets the problem description requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
