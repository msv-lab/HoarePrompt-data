The function accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters with a maximum length of 50 characters. It then iterates through all possible substrings of `s` to find the longest non-palindromic substring. If no non-palindromic substring is found, it returns 0. The function prints the length of the longest non-palindromic substring found or 0 if none exists.
