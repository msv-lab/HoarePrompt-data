`curr_lat` is decremented by `t / 111.195`. Since `t` is an integer and `curr_lat` is initially 90, the new value of `curr_lat` will be `90 - t / 111.195`. The other variables (`n`, `dir`, and `t`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `curr_lat` is 90 - t / 111.195, `t` is an integer, `dir` is 'South'**
