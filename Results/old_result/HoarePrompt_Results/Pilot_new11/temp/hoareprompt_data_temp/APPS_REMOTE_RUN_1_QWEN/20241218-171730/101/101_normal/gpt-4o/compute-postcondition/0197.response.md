Postcondition: ***`result[i][j]` is either `.` or `+`. If `result[i][j]` is `+`, all other elements in `result` remain unchanged. If `result[i][j]` is not `+`, it remains as `.`.***

Explanation:
- The if condition checks if `i` is equal to `top` or `bottom` or `j` is equal to `left` or `right`.
- If the condition is true and `result[i][j]` is `+`, no other elements in `result` change.
- If the condition is true and `result[i][j]` is not `+`, `result[i][j]` remains `.`.
- Since there is no else part, the postcondition only needs to consider the if part and the given preconditions.
