According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `N`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `N`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `i` is the current value of the loop index.
- `N` is the upper limit of the loop.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `N`. If `i` is already equal to `N`, the loop will terminate.

Since no specific values for `i` and `N` are provided in the example, let's denote the state at the end of the previous iteration as follows:

- Let's assume `i` is currently `k`.
- Therefore, `N` is still `N`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `k + 1`. This means `i` needs to be `k + 1` for the loop to continue.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`i` is k + 1, `N` must be greater than or equal to k + 1**
