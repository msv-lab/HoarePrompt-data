`s` is assigned the value of the input string, which is a string of length `n` containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T'. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1`, and `s` is a string of length `n` containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T'.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1`, and `s` is a string of length `n` containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T'**
