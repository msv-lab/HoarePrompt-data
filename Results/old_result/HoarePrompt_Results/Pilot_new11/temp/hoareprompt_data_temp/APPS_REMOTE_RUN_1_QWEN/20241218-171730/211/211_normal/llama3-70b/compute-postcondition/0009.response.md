Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is calculated as the cumulative sum of the first `i` elements of the list `a`, `a` is a list of integers based on the input, `prefix_sum[0]` is always 0, `prefix_sum[i + 1]` for `0 <= i < n` is the sum of the first `i + 1` elements of `a`.**

### Explanation:
- **Initialization:** Initially, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements set to 0. The array `a` remains unchanged.
- **Loop Execution:**
  - The loop iterates from `0` to `n-1`.
  - For each iteration `i`, `prefix_sum[i + 1]` is updated to `prefix_sum[i] + a[i]`.

After the loop completes:
- `prefix_sum[0]` remains 0.
- Each subsequent element `prefix_sum[i + 1]` (for `0 <= i < n`) will be the sum of the first `i + 1` elements of `a`.

If the loop does not execute (`n == 0`):
- `prefix_sum` will still be `[0]`.
- `a` will remain unchanged.
