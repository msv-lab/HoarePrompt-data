The code assigns the value `0` to the variable `ans`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the value of `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged, and `ans` is now `0`.

Output State: **`n` is a specific integer, `pos` is a specific integer, `l` is a specific integer, `r` is a specific integer, `ans` is 0**
