According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `visited[x]`. The loop will continue as long as `visited[x]` is `False`. At the end of the last iteration, `visited[x]` is `True`. Therefore, to allow the loop to execute one more time, `visited[x]` needs to be set back to `False`.

No other states need to be adjusted since the conditions related to `cycle` and `x` do not affect the loop's continuation.

State: **`visited[x]` is `False`; `cycle` contains `x`; `x` is `p[x] - 1`**
