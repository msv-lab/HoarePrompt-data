The code snippet `times = func_2(x, y, x, y)` calls the function `func_2` with arguments `x`, `y`, `x`, and `y`. However, the function `func_2` is not defined in the given code snippet. Since the function is not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `times`. But we know that `times` will be assigned the result of calling `func_2(x, y, x, y)`. 

The values of `ans` and `y` remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `x` remains `-1000`.

Output State: **`ans` is float('inf'), `x` is -1000, `y` is an integer within the range [-1000, 1000], `times` is the result of `func_2(-1000, y, -1000, y)`**
