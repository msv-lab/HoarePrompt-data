`beauty` is assigned the value 1. The value of `beauty` was previously the number of consecutive 'G's from index `i-1` to the first 'S' or the end of the string `s`. Since `beauty` is now explicitly set to 1, this overrides the previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer, `j` is `n`, `beauty` is 1, `left` is the index of the last 'G' in the string `s`, or `n` if there are no 'G's, `right` is `n`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is `beauty` if `beauty` > 0, else 0, and `golden` is a list of indices of all characters in `s` that are equal to 'G'.**
