The code `new_pos = new_row * 2 + new_col` calculates the position in a 2D grid based on the `new_row` and `new_col` values. Given that `new_row` is between 0 and 2 (inclusive) and `new_col` is between 0 and 2 (inclusive), the calculation of `new_pos` will produce a value between 0 and 7 (inclusive). The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`directions` is a non-empty list; `current` is a valid puzzle state with an 'X' position; `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is `new_row * 2 + new_col`**
