`sofas` is a list containing tuples, and each tuple contains four integers representing coordinates. The code appends a new tuple `(x1, y1, x2, y2)` to the list `sofas`. The values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are taken from inputs. The variables `d`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` remain unchanged, and the list `sofas` now includes the newly appended tuple.

Output State: **`d` is at least 1, `x1` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer, `x2` is an input integer, `y2` is an input integer, `sofas` is a list containing the tuples `(x1, y1, x2, y2)` and possibly more.**
