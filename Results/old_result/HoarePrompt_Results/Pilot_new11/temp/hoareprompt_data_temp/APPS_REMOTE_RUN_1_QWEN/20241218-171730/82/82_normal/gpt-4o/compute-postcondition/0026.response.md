The code assigns the value of `func_2(new_a, new_b)` to `current_lcm`. Since `func_2` returns a value, let's denote the returned value as `lcm_value`. This value replaces the previous value of `current_lcm`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is the smallest multiple of `diff // k` that is greater than or equal to its original value, `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `b` is the smallest multiple of `diff // k` that is greater than or equal to its original value, `diff` is the same, `min_lcm` is the minimum value between the previous `min_lcm` and `lcm_value`, `min_k` is now `diff // k`, `candidate` is now `diff // k`, `new_b` is the smallest multiple of `diff // k` that is greater than or equal to `b + diff // k - 1`, and `current_lcm` is `lcm_value`.**
