The function processes a series of movements defined by an integer `n` and corresponding directions and distances. It checks if each movement is valid based on the position constraints and direction restrictions. After processing all movements, it determines if the final position is 0. If the final position is 0, the function prints 'YES', indicating that all movements were valid and the final position is 0. Otherwise, it prints 'NO', indicating that the final position is not 0 or that any of the movements were invalid. Potential edge cases include movements that would cause the position to go out of bounds (less than 0 or greater than 20000) or invalid directions (only "North", "South", "West", or "East" are allowed). The function also checks if the initial or final position is exactly 0, which would make the movement invalid.
