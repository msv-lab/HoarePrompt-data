Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the program meets the problem requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads an even integer `n` (number of cards) and a list of `n` integers (numbers on the cards).
   - The input handling is straightforward and aligns with the problem description.

2. **Counting Frequencies**:
   - The program uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each integer in the list.
   - This ensures that the program can easily track how many times each number appears on the cards.

3. **Sorting Unique Numbers by Frequency**:
   - The unique numbers are sorted by their frequency in descending order using `sorted(count.keys(), key=lambda x: count[x])`.
   - This step is crucial for identifying pairs of numbers that could potentially allow a fair game.

4. **Checking Conditions for Fair Game**:
   - The program checks if there are at least two unique numbers.
   - It then verifies if the last two numbers in the sorted list (which have the highest frequencies) appear exactly `n // 2` times each.
   - If both conditions are met, it prints "YES" followed by the two numbers.
   - If either condition fails, it prints "NO".

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where there are fewer than two unique numbers, ensuring that "NO" is printed.
   - It also correctly identifies scenarios where the chosen numbers do not meet the condition of appearing exactly `n // 2` times each, ensuring that "NO" is printed.

### Why the Program is Correct:
- The program correctly interprets the problem statement by checking for the presence of at least two unique numbers and verifying if they appear exactly half the number of cards each.
- The use of `Counter` and sorting ensures that the program can efficiently find and verify the required conditions.
- The program outputs "YES" and the appropriate numbers if a fair game is possible, and "NO" otherwise.

Since the program accurately follows the problem description and handles all relevant cases, the correctness is **True**.
