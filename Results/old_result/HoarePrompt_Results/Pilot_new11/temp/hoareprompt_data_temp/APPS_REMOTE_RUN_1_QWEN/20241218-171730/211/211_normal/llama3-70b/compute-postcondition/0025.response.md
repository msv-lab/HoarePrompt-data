The code `l = r` assigns the current value of `r` to the variable `l`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `prefix_sum`, `k`, or any other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is that `l` is now equal to `r`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `prefix_sum[r + 1]` is not equal to 0, `prefix_sum[r + 1]` is not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, `k` is increased by 1, `l` equals `r`**
