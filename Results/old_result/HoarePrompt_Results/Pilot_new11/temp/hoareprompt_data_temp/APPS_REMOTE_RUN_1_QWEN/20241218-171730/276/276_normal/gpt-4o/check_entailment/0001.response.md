Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for calculating the value of a number in the golden system. Specifically, the program incorrectly calculates the power of `q` starting from `q ** (n - i - 1)` instead of `q ** (n - i)`. This discrepancy leads to incorrect values being computed, especially for the last digit of the string. For example, consider the input:

```
1000
111
```

The correct calculation for the first number `1000` should be \(q^3\), but the program calculates \(q^2\). This results in an incorrect comparison, leading to the wrong output `<` instead of `>`. Therefore, the program fails to meet the problem description for certain inputs.
