The code appends the current value of `i` (which is 1) to the `positions` list. The initial value of `i` is 1, and since the `positions` list was initially empty, after appending, it will contain the value 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 1000, `positions` is a list containing [1], and `i` is 2**
