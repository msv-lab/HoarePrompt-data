Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem description. Specifically, the code does not accurately determine the number of standing spectators at time `t`. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why it fails:

1. **Case Analysis**:
   - When `t <= n`, the code correctly prints the minimum of `t` and `k`. This part of the logic is correct.
   - When `t > n`, the code prints `k - (t - n) % k`. However, this formula does not correctly represent the number of standing spectators in the Mexican wave pattern.

2. **Mexican Wave Pattern**:
   - For `t > n`, the number of standing spectators should follow a repeating cycle of length `k`. Specifically, the number of standing spectators is `k` until the last few steps, where it decreases as the wave wraps around.

3. **Example Case**:
   - Consider the example given in the notes: `n = 10`, `k = 5`, `t = 12`.
     - According to the pattern, at `t = 12`, the number of standing spectators should be `3` because the wave has completed its cycle once and is in the process of wrapping around.
     - However, the code incorrectly calculates this as `k - (t - n) % k`, which gives `5 - (12 - 10) % 5 = 5 - 2 % 5 = 3`, but this does not correctly reflect the wave pattern.

4. **Proper Logic**:
   - To correctly implement the logic, we need to determine the position within the current cycle and adjust accordingly. The correct approach would involve calculating the effective position `p = (t - 1) % k` and then determining the number of standing spectators based on whether `p` is less than `t - n`.

Given these points, the code does not accurately implement the required logic for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
