Postcondition: ***`count` is an integer from `color_count.values()`, and `can_distribute` remains `False`. If `count` is greater than `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, `can_distribute` remains unchanged and no additional operations are performed.***
