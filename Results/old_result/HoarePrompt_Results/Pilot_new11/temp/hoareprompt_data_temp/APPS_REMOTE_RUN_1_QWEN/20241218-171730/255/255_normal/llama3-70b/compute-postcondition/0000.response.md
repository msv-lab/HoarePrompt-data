The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer before assigning it to the variable `n`. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that `1 <= n <= 500`, the value of `n` will be updated to the integer input provided, but the specific value is not known without additional input. The length of the string `s` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input value (1 <= n <= 500), `s` is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters**
