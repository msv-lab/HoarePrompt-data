The code sets `top` to the value of `i`. The value of `i` was previously `n + 1`, so now `top` is also `n + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `j` is a value within the range `[0, m - 1]`, `top` is `n + 1`, `bottom` is the largest row index of any 'w' in the `n`-th row of `screen`, `left` is the smallest column index of any 'w' in the `n`-th row of `screen`, `right` is the largest column index of any 'w' in the `n`-th row of `screen`, `m` must be greater than 0, the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w', and `top` is not None.**
