The code `print('YES')` simply prints the string 'YES' to the console and does not affect any variable values. The initial conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `A` contains `n` integers where each element `a_{i}` satisfies -10^3 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^3; `total_sum` is the sum of all elements in `A`. The current value of `total_sum` is not equal to 0**
