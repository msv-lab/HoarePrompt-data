Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, `A` is a 2D list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, `operations` is a list of tuples representing the positions (i+1, j+1) of the top-left corners of the 2x2 submatrices in `A` that satisfied the condition and were flipped in `B`, `B` is a 2D list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, and for every `j` in the range `[0, m)`, `A[i][j]` is equal to `B[i][j]`. If there exists any `j` in the range `[0, m)` such that `A[i][j]` is not equal to `B[i][j]`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, the function does not return anything.**
