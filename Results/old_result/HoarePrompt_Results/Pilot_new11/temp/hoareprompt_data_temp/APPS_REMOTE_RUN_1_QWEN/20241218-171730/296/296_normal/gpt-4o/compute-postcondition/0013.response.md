The code `divisors.append(n // i)` appends the value of `n // i` to the list `divisors`. Given the initial state, `divisors` contains all unique divisors of `n` from 2 to \(\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor + 1\) along with their corresponding quotients, and `i` is `k + 1`. After appending `n // i` to `divisors`, the value of `divisors` will include this new element.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and \(n > 2\); `divisors` is a list containing all unique divisors of `n` from 2 to \(\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor + 1\) along with their corresponding quotients, including `n // i`; `i` is `k + 1`**
