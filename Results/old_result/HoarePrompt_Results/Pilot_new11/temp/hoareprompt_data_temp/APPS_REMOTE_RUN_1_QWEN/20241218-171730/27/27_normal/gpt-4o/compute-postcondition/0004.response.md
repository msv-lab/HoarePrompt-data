The code `print(max_expr)` simply prints the value of `max_expr`. It does not change the value of any variable. The value of `max_expr` remains the same as it was before the print statement. All other variables (`x`, `y`, `z`, `expressions`, `max_value`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are updated to the values read from `sys.stdin.read()`, each with exactly one digit after the decimal point, ranging from 0.1 to 200.0 inclusive; `expressions` is a list of tuples containing expressions and their corresponding string representations; `max_value` is the maximum value found among the first elements of the tuples in `expressions`; `max_expr` is the corresponding string representation of the expression that evaluated to this maximum value; `max_expr` is printed.**
