The code `b *= 2` multiplies the current value of `b` by 2. Given that `b` is an integer between 1 and 10 (inclusive), after executing this line, `b` will be one of the following values: 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10, depending on its original value.

- If `b` was 1, it becomes 2.
- If `b` was 2, it becomes 4.
- If `b` was 3, it becomes 6.
- If `b` was 4, it becomes 8.
- If `b` was 5, it becomes 10.
- If `b` was 6, it becomes 12 (but since `b` is limited to the range [1, 10], it remains 10).
- If `b` was 7, it becomes 14 (but since `b` is limited to the range [1, 10], it remains 10).
- If `b` was 8, it becomes 16 (but since `b` is limited to the range [1, 10], it remains 10).
- If `b` was 9, it becomes 18 (but since `b` is limited to the range [1, 10], it remains 10).
- If `b` was 10, it becomes 20 (but since `b` is limited to the range [1, 10], it remains 10).

Therefore, after executing `b *= 2`, `b` will be one of the values 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10. The values of `a` and `years` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is 3 * a, `b` is either 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10, and `years` is 0**
