The code `a, b = b, a % b` updates the values of `a` and `b`. Initially, `a` is equal to `b` and `b` is non-zero.

1. The first part of the assignment, `a = b`, sets `a` to the current value of `b`.
2. The second part, `b = a % b`, calculates `a % b` (which is `b % b` since `a` is equal to `b`). Since any number modulo itself is 0, `b` becomes 0.

However, the initial condition states that `b` must be non-zero, which means the second assignment cannot actually happen as written. Given this constraint, the code effectively cannot run as intended because `b` would have to be zero to satisfy the modulo operation, contradicting the initial condition.

Output State: **`a` is equal to `b`, `b` is non-zero and the code results in an invalid state due to the initial condition being violated.**
