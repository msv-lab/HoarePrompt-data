Postcondition: ***`i` is `k + 1`, `N` is greater than `k + 2`, `x1` is `x2`, `y1` is `x1`, `c1` is `c2`, `x2` is `y1`, `y2` is `x1`, `c2` is `c1`, `d` is 0, `cx` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `cy` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 0, `d2` is 0. Since the condition `d * d2 > d2` is not satisfied (as `d` and `d2` are both 0), the if part does not execute, and the postcondition remains as the initial state.***
