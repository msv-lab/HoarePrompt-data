Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the solution described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the program adheres to the problem requirements:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of bottle types `n` and the required amount of lemonade `L` from the first line of input.
   - It then reads the costs of each bottle type from the second line of input.

2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**:
   - The program initializes a `dp` array of length `L + 1` with all elements set to infinity (`float('inf')`).
   - `dp[0]` is set to 0 because zero liters of lemonade cost zero roubles.

3. **DP Transition**:
   - For each possible amount of lemonade `i` from 1 to `L`, the program iterates over all bottle types `j`.
   - It calculates the volume of the bottle type `j` using `vol = 2 ** j - 1`.
   - If `vol` is less than or equal to `i`, it updates `dp[i]` to be the minimum of its current value and `dp[i - vol] + costs[j]`.

4. **Output Calculation**:
   - After filling the `dp` array, the program checks `dp[L]` to see if it has been updated from its initial value of infinity.
   - If `dp[L]` is still infinity, it means no combination of bottle types can achieve exactly `L` liters, so the program prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints the minimum cost `dp[L]`.

Given these steps, the program correctly computes the minimum cost to obtain at least `L` liters of lemonade using the available bottle types and their respective costs. The use of dynamic programming ensures that the solution is efficient even for large values of `L`.

Since the program handles all aspects of the problem statement as described, including the handling of edge cases (e.g., `L = 0` is naturally covered by setting `dp[0] = 0`), it is correct according to the problem description.
