The `math.gcd` function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. Here, `gcd_all` is assigned the GCD of `gcd_k1_k2` and `k3`. Since `gcd_k1_k2` is the GCD of `k1` and `k2`, and both `k1` and `k2` are integers between 1 and 1500, `gcd_k1_k2` is also an integer within this range. `k3` is also an integer between 1 and 1500. The value of `gcd_all` will be the GCD of these two integers.

Output State: **`k1` is an integer between 1 and 1500, `k2` is an integer between 1 and 1500, `k3` is an integer between 1 and 1500, `gcd_all` is the GCD of `gcd_k1_k2` and `k3`.**
