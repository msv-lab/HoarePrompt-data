Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the distribution of cake pieces to maximize the minimum number of pieces per plate. Specifically, consider the input `n=4`, `a=2`, `b=3`. According to the problem description, the correct output should be 1, as the only possible distribution is to have each plate with at least 1 piece of cake. However, the program outputs 2, which is incorrect because it does not satisfy the condition that each plate contains at least one piece of cake. The program incorrectly increments `x` beyond the valid minimum value, leading to an incorrect result.
