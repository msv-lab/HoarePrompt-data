Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The annotated program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Specifically, it fails to correctly handle the case where `n` is a power of 2 and `k` is exactly 1. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Handling Power of 2 and `k` == 1:**
   - When `n` is a power of 2 (e.g., `n = 2^x`), the binary representation of `n` contains exactly one 1-bit at position `x`. For such cases, if `k` is exactly 1, the correct answer should be a single `-1` because \(2^{-1} + 2^{-1} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1\).
   - However, the current implementation does not handle this special case correctly. It processes the bits as usual, potentially modifying them, and then returns the result. This leads to incorrect outputs for such cases.

2. **Specific Example:**
   - Consider the input `n = 2` and `k = 1`. According to the problem description, the expected output is `Yes -1`, but the current implementation will process the bits and might return something else, leading to an incorrect result.

To fix this issue, the program should add a special check for the case where `n` is a power of 2 and `k` is exactly 1, ensuring that it returns `Yes -1` in such cases.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, k):
    if (k > n) :
        return 'No'
    
    bits = []
    for i in range(60, -1, -1):
        if n >> i & 1:
            bits.append(i)
    
    if (len(bits) > k) :
        return 'No'
    
    if (n == 2**len(bits) and k == 1):
        return 'Yes -1'
    
    while len(bits) < k:
        smallest = bits.pop()
        bits.append(smallest - 1)
        bits.append(smallest - 1)
    
    bits.sort(reverse=True)
    return 'Yes\n' + ' '.join(map(str, bits))
```

With this correction, the program now correctly handles the special case where `n` is a power of 2 and `k` is exactly 1, ensuring it meets the problem description for all potential cases.
