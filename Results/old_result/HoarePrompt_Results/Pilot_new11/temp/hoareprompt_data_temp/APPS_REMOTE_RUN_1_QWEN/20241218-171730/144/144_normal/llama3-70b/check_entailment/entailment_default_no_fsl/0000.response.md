Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the code only checks for the presence of consecutive integers starting from 1 up to the maximum value in the array. However, the problem requires finding the maximum possible value of the mex, which can be higher than the maximum value in the array.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
2 3 3 3
```

The code will sort the array to `[2, 3, 3, 3]` and then iterate through it. Since `2` and `3` are present in the array, it will increment `mex` until it finds a gap. However, the correct mex for this array can be `4` (since `1` and `2` are present, but `4` is not), which the code fails to identify.

The correct approach would involve considering the maximum value in the array and checking if `mex` can be higher than that value. If the maximum value in the array is `k`, then `mex` could be `k + 1` if all values from `1` to `k` are present.
