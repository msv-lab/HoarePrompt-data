The code snippet `dp[j] += dp[j - 1]` increments each `dp[j]` (for all `j` from 1 to `f_max_n - 1`) by the value of `dp[j - 1]`. Given the initial conditions:

- `dp[0]` retains its original value.
- `dp[j]` for all `j` from 1 to `f_max_n - 1` is `dp[j] % MOD`.
- `f_max_n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is `k + 1`.

After executing the code, each `dp[j]` for `j` from 1 to `f_max_n - 1` will be updated to `dp[j - 1] + dp[j - 1]`, which simplifies to `2 * dp[j - 1]`. The value of `dp[0]` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `dp[0]` retains its original value.
- For each `j` from 1 to `f_max_n - 1`, `dp[j]` is now `2 * dp[j - 1] % MOD`.

Output State: **`dp[0]` retains its original value, `dp[j]` for all `j` from 1 to `f_max_n - 1` is `2 * dp[j - 1] % MOD`, `f_max_n` must be greater than 1, `i` is `k + 1`**
