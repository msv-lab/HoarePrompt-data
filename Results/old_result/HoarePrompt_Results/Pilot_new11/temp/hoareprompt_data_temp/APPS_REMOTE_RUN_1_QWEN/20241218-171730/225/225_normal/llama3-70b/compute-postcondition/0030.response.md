The code `print(max_jump)` simply prints the value of `max_jump` without changing it. The values of the other variables remain the same as they were before the execution of this line of code.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of capital English letters 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y', with a length not exceeding 100; `vowels` is 'AEIOUY'; `n` is the length of `s`; `i` is the index of the last vowel encountered; `last_vowel` is the index of the last vowel encountered; `max_jump` is the maximum of its current value and the distance between consecutive vowels divided by 2 rounded up plus 1. If `last_vowel` is not equal to `n - 1`, `last_vowel` remains unchanged and `max_jump` remains unchanged. If no vowels are present in `s`, `last_vowel` remains -1 and `max_jump` remains 0. The value of `max_jump` is printed.**
