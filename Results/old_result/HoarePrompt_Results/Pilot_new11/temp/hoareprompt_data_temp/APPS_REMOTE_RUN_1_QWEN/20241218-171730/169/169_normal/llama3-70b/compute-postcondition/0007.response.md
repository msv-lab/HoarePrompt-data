The code prints the value of `plus_count - minus_count`. This operation does not change the values of any variables; it only performs a calculation and outputs the result. The values of `s`, `n`, `minus_count`, and `plus_count` remain unchanged after executing the print statement.

Output State: **`s` is a string entered by the user, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `minus_count` is the number of hyphens in the string `s`, `plus_count` is the number of plus signs in the string `s`, and the value of `plus_count - minus_count` is printed.**
