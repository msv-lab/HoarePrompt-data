Output State: **`screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string is of length `m` and consists of characters ".", "w". `top` is the smallest row index of any 'w' in the screen, `bottom` is the largest row index of any 'w' in the screen, `left` is the smallest column index of any 'w' in the screen, `right` is the largest column index of any 'w' in the screen, `i` is `n` and `j` is `m`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each column `j` in the `i`-th row of the screen.
- When `screen[i][j]` is 'w', the loop updates the boundaries (`top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`) to ensure they encompass all the 'w' pixels encountered so far.
- If the loop does not execute (i.e., there are no 'w' pixels in the screen), then `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` will remain `None`.
- After the loop finishes, `i` will be `n` (since the loop condition is `range(m)` and `j` will be `m` (after completing all columns) and the loop will terminate.
- Therefore, the final values of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` will capture the smallest and largest row and column indices of any 'w' pixels in the screen.
