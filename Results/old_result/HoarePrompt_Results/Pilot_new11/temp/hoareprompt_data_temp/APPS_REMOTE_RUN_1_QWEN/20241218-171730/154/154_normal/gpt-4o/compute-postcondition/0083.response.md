The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `k`, `M`, and `t`.

- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 45.
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 45.
- `M` is an integer such that 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9.
- `t` is a list of `k` integers where each `t_j` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t_j ≤ 1000000.

After executing the function body, the function returns `max_points`, which is the maximum value achieved by updating `max_points` to be the maximum of its current value and `points + subtasks_solved`, with `subtasks_solved` being the minimum of its original value and (n - complete_tasks) * k.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept four parameters `n`, `k`, `M`, and `t`, and return `max_points` based on the given conditions.
