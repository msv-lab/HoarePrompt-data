Let's analyze the given loop and determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State:
- `m` is at least 0.
- `n` is at least 0.
- `heap` contains the tuples `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for all `0 ≤ y < n`.
- `x` is `x_end + 1`.

### Loop Code:
```python
for y in range(m):
    heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **First Iteration (y = 0):**
   - `heap` initially contains `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for all `0 ≤ y < n`.
   - After the first iteration (`y = 0`), `heap` contains `(-coverage(x, 0), x, 0)` in addition to its previous contents.

2. **Second Iteration (y = 1):**
   - `heap` now includes `(-coverage(x, 1), x, 1)` in addition to its previous contents.

3. **Third Iteration (y = 2):**
   - `heap` now includes `(-coverage(x, 2), x, 2)` in addition to its previous contents.

From the pattern observed in the first few iterations, we can generalize that after `k` iterations (where `k` ranges from 0 to `m-1`):

- The `heap` will contain the tuples `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for all `0 ≤ y < k`.

### General Case:

- After the loop completes (i.e., `y` goes from `0` to `m-1`), the `heap` will contain the tuples `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for all `0 ≤ y < m`.

### Final Output State:

- `m` is at least 0.
- `n` is at least 0.
- `heap` will contain the tuples `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for all `0 ≤ y < m`.
- `x` remains `x_end + 1` because `x` is not modified within the loop.
- `y` will be `m-1` because the loop runs `m` times, and the last iteration sets `y` to `m-1`.

### Conclusion:

Output State: **`m` is at least 0, `n` is at least 0, `heap` contains the tuples `(-coverage(x_end + 1, y), x_end + 1, y)` for all `0 ≤ y < m`, `x` is `x_end + 1`, `y` is `m-1`.**
