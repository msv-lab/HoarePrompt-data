Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Let's break down the solution to understand why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads the input values for \(N\), \(M\), \(K\), and \(L\) using `sys.stdin.read` and splits them into integers.
   
2. **Calculation of Minimum Coins (`min_x`)**:
   - The expression `(L + M - 1) // M` calculates the smallest integer \(x\) such that \(M \cdot x \geq L + 1\). This ensures that each friend gives at least \(x\) coins, and the total number of new coins is at least \(L\).

3. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition `if (M * min_x <= N - K)` checks whether the total number of new coins (\(M \cdot min_x\)) can fit within the remaining available distinct coins (\(N - K\)).
   - If the condition is true, the program prints `min_x`, indicating the minimum number of coins each friend should give.
   - If the condition is false, the program prints `-1`, indicating that it is not possible to satisfy all the terms.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases as per the problem description. For example, if \(M \cdot min_x > N - K\), it correctly prints `-1`.
   - It also ensures that the constraints \(1 \le K \le N \le 10^{18}\), \(1 \le M, L \le 10^{18}\), and \(M \cdot N \ge K + L\) are respected.

Since the program follows the logic and constraints described in the problem statement, it is correct. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
