Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle all potential cases as required by the problem description. Specifically, the code fails to consider cases where the area of the triangle cannot be achieved with integer coordinates within the given constraints.

### Analysis:

1. **Area Calculation**:
   - The area of the triangle is calculated as \(\frac{nm}{k}\).
   - The code checks if \(nm \% k == 0\) to ensure that the area is an integer. However, this condition alone is not sufficient to guarantee that the area can be achieved with integer coordinates.

2. **Function `func_3`**:
   - `func_3(a, b)` computes values `x`, `y`, and \(x * a + y * b\) using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.
   - These values are used to form the triangle's vertices. However, the function does not check if the computed values \(x\) and \(y\) can form a valid triangle with the given area.

3. **Potential Issue**:
   - The values \(x\) and \(y\) returned by `func_3` are not guaranteed to form a triangle with the desired area \(\frac{nm}{k}\) unless they satisfy additional conditions related to the geometry of the triangle.

### Example:
Consider the input \(n = 4\), \(m = 3\), \(k = 5\):
- The area of the triangle should be \(\frac{4 \times 3}{5} = \frac{12}{5} = 2.4\).
- The code will output "NO" because \(nm \% k != 0\).

However, if \(k = 10\):
- The area of the triangle should be \(\frac{4 \times 3}{10} = 1.2\).
- The code will still output "NO" because \(nm \% k != 0\), even though the area can be achieved with integer coordinates.

### Conclusion:
The code does not correctly handle cases where the area \(\frac{nm}{k}\) can be achieved with integer coordinates. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
