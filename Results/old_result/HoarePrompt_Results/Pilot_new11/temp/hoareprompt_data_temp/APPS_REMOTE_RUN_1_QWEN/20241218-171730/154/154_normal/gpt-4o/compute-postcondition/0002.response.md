Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables and Conditions**:
   - The loop variable `complete_tasks` ranges from 0 to `n` (inclusive). This means the loop will execute `n + 1` times.
   - The loop condition is `complete_tasks in range(n + 1)`.

2. **Determine the Initial States to Adjust**:
   - The initial state given includes `n`, `k`, `M`, `t`, `total_time_per_task`, and `max_points`.
   - The loop does not directly depend on `total_time_per_task` or `max_points` for its execution.
   - The loop does depend on `n` because it determines how many iterations the loop will have.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since the loop runs from `0` to `n`, `n` must be a non-negative integer.
   - Given the constraints, `n` is already within the range `[1, 45]`, so no additional adjustment is needed for `n`.

4. **Additional Considerations**:
   - The list `t` contains `k` integers, and each integer is between `1` and `1000000`.
   - The value of `k` is also constrained to be within `[1, 45]`, ensuring there are valid elements in the list `t`.

Based on this analysis, the only state that needs to be explicitly considered for the loop to execute is `n` being a non-negative integer within the given range. However, since `n` is already within the specified range, no further adjustments are necessary.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 45, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, `M` is an integer such that 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9, `t` is a list of k integers where each t_j is an integer such that 1 ≤ t_j ≤ 1000000, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in the list `t`, `max_points` is 0**.

The states for `n`, `k`, `M`, `t`, `total_time_per_task`, and `max_points` are consistent with the problem constraints, ensuring the loop can execute as intended.
