The code `''.join(new_state)` creates a string from the list `new_state`. This operation does not change the values of any variables except for creating a new string `new_state_str`.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the addition of the new string `new_state_str` created from the list `new_state`.

Output State: **`start` is a string representing the initial configuration of a 2x2 sliding puzzle, `queue` does not contain `start`, `visited` contains `start`, `directions` is `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`, `current` is the value that was at the front of `queue` before it was removed, `empty_row` is 0 if `empty_pos` is 0 or 1, 1 if `empty_pos` is 2 or 3, `empty_col` is 0 if `empty_pos` is 0 or 2, 1 if `empty_pos` is 1 or 3, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `new_row * 2 + new_col`, `new_state` is a list copy of `current` with elements at positions `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped, `new_state_str` is a string created by joining elements of `new_state`.**
