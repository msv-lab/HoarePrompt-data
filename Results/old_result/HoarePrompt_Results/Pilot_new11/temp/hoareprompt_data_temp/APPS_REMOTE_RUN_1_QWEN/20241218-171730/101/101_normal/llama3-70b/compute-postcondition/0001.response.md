The code initializes a list of lists named `pixels` by reading `n` lines of input, each line containing `m` characters ('.' or 'w'), and converts each line into a list of characters. This means the value of `n` remains the same, but the value of `m` is no longer relevant as the list comprehension reads `m` characters per line. The `pixels` list is created based on the input provided.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `pixels` is a list of n lists, each containing m characters ('.' or 'w')**
