Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `operations`, `x`, and `y`. 

- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R'.
- `x` and `y` are integers such that \(-10^9 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\).

The function processes the operations string to determine the final position `(final_x, final_y)` after performing all the specified movements ('R' for right, 'L' for left, 'U' for up, 'D' for down). It then calculates the required changes `dx` and `dy` to move from the final position to the initial position `(x, y)`.

Next, the function searches for the minimum index `i` in the operations string where the position after performing the operations up to index `i` matches the required position `(final_x + dx, final_y + dy)`. If such an index is found, it returns the minimum value of `i - position_map[target_pos]` for any target_pos found in `position_map`. If no such index is found, it returns -1.

The function returns 0 if the required position `(final_x + dx, final_y + dy)` is already the final position `(final_x, final_y)`, meaning no additional moves are needed.

Therefore, the function `func_1` determines whether a sequence of operations can bring the final position to the required position and, if possible, finds the minimum number of operations needed to achieve this, returning -1 if it's not possible.**
