The code `break` does not affect the values of the variables `i`, `j`, and `beauty`. It simply breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement we were inside, but no assignment or modification of variables occurs. Therefore, the values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged, and the value of `beauty` remains as it was determined by the condition at the time it was last checked.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is -1, if the character at index `-1` in string `s` is 'G', then `beauty` is 1. Otherwise, `beauty` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
