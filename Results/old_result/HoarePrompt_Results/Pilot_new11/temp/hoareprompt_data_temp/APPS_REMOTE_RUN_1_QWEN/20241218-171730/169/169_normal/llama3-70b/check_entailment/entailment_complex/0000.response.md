Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of operations `n` and the string `s` consisting of '-' and '+' characters. This part matches the problem description, which specifies that the first line should contain the number of operations and the second line should contain the string of operations.

2. **Counting Operations**: The program counts the number of '-' (minus_count) and '+' (plus_count) in the string `s`. This step is necessary to determine how many stones were taken and added during the operations.

3. **Calculating the Result**: 
   - If the number of '-' (hyphens) is greater than the number of '+' (plus signs), the program prints `0`. This is because the pile would be empty or have a negative number of stones if more stones were taken out than added, and the minimum number of stones in such a scenario is `0`.
   - Otherwise, the program prints the difference between the number of '+' and '-' (i.e., `plus_count - minus_count`). This represents the minimal possible number of stones left in the pile after all operations.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases properly:
   - When `n` is `1`, it correctly prints `0` if the character is '-', or `1` if the character is '+'.
   - The program ensures that `n` is within the specified range (1 to 100) as per the problem constraints.

5. **Output Format**: The output is a single integer representing the minimal possible number of stones left in the pile, which matches the problem requirements.

Given the above points, the program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description for all valid inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.
