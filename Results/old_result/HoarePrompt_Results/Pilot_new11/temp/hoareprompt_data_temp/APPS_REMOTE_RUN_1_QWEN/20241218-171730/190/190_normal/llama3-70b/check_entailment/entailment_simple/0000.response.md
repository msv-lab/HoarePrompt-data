Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided annotated program correctly implements the solution described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of how it adheres to the requirements:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of sticks \( n \) and the lengths of the sticks \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \).
   - It sorts the list of stick lengths to facilitate the calculation of the median, which is used as the initial guess for \( t \).

2. **Initial Cost Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the median of the sorted list of stick lengths and uses it as the initial value for \( t \).
   - It computes the initial cost of making all sticks almost good for this initial \( t \).

3. **Finding Minimum Cost:**
   - The program iterates over possible values of \( t \) in both directions from the initial median (\( t = \text{mid} \)).
   - For each possible \( t \), it calculates the cost of making all sticks almost good for that \( t \) by taking the minimum cost between adjusting to \( t \) or \( t+1 \) for each stick.
   - It keeps track of the minimum cost and the corresponding \( t \) value.

4. **Output:**
   - Finally, the program prints the optimal \( t \) and the minimum cost.

The program ensures that it explores all possible values of \( t \) within the range [1, 100] to find the one that results in the minimum cost. It correctly handles the constraints and requirements specified in the problem statement.

Since the program correctly follows the logic described in the problem statement and produces the expected output for all valid inputs, the program is correct.
