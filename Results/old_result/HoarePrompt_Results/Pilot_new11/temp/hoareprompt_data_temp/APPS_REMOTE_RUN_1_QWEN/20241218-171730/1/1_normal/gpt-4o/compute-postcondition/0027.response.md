Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters `[`, `]`, `:`, and `|`.
   - `n` is the length of `s`.
   - `ind` can be any integer value (or -1 if there is no `[`).
   - `bind` is `n - 2`.
   - `i` is `n - 2`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs from `i = n - 2` down to `i = 0` with a step of `-1`.

3. **Key Variables**:
   - `i`: This is the current index being checked in the string `s`.
   - `bind`: This is fixed at `n - 2`.

4. **Condition for Continuing the Loop**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0.

5. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` was `n - 2` (at the start of the previous iteration).

6. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be decremented to `n - 3` (since the loop decreases `i` by 1 each iteration).
   - The condition `i >= 0` must still hold true, which it does because `n - 3` is still a valid index in the string `s`.

7. **Other Variables**:
   - `s`: No changes to `s` are mentioned.
   - `n`: No changes to `n` are mentioned.
   - `ind`: No changes to `ind` are mentioned.
   - `bind`: Remains `n - 2`.

8. **Conclusion**:
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `i` to `n - 3`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters `[`, `]`, `:`, and `|`, `n` is the length of `s`, `ind` can be any integer value (or -1 if there is no `[`), `bind` is `n - 2`, `i` is `n - 3**.
