According to the code, the loop iterates over each tuple `(x, y)` in `white_pixels`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one tuple remaining in `white_pixels`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:
- `n` is the first integer input.
- `pixels` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` characters ('.' or 'w').
- `white_pixels` is a list of tuples representing the coordinates `(i, j)` of all 'w' characters in the `pixels` grid and must contain at least one tuple.
- `min_x` is the minimum of `float('inf')` and the `x` value from the tuple in `white_pixels`.
- `min_y` is the minimum of `float('inf')` and the `y` value from the tuple in `white_pixels`.
- `max_x` is the maximum `x` value from the tuples in `white_pixels`.
- `max_y` is the maximum `y` value from the tuples in `white_pixels`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `white_pixels` must still contain at least one tuple. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `white_pixels` still contains at least one tuple.

State: **`n` is the first integer input, `pixels` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` characters ('.' or 'w'), `white_pixels` is a list of tuples representing the coordinates `(i, j)` of all 'w' characters in the `pixels` grid and must contain at least one tuple, `min_x` is the minimum of `float('inf')` and the `x` value from the tuple in `white_pixels`, `min_y` is the minimum of `float('inf')` and the `y` value from the tuple in `white_pixels`, `max_x` is the maximum `x` value from the tuples in `white_pixels`, `max_y` is the maximum `y` value from the tuples in `white_pixels`, `white_pixels` must contain at least one tuple**
