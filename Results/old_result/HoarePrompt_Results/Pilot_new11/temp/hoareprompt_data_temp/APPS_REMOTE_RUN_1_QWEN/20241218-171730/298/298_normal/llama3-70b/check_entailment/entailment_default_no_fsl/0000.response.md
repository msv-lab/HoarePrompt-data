Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the function `func_3` is used to find integers \(x_1, y_1\) such that \(x_1 \cdot m + y_1 \cdot n = \text{gcd}(n, m)\), but this does not necessarily ensure that the area of the triangle formed by the points will be exactly \(\frac{nm}{k}\).

Let's analyze the logic step-by-step:

1. **Check if \(nm\) is divisible by \(k\)**:
   ```python
   if n * m % k:
       print('NO')
       exit()
   ```
   This part is correct and ensures that the area of the triangle can be an integer.

2. **Find \(x_1\) and \(y_1\) using `func_3`**:
   ```python
   (n1, m1, g) = func_3(n, m)
   ```
   Here, `func_3` finds integers \(x_1\) and \(y_1\) such that \(x_1 \cdot m + y_1 \cdot n = \text{gcd}(n, m)\). However, this does not directly solve the problem of finding points whose area is exactly \(\frac{nm}{k}\).

3. **Check if the product condition is satisfied**:
   ```python
   if abs(n1 * m) >= g:
       print('YES')
       print(0, 0)
       print(0, n1 * m // g)
       print(m1 * m // g, 0)
   else:
       print('NO')
   ```
   The condition `abs(n1 * m) >= g` is not sufficient to guarantee that the area of the triangle is exactly \(\frac{nm}{k}\). For example, if \(n = 4\), \(m = 3\), and \(k = 3\), the correct points should be \((1, 0)\), \((2, 3)\), and \((4, 1)\), but the code will not produce these points because the condition `abs(n1 * m) >= g` is not strictly checked for the area requirement.

To ensure the area of the triangle is exactly \(\frac{nm}{k}\), the points should be chosen such that the area calculation matches the requirement. The current implementation does not guarantee this.

Therefore, the code is incorrect for the given problem description.
