Postcondition: ***`i` is `N`; `x1` is `meats[N-1][0]`; `y1` is `meats[N-1][1]`; `c1` is `meats[N-1][2]`; `y2` is `meats[j][1]`; `c2` is `meats[j][2]`; `count` is the sum of `c` for each entry `(x, y, c)` in `meats` such that the distance between `(x, y)` and `(mx, my)` is less than or equal to `T`; `d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T`; `dx` is \((x1 - x2) / 2\); `dy` is \((y1 - y2) / 2\); `d2` is \(\left(\frac{x1 - x2}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y1 - y2}{2}\right)^2\); `cx` is \((y1 + y2) / 2\); if `c1 * T < c2 * T`, then `y2` is updated to `meats[j][1]`; `c2` is updated to `meats[j][2]`; `dx` is updated to \((x1 - x2) / 2\); `dy` is updated to \((y1 - y2) / 2\); `d2` is updated to \(\left(\frac{x1 - x2}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y1 - y2}{2}\right)^2\); `cx` is updated to \((y1 + y2) / 2\); `my` is updated to be greater than \((y1 + y2) / 2 - (x1 - x2) / 2 * math.sqrt(d2)\). Otherwise, `y2`, `c2`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `cx`, and `my` remain unchanged.***

This postcondition summarizes both the if and else parts of the if-else block, considering the condition `d < 0` in the if part and the absence of changes in the else part.
