`final_x` is decreased by 1. Since `final_x` can initially be -2, -1, 0, or 1, subtracting 1 from each possible value gives us -3, -2, -1, or 0. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `final_x` is either -3, -2, -1, or 0; `final_y` is -1 if the next operation is 'D' or 0 otherwise; `operations` is a non-empty string with at least two characters remaining; `x` and `y` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5.
