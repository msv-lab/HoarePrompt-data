The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop context provided in the initial state, the execution of `continue` does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `white_pixels` must contain at least one tuple, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1**
