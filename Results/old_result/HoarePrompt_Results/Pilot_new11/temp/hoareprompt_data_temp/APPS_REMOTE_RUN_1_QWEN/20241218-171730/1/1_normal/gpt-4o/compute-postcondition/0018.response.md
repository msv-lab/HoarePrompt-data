Let's break down the given for loop and determine the necessary states to ensure the loop can execute:

The for loop statement is:
```python
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

This means the loop will iterate over the indices of the string `s` in reverse order, starting from `n-1` (the last index of the string) down to `0` (the first index), and stopping at `-1`.

To execute this loop, the following conditions must be met:
1. The variable `n` must be defined and represent the length of the string `s`.
2. The variable `ind` must either be defined or it doesn't matter since the loop starts from `n-1` and will stop at `-1`.
3. The variable `bind` must either be defined or it doesn't matter since the loop starts from `n-1` and will stop at `-1`.

Since the loop is iterating in reverse, it will start from the last index of the string `s` and go until it reaches the beginning. Therefore, we don't need to adjust the value of `s` itself, as long as `n` is correct.

Given these considerations, we need to ensure the following states:
- `n` is the length of the string `s`.
- `ind` can be any value (it's not used in the loop), or it can be undefined.
- `bind` can be any value (it's not used in the loop), or it can be undefined.

Thus, the required states are:
- `s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters `[`, `]`, `:`, and `|`.
- `n` is the length of `s`.
- `ind` can be any integer value (or -1 if there is no `[`).
- `bind` can be any integer value (or -1).

State: **`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters `[`, `]`, `:`, and `|`, `n` is the length of `s`, `ind` can be any integer value (or -1 if there is no `[`), `bind` can be any integer value (or -1)**
