Postcondition: ***`sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[0]`, `y1_j` is the second element of `sofas[0]`, `x2_j` is the third element of `sofas[0]`, and `y2_j` is the fourth element of `sofas[0]`. If `x1 < x1_j` and `x2 < x1_j`, then `right_count[0]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the values remain unchanged.***
