Functionality: **The function processes a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' (golden) and 'S' (silver). It calculates two values: `max_beauty`, which is the length of the longest consecutive sequence of 'G's in the string, and `max_beauty_one_swap`, which is the maximum beauty (length of consecutive 'G's) achievable by swapping exactly one 'S' to 'G'. The function then prints the maximum of these two values. The function handles edge cases where there are no 'G's in the string.**

**Specifically, the function performs the following actions:**
1. Reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S'.
2. Enumerates the positions of all 'G's in the string and stores them in the list `golden`.
3. Initializes `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty` to 0 and iterates through the string to find the longest sequence of consecutive 'G's, updating `max_beauty` accordingly.
4. Initializes `max_beauty_one_swap` to 0 and iterates through the string to find the maximum beauty achievable by swapping one 'S' to 'G'. This involves checking each pair of adjacent characters 'G' and 'S' and calculating the extended beauty by extending the sequences of 'G's on both sides.
5. Prints the maximum value between `max_beauty` and `max_beauty_one_swap`.

**Potential edge cases:**
- If there are no 'G's in the string, both `max_beauty` and `max_beauty_one_swap` will be 0, and the function will print 0.
- The function correctly handles strings with only 'S' characters or a mix of 'G' and 'S' characters.

**Missing functionality:**
- The function does not explicitly handle cases where the string `s` contains other characters besides 'G' and 'S'. While the code currently works for valid inputs, it should ideally raise an error or handle such cases more gracefully.
