The code `current_node = 2 * current_node + 1` updates the value of `current_node`. Given the initial state where `current_node` is either 1 or 2 depending on the first element of `path`, we can calculate the new value of `current_node` as follows:

- If `current_node` is 1, then `current_node = 2 * 1 + 1 = 3`.
- If `current_node` is 2, then `current_node = 2 * 2 + 1 = 5`.

Therefore, the value of `current_node` changes based on its initial value. All other variables remain in their initial states.

Output State: **`total_leaves` is 2, `visited_count` is 2, `path` is a non-empty list with one fewer element, `current_level` is 0, `current_node` is 3 or 5 depending on the initial value (1 or 2)**
