Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the initial states:**
   - `i` is a valid starting index such that `i + 1` is within bounds of `s`.
   - `s` is a non-empty string.
   - `n` is greater than `i + 1`.
   - `max_len` is the maximum of its current value and the length of `substr` (where `substr` is the substring of `s` from index `i` to index `j_prev - 1` and is not equal to its reverse).
   - `j` is `j_prev + 1`.
   - `substr` is the substring of `s` from index `i` to index `j_prev - 1`.
   - `max_len` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the length of `substr`.

2. **Understand the loop condition:**
   - The loop runs for `j` in the range from `i + 1` to `n + 1`.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration:**
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than or equal to `n`.
   - Since `j` is set to `j_prev + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `j` would be `j_prev + 2`.
   - Therefore, the loop continues if `j_prev + 2` is still within the range `i + 1` to `n + 1`.

4. **Adjust the states:**
   - `i` remains the same as it was not changed in the loop.
   - `s` remains the same as it was not changed in the loop.
   - `n` remains the same as it was not changed in the loop.
   - `max_len` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the length of `substr` up to `j_prev - 1`.
   - `j` is updated to `j_prev + 2`.
   - `substr` is the substring of `s` from index `i` to index `j - 1`.

Given these steps, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `i` remains unchanged.
- `s` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `max_len` remains the same.
- `j` is now `j_prev + 2`.
- `substr` is the substring of `s` from index `i` to index `j - 1`.

So, the final state is:

State: **`i` is a valid starting index such that `i + 1` is within bounds of `s`; `s` is a non-empty string; `n` is greater than `i + 1`; `max_len` is the maximum of its current value and the length of `substr` (where `substr` is the substring of `s` from index `i` to index `j - 1` and is not equal to its reverse); `j` is `j_prev + 2`; `substr` is the substring of `s` from index `i` to index `j - 1`.**
