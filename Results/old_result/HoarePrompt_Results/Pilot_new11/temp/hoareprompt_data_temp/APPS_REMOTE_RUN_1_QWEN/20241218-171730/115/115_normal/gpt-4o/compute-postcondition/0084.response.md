Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, `A` is a 2D list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, `operations` is a list of tuples representing the positions (i+1, j+1) of the top-left corners of the 2x2 submatrices in `A` that satisfied the condition and were flipped in `B`, `B` is a 2D list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, and for every `i` and `j` in the range `[0, n)` and `[0, m)`, `A[i][j]` is equal to `B[i][j]`.**
