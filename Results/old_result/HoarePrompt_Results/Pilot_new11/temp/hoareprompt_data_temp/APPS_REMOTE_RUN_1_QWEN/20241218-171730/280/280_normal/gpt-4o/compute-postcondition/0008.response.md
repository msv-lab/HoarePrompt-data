In the given code, `speeds[i]` is assigned the value of `min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)`. Given the initial state, let's break down the calculation:

1. `speeds[0]` is `v1`.
2. `speeds[1]` is `min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 2) * d)`.
3. `speeds[t-1]` is `v2`.
4. The rest of the elements in `speeds` are zeros.

For `i = 2`, the code updates `speeds[2]`:
- `speeds[1]` is `min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 2) * d)`.
- `speeds[2]` is updated to `min(speeds[1] + d, v2 + (t - 2) * d)`.

Let's denote `speeds[1]` as `val1` for simplicity:
- `val1 = min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 2) * d)`.

Then,
- `speeds[2] = min(val1 + d, v2 + (t - 3) * d)`.

Since the exact values of `v1`, `v2`, `t`, and `d` are not specified, we keep them as they are. However, we know the structure of `speeds` and the updated value for `speeds[2]`.

Output State: **`v1` is an integer within the range [1, 100], `v2` is an integer within the range [1, 100], `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100, `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10, `speeds[0]` is `v1`, `speeds[1]` is `min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 2) * d)`, `speeds[2]` is `min(min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 2) * d) + d, v2 + (t - 3) * d)`, `speeds[t-1]` is `v2`, and the rest are zeros, `i` is 2.**
