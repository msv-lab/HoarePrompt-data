`k` is incremented by 1. The value of `n`, `prefix_sum[r + 1]`, and `prefix_sum[n]` remains unchanged. The value of `l` is dependent on `r`, which is not directly affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 0, `prefix_sum[r + 1]` is not equal to 0, `prefix_sum[r + 1]` is not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, `k` is the previous value + 1, and `l` will be updated based on the new value of `r`; `k` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `prefix_sum[r + 1]` is not equal to 0, `prefix_sum[r + 1]` is not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, `k` is the previous value + 1 and equals to `k + 1`, and `l` will be updated based on the new value of `r`.**
