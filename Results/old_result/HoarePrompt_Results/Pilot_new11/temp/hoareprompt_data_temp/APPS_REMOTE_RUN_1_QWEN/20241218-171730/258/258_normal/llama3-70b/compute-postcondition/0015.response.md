According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. The loop iterates over the range from -1000 to 1000 inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is -1000, and `y` is an integer within the range \([-1000, 1000]\). 

Since the loop is iterating over `x` and the range goes from -1000 to 1000, the next value of `x` should be -999. 

The value of `y` remains an integer within the range \([-1000, 1000]\), but since we don't have specific information about `y` changing or staying the same, we assume it will stay within its range. However, for the loop to continue, `y` must still be valid within the specified range.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `x` will be -999, and `y` will remain an integer within the range \([-1000, 1000]\).

State: **`ans` is the minimum value among the K-th largest elements of the list `times` obtained from calling `func_2(x, y, x, y)` for each `y` in the range from -1000 to 1000, `x` is -999, `y` is an integer within the range \([-1000, 1000]\), and `times` is a list of sorted values returned by `func_2(x, y, x, y)` for each `y`.**
