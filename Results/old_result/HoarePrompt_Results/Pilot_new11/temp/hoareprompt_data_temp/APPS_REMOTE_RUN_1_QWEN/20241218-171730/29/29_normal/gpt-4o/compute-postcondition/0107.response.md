`temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Since `temp_counter` was initially \((\text{previous } temp_counter) + 2\) and still less than or equal to \(2 \times n\), after incrementing by 1, its new value is \((\text{previous } temp_counter) + 3\) and still less than or equal to \(2 \times n\). The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`regulars` has at least one element, `i` is \((\text{initial } i) + 2\), `target` is \(\text{len(examples)} + (\text{initial } i) + 3\), `temp_counter` is \((\text{previous } temp_counter) + 3\) and still less than or equal to \(2 \times n\), and `str(temp_counter + 1)` must be in `files_set`.**
