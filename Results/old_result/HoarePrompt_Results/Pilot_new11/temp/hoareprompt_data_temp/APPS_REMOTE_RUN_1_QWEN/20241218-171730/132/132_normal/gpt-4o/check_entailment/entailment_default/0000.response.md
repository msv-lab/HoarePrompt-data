Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where stones may be added to the piles during the night. The program only checks if the total number of stones in the second configuration (`y`) is less than or equal to the total number of stones in the first configuration (`x`). However, the problem description states that jury members can either take one stone or move one stone from one pile to another. This means that the total number of stones in the garden can increase, decrease, or remain the same.

To illustrate, consider the following example:

- Input:
  ```
  3
  2 3 9
  1 7 9
  ```

- According to the problem description, the jury could have added a stone to the second pile and moved stones around. However, the program would incorrectly print "Yes" because the total number of stones in both configurations is the same (14).

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the described behavior and is incorrect for the given problem.
