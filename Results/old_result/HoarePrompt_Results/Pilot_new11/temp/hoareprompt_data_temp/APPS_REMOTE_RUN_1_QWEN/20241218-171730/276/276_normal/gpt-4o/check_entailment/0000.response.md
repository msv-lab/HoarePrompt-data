Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the golden system comparison. The issue lies in the `func_1` function, which only calculates the approximate decimal value of the given golden number but does not handle the full comparison logic required. Specifically, the function only sums the contributions of '1's in the string, ignoring the positions of the '0's, which are necessary for a correct comparison.

For example, consider the inputs:
- `s1 = "101"` (which should be evaluated as \(q^2 + q \approx 4.236\))
- `s2 = "11"` (which should be evaluated as \(q + q \approx 3.236\))

The current implementation would incorrectly evaluate both as equal since it only sums the contributions of '1's without considering their positions. A correct implementation would need to evaluate the full sum \(\sum_{i=0}^{n} a_i \cdot q^{n-i}\) for both strings and compare these values accurately.
