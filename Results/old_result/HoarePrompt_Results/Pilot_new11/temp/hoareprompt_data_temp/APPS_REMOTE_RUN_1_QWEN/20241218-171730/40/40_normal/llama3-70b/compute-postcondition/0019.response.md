Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop control variable**: The loop control variable in this case is `j`, which starts from `i + 1` and goes up to `n`.

2. **Determine the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

3. **Identify necessary initial states**:
   - `i` is given as `i + 1`, so we need to ensure `i` is initialized appropriately.
   - `s` is a non-empty string, which means it already satisfies this condition.
   - `n` must be greater than 0, ensuring the loop has a valid upper bound.
   - `max_len` is defined as the maximum length of any non-palindromic substring found in `s` from index `i + 1` to any valid end index `j` where `i + 2 <= j <= n`. This means that the substring `s[i+1:j]` should not be a palindrome for `max_len` to be meaningful.

4. **Ensure the loop can start**: For the loop to start, `i + 1` must be a valid index in the string `s`, meaning `i` must be at least 0 and less than the length of `s` minus 1 (since `i + 1` is the starting point).

Given these points, we need to ensure that:
- `i` is a valid starting index such that `i + 1` is a valid index in `s`.
- `n` is greater than `i + 1` to ensure there are indices `j` to iterate over.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are:

State: **`i` is a valid starting index such that `i + 1` is within bounds of `s`, `s` is a non-empty string, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, and `max_len` is the maximum length of any non-palindromic substring found in `s` from index `i + 1` to any valid end index `j` where `i + 2 <= j <= n`**.
