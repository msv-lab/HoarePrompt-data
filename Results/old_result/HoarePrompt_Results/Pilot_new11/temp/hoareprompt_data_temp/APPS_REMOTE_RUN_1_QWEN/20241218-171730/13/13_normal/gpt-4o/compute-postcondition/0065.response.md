Postcondition: ***`prev_start` is the first element of the tuple at index `i - 1` in `segments`; `prev_end` is the second element of the tuple at index `i - 1` in `segments`; `curr_start` is the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `segments`; `curr_end` is the second element of the tuple at index `i` in `segments`. If `curr_start - prev_end == 2`, then `max_length` is the maximum of its current value and `curr_end - curr_start + prev_end - prev_start + 3`. Otherwise, the value of `max_length` remains unchanged.***
