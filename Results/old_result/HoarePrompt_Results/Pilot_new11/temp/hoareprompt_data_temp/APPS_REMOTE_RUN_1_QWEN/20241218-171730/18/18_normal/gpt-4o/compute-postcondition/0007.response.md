The code prints the value of `n + k - t`. Since printing does not assign a value back to a variable, the values of `n`, `k`, and `t` remain unchanged after executing the print statement. Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `t` is an integer such that t > n, and the value of `n + k - t` is printed.**
