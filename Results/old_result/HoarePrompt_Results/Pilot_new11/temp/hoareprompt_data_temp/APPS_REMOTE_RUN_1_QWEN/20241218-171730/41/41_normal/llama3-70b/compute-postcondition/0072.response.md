Postcondition: ***`unrated`, `rated`, and `maybe` remain `False`. `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` remain unchanged as lists containing `n` input integers each. `i` is `n-1`. `n` must be a positive integer. The current value of `(not unrated)` is `True`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or conditional statement.***
