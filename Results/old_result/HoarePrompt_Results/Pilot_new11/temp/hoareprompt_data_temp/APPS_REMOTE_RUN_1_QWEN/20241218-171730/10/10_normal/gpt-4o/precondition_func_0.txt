d, n, m, x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2, cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b are integers such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ x_1, x_2 ≤ n, 1 ≤ y_1, y_2 ≤ m, and 0 ≤ cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b ≤ d - 1. Additionally, it is guaranteed that cells (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) have a common side, (x_1, y_1) ≠ (x_2, y_2), and no cell is covered by more than one sofa.
