Output State: **`pixels` is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a row of the pixel matrix, and each element in the inner list is either `'w'` or `'.'`. For each `(i, j)` in `pixels`, if `i == min_x` or `i == max_x` or `j == min_y` or `j == max_y`, then `pixels[i][j]` is `'w'`; otherwise, `pixels[i][j]` is `'.'`. The loop will execute at least as many times as the number of rows in `pixels`.**
