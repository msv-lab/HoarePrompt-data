Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down the program and verify each part against the problem description:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   ```python
   n, k, t = map(int, input().split())
   ```
   This line reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `k`, and `t`. The constraints `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`, `1 ≤ k ≤ n`, and `1 ≤ t < n + k` ensure that the inputs are within the expected range.

2. **Logic to Determine Standing Spectators:**
   ```python
   print(min(t, k) if t <= n else k - (t - n) % k)
   ```

   - **Case 1: \( t \leq n \)**
     - When `t` is less than or equal to `n`, the first `t` spectators stand up to time `t`.
     - The number of standing spectators is simply `t`.

   - **Case 2: \( t > n \)**
     - When `t` exceeds `n`, the pattern of standing spectators repeats every `k` units of time.
     - The position of the last standing spectator can be determined using the modulo operation: `(t - n) % k`.
     - Since the cycle starts repeating after `n`, the number of standing spectators is `k` minus the position within the cycle, which is `(t - n) % k`.

### Example Walkthrough:

- **Example 1: Input `10 5 3`**
  - `t = 3`, which is less than or equal to `n = 10`.
  - The number of standing spectators is `min(3, 5) = 3`.
  - Output: `3`

- **Example 2: Input `10 5 7`**
  - `t = 7`, which is greater than `n = 10`.
  - The number of standing spectators is `k - (7 - 10) % 5 = 5 - 3 = 2`.
  - However, since `7 - 10 = -3`, we should consider `7 - 10 + 10 = 7` and `7 % 5 = 2`, so the number of standing spectators is `5 - 2 = 3`.
  - Output: `5`

- **Example 3: Input `10 5 12`**
  - `t = 12`, which is greater than `n = 10`.
  - The number of standing spectators is `k - (12 - 10) % 5 = 5 - 2 = 3`.
  - Output: `3`

The program correctly handles both cases where `t` is within the initial range (`t <= n`) and where `t` exceeds `n` by using the modulo operation to determine the position within the repeating cycle. Therefore, the program always follows the problem description accurately.
