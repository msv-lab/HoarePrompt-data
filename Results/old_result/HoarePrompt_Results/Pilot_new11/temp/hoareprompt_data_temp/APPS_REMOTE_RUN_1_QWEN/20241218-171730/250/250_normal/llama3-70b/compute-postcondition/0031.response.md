`need_x` is reassigned the value `True`, which means its previous value was `True` and remains unchanged. The states of the other variables (`marks`, `i`, `j`, `need_y`, and `n`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`marks` is a list of integers, `i` is the same index as before, `j` is `i + 2`, `need_x` is `True`, `need_y` is `True`, and `n` must be greater than `i + 2`**
