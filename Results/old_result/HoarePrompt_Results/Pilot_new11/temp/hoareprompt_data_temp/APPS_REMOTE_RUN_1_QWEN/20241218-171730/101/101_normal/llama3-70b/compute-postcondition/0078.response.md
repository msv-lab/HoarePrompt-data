The code `pixels[i][j] = '+'` assigns the value `'+'` to the element at index `[i][j]` in the `pixels` list. Given the initial state:

- `n` is greater than 1
- `white_pixels` contains at least one tuple
- `m` is greater than or equal to 1
- `i` is less than `n`
- `j` is 1

The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the value of `j` also remains unchanged, but `pixels[i][j]` is now assigned the value `'+'`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `white_pixels` contains at least one tuple, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is 1, `pixels[i][1]` is '+'**
