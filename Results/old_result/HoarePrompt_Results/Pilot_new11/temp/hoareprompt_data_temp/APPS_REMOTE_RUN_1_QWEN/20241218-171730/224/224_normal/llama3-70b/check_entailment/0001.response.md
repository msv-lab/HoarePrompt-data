Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Specifically, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` are used to compute the maximum value of \( f(p) \) for a given \( n \), but the logic in `func_2` does not accurately determine \( f_{max}(n) \).

The function `func_2` is attempting to find the maximum GCD value across all prefixes of the permutation, but it does not consider all possible permutations or correctly compute the maximum \( f(p) \). For example, for \( n = 6 \), the correct \( f_{max}(6) \) should be 4, but the function `func_2` will not necessarily yield this result due to its flawed approach.

Additionally, the function `func_3` is intended to count the number of permutations with the maximum \( f(p) \), but it relies on an incorrect value of \( f_{max}(n) \) from `func_2`, making the entire solution incorrect.

To properly solve the problem, one would need to construct permutations that achieve the maximum \( f(p) \) and count them, which requires a different approach than the current implementation.
