The code increments `temp_counter` by 1. According to the initial state, `temp_counter` was previously equal to \((\text{previous } temp_counter) + 3\) and is still less than or equal to \(2 \times n\). After incrementing, `temp_counter` will now be \((\text{previous } temp_counter) + 4\). The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`regulars` has at least one element, `i` is \((\text{initial } i) + 2\), `target` is \(\text{len(examples)} + (\text{initial } i) + 3\), `temp_counter` is \((\text{previous } temp_counter) + 4\) and still less than or equal to \(2 \times n\), and `str(temp_counter + 1)` must be in `files_set`.**
