The code reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial value of `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 500. After executing the code, the value of `n` will be updated to the integer input, but the initial condition that 1 <= n <= 500 still holds. The variable `s` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and 1 <= n <= 500, `n` is an integer input**
