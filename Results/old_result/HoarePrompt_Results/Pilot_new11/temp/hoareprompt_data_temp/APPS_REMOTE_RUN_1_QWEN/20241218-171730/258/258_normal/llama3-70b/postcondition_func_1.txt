The function `func_2` accepts four parameters: `x` and `y` (lists of integers representing the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the meat pieces), `c` (a list of integers representing the hardness of each piece of meat), and `X` and `Y` (real numbers representing the coordinates of the heat source). The function calculates a new list of integers, where each integer is the product of the corresponding element in the `c` list and the result of the function `func_1` evaluated at the coordinates `(x[i], y[i], X, Y)` for each pair of elements `(x[i], y[i], c[i])`. The function returns this list of integers.
