The code snippet `ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))` appends a tuple \((i + 1, j + 1)\) to the list `ops`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, so `i + 1` is 3. The value of `j` is not specified directly, but since the tuple \((3, 4)\) was added to `ops` only if certain conditions involving \(A[2][4]\), \(A[3][4]\), \(A[2][5]\), and \(A[3][5]\) were met, and these conditions are satisfied, `j` must be 3.

Therefore, the tuple \((3, 4)\) is appended to `ops`. The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a non-negative integer with at least 3, `m` is an integer such that \(m > 5\), `A` is a matrix of size \(n \times m\) where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` contains all the tuples \((i + 1, j + 1)\) for which any of the conditions \(A[i][j] == 1\), \(A[i + 1][j] == 1\), \(A[i][j + 1] == 1\), or \(A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1\) are satisfied, and the new tuple \((3, 4)\), and `j` is 3.**
