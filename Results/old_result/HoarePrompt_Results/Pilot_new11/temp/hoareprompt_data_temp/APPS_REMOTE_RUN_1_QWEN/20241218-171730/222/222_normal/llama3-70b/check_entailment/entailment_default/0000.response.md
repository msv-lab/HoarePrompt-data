Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the solution for the problem. Specifically, the formula used to calculate the number of actions (`l = (n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)`) and the way the results are generated do not align with the problem description. 

To properly solve the problem, Miroslav needs to turn over all \(n\) skewers using the minimum number of actions. The code fails to consider the actual effect of turning skewers and the dependencies between actions. For instance, turning skewer \(i\) affects skewers within a range of \(k\) from each side. The current implementation does not take into account these dependencies and simply generates a sequence of skewers to be turned without ensuring all skewers are turned over.

A correct solution would involve a more complex algorithm to ensure that all skewers are turned over with the minimum number of actions, taking into account the range of skewers affected by each action. The current implementation does not meet this requirement, hence the correctness is **False**.
