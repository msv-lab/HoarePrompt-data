Postcondition: ***`start` is a string representing the initial configuration of a 2x2 sliding puzzle, `queue` does not contain `start`, `visited` contains `start`, `directions` is `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`, `current` is the value that was at the front of `queue` before it was removed, `empty_row` is 0 if `empty_pos` is 0 or 1, 1 if `empty_pos` is 2 or 3, `empty_col` is 0 if `empty_pos` is 0 or 2, 1 if `empty_pos` is 1 or 3, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`. The new position (`new_row`, `new_col`) is within the bounds of the 2x2 grid (0 <= new_row < 2 and 0 <= new_col < 2).***
