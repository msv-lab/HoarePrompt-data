Postcondition: ***`i` is a valid starting index such that `i + 2` is within bounds of `s`, `s` is a non-empty string, `n` is greater than `i + 2`, and `i + 2` must be less than or equal to `n + 1`; `max_len` is the maximum length of any non-palindromic substring found in `s` from index `i` to any valid end index `j` where `i + 3 <= j <= n`, and it is updated to be the maximum of its original value and the length of the substring from index `i` to `j-1` where `substr` is the substring of `s` from index `i` to index `j-1` and `j` is `i + 2`. If the substring is not a palindrome, `max_len` is updated accordingly.***
