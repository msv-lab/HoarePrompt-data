`res` is incremented by 2. The value of `i` is updated to `i_prev + 2` since it is `i_prev + 1` at the end of the previous iteration and the condition `i_prev + 1 < int(n)` must hold true. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is `i_prev + 2`, `res` is `res + 2`, `i_prev + 1 < int(n)` must hold true**
