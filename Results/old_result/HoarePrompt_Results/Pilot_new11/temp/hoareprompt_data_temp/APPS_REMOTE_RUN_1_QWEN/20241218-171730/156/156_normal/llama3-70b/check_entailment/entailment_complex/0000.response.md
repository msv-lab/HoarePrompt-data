Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads three integers \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \) from the input. It assumes these inputs are valid and within the specified ranges.

2. **Reduction of \( k \)**:
   - The program reduces \( k \) using the modulo operation with \( n \cdot 2 - 2 \). This step ensures that \( k \) is brought within a manageable range, specifically to handle the snake-like pattern of movement.

3. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case 1**: If \( k < n - 1 \):
     - This corresponds to the initial vertical movement from the top-left corner to the bottom-left corner.
     - The program directly outputs the position \( (k + 1, 1) \).
   - **Case 2**: If \( k \geq n - 1 \) and \( k < n \cdot 2 - 2 \):
     - This corresponds to the snake-like movement from the bottom-left to the bottom-right, and then upwards.
     - The program calculates the row and column indices based on the reduced \( k \):
       - Row index: \( 2n - k - 2 \)
       - Column index: \( \left(\frac{k - n + 1}{n - 1}\right) + 1 \)
     - The output is then printed.
   - **Case 3**: If \( k \geq n \cdot 2 - 2 \):
     - This corresponds to the final position at \( (1, 2) \).
     - The program directly outputs \( (1, 2) \).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles all edge cases as described:
     - When \( k < n - 1 \), the output is \( (k + 1, 1) \).
     - When \( k \geq n - 1 \) and \( k < n \cdot 2 - 2 \), the output is derived from the calculated row and column indices.
     - When \( k \geq n \cdot 2 - 2 \), the output is \( (1, 2) \).

5. **General Validity**:
   - The program follows the exact logic outlined in the problem statement and handles all possible values of \( k \) correctly.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description in all cases.
