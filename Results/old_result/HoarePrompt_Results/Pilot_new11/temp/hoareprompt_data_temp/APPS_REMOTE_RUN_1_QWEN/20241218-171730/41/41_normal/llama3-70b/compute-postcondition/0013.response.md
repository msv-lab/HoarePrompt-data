The code `ratings_before.append(a)` appends the value of `a` (which is an input integer) to the list `ratings_before`. The original list `ratings_before` was `['a', a]`. After appending `a`, the list `ratings_before` becomes `['a', a, a]`.

The states of the other variables (`ratings_after`, `b`, `n`) are not affected.

Output State: **`ratings_before` is `['a', a, a]', `ratings_after` is [b], `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `n` must be greater than 0**
