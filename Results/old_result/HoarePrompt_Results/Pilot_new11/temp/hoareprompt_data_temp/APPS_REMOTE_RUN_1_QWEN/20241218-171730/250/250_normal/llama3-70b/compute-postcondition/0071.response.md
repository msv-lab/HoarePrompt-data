`additional_marks` appends the value of `i + j` to its list. Since `i + j` is not already in the `additional_marks` list and is less than or equal to `l`, it gets added. The values of `i`, `j`, and `l` remain unchanged, and the `marks` list is unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `additional_marks` is a non-empty list with an additional element `i + j`, `i` and `j` are integers, the sum of `i` and `j` is less than or equal to `l`, and the sum of `i` and `j` is not in the `marks` list.

Output State: **`additional_marks` is a non-empty list with an additional element `i + j`, `i` and `j` are integers, the sum of `i` and `j` is less than or equal to `l`, and the sum of `i` and `j` is not in the `marks` list.**
