To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the information given:

1. **Initial Conditions at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `digit_sum` is the sum of the digits of `i + 1`
   - `i` is `i + 1`
   - `max_sum` remains unchanged
   - `max_num` remains unchanged
   - If `digit_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `digit_sum` and `max_num` is updated to `i + 1`

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(1, x + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

Given the above conditions, we need to determine the values of `i` and `max_sum`/`max_num` for the next iteration of the loop.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Determine the New Value of `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `i + 1`.

2. **Check if the Loop Can Continue:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is within the range `1` to `x`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i + 1` (which is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration) should be less than or equal to `x`.

3. **Update `digit_sum`:**
   - The new `digit_sum` will be the sum of the digits of the new `i` (which is `i + 2`).

4. **Update `max_sum` and `max_num`:**
   - Since the problem does not mention that `digit_sum` exceeded `max_sum` in the previous iteration, we assume `max_sum` and `max_num` remain unchanged.
   - Therefore, `max_sum` and `max_num` stay the same as they were before the previous iteration.

### Final State Adjustment:

- `i` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `digit_sum` will be recalculated for the new value of `i`.
- `max_sum` and `max_num` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the states to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`digit_sum` is the sum of the digits of `i + 2`, `i` is `i + 2`, `max_sum` remains unchanged, `max_num` remains unchanged**.
