The code assigns the value 1 to the variable `i`. The initial values of `num` and `count` are unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 10^9\); `count` is 0; `i` is 1.

Output State: **`num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 10^9\); `count` is 0; `i` is 1**
