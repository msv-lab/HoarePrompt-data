Postcondition: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `marks` is a list of integers (potentially empty), `marks_set` is a set of unique elements from `marks`, `x_found` is `True`, `y_found` is `True`, and `new_marks` is a set containing the updated results based on the final iteration through all `marks`. No conditions involving `mark + x`, `mark + y`, `mark - x`, or `mark - y` were met during the loop.**
