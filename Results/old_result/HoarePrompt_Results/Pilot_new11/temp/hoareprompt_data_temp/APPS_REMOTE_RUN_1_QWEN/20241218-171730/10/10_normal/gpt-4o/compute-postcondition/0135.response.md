`top_count[i]` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` is equal to the value of `j`, and the conditions for incrementing `bottom_count[i]` are not met (since `top_count[i] += 1` does not depend on `y1 < y1_j` and `y2 < y1_j`). Therefore, `bottom_count[i]` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` equals `j`, `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[j]`, `y1_j` is the second element of `sofas[j]`, `x2_j` is the third element of `sofas[j]`, and `y2_j` is the fourth element of `sofas[j]`; `top_count[i]` is incremented by 1, `bottom_count[i]` remains unchanged, `left_count[i]` remains unchanged.**
