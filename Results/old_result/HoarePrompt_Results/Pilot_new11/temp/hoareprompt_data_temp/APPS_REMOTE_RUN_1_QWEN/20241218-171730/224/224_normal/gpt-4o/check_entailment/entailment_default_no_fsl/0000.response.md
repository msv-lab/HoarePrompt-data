Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program attempts to calculate the factorial of `n-1` and returns it, which does not align with the problem description. According to the problem description, the goal is to count the number of permutations \( p \) of integers \( 1, 2, \ldots, n \) such that \( f(p) = f_{max}(n) \), where \( f(p) \) is defined as the number of distinct GCD values over the prefixes of the permutation. 

The function `func_1` calculates the factorial of `n-1`, which is not relevant to the problem. For example, for \( n = 6 \), the correct output should be 120, as stated in the provided example, but the program would output the factorial of 5, which is 120. However, the logic to determine the permutations where \( f(p) = f_{max}(n) \) is missing. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
