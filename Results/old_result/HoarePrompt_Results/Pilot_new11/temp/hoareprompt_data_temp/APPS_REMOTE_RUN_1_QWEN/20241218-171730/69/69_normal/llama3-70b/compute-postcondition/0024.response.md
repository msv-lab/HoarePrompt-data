`ux` is decremented by 1. Since `ux` was initially part of the string `ops`, it now has its value reduced by 1. The other variables (`ops` and `op`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`ops` is a non-empty string, `op` can be one of the following: 'U', 'R', 'L', or any other character, `ux` is `ux - 1`.**
