Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `p`, and `b`. Here, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `p` is a list of `n` integers representing a permutation, and `b` is a list of `n` integers consisting only of 0s and 1s. The function identifies cycles in the permutation `p` and checks if all elements within each cycle in `b` are 0s. If there is only one cycle, it prints `0`. Otherwise, it prints the number of cycles where all elements in `b` are 0s, unless no such cycles exist, in which case it prints `1`. The function handles the following edge cases:
- If `n` is 1, there is only one cycle, and it always prints `0`.
- If all elements in `b` are 0s across all cycles, the function prints the count of cycles where all elements are 0s.
- If no cycles have all elements in `b` being 0s, the function prints `1`.
The function does not modify the input lists `p` and `b`, and it returns nothing (i.e., it prints the result directly).**
