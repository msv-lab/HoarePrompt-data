Postcondition: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `marks` is a list of integers that must not be empty, `marks_set` is a set of unique elements from `marks`, `x_found` is `False`, `y_found` is `False`, `new_marks` is an empty set, and the condition `mark + x + y not in marks_set and mark + x - y not in marks_set and mark - x + y not in marks_set` holds true**
