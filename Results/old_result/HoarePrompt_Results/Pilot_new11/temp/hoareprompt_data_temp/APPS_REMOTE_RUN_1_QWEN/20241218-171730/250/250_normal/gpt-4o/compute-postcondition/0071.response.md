The code adds `mark - y` to `new_marks`. Since `mark - y` is not checked against `marks_set` in the given snippet, the only change is the addition of `mark - y` to `new_marks`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `marks` is a non-empty list of integers, `marks_set` is a set of unique elements from `marks`, `x_found` is `False`, `y_found` is `False`, and `new_marks` is a set containing `mark - y` in addition to its previous elements.**
