`remaining_after_cars` is assigned the value of `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`. The variables `total`, `n`, `house_cost`, `remaining_after_houses`, `b`, and `car_cost` are not directly involved in this operation, so their states remain unchanged. The only new variable created is `remaining_after_cars`, which is calculated based on the given expression.

Output State: **`total` is not specified, `n` is as it was before, `house_cost` is as it was before, `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`, `remaining_after_houses` must be greater than 0**
