The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no variables are updated or affected by the `continue` statement itself, the values of all variables remain the same as they were before the statement was executed.

Output State: **`d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T`, `meats`, `K`, `T`, `N`, `i`, `j + 1`, `x1` is `meats[j][0]`, `y1` is `meats[j][1]`, `c1` is `meats[j][2]` if `c1 * T < c2 * T`, otherwise `x1` is `meats[i][0]`, `y1` is `meats[i][1]`, and `c1` is `meats[i][2]`, `x2` is `meats[i][0]`, `y2` is `meats[i][1]`, `c2` is `meats[i][2]`, `cx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, `count`, `cy`, `dx` are as defined.**
