The code prints the value of `0` followed by `m // 2`. The value of `m // 2` is calculated from the initial state. Since `m` is initially an input integer divided by 2 using integer division, `m // 2` remains as it is because the code does not reassign any variables. The console prints 'YES', which is not affected by the code.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer // 2, `k` is an input integer, `area` is `n * (m // 2) / k`, and the console prints '0 {m // 2} YES'.**
