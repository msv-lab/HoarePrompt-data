The code initializes a variable `years` to 0. It does not perform any operations on `a` or `b`, which remain unchanged from their initial values. Therefore, the only new information is that `years` is now set to 0.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= a <= b <= 10, they hold the values entered by the user; `years` is 0.**
