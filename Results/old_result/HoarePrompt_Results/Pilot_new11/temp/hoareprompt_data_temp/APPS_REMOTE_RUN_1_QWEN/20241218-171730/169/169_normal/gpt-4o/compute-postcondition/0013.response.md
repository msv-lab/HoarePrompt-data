`stones` is updated to the maximum value between 0 and `stones - 1`. Since the initial value of `stones` is not specified, let's denote it as `stones_initial`. After the operation, `stones` will be `max(0, stones_initial - 1)`. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and the `operation` is set to the next character in the string `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `n` is the integer value of the input, `stones` is `max(0, stones_initial - 1)`, `operation` is the next character in the string `s`**
