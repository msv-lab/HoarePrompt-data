You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Today on Informatics class Nastya learned about GCD and LCM (see links below). Nastya is very intelligent, so she solved all the tasks momentarily and now suggests you to solve one of them as well.

We define a pair of integers (a, b) good, if GCD(a, b) = x and LCM(a, b) = y, where GCD(a, b) denotes the greatest common divisor of a and b, and LCM(a, b) denotes the least common multiple of a and b.

You are given two integers x and y. You are to find the number of good pairs of integers (a, b) such that l ≤ a, b ≤ r. Note that pairs (a, b) and (b, a) are considered different if a ≠ b.


-----Input-----

The only line contains four integers l, r, x, y (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 10^9).


-----Output-----

In the only line print the only integer — the answer for the problem.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 2 1 2

Output
2

Input
1 12 1 12

Output
4

Input
50 100 3 30

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example there are two suitable good pairs of integers (a, b): (1, 2) and (2, 1).

In the second example there are four suitable good pairs of integers (a, b): (1, 12), (12, 1), (3, 4) and (4, 3).

In the third example there are good pairs of integers, for example, (3, 30), but none of them fits the condition l ≤ a, b ≤ r.
Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

#Function 2:
def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b // func_1(a, b)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided includes two helper functions `func_1` and `func_2`, which are intended to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM), respectively. However, these functions are not utilized in the main logic to solve the problem, which is to count the number of good pairs (a, b) such that GCD(a, b) = x and LCM(a, b) = y within the range [l, r].

The problem requires using the properties of GCD and LCM to determine the number of valid pairs. Specifically, if GCD(a, b) = x and LCM(a, b) = y, then \(a \cdot b = x \cdot y\). Additionally, since \(x\) divides both \(a\) and \(b\), we can express \(a = dx\) and \(b = ey\), where \(d\) and \(e\) are coprime (i.e., GCD(d, e) = 1).

Given the constraints and the need to count pairs, the program should implement the logic to find such pairs, but the provided code does not do this. Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not provide the required functionality to solve the problem.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
(l, r, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
count = 0
for a in range(l, r + 1):
    for b in range(a, r + 1):
        if func_1(a, b) == x and func_2(a, b) == y:
            count += 1
print(count)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers such that a >= b > 0.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`, `b` is 0
    return a
    #The program returns a which is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of a and b, and b is 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, where `a` is greater than or equal to `b` and both are greater than 0. It computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. After the loop completes, `a` contains the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`, and `b` is set to 0. This process handles the case where `a` and `b` are equal (both become the GCD), and also ensures that `b` is always reduced until it reaches 0, making `a` the GCD. The function returns the computed GCD (`a`) and sets `b` to 0.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9 and func_1(a, b) is a function that returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b.
def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b // func_1(a, b)
    #`a * b // func_1(a, b)` where `func_1(a, b)` returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\). It computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the function `func_1(a, b)`. The function then returns the result of `a * b // func_1(a, b)`. This means the function returns the product of `a` and `b` divided by their GCD. 

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- If `a` or `b` is 1, the GCD will be 1, and the result will be `a * b`, since \(1 * n // 1 = n\) for any integer `n`.
- If both `a` and `b` are the same, the GCD will be `a` (or `b`), and the result will be `a^2 // a = a`.
- If either `a` or `b` is 0, the function will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` because `a * b // func_1(a, b)` would involve division by zero, as the GCD of any number and 0 is the number itself, leading to a division by the number when `a` or `b` is 0. Therefore, the function should handle such cases appropriately to avoid errors.



Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
