`ans` is assigned the value of the minimum between `k` and the product `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`. Given the constraints, these values are integers within specific ranges, but the exact values are not provided. Therefore, the exact value of `ans` depends on the input values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k`.

Output State: **`ans` is min(`k`, (`n` - `r` + 1) * (`m` - `r` + 1)), `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**
