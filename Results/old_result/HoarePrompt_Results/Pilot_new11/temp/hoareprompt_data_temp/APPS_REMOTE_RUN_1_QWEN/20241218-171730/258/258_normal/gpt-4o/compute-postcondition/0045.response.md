Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is an integer such that \(1 \leq K \leq \text{len(meats)}\), `T` is a non-negative float representing the time threshold, `N` is the length of the `meats` list and must be at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` are the first three elements of the tuple at index `i` or `j` in `meats`, `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` are the remaining tuple elements, `d` is \(\frac{T \cdot (c1 - c2)}{c1 \cdot c2}\), `cx` is \(\frac{x1 + x2}{2}\), `dy` is \(\frac{y1 - y2}{2}\), `d2` is \(dx^2 + dy^2\), `mx` is updated to \(cx + dy \cdot \frac{\sqrt{d2 \cdot d - d \cdot d}}{d2}\), `my` is updated to \(cy - dx \cdot \frac{\sqrt{d2 \cdot d - d \cdot d}}{d2}\), `count` is the number of tuples in `meats` where the distance from \((mx, my)\) to \((x, y)\) is less than or equal to \(T\), `cy` is \(\frac{y1 + y2}{2}\), `dx` is \(\frac{x1 - x2}{2}\)**.
