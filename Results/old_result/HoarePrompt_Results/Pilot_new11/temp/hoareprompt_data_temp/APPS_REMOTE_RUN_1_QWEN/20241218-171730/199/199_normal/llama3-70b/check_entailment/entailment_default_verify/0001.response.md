Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment was based on the assumption that the program did not correctly consider all valid cases, particularly those involving larger values of \(b\). However, upon reviewing the provided code and the output hints, the revised implementation of the function `func_1` now correctly iterates over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) up to \(\frac{n - a}{2} + 1\), ensuring that all valid pairs \((a, b)\) are considered. This adjustment ensures that the program can correctly count the number of ways to split the stick into four parts that can form a rectangle but not a square. The output hints confirm that the function now properly handles the required logic, and given the example inputs and their expected outputs, the program appears to be functioning correctly according to the problem description.
