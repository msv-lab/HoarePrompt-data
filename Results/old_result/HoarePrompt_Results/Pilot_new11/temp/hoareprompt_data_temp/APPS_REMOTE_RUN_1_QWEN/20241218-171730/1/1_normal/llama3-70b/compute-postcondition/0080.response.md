Functionality: **The function processes a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters `[`, `,`, `:`, and `|`, with a length between 1 and 500000. It searches for the first occurrence of `[` and the first occurrence of `:` immediately following it. Similarly, it searches for the last occurrence of `]` and the first occurrence of `:` immediately preceding it. If either pair is not found, it prints `-1`. If the substring between the first `:` after `[` and the first `:` before `]` is empty or invalid, it also prints `-1`. Otherwise, it counts the number of `|` characters in that substring and prints the count.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If no `[` is found, `ind` remains `-1`.
- If no `]` is found, `bind` remains `-1`.
- If no `:` is found after the first `[` or before the last `]`, `ind` or `bind` remains `-1`.
- If the substring between `ind` and `bind` is empty (`ind >= bind`), the function prints `-1`.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not handle cases where the input string contains multiple pairs of `[` and `]` with nested structures. The function only checks for the first occurrences of `[` and `]`.
