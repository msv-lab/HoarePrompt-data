The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. The initial state of `n` being greater than 2 and the list `ratings` remaining as `[('a', 'b'), ('a', 'b')]` are not directly affected by this code. However, the values of `is_rated` and `is_unrated` are explicitly stated to remain unchanged. Since the input is required, let's denote the input values as `x` and `y` for clarity.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state of `n` is greater than 2.
2. The list `ratings` is `[('a', 'b'), ('a', 'b')]`.
3. `is_rated` is True.
4. `is_unrated` is False.
5. The code reads two integers from input and assigns them to `a` and `b`.

After the code runs, the values of `a` and `b` are the integers entered by the user, while the other variables remain in their initial state.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `ratings` is `[('a', 'b'), ('a', 'b')]`, `is_rated` is True, `is_unrated` is False, `a` is an integer from input, `b` is an integer from input**
