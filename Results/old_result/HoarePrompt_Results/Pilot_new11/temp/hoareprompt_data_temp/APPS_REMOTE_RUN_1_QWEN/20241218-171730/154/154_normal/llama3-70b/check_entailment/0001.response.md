Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program implements a dynamic programming solution to find the maximum number of points Polycarp can earn within the given time limit \(M\). The logic in the program correctly handles the constraints and the scoring rules described in the problem statement. 

- The program sorts the times required to solve each subtask, which helps in efficiently building the DP table.
- The DP table `dp[i][j]` is used to store the maximum number of points that can be earned using the first `i` subtasks with `j` minutes available.
- The program correctly updates the DP table by considering whether to include the current subtask or not.
- Finally, the program sums up the points from the DP table and adds the extra point for completing tasks.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the provided solution appears to cover all necessary cases without any logical flaws. Therefore, the program is correct.
