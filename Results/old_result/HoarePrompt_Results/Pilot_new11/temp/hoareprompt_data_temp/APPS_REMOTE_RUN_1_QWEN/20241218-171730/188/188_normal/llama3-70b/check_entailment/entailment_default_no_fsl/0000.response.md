Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the case where there are multiple pairs of distinct integers, each appearing exactly \( \frac{n}{2} \) times. According to the problem description, the game is considered fair if Petya and Vasya can choose two distinct integers such that both integers appear exactly \( \frac{n}{2} \) times. However, the current implementation only checks for the existence of one pair and breaks the loop after finding the second integer, which means it will fail if there are multiple valid pairs.

For example, consider the following input:

```
6
1
1
2
2
3
3
```

The correct output should be "YES" followed by any two distinct integers that each appear exactly 3 times. However, the current code will print "NO" because it finds the second integer and breaks the loop without checking for other possible pairs. Therefore, the code is incorrect for this case.
