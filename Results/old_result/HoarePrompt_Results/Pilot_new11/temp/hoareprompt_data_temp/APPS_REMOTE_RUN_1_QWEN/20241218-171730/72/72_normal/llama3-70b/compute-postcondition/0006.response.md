Functionality: **The function reads five integers \(n\), \(m\), \(k\), \(x\), and \(y\) from standard input. It then calculates three values based on these inputs: `max_asked`, `min_asked`, and `sergei_asked`. These calculations are performed using specific formulas involving `k`, `n`, `x`, and `y`. The function prints these three calculated values to the console. There are no return values, and the function does not perform any error checking for negative values of `k`.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
1. **Negative Values of \(k\):** The function does not handle cases where \(k\) is negative. In such cases, the function should likely print an error message or return a specific value indicating an invalid input.
2. **Bounds for \(n\) and \(m\):** While the code assumes that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 100\), it does not check these bounds for \(n\) and \(m\). If \(n\) or \(m\) exceeds 100, the calculations might produce incorrect results.
