Postcondition: ***`n` is between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `t` is the integer value of the first input from the split, `dir` is the second input value from the split, `position` is within the range [0, 20000], and `valid` is True. If `dir` is either 'West' or 'East', `valid` remains True unless `position` is either 0 or 20000, in which case `valid` becomes False.***
