Postcondition: **`costs` is a list of integers, `L` is an integer greater than 0, `dp` is a list of length `L + 1` where each element is updated based on the smallest `vol` values up to `i` for each index `i` from 1 to `L`, `dp[0]` is 0, `i` is `n + 1` and its value is such that `vol` is less than or equal to `i`, `n` must be at least 1, `vol` is 2**
