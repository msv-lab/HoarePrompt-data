The code `a *= 3` multiplies the current value of `a` by 3. Since `a` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 10 (inclusive), the new value of `a` will be 3 times its original value. The value of `b` and `years` remains unchanged.

Let's denote the original value of `a` as `a_original`. After executing the code, the new value of `a` will be `a_original * 3`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`a` is `a_original * 3`, `b` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 10\); `years` is 0.**
