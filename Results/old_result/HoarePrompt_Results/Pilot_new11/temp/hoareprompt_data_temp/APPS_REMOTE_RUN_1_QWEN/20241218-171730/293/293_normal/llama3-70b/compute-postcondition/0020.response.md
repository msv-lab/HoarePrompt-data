First, let's determine the value of `ans` before the print statement is executed.

- Initial State: `n` is 1, which is `0b1` in binary. In binary, there is only one `1` at position 0.
- `ans` is calculated as the sum of the positions of the 1s in the binary representation of `n` minus the count of 1s.
- Positions of 1s: Since `n` is `0b1`, the position of the 1 is 0.
- Count of 1s: There is 1 `1`.

So, `ans` is calculated as:
\[ ans = (0) - 1 = -1 \]

The `print(ans)` statement will output `-1`.

Output State: **`n` is 1, `h` is unchanged, `ans` is -1**
