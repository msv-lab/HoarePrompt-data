`k` is incremented by 1, so `k` becomes 2. The function `func_2(new_a, new_b)` is called with `new_a` and `new_b` as arguments. The values of `new_a` and `new_b` are defined as `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, but the actual value depends on the value of `candidate`. However, the exact value of `candidate` is not given, so we keep it in its defined form. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is the same, `b` is the same, `diff` is the same, `min_lcm` is the same, `min_k` is the same, `k` is 2, `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate, current_lcm is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`**
