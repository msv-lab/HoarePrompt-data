The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` reads three space-separated integers from the standard input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. Since the input is not provided, we cannot specify the exact values, but we know they are positive integers within the given constraints.

The output state will be:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**
