Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to check if the fraction sum can be formed for values of \( n \) that have more than two divisors greater than 1 and less than \( n \). For instance, when \( n = 6 \), the program outputs a sequence that works, but it does not account for other valid sequences like \(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{6}\) or \(\frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{6}\).

The program only checks if \( n = 2 \) and prints "NO" directly, which is correct for that specific case. However, it does not generalize the solution to handle other valid cases, as required by the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
