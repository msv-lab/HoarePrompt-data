To ensure the loop executes, we need to verify that the conditions necessary for the loop to run are met. Specifically, we need to check the following:

1. The variable `i` should be within the bounds of the range defined by `top` and `bottom + 1`.
2. The variable `top` should be less than or equal to `bottom` to ensure there are rows to iterate over.
3. `top` and `bottom` should be valid indices for the `screen` list, meaning they should be within the bounds of the list.

Given the initial state and the loop condition:

- `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string is of length `m` and consists of characters ".", "w".
- `top` is the smallest row index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`.
- `bottom` is the largest row index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`.
- `left` is the smallest column index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`.
- `right` is the largest column index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`.
- `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1`.
- `frame_width` is `right - left + 1`.
- `frame_height` is greater than or equal to 2.
- `frame_width` is greater than or equal to 2.
- `result` is a list of `n` lists, each list is a copy of the corresponding string in `screen`.

For the loop to execute, we need to ensure that there are rows in the `screen` to iterate over. Therefore, we need to confirm that `top` is less than or equal to `bottom`.

State: **`screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string is of length `m` and consists of characters ".", "w"; `top` is the smallest row index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`; `bottom` is the largest row index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`; `left` is the smallest column index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`; `right` is the largest column index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`; `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1`; `frame_width` is `right - left + 1`; `frame_height` is greater than or equal to 2; `frame_width` is greater than or equal to 2; `result` is a list of `n` lists, each list is a copy of the corresponding string in `screen`; `top` must be less than or equal to `bottom`.**
