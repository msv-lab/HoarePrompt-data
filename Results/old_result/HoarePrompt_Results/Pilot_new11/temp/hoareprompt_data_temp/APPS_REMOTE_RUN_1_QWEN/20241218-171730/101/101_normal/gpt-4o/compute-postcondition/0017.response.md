Postcondition: ***`screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string is of length `m` and consists of characters ".", "w". `top` is `i` if `i > bottom`, otherwise it remains unchanged. `bottom` is now `i`. `left` is either `j` (if `j < left`) or remains `None`. `right` is still `None`. The current value of `j` is greater than the current value of `right`.***
