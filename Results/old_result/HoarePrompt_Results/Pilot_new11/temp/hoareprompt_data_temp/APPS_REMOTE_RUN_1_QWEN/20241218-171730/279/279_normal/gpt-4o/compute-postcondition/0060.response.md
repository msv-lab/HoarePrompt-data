`cycles.append(cycle)` appends the list `cycle` to the list `cycles`. This means that the list `cycle` is added as a new element to the list `cycles`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `visited` contains all nodes in the cycle marked as True, `cycle` contains all nodes in the cycle in the order they were visited, `x` points to the last node in the cycle, `cycles` is a list containing at least one element which is the list `cycle`**
