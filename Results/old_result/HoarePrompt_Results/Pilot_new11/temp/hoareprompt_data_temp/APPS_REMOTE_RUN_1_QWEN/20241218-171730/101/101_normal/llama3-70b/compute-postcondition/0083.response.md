Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `white_pixels` contains at least one tuple.
   - `m` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `i` is less than `n`.
   - `j` is 1.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`.

3. **What Happens Inside the Loop:**
   - For each `j`:
     - If `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or (j == max_y))` and `pixels[i][j]` is `'.'`, then `pixels[i][j]` remains unchanged.
     - Otherwise, if `pixels[i][j]` is `'w'`, then it remains unchanged.
     - If neither condition is met, `pixels[i][j]` is set to `'.'`.

4. **Current Values at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is less than `n`.
   - `j` is 1.

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - Since `j` is 1, the next value for `j` would be 2 (since the range is `range(m)`).

6. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The value of `i` does not change within the current loop iteration because the loop is iterating over `j`.
   - The condition `j == 1` was true at the end of the previous iteration, so `j` will now be incremented to 2.
   - The value of `n`, `white_pixels`, and `m` remain the same as they were not modified within the loop body.

**State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `white_pixels` contains at least one tuple.
- `m` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `i` is less than `n`.
- `j` is 2.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `white_pixels` contains at least one tuple, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is less than `n`, and `j` is 2.**
