The code assigns the value of `dp[i][j - 1]` to `dp[i][j]`. Given that `i` is 1, this assignment updates the value of `dp[1][j]` to be the same as `dp[1][j - 1]`. Since `j` can be any value from 0 to `M`, the value of `dp[1][j]` is now copied from `dp[1][j - 1]`. 

- `t` remains `[n, k, M]` sorted in ascending order.
- `dp` is updated such that `dp[1][j]` equals `dp[1][j - 1]` for all `j` from 0 to `M`.
- `k` and `M` remain unchanged and `k` is still greater than or equal to 1, `M` is still greater than 0.
- `i` remains 1.

Output State: **`t` is `[n, k, M]`, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(k + 1) x (M + 1)` where each element is 0 except `dp[1][j]` which is equal to `dp[1][j - 1]` for all `j` from 0 to `M`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `M` is greater than 0, and `i` is 1.**
