Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input, representing the initial weights of Limak and Bob, respectively. These values satisfy the constraints `1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10`.

2. **Initialization**: The variable `years` is initialized to 0, which will count the number of years required for Limak to become strictly larger than Bob.

3. **Loop Execution**: The `while` loop continues as long as `a` is less than or equal to `b`. Inside the loop:
   - Limak's weight is tripled: `a *= 3`.
   - Bob's weight is doubled: `b *= 2`.
   - The `years` counter is incremented by 1: `years += 1`.

4. **Termination Condition**: The loop terminates when `a` becomes strictly greater than `b`, meaning Limak has become larger than Bob.

5. **Output**: The number of years (`years`) required for Limak to surpass Bob's weight is printed.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the program, the program will always correctly compute the number of years required for Limak to become strictly larger than Bob. The loop ensures that the weights are updated correctly each year, and the condition `a > b` is checked after each iteration to determine when Limak becomes larger than Bob.

Thus, the program adheres to the problem description and will produce the correct output for all valid inputs within the specified range.
