The code `print(f'{result:.6f}')` prints the value of `result` formatted to 6 decimal places. This does not change the value of `result` or any other variables, it only outputs the value. The initial state includes `n` being the integer value of `data[0]`, `cakes` being a list of tuples containing the radius and height of the corresponding cakes, and `result` being the return value of `func_1(n, cakes)`. Since the print statement does not alter these values, they remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `cakes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the radius and height of the corresponding cake, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, cakes)`**
