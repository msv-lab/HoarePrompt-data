The code assigns the maximum value between `v1` and `v2` to `max_speed`. The values of `v1` and `v2` are unchanged, and the values of `t` and `d` remain the same as their initial inputs. Therefore, the `max_speed` variable is now the greater of `v1` and `v2`.

Output State: **`v1` is an integer input, `v2` is an integer input, `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100, `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10, `max_speed` is max(`v1`, `v2`).**
