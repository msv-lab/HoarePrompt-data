According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `m - 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 0
- `n` must be at least 3
- `m` is an integer such that \(2 \le m \le 50\)
- `A` is a matrix of size `n` by `m` where each element is either 0 or 1
- `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(1, j + 1)` where `j` is a valid index satisfying the given conditions
- There exists at least one valid index `j` within the bounds of the matrix such that `A[0][j] == 1` or `A[0][j + 1] == 1` or `A[1][j] == 1` or `A[1][j + 1] == 1`

Since the loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = m - 2`, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is less than `m - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.

Let's summarize the states:
- `i` remains 0 because it is not affected by the loop.
- `n` must still be at least 3.
- `m` remains the same since it is not modified within the loop.
- `A` remains the same because it is not modified within the loop.
- `ops` remains the same because it is not modified within the loop.
- Since `j` must be incremented by 1, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `j + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be at least 3, `m` is an integer such that \(2 \le m \le 50\), `A` is a matrix of size `n` by `m` where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(1, j + 1)` where `j` is a valid index satisfying the given conditions, and there exists at least one valid index `j` within the bounds of the matrix such that `A[0][j] == 1` or `A[0][j + 1] == 1` or `A[1][j] == 1` or `A[1][j + 1] == 1`, and `j` is incremented by 1.**

In simpler terms:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be at least 3, `m` is an integer such that \(2 \le m \le 50\), `A` is a matrix of size `n` by `m` where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(1, j + 1)` where `j` is a valid index satisfying the given conditions, and there exists at least one valid index `j` within the bounds of the matrix such that `A[0][j] == 1` or `A[0][j + 1] == 1` or `A[1][j] == 1` or `A[1][j + 1] == 1`, and `j` is 1 (since it was previously `j`).**
