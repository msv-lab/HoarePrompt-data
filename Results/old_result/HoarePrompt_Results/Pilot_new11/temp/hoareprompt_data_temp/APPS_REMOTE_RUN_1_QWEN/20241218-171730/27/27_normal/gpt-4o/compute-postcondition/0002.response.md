The given Python code creates a list of tuples containing expressions and their corresponding string representations. Each expression involves the variables `x`, `y`, and `z`, which are updated to the values read from `sys.stdin.read()`. Since the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are updated but no actual calculation or assignment is performed on them within the code snippet provided, the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are updated to the values read from `sys.stdin.read()`, each with exactly one digit after the decimal point, ranging from 0.1 to 200.0 inclusive; `expressions` is a list of tuples containing expressions and their corresponding string representations.**
