Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The annotated version confirms that the program correctly calculates the maximum number of fruits that can be used while maintaining the required ratio of 1 lemon : 2 apples : 4 pears. The logic of taking the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4` ensures that the fruits are used in the correct ratio. The calculation of the total number of fruits and the printing of the result are also correct. The annotated version supports that the program behaves as expected within the given constraints and problem requirements. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained as **True**.
