The code `print('-')` does not affect any variable values or states. It only prints a hyphen to the console. The initial conditions and variable values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`min_upvotes` is `x`, `y` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 100, `max_upvotes` is `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is `y`, `max_downvotes` is `y + z`, and the current value of `max_upvotes` is less than the current value of `min_downvotes`**
