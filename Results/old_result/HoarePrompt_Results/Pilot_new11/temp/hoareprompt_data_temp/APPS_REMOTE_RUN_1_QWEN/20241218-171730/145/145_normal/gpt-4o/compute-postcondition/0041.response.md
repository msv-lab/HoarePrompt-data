The line `current_sum = 0` sets the value of `current_sum` to 0. This changes the value of `current_sum`, but does not affect the other variables. Therefore, the updated values are:

- `target_sum` remains as the sum of the first `n` elements in the list.
- `segment_length` remains as `n`.
- `current_sum` is now 0.
- `segment_count` remains as 2.
- `i` remains as 4.
- `n` remains as the length of the ticket list.

Output State: **`target_sum` is the sum of the first `n` elements in the list, `segment_length` is `n`, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 2, `i` is 4, `n` is the length of the ticket list.**
