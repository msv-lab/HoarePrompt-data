`k` is incremented by 1, and then the program prints `k + 1` and `1`. Since the initial value of `k` is less than `n - 1`, after incrementing `k` by 1, `k + 1` will be between 1 and `n - 1`. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged. The output of the print statement will be `k + 1` followed by `1`.

Output State: **`n` is an even positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `m` is an odd positive integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k < n·m and k + 1` is between 1 and `n - 1`, and the output of the print statement is `k + 1 1`**
