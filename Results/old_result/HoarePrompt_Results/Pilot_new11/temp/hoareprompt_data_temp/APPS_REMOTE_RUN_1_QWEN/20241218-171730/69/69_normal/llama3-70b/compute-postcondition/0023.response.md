The code `ux += 1` increments the value of `ux` by 1. Since `ux` is not defined in the initial state, it means `ux` is being initialized to 1. The value of `ops` and `op` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`ops` is a non-empty string, `op` can be one of the following: 'U', 'R', 'L', or any other character, `ux` is 1**
