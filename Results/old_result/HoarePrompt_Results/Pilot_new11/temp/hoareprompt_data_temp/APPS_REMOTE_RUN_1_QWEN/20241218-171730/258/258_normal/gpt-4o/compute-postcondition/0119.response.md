The code snippet `x2, y2, c2 = meats[j]` updates the values of `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` to be the values of `meats[j][0]`, `meats[j][1]`, and `meats[j][2]`, respectively. 

- The value of `i` remains `k + 2`.
- The values of `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` remain `meats[i][0]`, `meats[i][1]`, and `meats[i][2]`, respectively.
- The value of `x2` is updated to `meats[j][0]`.
- The value of `y2` is updated to `meats[j][1]`.
- The value of `c2` is updated to `meats[j][2]`.

The values of `d`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `my`, and `count` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is `k + 2`, `x1` is `meats[i][0]`, `y1` is `meats[i][1]`, `c1` is `meats[i][2]`, `x2` is `meats[j][0]`, `y2` is `meats[j][1]`, `c2` is `meats[j][2]`, `d` remains unchanged, `dx` is \((x1 - x2) / 2\), `dy` is \((y1 - y2) / 2\), `d2` is \(\left(\frac{x1 - x2}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y1 - y2}{2}\right)^2\), `my` is `cy - dx \cdot \frac{\mathbf{math.sqrt(d2 \cdot d - d^2)}}{d2}`, `count` remains unchanged.**
