`max_beauty_one_swap` is assigned the maximum value between `max_beauty_one_swap` and `beauty`. The value of `beauty` is the count of 'G' characters in the substring of `s` starting from index `i` and going backwards until the first non-'G' character is encountered, and `j` is the index of the last 'G' character found in this substring or -1 if no 'G' character is found. The states of the other variables are not directly affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the value of `max_beauty_one_swap` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `beauty`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer, `s` is a string, `beauty` is the count of 'G' characters in the substring of `s` starting from index `i` and going backwards until the first non-'G' character is encountered, `j` is the index of the last 'G' character found in this substring or -1 if no 'G' character is found, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of its current value and `beauty`, and `n` is greater than `i + 1`.**
