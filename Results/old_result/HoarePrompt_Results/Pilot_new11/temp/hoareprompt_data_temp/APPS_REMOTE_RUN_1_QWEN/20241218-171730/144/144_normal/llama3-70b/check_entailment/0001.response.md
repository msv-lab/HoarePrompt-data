Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum possible value of the mex for the given array. Specifically, consider the following input:

Input:
```
3
2 2 2
```

According to the problem description, Alyona can decrease any element to any positive integer less than or equal to its original value. Therefore, for the array `[2, 2, 2]`, Alyona can decrease all elements to `1`. The resulting array would be `[1, 1, 1]`, and the mex of this array is `2`.

However, the program sorts the array and then iterates through it to find the mex. In the sorted array `[2, 2, 2]`, the program would find that `mex` remains `1` because it encounters `2` before reaching `1`. This leads to an incorrect output of `1` instead of the correct output of `2`.

Thus, the program fails to handle this specific case correctly, making it incorrect.
