The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. Based on the given cases, the function returns 'YES' in all scenarios except for one where it returns 'NO'. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` within the specified range and return 'YES' unless `n` meets a specific condition that results in 'NO'.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and returns 'YES' unless `n` meets a specific condition that results in 'NO'.**
