`current_x` is decremented by 1. The value of `dx` is updated as `dx = current_x - final_x`, and `current_x` is now 0 - 1 = -1. The value of `final_x` remains unchanged since the code does not modify it directly. The value of `final_y`, `operations`, `x`, `y`, `dy`, `min_length`, `current_y`, and `position_map` are not affected.

Output State: **`dx` is `-1 - final_x`, `final_x` is the number of 'R' operations minus the number of 'L' operations, `final_y` is the number of 'U' operations minus the number of 'D' operations, `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R', `x` and `y` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `dy` is `y - final_y`, `min_length` is set to `float('inf')`, `current_x` is -1, `current_y` is 0; `position_map` is `{(0, 0): -1}`.**
