The function `can_distribute` accepts a parameter `x` and returns whether the sum of `a // x` and `b // x` is greater than or equal to `n`. Here, `a` and `b` represent the number of pieces of the first and second cake respectively, and `n` is the number of plates. The function checks if each cake can be evenly distributed among the plates without leaving any remainder. If the sum of the pieces of both cakes divided by `x` is greater than or equal to the number of plates `n`, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Potential edge cases include when `x` is 1 (resulting in `a + b // x`), and when `x` is greater than `a` or `b` (resulting in `a // x + b // x` being 0).
