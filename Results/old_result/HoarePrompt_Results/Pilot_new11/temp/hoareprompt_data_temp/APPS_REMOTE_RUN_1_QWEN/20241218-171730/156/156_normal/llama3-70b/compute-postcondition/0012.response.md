Functionality: **The function processes three input integers \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \), where \( n \) and \( m \) are even and positive integers within the range \( 2 \leq n, m \leq 10^9 \) and \( k \) is an integer within the range \( 0 \leq k < n \cdot m \). It calculates and prints coordinates based on the value of \( k \).

Specifically, the function first reduces \( k \) modulo \( n \cdot 2 - 2 \). Then, depending on the value of \( k \):

- If \( k < n - 1 \), it prints \( (k + 1, 1) \).
- If \( k \geq n - 1 \) and \( k < n \cdot 2 - 2 \), it calculates the row and column indices as follows:
  - Row index: \( 2n - k - 2 \)
  - Column index: \( \left(\frac{k - n + 1}{n - 1}\right) + 1 \)
  - It prints the calculated row and column indices.
- If \( k \geq n \cdot 2 - 2 \), it prints \( (1, 2) \).

This process ensures that the function handles all possible values of \( k \) and provides appropriate output coordinates based on the given conditions.**

Edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function correctly handles the case when \( k \) is less than \( n - 1 \) by printing \( (k + 1, 1) \).
- For \( k \) between \( n - 1 \) and \( n \cdot 2 - 2 \), the function correctly calculates and prints the corresponding row and column indices.
- When \( k \) is greater than or equal to \( n \cdot 2 - 2 \), the function prints \( (1, 2) \), which is handled correctly.
- There are no missing functionalities; the function covers all the possible ranges for \( k \) as described in the problem statement.
