`full_rows` is assigned the value of `k` divided by `(m - 1)`. Given that `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k < nm - (n - 1)\) and \(k \geq n - 1\), and `m` is an odd positive integer such that \(2 \leq m \leq 10^9\), the value of `full_rows` depends on the exact value of `k` and `m`. However, we can express `full_rows` in terms of `k` and `m`.

The value of `full_rows` is the integer division of `k` by `(m - 1)`, which means it is the largest integer `q` such that \(q \times (m - 1) \leq k\).

Output State: **`n` is an even positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\); `m` is an odd positive integer such that \(2 \leq m \leq 10^9\); `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k < nm - (n - 1)\) and \(k \geq n - 1\); `full_rows` is \(k // (m - 1)\)**
