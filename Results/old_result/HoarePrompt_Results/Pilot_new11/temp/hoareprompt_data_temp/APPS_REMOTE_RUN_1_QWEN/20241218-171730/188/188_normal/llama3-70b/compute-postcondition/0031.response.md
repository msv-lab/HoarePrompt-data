The code `c += 1` increments the value of `c` by 1. The initial value of `c` is 0, so after the code is executed, `c` becomes 1. The other variables (`d`, `i`, `n`, `a1`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the list, `n` is an integer, and the current value of `d[i]` is equal to `n // 2`; `a1` is equal to `i`; `c` is 1.

Output State: **`d` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the list, `n` is an integer, and the current value of `d[i]` is equal to `n // 2`; `a1` is equal to `i`; `c` is 1**
