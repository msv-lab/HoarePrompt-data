`left` is assigned the value of `mid`. The value of `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `low` is less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`; `result` is an empty list; `left` is equal to `mid`.**
