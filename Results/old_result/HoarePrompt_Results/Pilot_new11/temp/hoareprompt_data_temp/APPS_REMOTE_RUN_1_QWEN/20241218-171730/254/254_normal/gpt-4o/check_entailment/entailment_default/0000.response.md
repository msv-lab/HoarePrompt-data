Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if it is possible to light at least one garland every second after switching them on. The logic in the code relies on checking the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the time intervals, but this is not sufficient to ensure that at least one garland is lit every second.

To illustrate why the code is incorrect, consider the following counterexample:

- Input: \( k_1 = 4 \), \( k_2 = 6 \), \( k_3 = 8 \)

According to the code, it computes:
- \( \text{gcd}(k_1, k_2) = \text{gcd}(4, 6) = 2 \)
- \( \text{gcd}(\text{gcd}(4, 6), k_3) = \text{gcd}(2, 8) = 2 \)

Since the final GCD is 2, the code incorrectly outputs 'YES', suggesting that it is possible to light at least one garland every second. However, this is not true because the sequence of seconds lit by the garlands (4, 8, 12, ...), (6, 12, 18, ...), and (8, 16, 24, ...) will never cover all seconds starting from the maximum initial switch-on time.

For example, at second 1, none of the garlands are lit. At second 2, none of the garlands are lit. At second 3, none of the garlands are lit. And so on. Therefore, the code fails to correctly determine if it is possible to light at least one garland every second.

Thus, the code is incorrect for this problem.
