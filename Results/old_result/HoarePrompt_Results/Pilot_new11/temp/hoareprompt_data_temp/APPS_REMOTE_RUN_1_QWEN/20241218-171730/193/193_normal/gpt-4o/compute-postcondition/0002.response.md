The function `func` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`. Both `x` and `y` are integers such that `3 <= y < x <= 100,000`. The function does not return any value directly from the given information, but it implies that the function might calculate or process something within these constraints. However, based on the provided output cases, we can infer that the function does not have explicit return statements listed.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two integers `x` and `y` such that `3 <= y < x <= 100,000`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, where `x` and `y` are integers such that `3 <= y < x <= 100,000`.**
