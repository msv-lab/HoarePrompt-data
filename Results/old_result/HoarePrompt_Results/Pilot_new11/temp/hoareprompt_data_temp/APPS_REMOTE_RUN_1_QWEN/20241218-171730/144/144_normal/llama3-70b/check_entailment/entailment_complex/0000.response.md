Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem described. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of elements in the array.
   - It then reads `n` integers from the input and stores them in the list `arr`.

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The program sorts the array `arr` in ascending order.
   - Sorting helps in efficiently finding the smallest missing positive integer.

3. **Finding the Mex Value:**
   - The variable `mex` is initialized to 1.
   - The program iterates through the sorted array `arr`:
     - If the current element `num` in the array is equal to `mex`, it increments `mex` by 1.
     - If the current element `num` is greater than `mex`, it means `mex` is the smallest missing positive integer, and the loop breaks.
   - If no elements in the array are greater than `mex`, `mex` will eventually become larger than the largest element in the array, and the loop will terminate, indicating that all integers from 1 to the largest element are present in the array.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the value of `mex`, which is the smallest positive integer not present in the array.

### Verification of Problem Description:
- **Array Elements:** The program handles the input of `n` integers and stores them in `arr`.
- **Sorting:** The array is sorted to facilitate the process of finding the smallest missing positive integer.
- **Finding Mex:** The program correctly finds the smallest missing positive integer by iterating through the sorted array.
- **Output:** The program outputs the correct value of `mex` as required.

Given that the program accurately follows the steps described in the problem statement and produces the correct output for any valid input, the program is correct.
