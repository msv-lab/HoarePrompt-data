According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is a non-negative integer.
- `s` is a string.
- `beauty` is the count of 'G' characters in the substring of `s` starting from index `i` and going backwards until the first non-'G' character is encountered.
- `j` is `i + 3`, and `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`. Given that `j` starts at `i + 3`, the next value of `j` would be `i + 4`. Therefore, for the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than `i + 4`.

State: **`i` is a non-negative integer, `s` is a string, `beauty` is the count of 'G' characters in the substring of `s` starting from index `i` and going backwards until the first non-'G' character is encountered, `j` is `i + 4`, and `n` must be greater than `i + 4`.**
