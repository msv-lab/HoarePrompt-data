Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of n integers, `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `min_cost` is infinity, `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1, `current_cost` is either `length - 2` (if `length > t + 1`) or `0` (otherwise), `length` is the first element in the list `a`, and the length of the first element in the list `a` is greater than or equal to `t + 1`***
