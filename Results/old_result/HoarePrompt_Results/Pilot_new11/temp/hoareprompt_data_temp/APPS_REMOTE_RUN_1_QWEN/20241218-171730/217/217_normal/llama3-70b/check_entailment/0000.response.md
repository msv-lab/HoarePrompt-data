Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program attempts to split the array into two parts by alternating between adding to `b` and `c`, but this approach does not guarantee finding the maximum possible value of \(B - C\). For example, consider the input:

```
Input
4
-10 20 -30 40
```

The program would split the array as follows:
- \(b = [-10, -30]\)
- \(c = [20, 40]\)

This results in \(B = -40\) and \(C = 60\), so \(B - C = -100\).

However, the optimal solution would be to place all positive numbers in `b` and all negative numbers in `c`:
- \(b = [20, 40]\)
- \(c = [-10, -30]\)

This results in \(B = 60\) and \(C = -40\), so \(B - C = 100\).

Thus, the program does not always find the maximum possible value of \(B - C\).
