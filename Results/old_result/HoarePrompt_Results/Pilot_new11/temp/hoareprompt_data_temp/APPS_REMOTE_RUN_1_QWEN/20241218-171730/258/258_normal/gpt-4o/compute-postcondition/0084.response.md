`dx` is assigned the value of `(x1 - x2) / 2`. Given that `x1` is equal to `y1` and `x2` is equal to `y1`, the value of `dx` can be simplified to `(y1 - y1) / 2`, which is `0`.

The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `N` is greater than `k + 2`, `x1` is `x2`, `y1` is `x1`, `c1` is `c2`, `x2` is `y1`, `y2` is `x1`, `c2` is `c1`, `d` is 0, `cx` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `cy` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `dx` is 0**
