Postcondition: ***`final_x` is either -1 or 1, depending on whether `op` is 'L' or 'R', respectively. `final_y` remains 0, `operations` must be a non-empty string, and `x`, `y` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, the operation `op` is not equal to 'D'.***
