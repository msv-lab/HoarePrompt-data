The code snippet updates the variable `max_beauty` to be the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`. However, the initial state does not specify a value for `curr_beauty`, so we cannot determine its exact value after the code runs. Therefore, `max_beauty` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`, which could be anything. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' or 'S', `golden` is a list of integers containing the indices of all characters in `s` that are equal to 'G', `max_beauty` is the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is the index of the last 'G' in the string `s`, or `n` if there are no 'G's, and `right` is `n`.**
