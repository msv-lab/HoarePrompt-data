Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The state at the end of the previous iteration is given as `n` must be greater than or equal to `i - 1`.

2. **Loop Condition**: The for loop iterates over the range `range(i - 1, -1, -1)`. This means the loop starts from `i - 1` and decrements down to `-1`.

3. **Loop Execution**: For each value of `j` in this range, the following actions are performed:
   - If `s[j]` is 'G', then `beauty` is set to 1.
   - If `s[j]` is not 'G', the most internal loop or switch-case structure is exited.

4. **Determining the Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be decreased by 1 (since the loop decrements).
   - Therefore, `j` must be `i - 2` at the start of the next iteration.
   - The condition `n >= i - 1` remains unchanged because it does not depend on `j`.

5. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since `j` decreases by 1, `i` remains the same, but `j` changes to `i - 2`.
   - The condition `n >= i - 1` still holds true.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to `i - 1`, `j` is `i - 2`**
