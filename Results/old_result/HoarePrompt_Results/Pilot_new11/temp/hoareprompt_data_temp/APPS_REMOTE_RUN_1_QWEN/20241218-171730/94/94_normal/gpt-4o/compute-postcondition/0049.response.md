The code swaps the values of `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]`. Given the initial state, the only variables affected are `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

- `queue` is a non-empty list.
- `directions` is `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`.
- `new_row` is either 0 or 1.
- `new_col` is either 0 or 1.
- `new_pos` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3.
- `new_state` is a copy of `current`.

After the swap, the values of `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` are swapped.

Output State: **`queue` is a non-empty list, `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `new_row` is either 0 or 1, `new_col` is either 0 or 1, `new_pos` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `new_state` is a copy of `current`, `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` are swapped.**
