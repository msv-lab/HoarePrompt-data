Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations to delete the entire string. The logic in the program increments `ans` whenever it encounters a different character than the previous one, which does not account for contiguous substrings of identical characters.

For example, consider the input:
```
6
aaabbbccc
```
The program would output `3`, but the correct output should be `3` operations to delete `aaa`, `bbb`, and `ccc`. However, the program only counts the transitions between different characters, resulting in only two operations: deleting `aaabbb` and then `ccc`.

To fix this, the program needs to identify and count contiguous substrings of identical characters. A correct approach would involve iterating through the string and counting the number of such substrings.
