The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `n` (an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) and `f_max_n` (the maximum value of \(f(p)\) for permutations of length `n` as defined in the problem description). It initializes a list `dp` of size `f_max_n + 1` with all elements set to 0, except for `dp[0]` which is set to 1. The function then iterates over the range from 1 to `n`, updating each element `dp[j]` to be the cumulative sum of `dp[j - 1]` modulo `10^9 + 7`. After the loop, the function returns `dp[f_max_n]`, which is the cumulative sum of `dp[0]` to `dp[f_max_n]` modulo `10^9 + 7`.

The function performs the following actions:
- Initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[j]` represents a cumulative sum.
- Sets the base case `dp[0]` to 1.
- Iteratively updates the `dp` array such that each element `dp[j]` is the sum of `dp[j - 1]` modulo `10^9 + 7`.
- Returns the final value of `dp[f_max_n]` which is the cumulative sum of the `dp` array up to `f_max_n` modulo `10^9 + 7`.

Potential edge cases:
- If `n` is 2, the loop will only run once, and `dp[j]` will only update for `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`.
- If `f_max_n` is 0, the initial `dp[0]` value will not change, and `dp[f_max_n]` will remain 1.

There are no missing functionalities in the provided code, and all relevant actions are covered in the summary.
