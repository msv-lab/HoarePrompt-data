The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. Since the initial state specifies that `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are empty lists and `n` must be greater than 0, these conditions remain unchanged. However, `a` and `b` are now assigned the values of the integers inputted by the user.

Output State: **`ratings_before` is an empty list, `ratings_after` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**
