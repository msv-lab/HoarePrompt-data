`visited[x]` is assigned the value `True`. Given the initial state, `x` is equal to `p[p[1] - 1] - 1`, so `visited[x]` becomes `True`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `visited[0]` is True, `cycle` contains the value [1, p[1] - 1], `x` is p[p[1] - 1] - 1, `visited[1]` is True, `cycles` includes the `cycle` list, `visited[p[1] - 1]` is True, `visited[x]` is True**
