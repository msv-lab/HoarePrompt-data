Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code clearly shows that the function `func_1` is calculating the number of distinct divisors of the input number `num`, including 1 and `num` itself. However, this does not match the problem description, which asks for the number of different weights of splits of `n`. As per the problem description, the weights are the number of elements in the split that are equal to the first element, and the range of weights is from 1 to `n`. The provided solution does not address this requirement and instead counts the divisors of `n`.

Based on the annotations and the problem description, the program does not meet the problem requirements. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.
