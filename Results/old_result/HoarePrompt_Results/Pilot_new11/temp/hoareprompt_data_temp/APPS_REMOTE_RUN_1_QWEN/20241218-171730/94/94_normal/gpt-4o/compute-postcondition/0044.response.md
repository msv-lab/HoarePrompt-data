Let's analyze the given code snippet and determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Analysis:
- **Variables involved in the loop**: The loop iterates over `directions`, which is a list of tuples `[(dr, dc)]` where each tuple represents a direction move (e.g., up, down, left, right).
- **Conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements in the `directions` list.

### Initial States:
- `start` is a string representing the initial configuration of a 2x2 sliding puzzle.
- `queue` is a list of unique states reachable from `start` with the leftmost element removed.
- `visited` is a set containing all unique states reachable from `start` through valid moves.
- `directions` is `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`.
- `current` is the leftmost element of the original `queue`.
- `empty_row`, `empty_col` are determined by `divmod(empty_pos, 2)`.
- `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`.
- `queue` must not be empty anymore since an element was popped.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`queue` must not be empty**: The problem statement mentions that `queue` must not be empty anymore since an element was popped. This ensures that the loop has something to iterate over.
2. **`directions` list**: The `directions` list contains four elements and will always exist, so no adjustment is needed for this list.
3. **`current` and its related states**: These are derived from the state of `queue` but are not directly involved in the loop's execution condition.

### Required Adjustments:
- Ensure `queue` is not empty. Since one element has been popped from `queue`, `queue` should still contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

### Final Answer:
State: **`queue` is a non-empty list, directions is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]**
