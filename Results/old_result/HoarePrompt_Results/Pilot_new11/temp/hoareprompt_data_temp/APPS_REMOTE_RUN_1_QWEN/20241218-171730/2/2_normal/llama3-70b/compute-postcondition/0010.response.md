The code calculates the `digit_sum` by converting `i` to a string, iterating over each character (digit), converting each character back to an integer, and summing these integers. 

- `i` was initially `i + 1`.
- `digit_sum` was the sum of the digits of `i + 1`.

After executing the code, `digit_sum` is updated to be the sum of the digits of `i`. Since `i` was originally `i + 1`, the new `digit_sum` is the sum of the digits of `i + 1`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`digit_sum` is the sum of the digits of `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `max_sum` remains unchanged, `max_num` remains unchanged**
