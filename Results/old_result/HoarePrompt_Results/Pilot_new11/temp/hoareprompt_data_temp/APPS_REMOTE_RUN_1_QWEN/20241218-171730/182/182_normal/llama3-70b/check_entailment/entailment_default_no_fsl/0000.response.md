Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed to minimize the deviation from vertical for a given camera rotation angle. The code handles all potential cases within the specified range of \([-10^{18}, 10^{18}]\). It first normalizes the angle using modulo 360 to ensure the angle is within \([0, 359]\). Then, it calculates the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns required to achieve the smallest deviation from vertical. The formula \(((x + 90 - 1) // 90) \% 4\) ensures that the correct number of turns is determined, considering all possible angles and their rotations. Given the problem constraints and the provided output hints, the code appears to handle all edge cases correctly, including the maximum and minimum values of \(x\).
