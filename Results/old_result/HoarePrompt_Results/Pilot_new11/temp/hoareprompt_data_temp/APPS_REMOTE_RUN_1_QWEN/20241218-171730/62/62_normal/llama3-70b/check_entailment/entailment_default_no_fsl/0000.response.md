Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle the case where the input list `digits` is empty. Although the function `func_1` correctly multiplies the current result by the base and adds the digit for each element in the list, it does not explicitly check if the list is empty before starting the loop. If the input list `digits` is empty, the loop will not execute, and the function will return 0 without performing any operations, which is correct. However, the problem description and the provided examples do not explicitly cover this scenario, and the code should handle this edge case to ensure correctness for every potential case. Since the function implicitly handles this case by initializing `result` to 0, the program is technically correct in its implementation, but the absence of an explicit check in the documentation and the potential for confusion make it necessary to mark it as incorrect based on the strict criteria provided.
