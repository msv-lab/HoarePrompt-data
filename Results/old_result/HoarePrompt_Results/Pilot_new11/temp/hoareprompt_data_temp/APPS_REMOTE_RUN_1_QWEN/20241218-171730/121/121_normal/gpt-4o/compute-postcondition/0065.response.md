`counts[char]` is incremented by 1. Since `char` is an element in `counts` at index `i`, the value at that index is increased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`counts` is a list with at least one element, `result` is a list with an additional assignment at index `i` where the value at that index is `char`, and the value at index `i` in `counts` is increased by 1.**
