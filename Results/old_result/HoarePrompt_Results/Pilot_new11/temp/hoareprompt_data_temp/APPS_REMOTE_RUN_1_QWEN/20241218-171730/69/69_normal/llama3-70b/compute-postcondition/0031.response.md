`uy` is decremented by 1. The initial state of `uy` is not specified other than it is an integer (since it can be operated upon with `-=`), so the only thing we know for certain is that `uy` was a non-zero integer initially. After decrementing by 1, `uy` will be `uy - 1`.

Output State: **`uy` is `uy - 1`, `ops` is a non-empty string, and `op` can be one of the following: 'U', 'R', 'L', or any other character.**
