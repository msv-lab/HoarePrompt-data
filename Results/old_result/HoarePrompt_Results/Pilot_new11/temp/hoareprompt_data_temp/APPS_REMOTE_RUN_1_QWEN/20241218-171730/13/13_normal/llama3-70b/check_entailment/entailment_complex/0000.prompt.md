You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Vova has won $n$ trophies in different competitions. Each trophy is either golden or silver. The trophies are arranged in a row.

The beauty of the arrangement is the length of the longest subsegment consisting of golden trophies. Vova wants to swap two trophies (not necessarily adjacent ones) to make the arrangement as beautiful as possible — that means, to maximize the length of the longest such subsegment.

Help Vova! Tell him the maximum possible beauty of the arrangement if he is allowed to do at most one swap.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^5$) — the number of trophies.

The second line contains $n$ characters, each of them is either G or S. If the $i$-th character is G, then the $i$-th trophy is a golden one, otherwise it's a silver trophy. 


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible length of a subsegment of golden trophies, if Vova is allowed to do at most one swap.


-----Examples-----
Input
10
GGGSGGGSGG

Output
7

Input
4
GGGG

Output
4

Input
3
SSS

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example Vova has to swap trophies with indices $4$ and $10$. Thus he will obtain the sequence "GGGGGGGSGS", the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies is $7$. 

In the second example Vova can make no swaps at all. The length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence is $4$. 

In the third example Vova cannot do anything to make the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence greater than $0$.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and the second line of input is a string consisting of n characters, each of which is either 'G' or 'S', representing golden and silver trophies respectively.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    golden = [i for i, x in enumerate(s) if x == 'G']
    max_beauty = 0
    curr_beauty = 0
    left = 0
    for right in range(n):
        if s[right] == 'G':
            curr_beauty += 1
        else:
            max_beauty = max(max_beauty, curr_beauty)
            curr_beauty = 0
            while left < right and s[left] != 'G':
                left += 1
            if left < right:
                curr_beauty += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' or 'S', `golden` is a list of integers containing the indices of all characters in `s` that are equal to 'G', `max_beauty` is the length of the longest consecutive sequence of 'G's in `s`, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is the index of the last 'G' in the string `s`, or `n` if there are no 'G's, and `right` is `n`.
    max_beauty = max(max_beauty, curr_beauty)
    max_beauty_one_swap = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if s[i] == 'G' and s[i + 1] == 'S':
            beauty = 1
            for j in range(i - 1, -1, -1):
                if s[j] == 'G':
                    beauty += 1
                else:
                    break
            for j in range(i + 2, n):
                if s[j] == 'G':
                    beauty += 1
                else:
                    break
            max_beauty_one_swap = max(max_beauty_one_swap, beauty)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is a non-negative integer less than `n-1`, `j` is either `i + 2` or the position just after the last consecutive 'G' in the string starting from index `i + 1` (if the condition `s[i] == 'G' and s[i + 1] == 'S'` is true), `beauty` is the count of consecutive 'G's from `i - 1` to the first non-'G' character in the range from `i + 1` to `j`, `left` is the index of the last 'G' in the string `s`, or `n` if there are no 'G's, `right` is `n`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is 0, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum value among all `beauty` calculated during the loop iterations when `beauty` > 0, and `golden` is a list of indices of all characters in `s` that are equal to 'G'.
    print(max(max_beauty, max_beauty_one_swap))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' (golden) and 'S' (silver). It calculates two values: `max_beauty`, which is the length of the longest consecutive sequence of 'G's in the string, and `max_beauty_one_swap`, which is the maximum beauty (length of consecutive 'G's) achievable by swapping exactly one 'S' to 'G'. The function then prints the maximum of these two values. The function handles edge cases where there are no 'G's in the string.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
