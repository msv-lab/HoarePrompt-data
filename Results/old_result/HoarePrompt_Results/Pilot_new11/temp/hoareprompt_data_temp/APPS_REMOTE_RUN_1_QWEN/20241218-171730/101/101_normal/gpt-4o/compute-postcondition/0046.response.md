Postcondition: ***`screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string is of length `m` and consists of characters "." and "w". If `top` is `None`, `top` is set to `i + 1`, `bottom` is set to `i + 1`, `left` is set to `j`, and `right` is set to `j`. Otherwise, `top` is set to `i + 1` if `i >= top`, otherwise `top` remains unchanged; `bottom` is set to `i`; `left` is set to `j` if `j > left`, otherwise `left` remains unchanged; `right` is set to `j`.***
