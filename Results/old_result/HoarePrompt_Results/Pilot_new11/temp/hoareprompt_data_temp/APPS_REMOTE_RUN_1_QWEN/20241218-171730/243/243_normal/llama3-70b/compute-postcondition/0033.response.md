The code snippet `ans.append(n)` appends the value of `n` to the list `ans`. Since `ans` is not mentioned in the initial state, we assume it is a list that needs to be initialized before this operation. However, since the initial state does not provide information about `ans`, we can infer that after executing this line, `ans` will contain `n`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `ans.append(n)` appends the value of `n` to the list `ans`.
2. The initial state tells us that `n` is an integer, `count` is a non-negative integer, and `m` is an integer.
3. After the code execution, `ans` will be a list containing the value of `n`, and the values of `count` and `m` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer; `count` is a non-negative integer; `m` is an integer; `ans` is a list containing `n`.**
