`n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input split by spaces and converted to integers. The string representing the layout of the cells is read in the next line but not used in this code snippet. The initial conditions of `n` and `k` are preserved, but now they have specific integer values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1`, and the second line of input is a string of length `n` containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T'**
