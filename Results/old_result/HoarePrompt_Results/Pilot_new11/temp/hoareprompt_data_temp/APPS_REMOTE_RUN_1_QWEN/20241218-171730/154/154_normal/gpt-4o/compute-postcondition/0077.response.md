Postcondition: ***`t` must have at least two elements. If `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`, then `remaining_time` becomes 0, `subtasks_solved` is updated to `m + (r - m * s) // subtask_time + (remaining_time // subtask_time)`, and `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is updated to `remaining_time // subtask_time`. Otherwise, the values of `remaining_time`, `subtasks_solved`, and `max_subtasks_for_this_task` remain unchanged.***
