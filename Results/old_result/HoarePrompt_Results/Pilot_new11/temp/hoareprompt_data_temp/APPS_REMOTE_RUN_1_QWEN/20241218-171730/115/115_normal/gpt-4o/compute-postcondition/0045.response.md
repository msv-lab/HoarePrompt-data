Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2; `i` is `n - 2`; `j` is `n - 1`. If `A[i][j] == 1` and `A[i][j + 1] == 1` and `A[i + 1][j] == 1` and `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1`, then `B[i][j]` is 1; `B[i][j + 1]` is 1; `B[i + 1][j]` is 1; `B[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1; `operations` contains the element `(n - 1, n)`. Otherwise, the state of `B` and `operations` remains unchanged.***
