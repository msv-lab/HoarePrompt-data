Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. Although the annotated version of the code provides some insight into the functionality of the helper functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`), these functions do not address the core problem of finding three integer points that form a triangle with the specified area. 

The main logic of the program checks if \(nm\) is divisible by \(k\). If it is not, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it attempts to use the results from the helper functions to construct a triangle. However, the helper functions are not used correctly for the intended purpose. Specifically:

1. **GCD Calculation**: The GCD of \(n\) and \(m\) is calculated using `func_3`, which is derived from the extended Euclidean algorithm. This is useful for finding the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity, but it doesn't directly help in constructing the triangle points.

2. **Triangle Construction**: The program constructs points \((0, 0)\), \((0, n1 * m // g)\), and \((m1 * m // g, 0)\). These points are derived from the GCD but do not necessarily form a triangle with the required area. For the points to form a triangle with area \(\frac{nm}{k}\), the determinant method or a direct construction method would be needed, which is not implemented here.

Given that the annotated version clarifies the roles of the helper functions but does not rectify the core logic error, the program still does not meet the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment remains correct.
