Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to form a regular bracket sequence from the given strings. Specifically, the condition `if cnt3 > cnt1:` is insufficient to ensure that a regular bracket sequence can be formed. This condition only checks if there are more `")("` sequences than `"()"` sequences, but it does not account for the balance of opening and closing parentheses.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
2
3
4
```

In this case, `cnt1 = 1`, `cnt2 = 2`, `cnt3 = 3`, and `cnt4 = 4`. According to the problem description, we need to check if it's possible to arrange these strings to form a regular bracket sequence. However, the program incorrectly prints `0` because `cnt3 > cnt1`.

A correct solution would involve checking the overall balance of parentheses. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    (cnt1, cnt2, cnt3, cnt4) = map(int, [input() for _ in range(4)])
    
    # Calculate the total number of '(' and ')'
    open_count = cnt1 + cnt2 + cnt3 + cnt4 // 2
    close_count = cnt2 + cnt3 + cnt4 // 2
    
    # Check if the total number of '(' equals the total number of ')'
    if open_count != close_count:
        print(0)
    else:
        # Check if there are enough "()" to pair with remaining parentheses
        if cnt3 > cnt1:
            print(0)
        else:
            print(1)

func()
```

This corrected program first calculates the total number of opening and closing parentheses and checks if they are equal. It also ensures that the number of `")("` sequences does not exceed the number of `"()"` sequences.
