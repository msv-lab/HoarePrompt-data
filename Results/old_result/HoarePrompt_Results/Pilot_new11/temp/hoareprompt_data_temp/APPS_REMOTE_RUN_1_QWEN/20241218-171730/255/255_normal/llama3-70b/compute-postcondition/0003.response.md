Let's think through this step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop**: The loop involves `i`, `n`, and `ans`. The loop starts with `i` as 1 and increments `i` until `i` is less than `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Value of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` as 1.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop condition is `1 <= i < n`. For the loop to execute at least once, `i` should be incremented from 1 to `n-1`.

4. **Initial Value of `n`**: Given that `n` is an integer input value (1 <= n <= 500), for the loop to execute at all, `n` must be greater than 1.

5. **Initial Value of `ans`**: The initial value of `ans` is 1. This value doesn't directly affect the loop's ability to execute but may influence the loop body if it were to be specified.

Based on the above points, we need to adjust the following states:
- `i` should start at 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1 to allow the loop to execute at least once.
- `ans` remains 1, which does not need adjustment for the loop to execute.

Thus, the required state adjustments are:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `ans` is 1**
