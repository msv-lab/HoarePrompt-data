Let's break down the given for loop and determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Code:
```python
for b in range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Initial States:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\)
- `ways` is 0
- `a` is 1

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as the starting value of `b` (which is `a`) is less than or equal to the ending value of the range.
   - The ending value of the range is \((n - a) // 2 + 1\).
   - For the loop to start, `a` must be less than or equal to \((n - a) // 2 + 1\).

2. **Initial Values**:
   - `a` is 1.
   - Therefore, the condition becomes \(1 \leq (n - 1) // 2 + 1\).

3. **Simplifying the Condition**:
   - \((n - 1) // 2 + 1 \geq 1\)
   - Simplifying further: \((n - 1) // 2 \geq 0\)
   - Since \(n\) is a positive integer, this condition is always true because \((n - 1) // 2\) will be non-negative for any \(n \geq 1\).

4. **Ensuring Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will execute if \((n - 1) // 2 + 1 > 1\).
   - This simplifies to \((n - 1) // 2 > 0\).
   - Therefore, \(n - 1 > 0\) or \(n > 1\).

Given that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\) and \(n > 1\), the only additional constraint we need to consider is ensuring that \(n > 1\).

### Final State Adjustment:
- `total` is not relevant here since it is not used in the loop.
- `a` is 1.
- `ways` is 0.
- `n` must be greater than 1.

### Answer:
State: **`ways` is 0, `a` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
