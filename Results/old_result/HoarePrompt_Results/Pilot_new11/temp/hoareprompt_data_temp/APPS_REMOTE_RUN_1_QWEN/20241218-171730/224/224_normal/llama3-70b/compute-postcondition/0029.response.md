According to the code, the loop iterates over `j` in reverse order from `f_max_n` to `1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `dp[j]` for all `j` from `1` to `f_max_n` is the cumulative sum of `dp[0]` to `dp[j]` modulo `MOD`, `dp[0]` retains its original value, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is `k + 1`.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how the loop variable `j` changes and what conditions must be met for the loop to continue.

1. The loop starts with `j = f_max_n` and decrements `j` by 1 each iteration.
2. Since the loop has just completed an iteration, `j` must have been decremented from `f_max_n` to `f_max_n - 1`.
3. For the loop to continue, `j` must be greater than 0. Therefore, `j` should be `f_max_n - 1`.

Given these considerations, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `dp[j]` for all `j` from `1` to `f_max_n` remains the same as they were after the previous iteration.
- `dp[0]` retains its original value.
- `f_max_n` must still be greater than or equal to 1.
- `i` remains `k + 1`.

However, since `j` is now `f_max_n - 1`, the condition for the loop to continue is that `f_max_n - 1` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the updated state is:
State: **`dp[j]` for all `j` from `1` to `f_max_n` is the cumulative sum of `dp[0]` to `dp[j]` modulo `MOD`, `dp[0]` retains its original value, `f_max_n` must be greater than 1, `i` is `k + 1`**
