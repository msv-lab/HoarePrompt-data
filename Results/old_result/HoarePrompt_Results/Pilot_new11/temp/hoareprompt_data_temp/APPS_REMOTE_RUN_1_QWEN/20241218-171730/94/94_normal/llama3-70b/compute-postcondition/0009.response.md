Postcondition: ***`puzzle1` is a string of four characters, `puzzle2` is a string of four characters, `x2` is equal to the index of 'X' in `puzzle2`, `x1` is equal to the index of 'X' in `puzzle1`. If `puzzle1[i]` is 'X', then `x1` is equal to the value of `i`. If `puzzle1[i]` is not 'X', then the value of `x1` remains unchanged.***
