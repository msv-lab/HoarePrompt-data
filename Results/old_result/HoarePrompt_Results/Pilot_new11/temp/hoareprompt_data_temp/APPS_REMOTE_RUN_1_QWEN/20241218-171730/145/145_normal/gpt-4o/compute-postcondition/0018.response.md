`segment_count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `segment_count` is unchanged, and the conditions for `n` and `i` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is increased by 1, `i` is increased by 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to `i+1`.

Output State: **`current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is increased by 1, `i` is increased by 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to `i+1`**
