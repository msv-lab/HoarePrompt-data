Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the program correctly converts numbers from the golden system to their decimal equivalents. The function `func_1` iterates over the reversed string, correctly calculates the decimal value using the given formula \( q^2 = q + 1 \), and the main part of the program compares these decimal values accurately. The provided examples and the annotated version both confirm that the program behaves as expected and meets the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct.
