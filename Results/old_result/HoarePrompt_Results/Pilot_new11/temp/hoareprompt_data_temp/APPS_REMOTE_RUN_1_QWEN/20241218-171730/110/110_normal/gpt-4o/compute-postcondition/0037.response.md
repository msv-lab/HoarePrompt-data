The given code snippet does not perform any operation that would change the value of any variables. It simply calculates the value of `total_positions` based on the values of `n` and `r`, and `m` and `r`. Since no assignment or modification of variables is performed, the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`total_positions` is `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`**
