Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `A` contains `n` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(-10^3 \leq a_i \leq 10^3\), and `total_sum` is the sum of all elements in `A` and `total_sum` is 0. The condition of the if statement is that the current element `A[i]` is not equal to 0.***
