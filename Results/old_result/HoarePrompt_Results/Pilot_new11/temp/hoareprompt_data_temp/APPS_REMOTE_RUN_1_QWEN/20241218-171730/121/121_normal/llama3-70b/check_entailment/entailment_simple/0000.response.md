Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the program meets the criteria:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `n` representing the length of the genome.
   - It then reads a string `s` of length `n` which consists of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'.

2. **Count Calculation**:
   - A dictionary `count` is initialized to keep track of the occurrences of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' (excluding '?').
   - The program iterates over each character in `s` and increments the count for the corresponding nucleotide if the character is not '?'.

3. **Average Calculation**:
   - The average count (`avg`) of each nucleotide type is calculated as `n // 4`.

4. **Replacements**:
   - Another dictionary update loop ensures that the count of each nucleotide is adjusted to meet the requirement of having an equal number of each type of nucleotide.
   - A new string `res` is constructed by iterating through `s` and replacing '?' with the appropriate nucleotide based on the adjusted counts in `count`. The first available nucleotide is chosen to ensure each '?' is replaced.

5. **Validation and Output**:
   - After constructing `res`, the program checks if any of the nucleotide counts in `count` are still greater than 0.
   - If any count is greater than 0, the program prints "===" indicating it is not possible to satisfy the condition.
   - Otherwise, it prints the decoded string `res`.

### Key Points Addressed:

- **Decoding Requirement**: The program ensures that each nucleotide type ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') has an equal count by replacing '?' with the appropriate nucleotide, ensuring the final string `res` has balanced counts of each nucleotide type.
- **Multiple Solutions**: The program handles multiple possible solutions by selecting the first available nucleotide for each '?'.
- **Impossibility Handling**: If it is impossible to balance the nucleotide counts, the program correctly prints "===".

Given that the program meets all these requirements and handles all edge cases as described, it can be concluded that the program is correct according to the problem description.
