The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, the given code snippet does not show a loop. Since there is no loop, the `continue` statement does not affect the variables `sofas`, `j`, and `i`. The values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, `j` is 0, and `i` is equal to `j`.**
