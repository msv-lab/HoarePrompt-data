Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is an empty list, `i` is `n`, and `start` is the starting index of the last segment of 'G's found (which does not exist since `segments` is empty).***
