The value of `left` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `left` was 2, so after executing `left += 1`, `left` becomes 3. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' or 'S', `golden` is a list of integers containing the indices of all characters in `s` that are equal to 'G', `max_beauty` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is 3, `right` must be greater than 2 and `s[right]` is not 'G'.**
