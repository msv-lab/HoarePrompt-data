The given code simply prints 'YES' and does not change any variable values. Therefore, all the initial conditions remain unchanged after executing the print statement.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1`, `s` is a string of length `n` containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', `i` is `n`, `g` is the index of the first 'G' in `s` (or -1 if no 'G'), `t` is the index of the first 'T' in `s` (or -1 if no 'T'), and both `g` and `t` are not equal to -1, `abs(t - g)` is divisible by `k`, and for every integer `i` from 0 to `abs(t - g) // k`, the character at index `(g + i * k) % n` in `s` is not '#'**
