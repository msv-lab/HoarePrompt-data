The code `remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost` updates the value of `remaining_after_cars`. From the initial state, we know that `remaining_after_houses` is greater than 0 and `(remaining_after_cars % computer_cost != 0)`. After executing the code, `remaining_after_cars` is updated to `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `remaining_after_houses` is greater than 0.
- `remaining_after_cars` is updated to `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`.
- The condition `(remaining_after_cars % computer_cost != 0)` still holds true.

Output State: **`remaining_after_houses` is greater than 0; `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`; `(remaining_after_cars % computer_cost != 0)`**
