`queue.append(neighbor)` adds the `neighbor` to the right end of the `queue`. The initial state mentions that `queue` is not empty and includes the neighbor node if the in-degree of `neighbor` is 0, but the code does not affect the in-degree condition directly. The `count` and `node` variables remain unchanged as they are not involved in this operation. Therefore, the `queue` is updated by appending the `neighbor`.

Output State: **`queue` includes the original elements plus `neighbor` on the right end, `count` is the total number of nodes whose in-degree became 0 plus 1, `node` is the node that was dequeued from the left side of the queue, and `neighbor` is a neighbor of `node`.**
