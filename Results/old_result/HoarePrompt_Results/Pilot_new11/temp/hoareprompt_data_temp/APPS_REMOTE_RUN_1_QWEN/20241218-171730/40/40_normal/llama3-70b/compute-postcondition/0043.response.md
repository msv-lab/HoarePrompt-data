Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `i` is a valid starting index such that `i + 2` is within bounds of `s`.
   - `s` is a non-empty string.
   - `n` is greater than `i + 2`.
   - `i + 2` must be less than or equal to `n + 1`.
   - `max_len` is the maximum length of any non-palindromic substring found in `s` from index `i` to any valid end index `j` where `i + 3 <= j <= n`.
   - `max_len` is updated to be the maximum of its original value and the length of the substring from index `i` to `j-1` where `substr` is the substring of `s` from index `i` to index `j-1` and `j` is `i + 2`.
   - If the substring is not a palindrome, `max_len` is updated accordingly.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs for `j` in the range from `i + 1` to `n + 1`.

3. **Key Points to Consider**:
   - For the loop to continue executing, `j` must be less than or equal to `n + 1`.
   - Since `j` starts at `i + 1`, the loop will continue as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n + 1`.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was `i + 2`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to `i + 3`.
   - Therefore, `n` must still be greater than `i + 2`, but now `j` is `i + 3`.

5. **Updated States**:
   - `i` remains the same.
   - `s` remains the same.
   - `n` must still be greater than `i + 2` but now `j` is `i + 3`.
   - `max_len` is updated based on the new substring from `i` to `j-1` (which is `i` to `i + 2`).

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is a valid starting index such that `i + 2` is within bounds of `s`, `s` is a non-empty string, `n` is greater than `i + 2`, and `i + 2` must be less than or equal to `n + 1`; `max_len` is the maximum length of any non-palindromic substring found in `s` from index `i` to any valid end index `j` where `i + 3 <= j <= n`, and it is updated to be the maximum of its original value and the length of the substring from index `i` to `j-1` where `j` is `i + 3`.**
