Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after all iterations have completed.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 30\).
- `L` is an integer such that \(1 \leq L \leq 10^9\).
- `costs` is a list of \(n\) integers where each \(cost_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq cost_i \leq 10^9\).
- `max_cost` is 10.
- `dp` is a list of 31 integers where each element is the minimum of its original value (10) and the corresponding element in `c`, where `c` is a list of \(n+1\) integers (the first \(n\) integers are the same as in `costs` and the last integer is 10).

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(1, 31):
    dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] * 2)
```

### Analysis:
The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = 30`. For each iteration, the value of `dp[i]` is updated to be the minimum of its original value (`dp[i]`) and twice the value of `dp[i - 1]`.

#### Key Observations:
1. **Initial Values**: Initially, `dp[i]` is set to 10 for all \(i\).
2. **Effect of Loop**: Each iteration updates `dp[i]` to be the minimum of its current value and \(2 \times dp[i - 1]\). This means that for each `i`, `dp[i]` will eventually become \(2^k \times \text{initial value of } dp[1]\) where \(k\) is the number of iterations where `dp[i - 1] < dp[i]`.

### Final State After All Iterations:
Since the loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = 30`, we need to consider the effect of the loop on `dp[1]` through `dp[30]`.

- For `i = 1`: No change because there is no previous value to compare with.
- For `i = 2`: `dp[2]` becomes `min(dp[2], dp[1] * 2)`.
- For `i = 3`: `dp[3]` becomes `min(dp[3], dp[2] * 2)`, and so on.

After 30 iterations, each `dp[i]` will be updated based on the previous value `dp[i - 1]` and the factor of \(2^{i-1}\).

Thus, after all 30 iterations, the value of `dp[i]` for any \(i\) will be \(2^{i-1} \times \text{initial value of } dp[1]\), which is 10.

### Output State:
- `i` will be 30.
- `dp[i]` for any \(i\) will be \(2^{i-1} \times 10\).

Since the loop runs for 30 iterations, the final value of `dp[i]` for any \(i\) will be \(2^{i-1} \times 10\).

**Output State:**
Output State: **`i` is 30, `dp[i]` is \(2^{i-1} \times 10` for any \(i\), `dp` is a list of 31 integers where each element is \(2^{i-1} \times 10\), `costs`, `max_cost`, and `c` retain their original values.**
