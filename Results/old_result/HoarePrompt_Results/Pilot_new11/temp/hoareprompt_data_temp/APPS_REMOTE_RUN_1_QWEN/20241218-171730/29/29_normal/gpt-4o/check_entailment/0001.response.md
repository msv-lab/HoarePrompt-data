Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where there are no example tests (i.e., `e` is 0). In such a scenario, the program will still attempt to rename files to ensure that the filenames are consecutive integers starting from 1, which is unnecessary and incorrect since there are no example tests to begin with.

For instance, consider the following input:
```
3
1 0
2 0
3 0
```

The expected output should be:
```
0
```
since there are no example tests, and no renaming is needed.

However, the current implementation will generate some unnecessary moves, leading to incorrect behavior. Therefore, the program is not correct for all potential cases.
