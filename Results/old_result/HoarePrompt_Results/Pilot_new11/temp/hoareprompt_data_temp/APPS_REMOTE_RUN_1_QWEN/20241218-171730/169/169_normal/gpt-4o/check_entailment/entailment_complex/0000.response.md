Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n` followed by a string `s` of length `n` containing only '-' and '+'. This matches the problem description perfectly.

2. **Processing Operations**: 
   - The program initializes a variable `stones` to 0.
   - It then iterates over each character in the string `s`.
   - For each '+' character, it increments the `stones` count by 1.
   - For each '-' character, it decrements the `stones` count by 1, ensuring it does not go below 0 (using `max(0, stones - 1)`).

3. **Output**: The program prints the final value of `stones`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the string `s` starts with a '-', ensuring the `stones` count does not go below 0.
   - The program correctly processes all '-' and '+' characters in `s`.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program always computes the minimal possible number of stones that can be left in the pile after performing the operations. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
