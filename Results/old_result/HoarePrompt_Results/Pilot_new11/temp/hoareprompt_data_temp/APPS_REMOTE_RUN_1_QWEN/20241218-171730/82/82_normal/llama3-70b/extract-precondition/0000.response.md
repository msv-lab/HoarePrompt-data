Precondition: **a and b are positive integers such that \(1 \le a, b \le 10^9\).** 

Note: The function `func_2(a, b)` provided in the program seems to be a part of the solution, but it does not fully address the problem statement. It uses another function `func_1(a, b)` which is not provided here. The role of `func_1` in finding the smallest non-negative integer \(k\) is unclear from the given information. The main goal described in the problem statement involves finding the least common multiple (LCM) and identifying the smallest \(k\), which is not directly addressed by the provided function `func_2`.
