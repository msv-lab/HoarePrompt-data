The code `beauty += 1` increments the value of `beauty` by 1. Given the initial state, `beauty` is incremented by 1 if the character at index 0 of `s` is 'G', otherwise it remains unchanged. Since the code simply increments `beauty` regardless of the condition (as the condition is already checked before this line), `beauty` will be incremented by 1. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`i` is at least 2, `s` is a string with at least `i - 2` characters, `beauty` is incremented by 1, `j` is 0.**
