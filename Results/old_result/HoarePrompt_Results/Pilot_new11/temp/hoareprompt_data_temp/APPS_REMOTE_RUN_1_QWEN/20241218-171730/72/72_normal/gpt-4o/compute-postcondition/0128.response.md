The code `row -= 2` decrements the value of `row` by 2. Given the initial state where `row` is `n - 1`, after the decrement, `row` becomes `(n - 1) - 2` or `n - 3`. The other variables (`col`, `m`, `sergei_questions`, `max_questions`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`col` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `sergei_questions` is increased by 1 if the current value of `row` is equal to `x` and the current value of `col` is equal to `y`, `max_questions` is increased by 1 if the current value of `row` is equal to `x` and the current value of `col` is equal to `y`, `row` is `n - 3`**
