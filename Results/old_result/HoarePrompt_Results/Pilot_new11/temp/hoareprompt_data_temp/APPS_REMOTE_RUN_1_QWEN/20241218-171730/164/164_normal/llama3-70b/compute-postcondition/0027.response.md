Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1`, `s` is a string of length `n` containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', `i` is `n`, `g` is the index of the first 'G' in `s` (or -1 if no 'G'), `t` is the index of the first 'T' in `s` (or -1 if no 'T'), and both `g` and `t` are not equal to -1, `abs(t - g) % k != 0` or there exists at least one index `j` in the range `[0, abs(t - g) // k]` such that `s[(g + j * k) % n] == '#'`**
