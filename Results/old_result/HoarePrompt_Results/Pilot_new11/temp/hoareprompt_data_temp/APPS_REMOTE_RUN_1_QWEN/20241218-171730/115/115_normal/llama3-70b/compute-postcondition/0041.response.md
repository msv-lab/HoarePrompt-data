Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is a non-negative integer with at least 3
   - `m` is an integer such that \(2 \le m \le 50\)
   - `A` is a matrix of size `n` by `m` where each element is either 0 or 1
   - `ops` is a list containing all the tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for which any of the conditions `A[i][j] == 1`, `A[i + 1][j] == 1`, `A[i][j + 1] == 1`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1` are satisfied
   - `j` is in the range `[0, m - 2]` and remains unchanged otherwise

2. **Loop Condition**: The for loop iterates over `range(n - 1)`. This means the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 2`.

3. **Current Iteration**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n - 1`. Therefore, the next valid value for `i` is 2.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since the loop is about to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it `2`.
   - The variable `j` remains unchanged as per the problem statement.
   - The condition for `n` and `m` remains the same because they are not modified within the loop body.
   - The matrix `A` and the list `ops` remain unchanged as well, since the loop body is omitted and no modifications are specified.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is 2
- `n` is a non-negative integer with at least 3
- `m` is an integer such that \(2 \le m \le 50\)
- `A` is a matrix of size `n` by `m` where each element is either 0 or 1
- `ops` is a list containing all the tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for which any of the conditions `A[i][j] == 1`, `A[i + 1][j] == 1`, `A[i][j + 1] == 1`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1` are satisfied
- `j` is in the range `[0, m - 2]` and remains unchanged otherwise

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a non-negative integer with at least 3, `m` is an integer such that \(2 \le m \le 50\), `A` is a matrix of size `n` by `m` where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` is a list containing all the tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for which any of the conditions `A[i][j] == 1`, `A[i + 1][j] == 1`, `A[i][j + 1] == 1`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1` are satisfied, `j` is in the range `[0, m - 2]` and remains unchanged otherwise**
