The code `min_k = candidate` assigns the value of `candidate` to the variable `min_k`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is `a`, `b` is `b`, `diff` is `diff`, `min_lcm` is `func_2((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate, (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate)`, `min_k` is `candidate`, `k` is `k`, `current_lcm` is `func_2((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate, (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate)**
