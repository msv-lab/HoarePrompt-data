`need_y` is assigned the value `True`. The values of `marks`, `i`, `j`, `need_x`, and `y` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the `need_x` remains unchanged if `marks[j] - marks[i] != y`, and it would only change if the condition `marks[j] - marks[i] == y` was met, but that is not indicated in the given code.

Output State: **`marks` is a list of integers, `i` and `j` are indices into the list `marks`, `need_x` is `True` if `marks[j] - marks[i] == x`, `need_y` is `True`, and there is no change to `need_x` if `marks[j] - marks[i] != y`.**
