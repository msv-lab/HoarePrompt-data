Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not handle the case where the list `meats` is empty, which should result in an immediate return of `False` in `func_2`. Additionally, the code assumes that `meats` is always a non-empty list and `K` is within the bounds of the list length, but it does not explicitly check these conditions. 

To illustrate, consider the case where `N = 0` and `K = 0`. In this scenario, the list `meats` would be empty, and the program should immediately return `False`. However, the provided code does not account for this edge case, leading to potential errors or incorrect behavior. Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
