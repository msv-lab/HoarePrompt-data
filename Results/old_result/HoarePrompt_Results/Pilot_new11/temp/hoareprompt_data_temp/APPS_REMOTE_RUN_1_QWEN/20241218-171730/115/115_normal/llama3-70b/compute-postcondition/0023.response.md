Let's think through this step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variable and Range**: The loop variable is `j`, and the loop runs from `0` to `m - 2` (since `range(m - 1)` generates values from `0` to `m - 2`).

2. **Initial State of Variables**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is a non-negative integer with at least 3
   - `m` is an integer such that \(2 \le m \le 50\)
   - `A` is an `n` by `m` matrix where each element is either 0 or 1
   - `ops` is a list of tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for all valid indices `j` such that certain conditions involving `A` are met

3. **Loop Execution Condition**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `m - 1`.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - We need to ensure that the loop can start executing, which means `j` should be able to enter the loop initially. Since `j` starts at `0` and the loop runs up to `m - 2`, `j` needs to be in the range `[0, m - 2]`.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `m` is greater than 1 (which is already given since \(2 \le m \le 50\)).

Given these points, the necessary adjustments to the initial state to ensure the loop can execute are:

- `i` is 1
- `n` is a non-negative integer with at least 3
- `m` is an integer such that \(2 \le m \le 50\) and `m` must be greater than 1 (which is already within the given range)
- `A` is an `n` by `m` matrix where each element is either 0 or 1
- `ops` is a list of tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for all valid indices `j` such that certain conditions involving `A` are met

Since `m` is already constrained to be at least 2, no additional constraints are needed for `m` itself.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a non-negative integer with at least 3, `m` is an integer such that \(2 \le m \le 50\), `A` is a matrix of size `n` by `m` where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` is a list containing tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for all valid indices `j` such that certain conditions involving `A` are met, `j` must be in the range `[0, m - 2]` initially**
