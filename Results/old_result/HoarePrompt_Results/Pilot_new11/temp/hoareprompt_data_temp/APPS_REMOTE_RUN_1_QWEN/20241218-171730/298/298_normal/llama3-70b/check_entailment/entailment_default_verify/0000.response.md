Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate because the provided functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`) are unrelated to solving the problem of finding three integer points that form a triangle with the specified area. The functions deal with the greatest common divisor and the extended Euclidean algorithm, which are not applicable to the task at hand. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description and cannot produce the correct output for any valid input. The output hints further confirm that these functions do not contribute to solving the problem, as they do not involve generating points or calculating areas.
