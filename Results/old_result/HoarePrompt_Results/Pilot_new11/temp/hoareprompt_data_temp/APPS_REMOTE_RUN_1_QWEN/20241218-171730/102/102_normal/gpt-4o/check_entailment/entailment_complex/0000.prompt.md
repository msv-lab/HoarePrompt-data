You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Vasya has n burles. One bottle of Ber-Cola costs a burles and one Bars bar costs b burles. He can buy any non-negative integer number of bottles of Ber-Cola and any non-negative integer number of Bars bars.

Find out if it's possible to buy some amount of bottles of Ber-Cola and Bars bars and spend exactly n burles.

In other words, you should find two non-negative integers x and y such that Vasya can buy x bottles of Ber-Cola and y Bars bars and x·a + y·b = n or tell that it's impossible.


-----Input-----

First line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10 000 000) — amount of money, that Vasya has.

Second line contains single integer a (1 ≤ a ≤ 10 000 000) — cost of one bottle of Ber-Cola.

Third line contains single integer b (1 ≤ b ≤ 10 000 000) — cost of one Bars bar.


-----Output-----

If Vasya can't buy Bars and Ber-Cola in such a way to spend exactly n burles print «NO» (without quotes).

Otherwise in first line print «YES» (without quotes). In second line print two non-negative integers x and y — number of bottles of Ber-Cola and number of Bars bars Vasya should buy in order to spend exactly n burles, i.e. x·a + y·b = n. If there are multiple answers print any of them.

Any of numbers x and y can be equal 0.

-----Note-----

In first example Vasya can buy two bottles of Ber-Cola and one Bars bar. He will spend exactly 2·2 + 1·3 = 7 burles.

In second example Vasya can spend exactly n burles multiple ways:   buy two bottles of Ber-Cola and five Bars bars;  buy four bottles of Ber-Cola and don't buy Bars bars;  don't buy Ber-Cola and buy 10 Bars bars. 

In third example it's impossible to but Ber-Cola and Bars bars in order to spend exactly n burles.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, a, and b are integers such that 1 <= n, a, b <= 10 000 000.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    for x in range(n // a + 1):
        if (n - x * a) % b == 0:
            y = (n - x * a) // b
            print('YES')
            print(x, y)
            return
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Let's analyze the given loop step-by-step to determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished.
    #
    #### Initial State
    #- `n` is an integer obtained from input.
    #- `a` is an integer obtained from input.
    #- `b` is an integer obtained from input.
    #
    #### Loop Analysis
    #The loop runs for `x` in the range `n // a + 1`. For each iteration, it checks if \((n - x * a) \% b == 0\). If this condition is met, it sets \(y\) to \((n - x * a) // b\) and prints 'YES' followed by the values of \(x\) and \(y\), then returns. If the condition is not met, the loop continues to the next iteration.
    #
    #### Key Observations
    #1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will only execute if \((n - x * a) \% b == 0\) is true for some \(x\) in the range \(0\) to \(n // a\).
    #2. **Return Statement**: The loop returns immediately when the condition is satisfied, so the loop can only execute once.
    #3. **No Further Iteration**: Once the loop finds a valid pair \((x, y)\), it exits without further iterations.
    #
    #### Output State After All Iterations
    #
    ##### Case 1: Loop Executes
    #- If the loop executes, it means there exists an integer \(x\) such that \((n - x * a) \% b == 0\). When this happens:
    #  - \(y = (n - x * a) // b\)
    #  - The function prints 'YES' and the values of \(x\) and \(y\)
    #  - The function returns
    #
    #Since the loop only executes once, the values of \(n\), \(a\), and \(b\) do not change.
    #
    ##### Case 2: Loop Does Not Execute
    #- If the loop does not execute, it means for all \(x\) in the range \(0\) to \(n // a\), the condition \((n - x * a) \% b == 0\) is false.
    #- In this case, the function does not print 'YES' or any values and simply returns without changing the values of \(n\), \(a\), and \(b\).
    #
    #### Final Output State
    #
    #- If the loop executes at least once, the function will have printed 'YES' and the values of \(x\) and \(y\), and returned. Hence, \(n\), \(a\), and \(b\) retain their original values.
    #- If the loop does not execute, the function simply returns without printing or changing the values of \(n\), \(a\), and \(b\).
    #
    #Thus, the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:
    #
    #**Output State: **`n` is an integer obtained from input, `a` is an integer obtained from input, `b` is an integer obtained from input. The function will either print 'YES' along with the values of `x` and `y` and return, or it will return without any print statements and the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
    print('NO')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes no parameters and returns `None`. It reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from the standard input, where `1 <= n, a, b <= 10,000,000`. The function then iterates through a range determined by `n // a + 1` and checks if `(n - x * a) % b == 0` for each `x`. If such an `x` is found, it calculates `y = (n - x * a) // b`, prints 'YES' followed by the values of `x` and `y`, and returns. If no such `x` is found, the function prints 'NO' and returns. In all cases, the function ultimately returns `None`.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
