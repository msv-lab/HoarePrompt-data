`n` is initially `n - 2`. The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Since `n` is derived from itself, it remains as `n - 2`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is `n - 2`; `i` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is `n - 2`; `i` is increased by 1**
