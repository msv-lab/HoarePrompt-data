According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the list `additional_marks`. The loop iterates over each element `j` in `additional_marks`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `additional_marks` is a non-empty list.
- If `i + j` is not in `marks` and satisfies `i + j <= l`, then `additional_marks` is updated to include `i + j`. Otherwise, `additional_marks` remains unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that there are still elements in `additional_marks` that satisfy the condition inside the loop.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Check if `additional_marks` is non-empty**: This is necessary because the loop requires at least one element to iterate over.
2. **Condition inside the loop**: The loop will check if `i + j` is not in `marks` and satisfies `i + j <= l`. If this condition is met, `additional_marks` is updated, but if not, it remains unchanged.

Since we are starting the next iteration, we need to consider the scenario where the condition inside the loop is true for at least one element in `additional_marks`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Initial State**: `additional_marks` is a non-empty list.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute, there must be at least one element `j` in `additional_marks` such that `i + j` is not in `marks` and `i + j <= l`.

If the condition is true for at least one element, `additional_marks` will be updated to include `i + j`, and the loop will continue.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute one more time, `additional_marks` must still contain at least one element that satisfies the condition.

**State:**
- `additional_marks` is a non-empty list.
- There exists at least one element `j` in `additional_marks` such that `i + j` is not in `marks` and `i + j <= l`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`additional_marks` is a non-empty list, and there exists at least one element `j` in `additional_marks` such that `i + j` is not in `marks` and `i + j <= l`**.
