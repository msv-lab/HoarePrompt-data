`b` is multiplied by 2. The original value of `b` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 10, so the new value of `b` will be twice its original value. The value of `a` is now `a_original * 3`, and `years` remains unchanged at 0.

Output State: **`a` is `a_original * 3`, `b` is twice its original value and within the range of 2 to 20; `years` is 0.**
