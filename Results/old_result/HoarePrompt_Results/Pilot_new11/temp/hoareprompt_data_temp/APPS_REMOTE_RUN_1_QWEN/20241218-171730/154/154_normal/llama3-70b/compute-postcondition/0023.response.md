`dp[i][j]` is assigned the maximum value between `dp[i][j]` and `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`. Given the initial conditions:
- `i` is 1
- `M` is greater than or equal to 1
- `dp[1][j]` is equal to `dp[1][j-1]`
- `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`

Since `i` is 1, `t[i - 1]` is equivalent to `t[0]`. The condition `j >= t[0]` means that `dp[1][j]` is only considered for values of `j` that are greater than or equal to `t[0]`.

The line of code updates `dp[1][j]` based on the maximum value between its current value and `dp[0][j - t[0]] + 1`. However, since `i - 1` is 0, we are essentially updating `dp[1][j]` based on `dp[0][j - t[0]] + 1`.

Given the initial condition that `dp[1][j]` is equal to `dp[1][j-1]`, this means `dp[1][j]` is unchanged unless `dp[0][j - t[0]] + 1` is greater than `dp[1][j]`.

If `dp[0][j - t[0]]` is less than `dp[1][j]`, the value of `dp[1][j]` remains unchanged. If `dp[0][j - t[0]]` is greater than or equal to `dp[1][j]`, then `dp[1][j]` is updated to `dp[0][j - t[0]] + 1`.

Since the exact value of `dp[0][j - t[0]]` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact new value of `dp[1][j]`. However, we know that if `dp[0][j - t[0]]` is greater than or equal to `dp[1][j]`, `dp[1][j]` is updated to `dp[0][j - t[0]] + 1`.

Output State: **`i` is 1; `M` is greater than or equal to 1; `dp[1][j]` is equal to `max(dp[1][j], dp[0][j - t[0]] + 1)` if `dp[0][j - t[0]]` is greater than or equal to `dp[1][j]`; `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`**
