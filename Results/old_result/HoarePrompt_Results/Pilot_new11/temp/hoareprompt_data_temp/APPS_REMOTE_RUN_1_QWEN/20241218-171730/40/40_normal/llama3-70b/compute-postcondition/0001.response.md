The code `n = len(s)` calculates the length of the string `s` and assigns it to the variable `n`. The value of `s` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 50 characters; `n` is the length of `s`.**
