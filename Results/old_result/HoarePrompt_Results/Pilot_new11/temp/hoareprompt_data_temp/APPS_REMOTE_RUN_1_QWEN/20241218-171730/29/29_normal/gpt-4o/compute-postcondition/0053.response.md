Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `examples[i]` is "2"
   - `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 2`
   - `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`
   - `n` must be at least 1
   - `moves` is a list containing the strings `'move 2 {temp_counter}'` and `'move 2 2'`

2. **Loop Condition Analysis:**
   - The loop runs for each element in `examples`.
   - The loop condition is `for i in range(len(examples))`.

3. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.

4. **Next Iteration Check:**
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 2.

5. **Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will execute if `i < len(examples)`.
   - Since `i` is currently 1, the loop can still execute because `1 < len(examples)` as long as `len(examples)` is at least 2.

6. **Adjusting States:**
   - `i` will be updated to 2.
   - `examples[i]` is checked, and if it is not "2", it is set to "2". Since `i` is now 2, we need to check `examples[2]`.
   - `temp_counter` remains the same as `2 * n + 2`.
   - `str(temp_counter)` remains in `files_set`.
   - `n` remains at least 1.
   - `moves` remains the same list as before: `['move 2 {temp_counter}', 'move 2 2']`.

7. **Final Adjusted States:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `examples[i]` is "2" (if `examples[2]` is not already "2", it will be set to "2").
   - `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 2`.
   - `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`.
   - `n` must be at least 1.
   - `moves` is `['move 2 {temp_counter}', 'move 2 2']`.

Therefore, the adjusted states for the start of the next iteration are:

State: **`i` is 2, `examples[i]` is "2", `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 2`, `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`, `n` must be at least 1, and `moves` is a list containing the strings `'move 2 {temp_counter}'` and `'move 2 2'`.**
