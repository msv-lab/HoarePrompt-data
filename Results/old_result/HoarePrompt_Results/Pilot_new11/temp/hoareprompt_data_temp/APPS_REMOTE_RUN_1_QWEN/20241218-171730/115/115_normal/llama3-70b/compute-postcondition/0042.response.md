Let's analyze the given program state and the for loop step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given States:
- `i` is 2
- `n` is a non-negative integer with at least 3 (i.e., `n >= 3`)
- `m` is an integer such that \(2 \le m \le 50\)
- `A` is a matrix of size `n` by `m` where each element is either 0 or 1
- `ops` is a list containing all the tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for which any of the conditions `A[i][j] == 1`, `A[i + 1][j] == 1`, `A[i][j + 1] == 1`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1` are satisfied
- `j` is in the range `[0, m - 2]` and remains unchanged otherwise

### For Loop:
```python
for j in range(m - 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initialization and Range of `j`:**
   - The loop variable `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 until it reaches `m - 1`.
   - Since `j` is initialized to 0 and remains within the range `[0, m - 2]`, the loop will execute as long as `m` is at least 2 (which is already guaranteed by the condition \(2 \le m \le 50\)).

2. **Matrix `A` and Conditions for `ops`:**
   - The list `ops` contains tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` based on specific conditions involving `A`.
   - These conditions do not affect the loop execution directly but influence what values `ops` might contain. The loop itself will still execute regardless of the contents of `ops`.

### Conclusion:
Given that `j` is in the range `[0, m - 2]` and `m` is at least 2, the loop will execute as long as `m` is at least 2, which is already satisfied. Therefore, no additional adjustments to the initial states are necessary for the loop to execute.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a non-negative integer with at least 3 (i.e., `n >= 3`), `m` is an integer such that \(2 \le m \le 50\), `A` is a matrix of size `n` by `m` where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` is a list containing all the tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for which any of the conditions `A[i][j] == 1`, `A[i + 1][j] == 1`, `A[i][j + 1] == 1`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1` are satisfied, `j` is in the range `[0, m - 2]` and remains unchanged otherwise**.

The loop will execute without needing further adjustments to these states.
