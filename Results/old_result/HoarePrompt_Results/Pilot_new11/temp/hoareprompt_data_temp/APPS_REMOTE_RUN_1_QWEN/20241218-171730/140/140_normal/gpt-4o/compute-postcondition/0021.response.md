`in_degree[v]` is incremented by 1. According to the initial state, `in_degree[v]` is already incremented by 1 due to the vertex being iterated over. Therefore, after executing the line of code, `in_degree[v]` will be incremented by 1 again.

Output State: **`graph` must have at least one key remaining, `in_degree` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex and the corresponding value is the total number of incoming edges for that vertex incremented by the number of times the vertex was iterated over plus 1, `u` is a vertex such that `graph[u]` is not empty and contains at least one vertex, and `v` is a vertex in `graph[u]`.**
