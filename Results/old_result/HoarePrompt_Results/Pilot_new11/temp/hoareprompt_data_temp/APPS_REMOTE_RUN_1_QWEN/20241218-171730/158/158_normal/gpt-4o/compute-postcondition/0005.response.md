The code `print(total_fruits)` simply prints the value of `total_fruits`, which was previously calculated as `7 * max_lemons`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not affected by this line of code. The output of the program is the value of `total_fruits`, but the values of the variables themselves do not change.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is an integer input from the user within the range 1 to 1000.
- `b` is an integer input from the user.
- `c` is an integer input from the user.
- `max_lemons` is the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.
- `total_fruits` is `7 * max_lemons`.

After executing the code, the value of `total_fruits` is printed, but the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `max_lemons`, and `total_fruits` remain in their respective states.

Output State: **`a` is an integer input from the user within the range 1 to 1000, `b` is an integer input from the user, `c` is an integer input from the user, `max_lemons` is the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, `total_fruits` is `7 * max_lemons`, and `total_fruits` is printed.**
