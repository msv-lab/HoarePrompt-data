#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of simple cakes, and cakes is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two positive integers (r_i, h_i) representing the radius and height of the i-th cake respectively.
def func_1(n, cakes):
    volumes = [(math.pi * r * r * h) for r, h in cakes]
    dp = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i] = volumes[i]
        
        for j in range(i):
            if volumes[j] < volumes[i]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + volumes[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State:
    return max(dp)
    #The program returns the maximum value from the list or array 'dp'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` representing the number of simple cakes and a list of tuples `cakes`, where each tuple contains two positive integers (radius and height) representing the dimensions of each cake. It calculates the volume of each cake and then uses dynamic programming to find the maximum value that can be obtained by selecting a subset of the cakes such that no two selected cakes have overlapping volumes. The function returns the maximum value from the list or array `dp`. Potential edge cases include when `n` is 0 (returning 0) or when the list `cakes` is empty (also returning 0).

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of simple cakes, and cakes is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing the radius and height of the i-th cake, respectively.
def func_2():
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    cakes = [(int(data[2 * i + 1]), int(data[2 * i + 2])) for i in range(n)]
    result = func_1(n, cakes)
    print(f'{result:.6f}')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads an integer `n` and a list of tuples `cakes` from standard input, where each tuple contains the radius and height of a cake. It then calls another function `func_1` with these inputs and prints the result formatted to six decimal places. The function assumes that the input format is correct and that the list `cakes` has the correct structure (i.e., each element is a tuple containing exactly two integers). If the input does not conform to this structure, the behavior is undefined.
