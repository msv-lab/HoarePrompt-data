You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Piegirl got bored with binary, decimal and other integer based counting systems. Recently she discovered some interesting properties about number $q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2}$, in particular that q^2 = q + 1, and she thinks it would make a good base for her new unique system. She called it "golden system". In golden system the number is a non-empty string containing 0's and 1's as digits. The decimal value of expression a_0a_1...a_{n} equals to $\sum_{i = 0}^{n} a_{i} \cdot q^{n - i}$.

Soon Piegirl found out that this system doesn't have same properties that integer base systems do and some operations can not be performed on it. She wasn't able to come up with a fast way of comparing two numbers. She is asking for your help.

Given two numbers written in golden system notation, determine which of them has larger decimal value.


-----Input-----

Input consists of two lines — one for each number. Each line contains non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters. The length of each string does not exceed 100000.


-----Output-----

Print ">" if the first number is larger, "<" if it is smaller and "=" if they are equal.


-----Examples-----
Input
1000
111

Output
<

Input
00100
11

Output
=

Input
110
101

Output
>



-----Note-----

In the first example first number equals to $((\sqrt{5} + 1) / 2)^{3} \approx 1.618033988^{3} \approx 4.236$, while second number is approximately 1.618033988^2 + 1.618033988 + 1 ≈ 5.236, which is clearly a bigger number.

In the second example numbers are equal. Each of them is  ≈ 2.618.
Program:
```
s1 = input().strip()
s2 = input().strip()
value1 = func_1(s1)
value2 = func_1(s2)
if value1 > value2:
    print('>')
elif value1 < value2:
    print('<')
else:
    print('=')

def func_1(s):
    q = (5 ** 0.5 + 1) / 2
    value = 0
    n = len(s)
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '1':
            value += q ** (n - i - 1)
    return value


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the golden system comparison. The issue lies in the `func_1` function, which only calculates the approximate decimal value of the given golden number but does not handle the full comparison logic required. Specifically, the function only sums the contributions of '1's in the string, ignoring the positions of the '0's, which are necessary for a correct comparison.

For example, consider the inputs:
- `s1 = "101"` (which should be evaluated as \(q^2 + q \approx 4.236\))
- `s2 = "11"` (which should be evaluated as \(q + q \approx 3.236\))

The current implementation would incorrectly evaluate both as equal since it only sums the contributions of '1's without considering their positions. A correct implementation would need to evaluate the full sum \(\sum_{i=0}^{n} a_i \cdot q^{n-i}\) for both strings and compare these values accurately.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
s1 = input().strip()
s2 = input().strip()
value1 = func_1(s1)
value2 = func_1(s2)
if value1 > value2:
    print('>')
elif value1 < value2:
    print('<')
else:
    print('=')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters, representing a number in the golden system.
def func_1(s):
    q = (5 ** 0.5 + 1) / 2
    value = 0
    n = len(s)
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '1':
            value += q ** (n - i - 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a non-empty string, `q` is 5, `value` is the sum of `5^(n - i - 1)` for each `i` where `s[i]` is '1', `n` is the length of `s`.
    return value
    #The program returns the sum of \(5^{n - i - 1}\) for each \(i\) where \(s[i]\) is '1' and \(n\) is the length of string \(s\)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` which is a non-empty binary string representing a number in the golden system. It calculates and returns the sum of \(5^{n - i - 1}\) for each position `i` where `s[i]` is '1', and `n` is the length of the string `s`. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the annotations or the code itself, but we can infer that the function assumes `s` is always a valid non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1'. The function iterates over each character in `s`, and if the character is '1', it adds the corresponding power of 5 to the `value` variable. After the loop, the function returns the computed `value`. The overall effect of the function is to convert a specific type of binary string into a numerical value based on a unique weighting system.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
