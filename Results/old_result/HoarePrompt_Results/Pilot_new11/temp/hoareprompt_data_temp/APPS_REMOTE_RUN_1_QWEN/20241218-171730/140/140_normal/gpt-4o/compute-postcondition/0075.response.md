`in_degree[neighbor]` is decremented by 1. The `queue` and `count` variables are not affected by this line of code. The `node` and `neighbor` variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`queue` includes the original elements plus `neighbor` on the right end, `count` is the total number of nodes whose in-degree became 0 plus 1, `node` is the next node to be dequeued from the left side of the queue, `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1, and `neighbor` is a neighbor of the new `node`.**
