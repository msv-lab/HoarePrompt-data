Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads a string `s` from the input, which is a valid operation according to the problem description.
   - The function `func_1(s)` processes this string.

2. **Vowel Identification and Jump Calculation**:
   - A set `vowels` containing all the vowels ('A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y') is defined.
   - The variable `max_jump` is initialized to 1, representing the minimum jump length required to reach the next vowel.
   - The variable `prev_pos` keeps track of the index of the last vowel encountered.
   - For each character in the string `s`, if the character is a vowel, the program updates `max_jump` to be the maximum of its current value and the difference between the current index and `prev_pos`.
   - After the loop, the final value of `max_jump` is adjusted to account for the distance from the last vowel to the end of the string.

3. **Output**:
   - The function returns `max_jump`, which is the maximum jump ability required to jump over the string while landing only on vowels.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where there might be no vowels in the string by ensuring that the final value of `max_jump` is computed correctly.
   - The program correctly handles the case where the string consists entirely of vowels, returning 1 as the jump ability.

5. **Validation Assumptions**:
   - While the problem description guarantees that the string is non-empty and contains only valid characters, the program inherently handles these constraints through its logic. It does not explicitly check for these conditions but correctly computes the result based on the given input.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the logic required to determine the minimum jump ability needed to reach the end of the string, jumping only on vowels. Therefore, the program is correct.
