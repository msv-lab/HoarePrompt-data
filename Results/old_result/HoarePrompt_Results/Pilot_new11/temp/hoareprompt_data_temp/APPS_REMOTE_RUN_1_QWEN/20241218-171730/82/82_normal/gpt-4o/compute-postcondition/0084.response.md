The function `func_3` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\). The function has two possible return cases:
- Case_1: The program returns 0.
- Case_2: The program returns `min_k`, which is the corresponding minimum `k` when the loop did not execute at all, and thus remains 0.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept two positive integers `a` and `b`, and return either 0 or the minimum `k` (which remains 0 if the loop does not execute).
