Output State: **`i` is `N-1`, `x1` is `meats[N-1][0]`, `y1` is `meats[N-1][1]`, `y2` is `meats[N][1]`, `c1` is `meats[N-1][2]`, `c2` is `meats[N][2]`, `count` is the number of meat entries within distance `T` if a valid combination is found, otherwise it is the maximum number of meat entries checked during the loop, `d` is `(c1_val - c2_val) * T / (c1_val * c2_val)`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `cx`, `cy`, `mx`, `my` hold the values calculated for the last pair of meat entries compared, `j` is `N`, `cx` is `(meats[N-1][0] + meats[N][0]) / 2`, where `c1_val` and `c2_val` are the values of `meats[N-1][2]` and `meats[N][2]` respectively.**

In this step, the code calculates the midpoint `cx` between the x-coordinates of the last two meat entries. The values of the other variables remain unchanged from the initial state except for `cx`, which is updated to the average of the x-coordinates of the last two meat entries.
