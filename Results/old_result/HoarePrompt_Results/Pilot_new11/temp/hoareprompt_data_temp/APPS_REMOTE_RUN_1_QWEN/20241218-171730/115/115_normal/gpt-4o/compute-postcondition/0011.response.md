Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 1. If the 2x2 submatrix starting from `A[i][j]` (which is `A[0][1]`) to `A[i + 1][j + 1]` (which is `A[1][2]`) consists entirely of 1s, then `B` is a 2x2 matrix with `B[0][1] = 1`, `B[0][2] = 1`, `B[1][1] = 1`, `B[1][2] = 1`, and other elements unspecified, and `operations` contains the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1) = (1, 2)`. Otherwise, the matrix `B` and the list `operations` remain unchanged.***
