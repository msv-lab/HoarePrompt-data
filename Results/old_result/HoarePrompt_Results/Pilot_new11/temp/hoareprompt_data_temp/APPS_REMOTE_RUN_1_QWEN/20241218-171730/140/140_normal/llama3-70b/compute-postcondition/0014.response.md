Postcondition: ***`node` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph. If `func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack)` returns True, the function returns True. Otherwise, the function does not change the state of `visited[node]` and `rec_stack[node]` since there is no other operation specified in the else part.***
