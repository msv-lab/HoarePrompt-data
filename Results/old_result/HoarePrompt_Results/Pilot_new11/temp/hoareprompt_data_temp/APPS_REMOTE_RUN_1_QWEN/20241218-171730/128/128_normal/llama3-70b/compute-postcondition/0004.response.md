`days` is an empty list before the code execution. After executing `days.append((k, l))`, the list `days` will contain the tuple `(k, l)`. The values of `n`, `f`, `k`, `l`, and the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be at least 1, `days` is now a list containing the tuple `(k, l)`, `f` must be within the range 0 to `n` inclusive, `k` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `days` is now a list containing the tuple `(k, l)`, `f` must be within the range 0 to `n` inclusive, `k` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer**
