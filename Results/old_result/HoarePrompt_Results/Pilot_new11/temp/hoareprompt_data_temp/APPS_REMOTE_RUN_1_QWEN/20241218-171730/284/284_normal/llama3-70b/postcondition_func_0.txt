The function `func_1` accepts an integer `num` within the range of 1 to 1000. It checks whether `num` is a prime number by iterating from 2 to the square root of `num`. If `num` is divisible by any number in this range, the function returns `False`. If no divisors are found (i.e., `num` is not divisible by any number in the range), the function returns `True`. There are five possible outcomes: the function returns `False` if `num` is less than 2, if `num` is divisible by any number in the range [2, âˆšnum], or if `num` is less than 2 after the loop. The function returns `True` if `num` is a prime number and no divisors are found.
