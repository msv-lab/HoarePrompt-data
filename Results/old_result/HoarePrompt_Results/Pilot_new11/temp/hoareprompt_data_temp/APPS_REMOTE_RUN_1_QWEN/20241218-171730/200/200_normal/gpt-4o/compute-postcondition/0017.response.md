The `break` statement does not modify the values of the variables but rather breaks out of the loop or conditional block it is within. Since there is no loop or conditional block in the given code snippet that would be affected by the `break` statement, the variables remain in their previous states.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `volumes[i]` is less than or equal to `min_keg_volume`, therefore no change is made to `remaining_kvass`, `possible_to_take` is set to the minimum value between `volumes[i] - min_keg_volume` and `remaining_kvass`, and `remaining_kvass` is reduced by `possible_to_take`. In either case, the current value of `remaining_kvass` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
