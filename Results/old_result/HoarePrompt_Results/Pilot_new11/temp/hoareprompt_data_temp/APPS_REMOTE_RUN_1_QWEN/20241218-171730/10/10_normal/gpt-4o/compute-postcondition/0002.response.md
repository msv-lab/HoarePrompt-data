The code initializes an empty list `sofas`. This does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`d` is an input integer, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, `x_1` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x_1 ≤ n, `y_1` is an integer such that 1 ≤ y_1 ≤ m, `x_2` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x_2 ≤ n, `y_2` is an integer such that 1 ≤ y_2 ≤ m, `cnt_l` is an integer such that 0 ≤ cnt_l ≤ d - 1, `cnt_r` is an integer such that 0 ≤ cnt_r ≤ d - 1, `cnt_t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ cnt_t ≤ d - 1, `cnt_b` is an integer such that 0 ≤ cnt_b ≤ d - 1; `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input; `sofas` is an empty list.**
