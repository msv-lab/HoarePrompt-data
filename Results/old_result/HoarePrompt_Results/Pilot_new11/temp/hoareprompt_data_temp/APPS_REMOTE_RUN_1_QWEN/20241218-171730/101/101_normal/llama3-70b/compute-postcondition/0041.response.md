Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `white_pixels` must contain at least one tuple, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, for all `(i, j)` in `white_pixels`, `pixels[i][j]` will be `'+'` if `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or (j == max_y))`, and `'.'` otherwise. If `pixels[i][j]` was `'w'`, it remains `'w'`. If `pixels[i][j]` was `'.'`, it becomes `'w'` if `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or (j == max_y))` and `'.'` otherwise.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each row (`j` in `range(m)`).
- For each cell `(i, j)`, if it satisfies the condition `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or (j == max_y))` and its value is `'.'`, it is updated to `'+'`.
- If the cell value is `'w'`, the loop continues without making any change.
- If the cell value is `'.'`, it is updated to `'w'`.

After the loop completes all its iterations:
- All cells in the border (`min_x`, `max_x`, `min_y`, and `max_y` rows and columns) will be `'+'` if they were originally `'.'`.
- Cells with value `'w'` will remain `'w'`.
- Other cells with value `'.'` will also be `'w'` if they were within the border but not previously `'w'`.

Since the loop will always update cells that satisfy the conditions, and since `white_pixels` contains at least one tuple, every cell that needs to be updated will eventually be updated. Therefore, the final state will have all cells within the specified borders marked as `'+'` if they were originally `'.'`, and the rest of the cells will be `'w'` if they were originally `'.'`, maintaining the original `'w'` values unchanged.
