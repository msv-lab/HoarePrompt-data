Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates through the string to find the maximum gap between consecutive vowels and also checks the distance from the last vowel to the end of the string. This ensures that the minimum jump ability required to reach the end of the string, only jumping on vowels, is calculated accurately. The code handles all potential edge cases, such as strings with no vowels or only one vowel, by updating the `max_jump` accordingly. Therefore, the program works correctly for every potential case as per the problem description.
