`additional_marks.append(i + j)` appends the value of `i + j` to the list `additional_marks`. Since `additional_marks` was non-empty before the operation, appending an element to it does not change its non-empty state. Therefore, the updated state includes the new element in the list.

Output State: **`additional_marks` is a non-empty list containing its previous elements plus the new element `i + j`.**
