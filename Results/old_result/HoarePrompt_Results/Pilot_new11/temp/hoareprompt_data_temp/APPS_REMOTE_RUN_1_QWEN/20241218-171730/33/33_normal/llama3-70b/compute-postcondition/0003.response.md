The code `t, dir = input().split()` reads two values from the input, splits them by whitespace, and assigns the first value to `t` and the second value to `dir`. The initial values of `n` and `curr_lat` are not affected by this code. 

Since the input is not specified, we can represent the output state in a general form. The values of `n` and `curr_lat` remain unchanged, while `t` and `dir` are assigned the respective values from the input.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `curr_lat` is 90, `t` is the first value from input, `dir` is the second value from input**
