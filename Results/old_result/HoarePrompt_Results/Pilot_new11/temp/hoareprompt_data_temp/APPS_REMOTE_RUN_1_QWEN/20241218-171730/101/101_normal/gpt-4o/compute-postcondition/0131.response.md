Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**: At the end of the previous iteration, we have the following states:
   - \( i \) is \( n + 1 \)
   - \( j \) is 0
   - \( m \) must be greater than 0
   - \( top \) is \( n + 1 \)
   - \( bottom \) is \( n + 1 \)
   - \( left \) is 0
   - \( right \) is 0

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over \( j \) from 0 to \( m - 1 \). Therefore, the condition for the loop to execute again is that \( j < m \).

3. **Current Values**:
   - \( i = n + 1 \)
   - \( j = 0 \)

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - Since \( j = 0 \) and \( m \) is greater than 0, \( j < m \) holds true. Therefore, the loop will execute again.
   - \( j \) will be incremented by 1, so \( j \) will become 1.

5. **Other States Remain Unchanged**:
   - \( i \) remains \( n + 1 \)
   - \( m \) remains greater than 0
   - \( top \) remains \( n + 1 \)
   - \( bottom \) remains \( n + 1 \)
   - \( left \) remains 0
   - \( right \) remains 0

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
- \( j \) becomes 1

The final state should be:
State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `j` is 1, `m` must be greater than 0, `top` is `n + 1`, `bottom` is `n + 1`, `left` is 0, and `right` is 0**
