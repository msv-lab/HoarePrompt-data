The code appends the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `ops`. Given the initial state, the value of `i` is 1, and `j` is in the range `[0, m - 2]`. Since the current value of the if condition is satisfied, the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` will be added to `ops`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a non-negative integer with at least 3, `m` is an integer such that \(2 \le m \le 50\), `A` is a matrix of size `n` by `m` where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` is a list containing the additional tuple `(2, j + 1)` (where `j` is in the range `[0, m - 2]`), `j` is in the range `[0, m - 2]` and the current value of the if condition is satisfied.**
