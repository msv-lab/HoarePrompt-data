Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the input as specified in the problem description. It reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `M`, and a list of `k` integers representing the time taken to solve each subtask.

2. **Sorting Subtasks**: The program sorts the subtask times `t`. While sorting isn't strictly necessary for the dynamic programming approach, it simplifies the implementation and ensures consistent ordering, which is good practice.

3. **Dynamic Programming Table Initialization**: The program initializes a 2D DP table `dp` with dimensions `(k + 1) x (M + 1)`. Each element `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum points that can be earned by solving up to `i` subtasks within `j` minutes.

4. **Filling the DP Table**: The program fills the DP table using nested loops. For each subtask `i` and each minute `j`, it updates `dp[i][j]` by considering whether including the current subtask would increase the points earned. This logic correctly reflects the problem's requirement to maximize points within the given time.

5. **Calculating the Result**: After filling the DP table, the program calculates the maximum points by summing the points from the last row of the DP table (`sum(dp[i][M] for i in range(k + 1))`) and adding the bonus points for fully completing tasks (`sum(1 for i in range(k + 1) if dp[i][M] == i)`).

The program accurately handles all aspects of the problem, including considering the time constraints, calculating points for partially completed and fully completed tasks, and maximizing the total points within the given time limit. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
