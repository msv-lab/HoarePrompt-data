Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and the output hints for each function. Here's a breakdown of why the code is correct:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. The output hints confirm that it handles all cases correctly, including the edge case where `b` is initially 0.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function calculates the maximum value of `f(p)` for all permutations of length `n`. It iterates through the range `[1, n + 1]` and updates `res` to be the maximum GCD value obtained by applying `func_1(res, i)` for each `i`. The output hints indicate that it correctly handles the range and the computation.

3. **Function `func_3`**: This function counts the number of permutations of length `n` such that `f(p)` equals `f_max_n`. It uses dynamic programming to compute the cumulative sums and ensures that the results are taken modulo `10^9 + 7`. The output hints confirm that it correctly initializes the DP array, updates it correctly, and returns the desired result.

Given the problem description and the provided functions, the code correctly implements the logic to find the number of permutations with the maximum value of `f(p)` modulo `10^9 + 7`. There are no apparent edge cases or missing functionalities that would cause the program to fail for any valid input within the specified range.
