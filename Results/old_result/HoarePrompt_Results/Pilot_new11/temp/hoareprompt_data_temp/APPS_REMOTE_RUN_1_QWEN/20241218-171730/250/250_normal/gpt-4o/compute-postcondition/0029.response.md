Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `marks` is a list of integers (potentially empty), `marks_set` is a set of unique elements from `marks`, `x_found` is `True`, `y_found` is `True`. If the loop does not execute, `x_found` and `y_found` remain `False`.** 

### Explanation:
- **`n` is a non-negative integer**: This means `n` could be any non-negative integer since `n` represents the length of `marks` and lengths are non-negative.
- **`marks` is a list of integers (potentially empty)**: The final state of `marks` could be any list of integers, including an empty list. It might have elements removed if the conditions inside the loop were met.
- **`marks_set` is a set of unique elements from `marks`**: `marks_set` will always contain unique elements from the `marks` list, regardless of whether the loop executes or not.
- **`x_found` is `True`, `y_found` is `True`**: These boolean flags indicate that within the list `marks`, there exist pairs of elements `mark` and `x` such that `mark + x` or `mark - x` is in `marks_set`, and similarly for `y`.
- **If the loop does not execute, `x_found` and `y_found` remain `False`**: This indicates that if no such pairs `(mark, x)` and `(mark, y)` are found in the `marks` list, the flags `x_found` and `y_found` will stay `False`.

This output state summarizes the possible final states of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations or not at all.
