The function processes input consisting of \(n\) lines, each containing two space-separated integers \(a_i\) and \(b_i\). It determines whether the participants' ratings are consistent (i.e., no participant has a strictly lower rating than the next one), fully rated (at least one participant has a strictly higher rating than the previous one), or mixed (neither condition is met). Specifically, it:

1. Reads \(n\) and initializes lists to store ratings and boolean flags.
2. Collects \(n\) pairs of ratings into a list.
3. Sets a flag `is_rated` to True if any participant has a different rating than the previous one.
4. If no participant has a different rating (`is_rated` remains False), it checks if the ratings are strictly increasing. If so, it sets `is_unrated` to False; otherwise, it keeps `is_unrated` as True.
5. Prints "rated" if `is_rated` is True, indicating the ratings are fully rated.
6. Prints "unrated" if `is_unrated` is True, indicating the ratings are not strictly increasing.
7. Prints "maybe" if neither of the above conditions is met, indicating the ratings are mixed.

Potential edge cases:
- If \(n = 1\), the function will always print "maybe" because there are no subsequent ratings to compare.
- If all participants have the same rating, the function will print "unrated" since no participant has a strictly higher rating than the previous one.
