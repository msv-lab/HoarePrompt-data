The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The output cases are based on the values of `m`, `a`, and `b`, which are constrained as follows: `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\), and `a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^5\). However, since these variables are not passed to the function, they must be defined within the function itself.

Given the output cases, the function likely involves some computation or comparison involving `m`, `a`, and `b`. But based solely on the parameter constraints and the requested format, the parameters accepted by the function are none. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to return a value based on the internal handling of the integer `m` and positive integers `a` and `b`, without accepting any parameters.

Functionality: **The function returns a value based on the internal handling of the integer `m` and positive integers `a` and `b`, without accepting any parameters.**
