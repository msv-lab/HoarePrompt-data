`dp[i]` is assigned the maximum value between `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + volumes[i]`. The value of `i` is 2, but the values of `dp`, `j`, and `volumes` are not specified. Therefore, we can only say that `dp[2]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + volumes[2]`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `dp[2]` is the maximum of `dp[2]` and `dp[j] + volumes[2]`, the value of `j` and `volumes` remains unchanged**
