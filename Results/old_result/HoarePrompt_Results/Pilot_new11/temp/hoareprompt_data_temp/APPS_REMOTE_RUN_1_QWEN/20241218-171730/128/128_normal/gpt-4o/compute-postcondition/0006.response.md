The code snippet `regular_sales.append(min(k, l))` appends the minimum value between `k` and `l` to the list `regular_sales`. However, the variables `k` and `l` are not defined in the provided initial state or within the given code snippet. Therefore, we cannot determine their values directly from the given information.

Given the initial state and the lack of specific values for `k` and `l`, the output state will reflect that the operation attempted to append the minimum of `k` and `l` to `regular_sales`, but since `k` and `l` are undefined, no specific values can be provided for them.

Output State: **`n` and `f` are non-negative integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\) and \(0 \leq f \leq n\), `days` is a list of `n` tuples, `f` is \(f - 1\), and `regular_sales` is a list with an appended element which is the minimum of undefined variables `k` and `l`.**
