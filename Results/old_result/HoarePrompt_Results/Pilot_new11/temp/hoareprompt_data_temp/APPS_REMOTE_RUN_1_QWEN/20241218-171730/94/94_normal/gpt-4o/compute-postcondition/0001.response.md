`visited` is assigned a set containing the value of `start`. The `queue` remains unchanged, and `start` also remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `start` is a string representing the initial configuration of a 2x2 sliding puzzle; `queue` is a deque containing `start`; `visited` is a set containing `start`.

Output State: **`start` is a string representing the initial configuration of a 2x2 sliding puzzle; `queue` is a deque containing `start`; `visited` is a set containing `start`**
