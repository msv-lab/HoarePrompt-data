Postcondition: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `marks` is a list of integers that must not be empty, `marks_set` is a set of unique elements from `marks`, `x_found` is `False`, `y_found` is `False`, `new_marks` is a set containing either `mark + x` or `mark - x` based on the condition inside the if-else block, and the if condition `(mark + y + x in marks_set or mark + y - x in marks_set or mark - y + x in marks_set)` is being evaluated.**
