Postcondition: ***`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is an integer such that \(1 \leq K \leq \text{len(meats)}\), `T` is a non-negative float representing the time threshold, `N` is the length of the `meats` list and must be at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` are either the first three elements of the tuple at index `i` or `j` in `meats`, `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` are the remaining tuple elements, `d` is now `c1 * T - c2 * T`, `cx` is \((x1 + x2) / 2\), `cy` is \((y1 + y2) / 2\), `dx` is \((x1 - x2) / 2\), `dy` is \((y1 - y2) / 2\), `d2` is \(\left(\frac{x1 - x2}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y1 - y2}{2}\right)^2\), `mx` is `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `my` is `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `count` is an integer representing the number of tuples in `meats` where the distance from `(mx, my)` to `(x, y)` is less than or equal to `T`, and `count` is less than `K`. If `d < 0`, then `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` are replaced with `x2_original`, `y2_original`, and `c1_original` respectively, and `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` are replaced with `x1_original`, `y1_original`, and `c2_original` respectively.***

This postcondition covers all possible outcomes of the if-else block, summarizing the state of the program variables after the execution of the block.
