`pixels[i][j]` is assigned the value `'+'`. The value of `i` and `j` are not specified in the initial state, but we know that `j` must be less than `m-1` and will be set to `m-1` for the next iteration. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `white_pixels` must contain at least one tuple, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is now `m-1`, `pixels[i][j]` is `'+'`**
