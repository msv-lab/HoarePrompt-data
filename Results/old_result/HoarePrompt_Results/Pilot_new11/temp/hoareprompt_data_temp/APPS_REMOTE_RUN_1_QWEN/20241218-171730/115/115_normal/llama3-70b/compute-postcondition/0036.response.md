The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop but does not affect the values of any variables outside the loop. Given the conditions for setting `ops`, the only change would be whether the loop continues or not based on those conditions, but since no new assignments or changes are made to the variables within the snippet provided, the values remain as they were.

Output State: **`A` is the original array, `ops` is `[<initial content of ops>, (i + 1, j + 2)]` if any of the following conditions are true: `A[i][j + 1] == 1`, `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.**
