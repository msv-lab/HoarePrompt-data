According to the code, the loop iterates over a range starting from 1 up to `k`. The variable `i` takes values from 1 to `k` inclusively. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be equal to `k`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and become `k + 1`. Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration, the condition for the next iteration would require `i` to be `k + 1`.

State: **`i` is `k + 1`**
