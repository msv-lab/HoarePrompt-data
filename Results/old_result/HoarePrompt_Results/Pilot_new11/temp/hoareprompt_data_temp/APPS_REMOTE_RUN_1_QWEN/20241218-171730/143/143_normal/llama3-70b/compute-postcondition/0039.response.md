Postcondition: ***`j` is 0, `vol` is 0, `dp[i]` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `dp[i - vol] + costs[0]`, and `n` is a positive integer. Since there is no else part, the condition that `vol` is less than or equal to `i` is the only condition considered, ensuring that `dp[i]` is updated based on this condition.***
