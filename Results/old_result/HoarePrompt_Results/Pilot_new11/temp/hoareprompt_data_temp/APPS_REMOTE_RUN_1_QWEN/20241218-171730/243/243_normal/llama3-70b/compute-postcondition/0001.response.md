`count` is assigned the value 0. The value of `m` remains unchanged and is an integer between 1 and 100,000 inclusive. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is an integer equal to the input value and 1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000; `count` is 0.

Output State: **`m` is an integer equal to the input value and 1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000; `count` is 0**
