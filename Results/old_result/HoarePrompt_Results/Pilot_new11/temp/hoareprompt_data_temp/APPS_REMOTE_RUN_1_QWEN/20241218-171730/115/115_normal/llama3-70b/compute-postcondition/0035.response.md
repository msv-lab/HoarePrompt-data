Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Understanding**:
   - `A` is the original array.
   - `ops` is initially an empty list or a list containing an element `(i + 1, j + 1)` if any of the following conditions are met:
     - `A[i][j] == 1`
     - `A[i + 1][j] == 1`
     - `A[i][j + 1] == 1`
     - `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1`

2. **Loop Iteration**:
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `m - 2`.

3. **Conditions for Adding to `ops`**:
   - At each iteration, the condition checks if any of the elements in the specified positions within the array `A` are equal to `1`.
   - If any of these conditions are met, `(i + 1, j + 1)` is added to `ops`.

4. **State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - We need to determine the state just before the next iteration starts.

5. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since the loop increments `j` by 1 at each iteration, the new value of `j` will be `j + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `m - 1`.

Given that we are at the end of the previous iteration, let's assume the current value of `j` is `k`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be `k + 1`.

6. **Determine the Next Condition**:
   - The next condition to check would be `A[i][j + 1]`, as `j` will now be `k + 1`.

7. **Update the `ops` List**:
   - The state of `ops` will depend on whether the condition is met at the new `j` position.

Since no specific values for `i`, `A`, or `ops` are given, we'll keep the general form. 

**Final State Adjustment**:
- `j` should be updated to `j + 1` for the next iteration.
- `ops` will remain unchanged unless the new condition is met.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`A` is the original array, `ops` is `[<initial content of ops>, (i + 1, j + 2)]` if any of the following conditions are true: `A[i][j + 1] == 1`, `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.**

Note: `ops` will only change if the new condition (`A[i][j + 1]` or `A[i + 1][j + 1]`) is met.
