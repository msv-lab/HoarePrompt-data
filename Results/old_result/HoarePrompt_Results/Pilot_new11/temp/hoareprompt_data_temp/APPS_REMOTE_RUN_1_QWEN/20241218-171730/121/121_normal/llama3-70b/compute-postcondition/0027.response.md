`res` is assigned the value of `res` plus `nc`. Given that `nc` is 'A' and the initial value of `res` (assuming it's an integer) is implied to start from 0 (since no initial value is provided), the value of `res` will be incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nc` is 'A'; `count['A']` is greater than 0; `res` is 1.

Output State: **`nc` is 'A'; `count['A']` is greater than 0; `res` is 1**
