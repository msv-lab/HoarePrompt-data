According to the code, the loop will iterate `n` times. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 because the loop runs from `0` to `n-1` (inclusive). The variable `cakes` is a list, and since it is empty initially, it does not affect the condition for the loop to execute.

To ensure the loop can execute, `n` must be greater than 0.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
