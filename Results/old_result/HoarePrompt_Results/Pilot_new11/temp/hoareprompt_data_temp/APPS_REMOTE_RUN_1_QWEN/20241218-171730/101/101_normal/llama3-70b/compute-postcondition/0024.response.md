The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop and move to the next iteration of the loop. It does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `n`, `white_pixels`, `m`, and the conditions on `white_pixels` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `white_pixels` must contain at least one tuple, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, and for all tuples `(i, j)` in `white_pixels`, it is not the case that `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or (j == max_y)) and pixels[i][j] == '.'`. Additionally, there exists at least one tuple `(i, j)` in `white_pixels` such that `pixels[i][j] == 'w'`.**
