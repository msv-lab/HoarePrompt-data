The given code snippet does not modify any of the existing values of the `dp` list. Instead, it calculates and prints two values:

1. The sum of the last column (`dp[i][M]`) for all rows from `0` to `k`.
2. The count of rows where `dp[i][M]` equals `i`.

These operations do not alter the contents of the `dp` list itself, but they do involve reading from it. The output of the code is printed to the console, but the `dp` list remains unchanged.

Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list of dimensions `(k + 1) x (M + 1)` where each element `dp[i][j]` is the maximum value obtained by either keeping the previous value `dp[i][j - 1]` or updating it based on the condition `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1` if `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`; the print statement outputs the sum of `dp[i][M]` for `0 <= i <= k` and the count of `i` where `dp[i][M] == i`.**
