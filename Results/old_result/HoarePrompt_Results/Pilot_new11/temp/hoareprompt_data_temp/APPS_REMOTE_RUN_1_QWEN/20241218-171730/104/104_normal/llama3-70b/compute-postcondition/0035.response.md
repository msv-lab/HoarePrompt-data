Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `j` is `n + 2`.
   - The condition to check is whether all elements in the sublist `a[i:j]` satisfy `a[k] - a[i] == k - i` for every `k` in the range from `i` to `j-1`.
   - If the condition is satisfied, `max_erase` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `n - 1`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `j = i + 1` to `j = n + 1`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` remains 2.
   - `j` is `n + 2`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will increment `j` by 1, so the new value of `j` will be `n + 3`.

5. **Checking the Condition:**
   - We need to check if the condition `a[k] - a[i] == k - i` holds for the new range `[i, j)` where `i` is still 2 and `j` is now `n + 3`.
   - If the condition is satisfied, `max_erase` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `n - 1`.

6. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since `i` remains the same, `i` is still 2.
   - The new value of `j` is `n + 3`.
   - `max_erase` may or may not be updated based on the condition check. However, since we don't know the exact value of `max_erase` without checking the condition, we'll keep it as the current state unless explicitly changed.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration are:

**State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is 2, `j` is `n + 3`**.
