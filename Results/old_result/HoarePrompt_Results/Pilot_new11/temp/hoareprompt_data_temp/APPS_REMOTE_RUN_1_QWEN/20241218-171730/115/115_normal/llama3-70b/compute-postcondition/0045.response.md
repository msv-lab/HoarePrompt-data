Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is a non-negative integer with at least 3 (i.e., `n >= 3`), `m` is an integer such that \(2 \le m \le 50\), `A` is a matrix of size `n` by `m` where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` is a list containing all the tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for which any of the conditions `A[i][j] == 1`, `A[i + 1][j] == 1`, `A[i][j + 1] == 1`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1` are satisfied, `j` is in the range `[0, m - 2]` and remains unchanged otherwise. If `A[i][j] == 1`, `A[i + 1][j] == 1`, `A[i][j + 1] == 1`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1` are all true, then the function does not change the matrix `A` and `ops` remains the same. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
