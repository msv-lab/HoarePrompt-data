The line `min_cost = current_cost` updates the value of `min_cost` to be equal to the current value of `current_cost`. The value of `current_cost` is the sum of adjustments made to it based on the conditions within the loop, and since it is now assigned to `min_cost`, `min_cost` will have this updated value. The values of `best_t`, `t`, and `a` remain unchanged because they are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list, `min_cost` is the current value of `current_cost`, `best_t` is `n + 1`, `t` is `n + 2`, `current_cost` is the sum of all adjustments made to it based on the conditions within the loop.**
