Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The annotated version confirms that the program does not ensure the sum of the fractions equals \(1 - \frac{1}{n}\). For instance, for \(n = 4\), the program generates fractions \(\frac{1}{2}\) and \(\frac{1}{2}\), resulting in a sum of 1, which is not equal to \(1 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description, leading to the same assessment of **False**.
