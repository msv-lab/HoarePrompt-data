`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values obtained from `input().split()`, which means they are converted to integers from the input. Since the input values for `n`, `m`, and `k` are provided through `input().split()`, their specific values are not known beforehand but are now set to the integers entered by the user. The initial conditions that `n` and `m` are even and positive integers within the specified range (2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9) and that `k` is an integer within the range (0 ≤ k < n·m) remain valid.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, and `n` and `m` are even and positive integers such that 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9, and k is an integer such that 0 ≤ k < n·m.**
