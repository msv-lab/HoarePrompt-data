Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `n` is \(n - 1\)
   - `name` is the first part of the input split by space
   - `type_` is the second part of the input split by space
   - `files` is `[('name', int(type_))]`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates for `n` times.
   - Given that `n` is \(n - 1\) at the end of the previous iteration, it means that the loop has already completed one iteration.

3. **Next Iteration Analysis:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 0.
   - If the loop is to continue, `n` must be set to \(n - 1 + 1 = n\).

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since the loop condition requires `n > 0`, we need to ensure `n` is set to a value greater than 0.
   - The variable `name` and `type_` remain unchanged as they are not involved in the loop condition.
   - `files` remains `[('name', int(type_))]` as it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Final State:**
   - To allow the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be set to a value that is still greater than 0.

Therefore, the final state before the next iteration should be:
State: **`n` is \(n\), `name` is the first part of the input split by space, `type_` is the second part of the input split by space, `files` is `[('name', int(type_))]`**
