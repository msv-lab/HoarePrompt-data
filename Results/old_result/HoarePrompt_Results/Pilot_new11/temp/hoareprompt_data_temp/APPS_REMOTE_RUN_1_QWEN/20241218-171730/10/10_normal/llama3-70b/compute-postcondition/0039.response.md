Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes a `sofa` (a tuple of integers representing the coordinates of a single sofa) and a `sofas` (a list of tuples representing the coordinates of multiple sofas) as inputs. It counts the number of sofas that are to the left, right, above, and below the given `sofa` within the same row or column, respectively. The function iterates through the `sofas` list, excluding the given `sofa`, and updates counters based on the relative positions of other sofas. After processing all other sofas, it returns four values: `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom`, which represent the count of sofas in those respective directions. The function handles the case where `sofas` is a non-empty list, but it does not handle the case where `sofas` is an empty list, in which case it would result in undefined behavior since no other sofas would be counted.**
