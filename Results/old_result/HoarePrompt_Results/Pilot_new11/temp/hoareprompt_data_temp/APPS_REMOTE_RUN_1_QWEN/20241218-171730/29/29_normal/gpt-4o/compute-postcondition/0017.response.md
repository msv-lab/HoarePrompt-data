`regulars` appends the value of `name`. The value of `name` is the first part of the next `file`, and since `type_` was not checked in this line of code, the value of `type_` could be either '1' or something else. However, the code only appends `name` to `regulars` regardless of the value of `type_`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `files` has at least one element, `name` is the first part of the next `file`, `type_` is the second part of the next `file`, `regulars` includes `name`**
