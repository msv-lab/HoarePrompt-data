The code `top = i` assigns the value of `i` to the variable `top`. This updates the value of `top` but does not affect the values of the other variables.

Output State: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is `j + 1`, `top` is `i`, `right` is `j + 1` if `j + 1 > right`, and `bottom` is `i` if `i > bottom`**
