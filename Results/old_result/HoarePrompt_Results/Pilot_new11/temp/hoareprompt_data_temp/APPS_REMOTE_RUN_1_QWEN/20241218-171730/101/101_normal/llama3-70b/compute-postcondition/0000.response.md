The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input, splits them, and converts them to integers, assigning them to `n` and `m` respectively. The initial state specifies that the input consists of two integers representing the dimensions of the monitor, followed by `n` lines of strings, each containing exactly `m` characters. These lines are made up of the characters "." (black pixels) and "w" (white pixels). The code does not affect these lines, only updates `n` and `m`.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, the input consists of `n` lines of strings, each containing exactly `m` characters, made up of the characters "." and "w".**
