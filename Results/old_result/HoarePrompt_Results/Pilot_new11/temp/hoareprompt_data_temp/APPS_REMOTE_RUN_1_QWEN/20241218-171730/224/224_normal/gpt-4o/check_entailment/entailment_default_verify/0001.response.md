Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate because the provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The output hints confirm that the `func_1` function calculates the factorial of \( n-1 \) modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \). This calculation is not relevant to the problem of finding the number of permutations \( p \) such that \( f(p) = f_{max}(n) \).

For example, for \( n = 3 \), the expected output should be 4, as explained in the problem note. However, the program returns 2, which is the factorial of \( 2 \) (i.e., \( 2! = 2 \)). This clearly indicates that the program is not solving the intended problem.

The output hints and the problem description do not align with the current implementation, hence the program remains incorrect.
