Postcondition: ***`a` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` to its original value; `b` is an integer such that \(1 \le b \le 10^9\) and \(a \neq b\); `new_b` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b`; `diff` is the absolute value of `a - b` and is at least 1; if `current_lcm < min_lcm` or (`current_lcm == min_lcm` and `candidate < min_k`), then `min_lcm` is updated to `current_lcm` and `min_k` is updated to `candidate`; `new_a` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`; `new_b` is calculated as \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\).***
