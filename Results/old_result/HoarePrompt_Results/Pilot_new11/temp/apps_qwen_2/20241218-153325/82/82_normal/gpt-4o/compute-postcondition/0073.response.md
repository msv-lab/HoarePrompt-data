To determine the states that need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze how the loop variable `candidate` changes and what conditions must be met for the loop to continue.

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the list `[k, diff // k]`.
- The loop variable `candidate` takes on the values `k` and `diff // k` in sequence.
- If `current_lcm < min_lcm` or (`current_lcm == min_lcm` and `candidate < min_k`), then `min_lcm` and `min_k` are updated. Otherwise, they remain unchanged.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `new_a = (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`
   - `new_b = (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`
   - `current_lcm` is the least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b`.
   - `min_lcm` is the minimum least common multiple found so far.
   - `min_k` is the smallest value of `k` that achieves `min_lcm`.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over two values: `k` and `diff // k`.
   - For each value of `candidate`, it calculates `new_a`, `new_b`, `current_lcm`, and checks if `current_lcm` should update `min_lcm` and `min_k`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration:**
   - Suppose the loop just finished with the current `candidate` being either `k` or `diff // k`.
   - We need to determine the next `candidate` for the next iteration.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - If the loop just finished with `candidate = k`, the next `candidate` will be `diff // k`.
   - If the loop just finished with `candidate = diff // k`, the next `candidate` will be `k`.

5. **States to Adjust:**
   - `new_a` and `new_b` will depend on the new `candidate`.
   - `current_lcm` will be recalculated based on the new `new_a` and `new_b`.
   - `min_lcm` and `min_k` may or may not be updated depending on the comparison.

### Conclusion:
- At the start of the next iteration, `candidate` will be the other value between `k` and `diff // k` that was not used in the previous iteration.
- `new_a` and `new_b` will be recalculated based on the new `candidate`.
- `current_lcm` will be the least common multiple of the new `new_a` and `new_b`.
- `min_lcm` and `min_k` may or may not be updated based on the comparison with the previous `min_lcm` and `min_k`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`new_a` is \((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\); `new_b` is \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\); `current_lcm` is the least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b`; `min_lcm` is the minimum least common multiple found so far; `min_k` is the smallest value of `k` that achieves `min_lcm`. Where `candidate` is the other value between `k` and `diff // k` that was not used in the previous iteration.**
