The function `func_3` accepts two integers `a` and `b`, both within the range \(1 \le a, b \le 10^9\) and ensures \(a \neq b\). It first checks if `a` equals `b`, returning 0 if true. Otherwise, it calculates the absolute difference `diff` between `a` and `b`. It then iterates through possible values of `k` from 1 to the square root of `diff`, checking each pair of factors of `diff`. For each factor pair, it adjusts `a` and `b` to the nearest multiples of `k` and computes their least common multiple using `func_2`. It keeps track of the minimum LCM found and the corresponding `k` that achieves this minimum LCM. Finally, it returns either 0 (if no valid `k` was found) or the `k` that results in the smallest LCM found.
