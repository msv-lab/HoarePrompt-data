Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the case when \(a\) and \(b\) are equal. In such cases, the least common multiple (LCM) of \(a+k\) and \(b+k\) should be minimized by setting \(k=0\), as shown in the third example. However, the current implementation starts with \(k=0\) and increments \(k\) until it finds a smaller LCM. This approach fails to recognize that \(k=0\) might already be the optimal solution, especially when \(a=b\).

For instance, consider the input:
```
5 5
```

The correct output should be:
```
0
```

However, the current implementation will start with \(k=0\) and check if incrementing \(k\) leads to a smaller LCM, which it won't in this case. Thus, the implementation will output \(0\) for \(k-1\), which is incorrect.

To fix this, the code should directly check if \(a\) equals \(b\) and return \(0\) immediately if they are equal.
