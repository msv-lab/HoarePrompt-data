Postcondition: ***`new_a` is \((a + c - 1) // c * c\), `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `diff` is the absolute value of `a - b`, `k` is a positive integer, and `diff // k` is an integer; `new_b` is \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\); `current_lcm` is a value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`. `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm` or (`current_lcm` is equal to `min_lcm` and `candidate` is less than `min_k`).***
