Postcondition: **`a` is `a + candidate - 1`, `b` is `b + candidate - 1`, `diff` is `diff`, `k` is a positive integer greater than 1, `candidate` is a factor of `diff`, `new_b` is `b + candidate - 1`, `current_lcm` is the least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b`. The current least common multiple (`current_lcm`) is less than `min_lcm` or (if `current_lcm` equals `min_lcm`), `candidate` is less than `min_k`**
