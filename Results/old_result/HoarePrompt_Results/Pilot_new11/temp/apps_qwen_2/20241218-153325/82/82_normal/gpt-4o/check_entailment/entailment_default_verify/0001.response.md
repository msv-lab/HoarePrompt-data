Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_3` correctly implements the logic to find the smallest non-negative integer \( k \) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) is minimized. 

Here's a detailed breakdown:
1. **GCD and LCM Functions**: The helper functions `func_1` and `func_2` are implemented correctly to compute the GCD and LCM respectively.
2. **Main Logic**: The main function `func_3` iterates over possible values of \( k \) from 1 to the square root of the absolute difference between \( a \) and \( b \). It checks each pair of factors of this difference and calculates the adjusted values of \( a \) and \( b \) to find the smallest LCM. This approach ensures that the smallest \( k \) yielding the minimal LCM is identified.

The output hints confirm that the function handles the problem correctly by iterating through possible values of \( k \) and adjusting \( a \) and \( b \) to their nearest multiples of \( k \). This method ensures that the smallest \( k \) with the smallest LCM is chosen, aligning with the problem requirements.

Given that the provided examples and the logical steps in the code match the problem description and the output hints, the program is indeed correct. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment is justified.
