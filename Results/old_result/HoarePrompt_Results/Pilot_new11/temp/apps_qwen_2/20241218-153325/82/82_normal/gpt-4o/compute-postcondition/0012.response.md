Postcondition: ***`a` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` to its original value, `b` is an integer such that \(1 \le b \le 10^9\) and \(a \neq b\), `new_b` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b`, `diff` is the absolute value of `a - b` and is at least 1, `current_lcm` is the least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b`. `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm` or (`current_lcm` is equal to `min_lcm` and `candidate` is less than `min_k`).***
