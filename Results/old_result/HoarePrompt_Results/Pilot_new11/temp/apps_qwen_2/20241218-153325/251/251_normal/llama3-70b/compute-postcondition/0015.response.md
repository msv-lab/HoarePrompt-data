Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `cakes` is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: (volume, r, h).
   - `dp` is a list of `n` zeros.
   - `dp[0]` is equal to the volume of the first cake in the `cakes` list.

2. **Loop Execution Condition**:
   - The loop starts from `i = 1` and runs up to `i < n`.
   - This means the loop will execute as long as `i` is between 1 and `n-1`.

3. **What Needs to Be Adjusted**:
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be at least 1, and `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since the loop starts at `i = 1`, we need to ensure that `i` is set to 1 and that `n` is at least 2 (since `i` goes up to `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 1).

4. **State Adjustment**:
   - `i` must be 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 1 (i.e., `n > 1`).

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1**
