The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input from the user and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. The variable `n` remains unchanged, and the variable `cakes` is not affected. After executing this line, `data` will contain the split input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, `cakes` is a list of tuples where each tuple (r_i, h_i) represents the radius and height of the i-th cake such that 1 ≤ r_i, h_i ≤ 10 000, and `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.**
