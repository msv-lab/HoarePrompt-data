Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is a number greater than 1
   - `dp[1]` is the maximum value of `dp[1]` after considering all valid `j` values such that `cakes[1][1] < cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[j][2] < cakes[j][2]` for each `j` in the range of `i`.

2. **Loop Statement**:
   ```python
   for i in range(1, n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`. Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

4. **Update States**:
   - Since the loop condition is `i < n`, and currently `i` is 1, the next iteration will start with `i = 2`.
   - The variable `n` remains unchanged because it is the upper limit of the loop and does not change within the loop.
   - The value of `dp[1]` does not get updated in this iteration, so it remains the same for the next iteration.

Therefore, the updated states for the next iteration are:
- `i` is 2
- `n` is still a number greater than 1
- `dp[1]` is still the maximum value of `dp[1]` after considering all valid `j` values such that `cakes[1][1] < cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[j][2] < cakes[j][2]` for each `j` in the range of `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a number greater than 1, `dp[1]` is the maximum value of `dp[1]` after considering all valid `j` values such that `cakes[1][1] < cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[j][2] < cakes[j][2]` for each `j` in the range of `i`**.
