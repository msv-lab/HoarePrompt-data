`dp[i]` is assigned the value of `cakes[i][0]`. The initial value of `i` is 2, and `n` is a number greater than 1. The value of `dp[1]` remains unchanged because it is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 2, `n` is a number greater than 1, `dp[1]` is the maximum value of `dp[1]` after considering all valid `j` values such that `cakes[1][1] < cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[j][2] < cakes[j][2]` for each `j` in the range of `i`, and `dp[2]` is `cakes[2][0]`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a number greater than 1, `dp[1]` is the maximum value of `dp[1]` after considering all valid `j` values such that `cakes[1][1] < cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[j][2] < cakes[j][2]` for each `j` in the range of `i`, and `dp[2]` is `cakes[2][0]`**.
