Let's go through the given code step by step:

### Initial State:
- `v1` is an integer such that \(1 \leq v1 \leq 100\)
- `v2` is an integer such that \(1 \leq v2 \leq 100\)
- `t` must be greater than 1
- `d` is an integer such that \(0 \leq d \leq 10\)
- `a` is an integer such that \(2 \leq a \leq 100\)
- `b` is an integer such that \(0 \leq b \leq 10\)
- `speeds` is a list with `a` elements, where:
  - `speeds[0]` is equal to `v1`
  - `speeds[-1]` is equal to `v2`
  - For \(1 \leq i \leq a - 2\), `speeds[i]` is the minimum of `speeds[i - 1] + d` and `v2 + (t - i - 1) * d`
  - `i` is `t-1`

### Code Execution:
```python
for i in range(1, a):
    speeds[i] = min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `speeds[0] = v1`
   - `speeds[-1] = v2`

2. **For Loop**:
   - The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = a - 1`.
   - For each `i`, `speeds[i]` is updated to the minimum of two values:
     - `speeds[i - 1] + d`
     - `v2 + (t - i - 1) * d`

3. **Updating `speeds`**:
   - For each `i` in the range `1` to `a - 2`:
     - `speeds[i]` is set to the minimum of `speeds[i - 1] + d` and `v2 + (t - i - 1) * d`.

### Updated States:
- The initial conditions for `speeds` remain unchanged except for the updates within the loop.
- Specifically, for each `i` in the range `1` to `a - 2`, the value of `speeds[i]` is updated based on the above formula.

### Output State:
- `v1` remains unchanged.
- `v2` remains unchanged.
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `d` remains unchanged.
- `a` remains unchanged.
- `b` remains unchanged.
- `speeds` is updated according to the rule: `speeds[i] = min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)` for \(1 \leq i \leq a - 2\).

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`v1` is an integer such that \(1 \leq v1 \leq 100\); `v2` is an integer such that \(1 \leq v2 \leq 100\); `t` is greater than 1; `d` is an integer such that \(0 \leq d \leq 10\); `a` is an integer such that \(2 \leq a \leq 100\); `b` is an integer such that \(0 \leq b \leq 10\); `speeds` is a list with `a` elements, where `speeds[0] = v1`, `speeds[-1] = v2`, and for \(1 \leq i \leq a - 2\), `speeds[i] = min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)`**.
