The code prints the value of `mex`. The value of `mex` is the smallest positive integer not present in `arr`. Since `mex` is not affected by the print statement, its value remains unchanged. The print statement does not assign a new value to any variable, so the values of `n` and `arr` remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `arr` is a sorted list of integers, `mex` is the smallest positive integer not present in `arr`. The value of `mex` is printed.**
