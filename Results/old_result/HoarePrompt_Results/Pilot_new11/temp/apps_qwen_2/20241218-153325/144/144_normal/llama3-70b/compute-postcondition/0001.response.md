The code reads a list of integers from the user input and assigns it to the variable `arr`. The variable `n` is already assigned the integer value from the first line of standard input. After executing this line of code, the variable `n` remains unchanged, but a new list `arr` is created with the elements from the user's input.

Since the exact values of the input are not specified, we can represent the output state in a general form. The value of `n` remains the same, and `arr` is a list of integers corresponding to the second line of input split by spaces.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input from the first line of standard input (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000); `arr` is a list of integers from the second line of standard input**
