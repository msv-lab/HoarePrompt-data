Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `visited[x]` is True for all elements added to `cycle`, `cycle` contains all elements that were added during the loop execution, `x` is the final value obtained by following the path defined by `p`, `not visited[i]` is initially True and remains True if no further elements are added to `cycle`**
