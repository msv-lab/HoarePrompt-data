The code `visited[x] = True` changes the value of `visited[x]` to `True`. Since `x` must be a value such that `visited[x]` is False, after executing this line, `visited[x]` becomes `True`. The values of the other variables (`i`, `n`, `cycle`, and `x`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `cycle` is [1, 0], `x` must be a value such that `visited[x]` is `True`, `visited[0]` is `True`**
