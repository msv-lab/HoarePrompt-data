Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `visited[2]` remains True, `cycle` contains all elements that were added during the loop execution, `x` is the final value obtained by following the path defined by `p`, and `cycles` now includes the current `cycle`***
