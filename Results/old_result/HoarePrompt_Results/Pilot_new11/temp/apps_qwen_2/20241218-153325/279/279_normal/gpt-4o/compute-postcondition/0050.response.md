The code snippet `x = p[x] - 1` updates the value of `x` based on the value of `p[x]` and then subtracts 1 from it. However, the initial state does not provide the value of `p[2]`. Since `p[2]` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact new value of `x`. But we know that `x` will be updated to `p[2] - 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 2
- `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)
- `not visited[2]` must be false
- `cycle` is `[2]`
- `x` is 2
- `visited[2]` is True

After executing the code snippet:
- `x` will be updated to `p[2] - 1`

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `not visited[2]` is False, `cycle` is `[2]`, `x` is `p[2] - 1`, `visited[2]` is True**
