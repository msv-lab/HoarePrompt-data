Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n`, a permutation list `p`, and a binary list `b`. It identifies cycles in the permutation `p` and counts the number of cycles where all elements have a corresponding value of 0 in `b`. If there is only one cycle, the function prints `0`. Otherwise, it prints the count of such cycles unless the count is `0`, in which case it prints `1`. The function does not return any value but prints the result directly. Potential edge cases include when `n` is `1` (which would mean there is only one element and hence one cycle), and when there are no cycles (though the latter is unlikely given the constraints). The function handles these cases appropriately by printing `0` or `1` based on the conditions described.**
