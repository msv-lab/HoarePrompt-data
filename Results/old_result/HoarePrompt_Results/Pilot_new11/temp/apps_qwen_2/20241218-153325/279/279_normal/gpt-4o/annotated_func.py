#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, p is a list of n integers representing a permutation (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n and all p_i are unique), and b is a list of n integers consisting of zeros and ones.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    p = list(map(int, data[1:n + 1]))
    b = list(map(int, data[n + 1:2 * n + 1]))
    visited = [False] * n
    cycles = []
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            cycle = []
            x = i
            while not visited[x]:
                visited[x] = True
                cycle.append(x)

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `visited` is a list where each element is either `True` or `False` depending on whether the corresponding index was part of any cycle, `cycles` is a list of lists where each inner list represents a cycle found in the graph represented by `p`, and `p` and `b` are lists of integers as originally defined.
    no_reverse_components = sum(all(b[x] == 0 for x in cycle) for cycle in cycles)
    if (len(cycles) == 1) :
        print(0)
    else :
        print(no_reverse_components if no_reverse_components > 0 else 1)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`no_reverse_components` is the sum of boolean values based on the condition `all(b[x] == 0 for x in cycle)` for each cycle in `cycles`; `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `visited` is a list where each element is either `True` or `False` depending on whether the corresponding index was part of any cycle; `cycles` is a list of lists where each inner list represents a cycle found in the graph represented by `p`, and `p` and `b` are lists of integers as originally defined. If `len(cycles) == 1`, the function does not change `no_reverse_components`. Otherwise, the function prints `no_reverse_components` if it is greater than 0, otherwise it prints `1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n`, a permutation list `p`, and a binary list `b`. It identifies cycles in the permutation `p` and counts the number of cycles where all elements have a corresponding value of 0 in `b`. If there is only one cycle, the function prints `0`. Otherwise, it prints the count of such cycles unless the count is `0`, in which case it prints `1`. The function does not return any value but prints the result directly. Potential edge cases include when `n` is `1` (which would mean there is only one element and hence one cycle), and when there are no cycles (though the latter is unlikely given the constraints). The function handles these cases appropriately by printing `0` or `1` based on the conditions described.
