You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Pavel cooks barbecue. There are n skewers, they lay on a brazier in a row, each on one of n positions. Pavel wants each skewer to be cooked some time in every of n positions in two directions: in the one it was directed originally and in the reversed direction.

Pavel has a plan: a permutation p and a sequence b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n}, consisting of zeros and ones. Each second Pavel move skewer on position i to position p_{i}, and if b_{i} equals 1 then he reverses it. So he hope that every skewer will visit every position in both directions.

Unfortunately, not every pair of permutation p and sequence b suits Pavel. What is the minimum total number of elements in the given permutation p and the given sequence b he needs to change so that every skewer will visit each of 2n placements? Note that after changing the permutation should remain a permutation as well.

There is no problem for Pavel, if some skewer visits some of the placements several times before he ends to cook. In other words, a permutation p and a sequence b suit him if there is an integer k (k ≥ 2n), so that after k seconds each skewer visits each of the 2n placements.

It can be shown that some suitable pair of permutation p and sequence b exists for any n.


-----Input-----

The first line contain the integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) — the number of skewers.

The second line contains a sequence of integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n} (1 ≤ p_{i} ≤ n) — the permutation, according to which Pavel wants to move the skewers.

The third line contains a sequence b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n} consisting of zeros and ones, according to which Pavel wants to reverse the skewers.


-----Output-----

Print single integer — the minimum total number of elements in the given permutation p and the given sequence b he needs to change so that every skewer will visit each of 2n placements.


-----Examples-----
Input
4
4 3 2 1
0 1 1 1

Output
2

Input
3
2 3 1
0 0 0

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first example Pavel can change the permutation to 4, 3, 1, 2.

In the second example Pavel can change any element of b to 1.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, p is a list of n integers representing a permutation (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n and all p_i are unique), and b is a list of n integers consisting of zeros and ones.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    p = list(map(int, data[1:n + 1]))
    b = list(map(int, data[n + 1:2 * n + 1]))
    visited = [False] * n
    cycles = []
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            cycle = []
            x = i
            while not visited[x]:
                visited[x] = True
                cycle.append(x)
                x = p[x] - 1
            cycles.append(cycle)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `visited` is a list where each element is either `True` or `False` depending on whether the corresponding index was part of any cycle, `cycles` is a list of lists where each inner list represents a cycle found in the graph represented by `p`, and `p` and `b` are lists of integers as originally defined.
    no_reverse_components = sum(all(b[x] == 0 for x in cycle) for cycle in cycles)
    if (len(cycles) == 1) :
        print(0)
    else :
        print(no_reverse_components if no_reverse_components > 0 else 1)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`no_reverse_components` is the sum of boolean values based on the condition `all(b[x] == 0 for x in cycle)` for each cycle in `cycles`; `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `visited` is a list where each element is either `True` or `False` depending on whether the corresponding index was part of any cycle; `cycles` is a list of lists where each inner list represents a cycle found in the graph represented by `p`, and `p` and `b` are lists of integers as originally defined. If `len(cycles) == 1`, the function does not change `no_reverse_components`. Otherwise, the function prints `no_reverse_components` if it is greater than 0, otherwise it prints `1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n`, a permutation list `p`, and a binary list `b`. It identifies cycles in the permutation `p` and counts the number of cycles where all elements have a corresponding value of 0 in `b`. If there is only one cycle, the function prints `0`. Otherwise, it prints the count of such cycles unless the count is `0`, in which case it prints `1`. The function does not return any value but prints the result directly. Potential edge cases include when `n` is `1` (which would mean there is only one element and hence one cycle), and when there are no cycles (though the latter is unlikely given the constraints). The function handles these cases appropriately by printing `0` or `1` based on the conditions described.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
