To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop statement.

Given:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `p` is a list of \(n\) integers converted from the slice of `data` starting from index 1 to `n`.
- `b` is a list of \(n\) integers consisting of the integers converted from the slice of `data` starting from index \(n + 1\) to \(2 \cdot n + 1\).
- `data` is a list of strings resulting from splitting the input read from `sys.stdin.read`.
- `visited` is a list of \(n\) elements all set to `False`.
- `cycles` is an empty list.

The for loop is:
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. Therefore, `i` should start from 0 (the initial value of `i` in `range(n)`), and it should iterate up to but not including `n`.

2. **Initial Value of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i = 0` and increments by 1 each iteration, the initial state must include `i` being 0.

3. **Value of `n`**: `n` must be a valid integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).

4. **List `visited`**: The list `visited` is not used in the loop, but its initial state (`n` elements all set to `False`) is correct for the problem context.

5. **List `cycles`**: The list `cycles` is not used in the loop, but it is correctly initialized as an empty list.

Based on this analysis, the required adjustments for the loop to execute are:
- `i` should be 0.
- `n` should be a valid integer within the specified range.

Thus, the final state to be adjusted is:
**State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)**.
