`visited[x]` is assigned the value `True`. Since `x` is 2, `visited[2]` becomes `True`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `not visited[2]` must be false, `cycle` is an empty list, `x` is 2, `visited[2]` is True**
