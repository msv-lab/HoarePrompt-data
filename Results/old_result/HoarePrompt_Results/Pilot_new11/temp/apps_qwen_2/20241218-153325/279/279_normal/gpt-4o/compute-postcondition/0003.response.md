The code snippet converts a slice of the `data` list starting from index 1 to `n+1` into a list of integers and assigns this list to `p`. The other variables (`n`, `b`, and `data`) remain unchanged.

- `n` remains as the integer value from `data[0]`.
- `p` is updated to be the list of integers obtained by converting the elements from `data[1]` to `data[n]` (inclusive) to integers.
- `b` and `data` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `p` is a list of n integers converted from the slice of `data` starting from index 1 to `n`, `b` is a list of n integers consisting of zeros and ones, `data` is a list of strings resulting from splitting the input read from `sys.stdin.read`.**
