The code `h, n = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the standard input and assigns them to the variables `h` and `n`. Since the initial state specifies that `h` is an integer between 1 and 50, and `n` is an integer between 1 and \(2^h\), these constraints remain valid after the code execution. However, the specific values of `h` and `n` are now determined by the user's input.

After the code runs, the values of `h` and `n` will be updated based on the input provided, while the constraints on `h` and `n` are preserved.

Output State: **`h` is an integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 50; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^`h`**
