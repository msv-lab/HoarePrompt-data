`ans` is incremented by the value of `n // 2 - 1`. The value of `n` must be greater than 2 before being halved, but the exact value of `n` is not specified. The initial state also mentions that `h` is an integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 50, which remains unchanged by the code.

Output State: **`h` is an integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 50, `n` must be greater than 2 before being halved, and `ans` is updated by adding `n // 2 - 1` to its current value.**
