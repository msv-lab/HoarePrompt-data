The code `current_node = 2 * current_node + 2` impacts the `current_node` variable by updating its value. Initially, `current_node` is 0. According to the code, it gets updated to `2 * 0 + 2`, which is 2.

All other variables remain unchanged: `total_leaves` is still 2, `visited_count` is still 1, `path` is still the binary representation of `n - 1`, padded to length `h` with leading zeros, `current_level` remains 0, and `direction` remains not '0'.

Output State: **`total_leaves` is 2, `visited_count` is 1, `path` is the binary representation of `n - 1`, padded to length `h` with leading zeros, `current_level` is 0, `current_node` is 2, direction is not '0'**
