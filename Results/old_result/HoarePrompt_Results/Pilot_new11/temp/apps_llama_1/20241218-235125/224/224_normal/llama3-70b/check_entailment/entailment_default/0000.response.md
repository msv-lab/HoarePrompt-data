Correctness: **False**.

The provided code does not correctly calculate the number of permutations $p$ of integers $1$, $2$,..., $n$, such that $f(p)$ is equal to $f_{max}(n)$. 

The issue lies in the function `func_2(n)`, which is supposed to calculate the maximum value $f_{max}(n)$. However, this function does not correctly calculate the maximum value of $f(p)$ among all permutations $p$ of integers $1$, $2$,..., $n$. Instead, it calculates the maximum value obtained by iteratively applying `func_1` to the previous maximum and the current iteration number, from 1 to `n`, starting with `res = 0`. This is not the correct way to calculate $f_{max}(n)$, as it does not consider all possible permutations of the integers.

For example, if we consider the case where $n = 3$, the function `func_2(n)` will return $1$, while the correct maximum value $f_{max}(3)$ is $2$. This is because the function `func_2(n)` does not correctly calculate the maximum value of $f(p)$ among all permutations $p$ of integers $1$, $2$,..., $n$.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, and Correctness is **False**.
