The given code is `dp[j] %= MOD`. 

Since `j` is `f_max_n - 2`, `dp[j]` is `dp[f_max_n - 2]`. 

We know that `dp[f_max_n - 2]` is `dp[f_max_n - 2] + dp[f_max_n - 3]`. 

So, `dp[f_max_n - 2]` is updated to `(dp[f_max_n - 2] + dp[f_max_n - 3]) % MOD`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

The value of `n` is still an integer and `3 <= n <= 10^6`, `f_max_n` is still an integer representing the maximum value of `f(p)` among all permutations `p` of integers `1, 2,..., n` and must be at least 2, `MOD` is still `1000000007`, `dp` is still a list of size `f_max_n + 1`, `i` is still `3`, and `j` is still `f_max_n - 2`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer and `3 <= n <= 10^6`, `f_max_n` is an integer representing the maximum value of `f(p)` among all permutations `p` of integers `1, 2,..., n` and must be at least 2, `MOD` is `1000000007`, `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[f_max_n]` is `(dp[f_max_n] + dp[f_max_n - 1]) % MOD`, `dp[f_max_n - 1]` is `(dp[f_max_n - 1] + dp[f_max_n - 2]) % MOD`, and `dp[f_max_n - 2]` is `(dp[f_max_n - 2] + dp[f_max_n - 3]) % MOD`, `i` is `3`, and `j` is `f_max_n - 2`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer and `3 <= n <= 10^6`, `f_max_n` is an integer representing the maximum value of `f(p)` among all permutations `p` of integers `1, 2,..., n` and must be at least 2, `MOD` is `1000000007`, `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[f_max_n]` is `(dp[f_max_n] + dp[f_max_n - 1]) % MOD`, `dp[f_max_n - 1]` is `(dp[f_max_n - 1] + dp[f_max_n - 2]) % MOD`, and `dp[f_max_n - 2]` is `((dp[f_max_n - 2] + dp[f_max_n - 3]) % MOD)`, `i` is `3`, and `j` is `f_max_n - 2`**
