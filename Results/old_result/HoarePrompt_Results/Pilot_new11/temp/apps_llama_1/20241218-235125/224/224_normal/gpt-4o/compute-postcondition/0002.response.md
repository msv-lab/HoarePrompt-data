The value of `result` is updated to `result * i % mod`. Given that `result` is initially 1, `i` is 2, and `mod` is 10^9 + 7, we calculate the new value of `result` as follows: 
`result` = 1 * 2 % (10^9 + 7) = 2 % (10^9 + 7) = 2.
The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `mod` is 10^9 + 7, `result` is 2, `i` is 2.
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `mod` is 10^9 + 7, `result` is 2, `i` is 2**
