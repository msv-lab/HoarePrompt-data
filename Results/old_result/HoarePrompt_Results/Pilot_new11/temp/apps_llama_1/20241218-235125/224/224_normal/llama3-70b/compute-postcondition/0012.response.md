The value of `dp[j]` is updated to be the remainder of `dp[j]` divided by `MOD`. Since `j` is `f_max_n - 1`, `dp[j]` is `dp[f_max_n - 1]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer and `2 <= n <= 10^6`, `f_max_n` is an integer representing the maximum value of `f(p)` among all permutations `p` of integers `1, 2,..., n` and `f_max_n >= 2`, `MOD` is `1000000007`, `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 2` where `dp[0]` is `1`, `dp[f_max_n + 1]` is `0`, `dp[f_max_n - 1]` is `dp[f_max_n - 2] % MOD`, `i` is `1`, `j` is `f_max_n - 1`**
