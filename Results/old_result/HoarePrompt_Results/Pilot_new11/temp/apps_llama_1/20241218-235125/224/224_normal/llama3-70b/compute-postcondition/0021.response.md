According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `f_max_n`. If `j` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `f_max_n - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be decreased by 1. So, `j` becomes `f_max_n - 2`. 
State: **`n` is an integer and `2 <= n <= 10^6` and `n` must be greater than 1, `f_max_n` is an integer representing the maximum value of `f(p)` among all permutations `p` of integers `1, 2,..., n` and must be greater than 0, `MOD` is `1000000007`, `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[0]` is `1` and for `j` equals to `f_max_n - 1`, `dp[j]` is `(3 * dp[j - 1] + dp[j - 2]) % MOD`, and for all other `j` from `2` to `f_max_n - 2`, `dp[j]` is `(2 * dp[j - 1] + dp[j - 2]) % MOD` if `j` equals `f_max_n - 2` and `(2 * dp[j - 1] + dp[j - 2])` for other values of `j`, `i` is `2`, `j` is `f_max_n - 2`, and `dp[j]` equals `((2 * dp[j - 1] + dp[j - 2]) % MOD)`**
