The code `result = result * i % mod` updates the value of `result`. Given the initial state, `result` is 6, `i` is 4, and `mod` is 10^9 + 7. 

First, calculate `result * i`: 6 * 4 = 24. 

Then, calculate `result * i % mod`: 24 % (10^9 + 7). 

To simplify this, we can directly calculate 24 % (10^9 + 7), but since 24 is significantly smaller than 10^9 + 7, the result of the modulus operation will simply be 24, because 24 is less than 10^9 + 7.

Therefore, `result` is updated to 24. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 4, `mod` is 10^9 + 7, `result` is 24, `i` is 4**
