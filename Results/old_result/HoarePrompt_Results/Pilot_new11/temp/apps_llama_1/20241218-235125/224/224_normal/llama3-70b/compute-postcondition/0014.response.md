According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer and `2 <= n <= 10^6`. So for the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, therefore `i` is 2. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n + 1`, therefore `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 (this condition was already met) and now `n` must also be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer and `2 <= n <= 10^6` and `n` must be greater than 1, `f_max_n` is an integer representing the maximum value of `f(p)` among all permutations `p` of integers `1, 2,..., n`, `MOD` is `1000000007`, `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[0]` is `1` and `dp[j]` is the sum of `dp[j - 1]` and `dp[j - 2]`, modulo `MOD`, for all `j` from 2 to `f_max_n`, `i` is `2`**
