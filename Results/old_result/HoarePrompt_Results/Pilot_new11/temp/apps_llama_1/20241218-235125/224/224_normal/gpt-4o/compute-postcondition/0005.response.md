According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 4, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 4, but since the range starts from 2, the condition is `i` must be less than or equal to `n`. 
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 4, `mod` is 10^9 + 7, `result` is 6, `i` is 4**
