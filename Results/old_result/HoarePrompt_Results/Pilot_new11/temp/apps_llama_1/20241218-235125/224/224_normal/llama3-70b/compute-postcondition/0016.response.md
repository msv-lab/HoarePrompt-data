The value of `dp[j]` is increased by `dp[j - 1]`. The previous value of `dp[j]` was the sum of `dp[j - 1]` and `dp[j - 2]`, modulo `MOD`. Now, `dp[j]` is equal to twice `dp[j - 1]` plus `dp[j - 2]`, modulo `MOD`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer and `2 <= n <= 10^6` and `n` must be greater than 1, `f_max_n` is an integer representing the maximum value of `f(p)` among all permutations `p` of integers `1, 2,..., n` and must be greater than 0, `MOD` is `1000000007`, `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[0]` is `1` and for `j` equals to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` is `2 * dp[j - 1] + dp[j - 2]`, modulo `MOD`, and for all other `j` from 2 to `f_max_n - 1`, `dp[j]` is the sum of `dp[j - 1]` and `dp[j - 2]`, modulo `MOD`, `i` is `2`, `j` is `f_max_n`**
