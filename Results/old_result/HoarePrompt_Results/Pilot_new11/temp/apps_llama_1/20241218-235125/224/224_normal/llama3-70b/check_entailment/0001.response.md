Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly calculate the number of permutations p of integers 1, 2,..., n, such that f(p) is equal to f_{max}(n). 

The issue with the program lies in the fact that it doesn't correctly calculate f_{max}(n) and the number of permutations that achieve this maximum value. The function func_2(n) calculates the least common multiple of the numbers from 1 to n, not the maximum value of f(p) among all permutations p.

Additionally, the function func_3(n, f_max_n) seems to be calculating the number of permutations, but it's using a dynamic programming approach that doesn't accurately represent the problem. The dynamic programming approach used here doesn't consider the actual values of the permutations and their effect on the function f(p).

To correctly solve this problem, we need to find the maximum value of f(p) among all permutations p of integers 1, 2,..., n, and then count the number of permutations that achieve this maximum value. This requires a more complex approach that considers the actual values of the permutations and their effect on the function f(p).

For example, when the input is 5, the program does not correctly calculate f_{max}(5) or the number of permutations that achieve this maximum value. A correct solution would involve finding all permutations of the numbers 1 through 5, calculating f(p) for each permutation, finding the maximum value of f(p), and then counting the number of permutations that achieve this maximum value. 

Therefore, the given program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
