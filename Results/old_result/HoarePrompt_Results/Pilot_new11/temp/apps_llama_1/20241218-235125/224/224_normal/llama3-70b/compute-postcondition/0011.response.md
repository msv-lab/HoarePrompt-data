The value of `dp[j]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[j - 1]`. The previous value of `dp[j]` is `0` and the value of `dp[j - 1]` is also `0`. 

Since `j` is `f_max_n - 1`, `dp[j - 1]` is `dp[f_max_n - 1 - 1]` which is `dp[f_max_n - 2]`. The value of `dp[f_max_n - 2]` is `0`. 

So, `dp[j]` becomes `0 + 0` which is `0` but since `dp[j - 1]` was `0` and we added it to `dp[j]`, `dp[j]` is still `0`. 

All the other variables remain unchanged. 

So, the output state is: `n` is an integer and `2 <= n <= 10^6`, `f_max_n` is an integer representing the maximum value of `f(p)` among all permutations `p` of integers `1, 2,..., n` and `f_max_n >= 2`, `MOD` is `1000000007`, `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 2` where `dp[0]` is `1`, `dp[j]` is `dp[f_max_n - 1]` is `0`, `dp[f_max_n + 1]` is `0` and all other elements are `0` except `dp[j]` which is `dp[j-1]`, `i` is `1`, `j` is `f_max_n - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer and `2 <= n <= 10^6`, `f_max_n` is an integer representing the maximum value of `f(p)` among all permutations `p` of integers `1, 2,..., n` and `f_max_n >= 2`, `MOD` is `1000000007`, `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 2` where `dp[0]` is `1`, `dp[f_max_n + 1]` is `0`, `dp[f_max_n - 1]` is `dp[f_max_n - 2]`, `i` is `1`, `j` is `f_max_n - 1`**
