Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly calculate the number of permutations `p` such that `f(p)` is equal to `f_max(n)`. 

The issue lies in the function `func_2(n)` and `func_3(n, f_max_n)`. 

`func_2(n)` calculates the maximum value of `f(p)` among all permutations `p` of integers `1, 2,..., n`, which is incorrect. It calculates the GCD of all numbers from 1 to `n`, not the maximum number of distinct GCDs among all permutations.

`func_3(n, f_max_n)` attempts to calculate the number of permutations `p` such that `f(p)` is equal to `f_max(n)`, but it uses a dynamic programming approach that does not correctly model the problem. 

To correctly solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of distinct GCDs among all permutations of integers `1, 2,..., n`, and then count the number of permutations that achieve this maximum. 

The correct approach would involve generating all permutations of integers `1, 2,..., n`, calculating the GCDs for each permutation, and then counting the number of permutations that achieve the maximum number of distinct GCDs.

The given program does not follow this approach and therefore does not correctly solve the problem. 

Here is a high-level explanation of why this program does not solve the problem:
- The `func_2(n)` function is supposed to calculate `f_max(n)`, but it does not do this correctly. It calculates the GCD of all numbers from 1 to `n`, not the maximum number of distinct GCDs among all permutations.
- The `func_3(n, f_max_n)` function attempts to calculate the number of permutations `p` such that `f(p)` is equal to `f_max(n)`, but it uses a dynamic programming approach that does not correctly model the problem.
- The program does not generate all permutations of integers `1, 2,..., n`, calculate the GCDs for each permutation, and then count the number of permutations that achieve the maximum number of distinct GCDs. 

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem and the correctness is **False**.
