Correctness: **False**

The given Python program does not handle all potential cases as specified in the problem description. For example, the program does not handle the case when the input array has multiple non-zero elements that can be grouped together to form subarrays with non-zero sums.

One example of this is when the input array is `[1, -2, 1, -1]`. In this case, the program should group the first two elements (`1` and `-2`) together and the last two elements (`1` and `-1`) together, resulting in two subarrays with non-zero sums: `[1, -2]` and `[1, -1]`. However, the program does not handle this case correctly and prints `NO`.

The problem in the program lies in its logic of handling cases when the total sum of the array is not zero. It simply prints `YES` and tries to split the array into two parts, but it does not consider all possible ways of grouping the elements together to form subarrays with non-zero sums.

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to consider all possible ways of grouping the elements together and find the correct way to split the array into subarrays with non-zero sums. The program should also handle cases when there are multiple ways to split the array into subarrays with non-zero sums, and it should print any one of these correct solutions.

Here's a revised version of the program that should handle all potential cases correctly:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    total_sum = sum(A)
    if total_sum == 0:
        print('NO')
        return
    result = []
    current_sum = 0
    start = 0
    for i in range(n):
        current_sum += A[i]
        if current_sum!= 0:
            if i == n - 1 or current_sum - A[i + 1]!= 0:
                result.append((start + 1, i + 1))
                start = i + 1
                current_sum = 0
    print('YES')
    print(len(result))
    for start, end in result:
        print(start, end)

func()
```

This revised program first checks if the total sum of the array is zero. If it is, the program prints `NO` because it's not possible to split the array into subarrays with non-zero sums.

If the total sum of the array is not zero, the program tries to group the elements together to form subarrays with non-zero sums. It keeps track of the current sum of the elements in the current subarray and the start index of the current subarray.

When the current sum is not zero, the program checks if it has reached the end of the array or if the current sum minus the next element is not zero. If either condition is true, it means that the current subarray has a non-zero sum, so the program adds the current subarray to the result and resets the current sum and start index.

Finally, the program prints `YES` and the number of subarrays, followed by the start and end indices of each subarray.
