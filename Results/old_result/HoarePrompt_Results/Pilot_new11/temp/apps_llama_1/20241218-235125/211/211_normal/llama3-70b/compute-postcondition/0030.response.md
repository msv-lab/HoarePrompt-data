The value of `l` is updated to be equal to `r`. Since `r` equals `n`, `l` is now equal to `n`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`A` is a list of integers with a length of `n`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `n` is greater than 1, `prefix_sum` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `prefix_sum[i]` is the sum of all elements in `a` up to index `i-1`, `i` is `n`, `prefix_sum[n]` is not equal to 0, 'YES' has been printed, `k` has been incremented by 1, `l` equals `n`, and `r` equals `n`**
