Postcondition: **`A` is a list of integers with a length of `n`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `n` is greater than 0, `prefix_sum` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `prefix_sum[i]` is the sum of all elements in `a` up to index `i-1`, `i` is `n-1`, initially `k` is `1`, initially `l` is `1`, `prefix_sum[n]` is not equal to 0, 'YES' has been printed, and initially `r` is 1. The current value of `r` is such that `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to 0 and `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`.**
