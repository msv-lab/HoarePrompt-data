According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`A` is a list of integers with a length of `n`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `n` is greater than 1, `prefix_sum` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `prefix_sum[0]` is 0 and `prefix_sum[1]` is `a[0]`, `i` is 1**
