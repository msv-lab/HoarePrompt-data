Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description. The main issue is in the way it prints the indices of the subsequences. According to the problem description, the program should print the number of subsequences (k) followed by the start and end indices of each subsequence. However, the program prints the indices in a different format, which does not match the problem description.

Specifically, the program prints the indices in the following format: `print(k, l, r)`, where `k` is the current subsequence number, `l` is the start index of the current subsequence, and `r` is the end index of the current subsequence. This does not match the problem description, which requires the program to print the number of subsequences (k) followed by the start and end indices of each subsequence.

Additionally, the program has an extra print statement `print(k, l, n)` after the loop, which is not necessary and does not follow the problem description.

To fix this issue, the program should be modified to print the indices in the correct format, as specified in the problem description. The corrected code should look something like this:
```python
print('YES')
k = 0
l = 1
for r in range(1, n + 1):
    if prefix_sum[r]!= 0 and prefix_sum[r]!= prefix_sum[n]:
        k += 1
print(k)
for i in range(k):
    print(l, r)
    l = r + 1
print(l, n)
```
This corrected code prints the number of subsequences (k) followed by the start and end indices of each subsequence, as required by the problem description.
