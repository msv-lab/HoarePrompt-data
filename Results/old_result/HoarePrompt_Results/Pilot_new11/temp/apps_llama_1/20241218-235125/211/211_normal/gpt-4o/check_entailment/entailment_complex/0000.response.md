Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description for every potential case. 

Here's why it's incorrect:

1. **Handling the case where the sum of the array is zero**: In the problem description, if the sum of the elements in the array A is zero, the program should print 'NO' as it's not possible to split the array into new arrays with non-zero sums. However, the given program does not handle this case correctly. It only checks for the first non-zero element and tries to split the array based on that, which is not in line with the problem description.

2. **Handling the case where all elements are zero**: The program does not print 'NO' when all elements in the array are zero. In such a case, it's impossible to split the array into new arrays with non-zero sums, and 'NO' should be printed according to the problem description.

3. **Splitting the array into new arrays with non-zero sums**: The problem description allows for the array to be split into possibly one new array, and the sum of elements in each of the new arrays should not be zero. However, the given program does not correctly implement this logic for all cases, especially when the sum of the array is not zero and there are multiple ways to split the array.

To meet the requirements outlined in the problem description, the program should be revised to correctly handle the cases where the sum of the array is zero, and to properly split the array into new arrays with non-zero sums. The current implementation does not cover all possible scenarios and therefore does not always follow the problem description.
