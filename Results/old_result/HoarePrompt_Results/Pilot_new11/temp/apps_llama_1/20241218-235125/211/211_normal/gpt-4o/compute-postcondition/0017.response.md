The provided Python code snippet simply prints the string 'YES'. This operation does not modify any variables. 

The initial state given is: `A` is a list where `A[0]` is an integer `n` with 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, the elements in `A` (excluding `A[0]`) sum up to `-A[0]`, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2.

After running the code, the values of `A`, `total_sum`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged because the print statement does not affect these variables.

Output State: **`A` is a list where `A[0]` is an integer `n` with 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, the elements in `A` (excluding `A[0]`) sum up to `-A[0]`, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2, and 'YES' has been printed.**
