Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not meet the requirements of the problem description. If the sum of the array elements is zero, the code checks for the first non-zero element and splits the array into two parts: from the start to the index of the non-zero element and from the index after the non-zero element to the end. However, this approach is incorrect because it only considers the case where the first non-zero element is found, but it does not consider the case where the sum of a subarray within the array is not zero.

A counterexample is the input:

4
0 0 1 -1

In this case, the sum of the array is zero, and the code should print "NO" because it is not possible to split the array into subarrays with non-zero sums. However, the code will incorrectly print "YES" and split the array into two parts.

The correct approach would be to use a dynamic programming approach to find all possible subarrays with non-zero sums and then check if it is possible to split the array into these subarrays. The provided code does not implement this approach correctly, and therefore, it is incorrect.
