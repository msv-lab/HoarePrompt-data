The code prints '1' and the value of `i + 1`. The value of `i` is 1, so `i + 1` equals 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. '1' and `i + 1` (which is 2) have been printed in addition to 'YES' and '2'. The elements in `A` (excluding `A[0]`) still sum up to `-A[0]`. 

Output State: **`A` is a list where `A[0]` is an integer `n` with 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, the elements in `A` (excluding `A[0]`) sum up to `-A[0]`, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2, 'YES' has been printed, '2' has been printed, '1' has been printed, and '2' has been printed again.**
