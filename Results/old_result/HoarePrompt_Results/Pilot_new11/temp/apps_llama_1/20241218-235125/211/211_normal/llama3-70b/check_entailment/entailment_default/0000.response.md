Correctness: **False**.

The code provided attempts to split an array into subarrays where the sum of elements in each subarray is non-zero. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the code does not correctly implement this functionality for all cases.

One major issue with the code is that it does not correctly handle the case where a subarray's sum is equal to the total sum of the array. In the given code, when it encounters a subarray whose sum is equal to the total sum, it simply moves on to the next element without considering the possibility of including the current element in a new subarray.

Additionally, the code's output format does not match the expected format specified in the problem description. The code prints the count of subsequences, the start index of the last subsequence, and the total length of the list on the same line, whereas the problem description requires that the count of subsequences be printed on a separate line, followed by the start and end indices of each subsequence on separate lines.

For example, given the input:
```
4
1 2 3 -5
```
The code will output:
```
YES
1 1 4
```
However, the correct output should be:
```
YES
4
1 1
2 2
3 3
4 4
```
This indicates that the code does not correctly split the array into subarrays with non-zero sums and does not produce the expected output format. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
