Postcondition: ***`A` is a list of integers with a length of `n`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `n` is greater than 1, `prefix_sum` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `prefix_sum[i]` is the sum of all elements in `a` up to index `i-1`, `i` is `n`, `prefix_sum[n]` is not equal to 0, 'YES' has been printed, if `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, then `k` has been incremented by 1 and `l` equals `n` and `r` equals `n`, otherwise the state of `k` and `l` remains as before the if statement and `r` equals `n`***
