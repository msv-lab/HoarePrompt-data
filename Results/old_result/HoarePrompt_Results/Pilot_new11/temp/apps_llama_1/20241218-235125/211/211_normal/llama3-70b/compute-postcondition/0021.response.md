Postcondition: **`A` is a list of integers with a length of `n`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `n` is greater than 0, `prefix_sum` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `prefix_sum[i]` is the sum of all elements in `a` up to index `i-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `prefix_sum[n]` is not equal to 0, 'YES' has been printed. If `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, then `k` is 2, `l` is 1, `r` is 1, and the values of `k`, `l`, and `r` have been printed as `1 1 1`. Otherwise, the values of `k`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged as `1 1 1` has already been printed.**
