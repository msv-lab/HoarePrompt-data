To calculate the output state, we first note that the initial state includes `m` as a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, `mid` is initially `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`, and `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`. However, the given code snippet updates the value of `mid` to `(low + high) // 2`. 

Given that `low` and `high` are not explicitly defined in the initial state, we assume they are part of the context and their values are such that `low` is less than or equal to `high` to ensure `mid` is a valid intermediate value. The code does not provide information on how `low` and `high` are related to `m` or the initial `mid`, so we proceed with the understanding that `mid` is updated based on `low` and `high`, without specific values for these variables.

The update of `mid` to `(low + high) // 2` implies that its value is now dependent on `low` and `high`, not directly on `m` as before. The value of `m`, the definition of `func_1(mid)`, and the initial calculation of `zeroes` based on the original `mid` are not affected by this update. However, the relationship between `mid` and `m` is changed.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1` based on the original `mid` which was `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`, and `low` must be less than or equal to `high`.**
