Correctness: **True**

The code provided seems to correctly solve the problem of finding the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. 

Function `func_1` calculates the number of trailing zeroes in `n!` by counting the number of factors of 5 in all the numbers from 1 to `n`, which determines the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `n`.

Function `func_2` uses a binary search approach to find the range of values for which `func_1` returns exactly `m` trailing zeroes when calculating the factorial of a number. Once it finds a value that satisfies this condition, it expands around this value to determine the exact range.

The provided output hints agree with the code and suggest that the functions handle all positive integer inputs correctly. 

The code also handles edge cases where no such range exists by returning an empty list.

The given examples also seem to match the expected output, with the first example returning 5 values (5, 6, 7, 8, 9) for `m = 1` and the second example returning an empty list for `m = 5`.

Overall, based on the provided code and output hints, the program seems to be correct and should work as expected for all valid inputs.
