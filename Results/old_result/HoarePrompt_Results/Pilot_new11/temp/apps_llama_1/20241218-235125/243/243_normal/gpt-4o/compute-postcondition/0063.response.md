To calculate the output state, we first need to understand the given initial state and how the provided Python code affects it.

Given initial state: 
- `m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`.
- `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
- `mid` is the integer part of `(low + high) / 2`.
- `zeroes` is equal to `func_1(mid)`.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
high = mid - 1
```

This line of code updates the value of `high` to be one less than `mid`. 

So, after executing this code:
- The value of `m` remains unchanged as there's no operation performed on it.
- The relationship between `low` and `high` might change because `high` is decreased, but we know `low` is less than or equal to the original `high`, and now `high` is `mid - 1`.
- `mid` is calculated based on the original `low` and `high`, but its value doesn't change here; it's just used to calculate the new `high`.
- `zeroes` is still equal to `func_1(mid)`, as there's no operation that changes `zeroes` or `mid` in this snippet.

The new `high` is `mid - 1`, which means the range defined by `low` and `high` has narrowed down, with `high` being decreased by 1 from its midpoint.

Therefore, the output state, considering all provided information and the change made by the code, is:
Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is the integer part of `(original_low + original_high) / 2`, `high` is `mid - 1`, and `zeroes` is equal to `func_1(mid)`**
