`high` is updated to be `mid - 1`. The value of `mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`. 
Since `high` was initially `5 * (m + 1)`, and `mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`, `high` becomes `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2 - 1`.
The states of the other variables are not affected. 
The value of `zeroes` is greater than `m` and is the return value of `func_1(mid)`.
The value of `m` is still a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`.
The value of `low` is still `0`.
The value of `result` is still an empty list.
The value of `mid` is still `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`.
Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, `low` is `0`, `high` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2 - 1`, `result` is an empty list, `mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`, `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)` and is greater than `m`.
Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, `low` is `0`, `high` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2 - 1`, `result` is an empty list, `mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`, `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)` and is greater than `m`**
