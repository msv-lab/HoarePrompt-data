The code updates the value of `low` to `mid + 1`. The value of `mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`. 

Given that `m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, the value of `mid` is calculated as `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`, and `low` is updated to `mid + 1`.

The other variables are not affected by the code. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, `low` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2 + 1`, `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, `result` is an empty list, `mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`, and the current value of `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)` which is less than `m`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, `low` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2 + 1`, `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, `result` is an empty list, `mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`, and the current value of `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)` which is less than `m`.**
