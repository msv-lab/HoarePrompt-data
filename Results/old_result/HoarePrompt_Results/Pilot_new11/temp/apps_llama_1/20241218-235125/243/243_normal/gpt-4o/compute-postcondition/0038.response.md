The code snippet `result = []` assigns an empty list to the variable `result`. This operation does not change the values of the existing variables `m`, `mid`, `zeroes`, `low`, or `high`. 

The initial state conditions, such as `m` being a positive integer between 1 and 100,000, `mid` being the average of `low` and `high`, `zeroes` being the return value of `func_1((low + high) // 2)`, and `low` being less than or equal to `high`, remain unchanged.

However, a new variable `result` is introduced and assigned an empty list as its value.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1((low + high) // 2)`, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, and `result` is an empty list `[]`.**
