To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition of the `while` loop, which is `func_1(left) == m`.

1. **Understanding the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `func_1(left)` equals `m`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `func_1(left)` must still equal `m` after the previous iteration.

2. **Analyzing `func_1(left)`**: The function `func_1` and its behavior are not specified. However, we know that `left` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2 - 2` at the end of the previous iteration. To ensure the loop can execute again, we need `func_1(left)` to remain equal to `m`.

3. **Considering the State Variables**:
   - `m` is a constant within the loop's context since it's defined by the problem statement as a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`. Its value doesn't change based on the loop iterations.
   - `low` and `high` are not directly involved in the loop condition but could be modified within the loop body (not shown). Their current values are `0` and `5 * (m + 1)`, respectively.
   - `result` is an empty list, which implies it might be used to accumulate some results from the loop, but it doesn't affect the loop condition.
   - `mid` is calculated as `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`, which is used to derive `left`. It's a constant value based on `m`.
   - `zeroes` equals `m`, but its role in the loop is not clear without the loop body. It doesn't directly affect the loop condition.
   - `left` is derived from `mid` and is crucial for the loop condition.

Given that `func_1(left)` must equal `m` for the loop to continue, and without specific knowledge of what `func_1` does, we can't adjust `left` or any other variable directly based on the function's behavior. However, we know that for the loop to potentially execute again, the condition `func_1(left) == m` must hold true.

Since the loop body is omitted, we can't accurately predict how `left` or other variables might be modified to ensure the condition holds. However, to give the loop the chance to execute again based solely on the information provided and without assuming the specifics of `func_1`, we must acknowledge that the condition `func_1(left) == m` needs to be potentially true after adjustments.

Given this, and the fact that we don't have the specifics of `func_1`, the most accurate adjustment is conceptual: acknowledging the loop can continue if `func_1(left)` can be made to equal `m` again, which might involve adjusting `left` or other factors influencing `func_1` in a way that's not specified by the problem statement.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, `low` is `0`, `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, `result` is an empty list, `mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`, `zeroes` is equal to `m`, `left` must be such that `func_1(left)` equals `m`**
