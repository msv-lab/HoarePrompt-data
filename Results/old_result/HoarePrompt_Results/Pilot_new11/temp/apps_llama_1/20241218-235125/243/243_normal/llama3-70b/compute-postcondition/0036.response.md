To solve this problem, we first need to understand the initial state and the given Python code snippet.


Initial State: `n` is the smallest integer such that `n // 5 > 0` and `ans` is a list of integers.


The smallest integer `n` such that `n // 5 > 0` is 5 (since 5 // 5 = 1) but we don't have any other restrictions on n. However, `ans` is also defined in this state and thus should be taken into consideration when describing the final state. 

Given the initial state and the code:


The code is `return len(ans)`. However, there's no function that this return statement seems to belong to in the provided code snippet, so it will be assumed this is part of a larger code and return statement's parent function is defined somewhere else.


This return statement doesn't change `n` or `ans`, it simply returns the length of `ans`.


Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `n // 5 > 0`, `ans` is a list of integers and the length of `ans` has been returned**.
