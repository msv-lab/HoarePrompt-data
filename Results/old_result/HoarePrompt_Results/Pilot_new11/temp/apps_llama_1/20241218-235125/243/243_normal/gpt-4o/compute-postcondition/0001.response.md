The code initializes two variables, `low` and `high`, and assigns them values based on the value of `m`. Specifically, `low` is assigned the value `0`, and `high` is assigned the value `5 * (m + 1)`. 

The value of `m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`. 

Therefore, the value of `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, which is between `5 * (1 + 1)` and `5 * (100,000 + 1)`, or between `10` and `500,005`. 

The state of `m` is not affected by the code.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, `low` is `0`, `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`**
