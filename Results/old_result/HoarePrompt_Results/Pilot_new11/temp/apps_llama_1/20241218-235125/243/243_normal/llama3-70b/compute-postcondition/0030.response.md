According to the code, the loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will continue to execute indefinitely until it encounters a break statement. Since there is no condition that needs to be met for the loop to execute again, no states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is 3, `count` is a finite value, `m` is greater than 1, `ans` is [1]**
