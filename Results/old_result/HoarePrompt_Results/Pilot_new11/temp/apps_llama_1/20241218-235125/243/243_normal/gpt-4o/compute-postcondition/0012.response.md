The given code snippet is `result = []`. This line of code reinitializes the `result` variable to an empty list.

Given the initial state: 
- `m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`
- `low` is `0`
- `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`
- `result` is an empty list
- `mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`
- `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`
- `zeroes` is greater than or equal to `m`
- `zeroes` is equal to `m`

After executing the code, the value of `result` is reset to an empty list. The values of the other variables (`m`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `zeroes`) remain unchanged because the code does not modify them.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, `low` is `0`, `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, `result` is an empty list, `mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`, `zeroes` is equal to `m`**
