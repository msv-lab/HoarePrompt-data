Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of positive integers `n` such that the factorial of `n` ends with exactly `m` zeroes. 

The issue lies in the way the program calculates the count of trailing zeroes. The current implementation only checks for the power of 5 in the factorial, which is not sufficient. 

A correct approach would involve finding the highest power of 5 that divides `n!` and then checking if the corresponding power of 2 is sufficient to form the required number of trailing zeroes.

For example, if the input is 3, the program will output incorrect results because it only considers the power of 5 and does not take into account the power of 2.

Here is a correct implementation:

```python
def find_trailing_zeroes(m):
    def count_trailing_zeroes(n):
        count = 0
        i = 5
        while n // i >= 1:
            count += n // i
            i *= 5
        return count

    ans = []
    n = 1
    while True:
        if count_trailing_zeroes(n) > m:
            break
        if count_trailing_zeroes(n) == m:
            ans.append(n)
        n += 1

    print(len(ans))
    print(' '.join(map(str, ans)))

find_trailing_zeroes(int(input()))
```

This implementation correctly calculates the number of trailing zeroes in `n!` and finds all `n` that satisfy the given condition.
