To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given `while` loop statement and the provided program state at the end of the previous iteration.

The `while` loop statement is `while func_1(right) == m:`. This means the loop will continue to execute as long as the result of `func_1(right)` is equal to `m`.

Given program state:
- `m` is unchanged
- `low` is 0
- `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`
- `result` is an empty list
- `mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`
- `zeroes` equals the original value of `m`
- `left` is the first value less than the original `left` for which `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`
- `right` is `((5 * (m + 1)) // 2) + 3`

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `func_1(right) == m` must still be true. Here's how we can adjust our understanding based on the given information:

1. **`m` being unchanged** does not directly affect the loop condition since `m` is a constant in this context.
2. **`low` is 0** and **`high` is `5 * (m + 1)`** provide context but don't directly impact the condition for the next iteration.
3. **`result` is an empty list** doesn't affect the loop condition directly.
4. **`mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`** gives context but doesn't directly influence the loop's condition for the next iteration.
5. **`zeroes` equals the original value of `m`** offers context about the original state but does not impact the loop condition directly.
6. **`left` is the first value less than the original `left` for which `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`**. This tells us about the behavior of `func_1` for values less than the original `left`, but it doesn't directly impact the condition for the next iteration of the loop regarding `right`.
7. **`right` is `((5 * (m + 1)) // 2) + 3`**. For the loop to continue, `func_1(right)` must equal `m`. This means `right` must be a value for which `func_1` returns `m`.

Given that `left` is defined as the first value less than the original `left` where `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, and considering we need `func_1(right)` to equal `m` for the loop to execute again, we can infer:

- The loop will continue if there are values of `right` for which `func_1(right)` equals `m`.
- Since `right` is `((5 * (m + 1)) // 2) + 3`, and we want `func_1(right)` to equal `m`, no specific adjustment to `right` or `m` is mentioned in the context that would prevent the loop from executing. The condition is about the function's output matching `m`, not directly about the value of `right` itself.

However, considering the given conditions and the fact that we are looking at the state at the end of the previous iteration to see if the loop can execute one more time, we recognize that:

- The fact that `left` is the first value less than the original `left` for which `func_1(left)` does not equal `m` suggests we are searching for or have found a boundary condition related to `func_1`'s behavior.
- The loop's continuation depends on `func_1(right)` equaling `m`, which means the current value of `right` must satisfy this condition for the loop to execute again.

Thus, no explicit adjustments to the states are needed based on the condition provided, other than ensuring `func_1(right)` equals `m`, which is already implied by the loop condition itself and the fact that `right`'s value is given as a specific calculation based on `m`. The state adjustments are implicit in the loop's condition and the provided variable states.

State: **`m` is unchanged, `low` is 0, `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, `result` is an empty list, `mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`, `zeroes` equals the original value of `m`, `left` is the first value less than the original `left` for which `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, and `right` is `((5 * (m + 1)) // 2) + 3`**
