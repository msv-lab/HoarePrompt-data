To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given `while` loop condition: `while func_1(right) == m`.

1. The loop can execute if `func_1(right)` equals `m`.
2. Given that `right` is `(low + high) // 2 + 1`, for `func_1(right)` to equal `m`, `right` must be a value for which `func_1` returns `m`.
3. Since `left` is the first value less than or equal to `(low + high) // 2` for which `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, and `right` is `(low + high) // 2 + 1`, it implies that there could be values greater than `(low + high) // 2` for which `func_1` returns `m`.
4. `zeroes` is the original return value of `func_1((low + high) // 2)`, but this does not directly affect the condition for the `while` loop to execute, as the loop condition depends on `func_1(right)`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the essential condition is that `func_1(right)` must equal `m`. Given that `right` is defined as `(low + high) // 2 + 1`, we must ensure that there exists a scenario where `func_1` of this `right` value equals `m`. This condition is already implicit in the setup, given the definitions of `left`, `right`, and the relationship between `low` and `high`.

However, to explicitly state the conditions under which the loop can execute, we must recognize that:
- `m` is unchanged, implying its value is consistent.
- `right` must be a value such that `func_1(right)` equals `m`, which is feasible given the definitions.
- Other variables like `mid`, `zeroes`, `low`, `high`, `result`, and `left` do not directly affect the loop's ability to execute one more time based on the condition `func_1(right) == m`.

Thus, the primary condition for the loop to execute one more time is that `func_1(right)` must equal `m`, and the given state already supports this possibility by defining `right` in a manner that could satisfy this condition, given the appropriate behavior of `func_1`.

State: **`m` is unchanged, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is the original return value of `func_1((low + high) // 2)`, `low` and `high` are unchanged, `result` is an empty list `[]`, `left` is the first value less than or equal to `(low + high) // 2` for which `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, and `right` is `(low + high) // 2 + 1` and `func_1(right)` equals `m`**
