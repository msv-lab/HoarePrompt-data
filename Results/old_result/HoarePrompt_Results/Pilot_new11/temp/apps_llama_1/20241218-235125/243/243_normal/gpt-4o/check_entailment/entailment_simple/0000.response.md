Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. The problem asks to find the number of positive integers `n` such that the factorial of `n` ends with exactly `m` zeroes.
2. The program uses a binary search approach to find the range of values for `n` that satisfy this condition.
3. The `func_1` function correctly calculates the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of a given number `n`. This is done by dividing `n` by powers of 5 and summing up the quotients, which is a well-known method for calculating the number of trailing zeroes in a factorial.
4. The `func_2` function uses `func_1` to find the range of values for `n` that have exactly `m` trailing zeroes. It does this by performing a binary search over the possible values of `n` and adjusting the search range based on the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of the current value.
5. Once the correct range is found, the program generates a list of integers within that range and returns it.
6. The program handles the case where no values of `n` have exactly `m` trailing zeroes by returning an empty list.

The program's correctness can be demonstrated by analyzing its behavior for different inputs. For example:

* If `m = 1`, the program will find the values of `n` that have exactly 1 trailing zero in their factorial, which are `n = 5, 6, 7, 8, 9`. This is because `5! = 120`, `6! = 720`, `7! = 5040`, `8! = 40320`, and `9! = 362880`, all of which have exactly 1 trailing zero.
* If `m = 5`, the program will return an empty list because there are no values of `n` that have exactly 5 trailing zeroes in their factorial.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem and produces the expected output for different inputs.
