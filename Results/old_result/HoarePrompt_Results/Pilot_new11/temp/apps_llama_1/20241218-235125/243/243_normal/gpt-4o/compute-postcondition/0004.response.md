To find the output state, we first need to understand the given initial state and then apply the provided Python code snippet to it.

Given initial state:
- `m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`
- `low` is `0`
- `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`
- `result` is an empty list

The Python code snippet is:
```python
mid = (low + high) // 2
```

Applying the code:
- `low` is `0`
- `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`
- Therefore, `mid` is calculated as `(0 + 5 * (m + 1)) // 2`

Simplifying the expression for `mid`:
- `mid = (5 * (m + 1)) // 2`
- Since `5 * (m + 1)` will always be an odd number (because `m` is a positive integer and `5` times an odd number is odd), and we are doing integer division (`//`), the result will be the integer part of the division, effectively rounding down.

Given that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, 
- The minimum value of `5 * (m + 1)` is `5 * (1 + 1) = 10`, making `mid` at least `(10) // 2 = 5`.
- The maximum value of `5 * (m + 1)` is `5 * (100,000 + 1) = 500,005`, making `mid` at most `(500,005) // 2 = 250,002`.

Thus, the value of `mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`, which is an integer between `5` and `250,002` (inclusive), depending on the value of `m`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, `low` is `0`, `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, `result` is an empty list, and `mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`**
