To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and initial state.

Initial State: 
- `m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`
- `low` is `0`
- `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`
- `result` is an empty list
- `mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`

Given Code:
```python
zeroes = func_1(mid)
```

The code calls a function `func_1` with the argument `mid` and assigns the return value of this function to the variable `zeroes`. 

Since the definition of `func_1` is not provided, we can't determine the exact value or nature of `zeroes` without knowing what `func_1` does. However, we can say that `zeroes` will be equal to the return value of `func_1(mid)`.

The states of `m`, `low`, `high`, `result`, and `mid` are not affected by this line of code because it only introduces a new variable `zeroes` without modifying any existing variables.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
- `m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`
- `low` is `0`
- `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`
- `result` is an empty list
- `mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`
- `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, `low` is `0`, `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, `result` is an empty list, `mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`, and `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`.**
