The value of `result` is updated to be a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1` (inclusive), since the `range` function in Python generates numbers up to but not including the stop value. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`right` is the first value greater than the original value of `mid` for which `func_1(right)` does not equal the original value of `m`, `m` remains the same, `low` remains the same, `high` remains the same, `mid` remains the same, `zeroes` remains the same, `left` remains the first value less than or equal to the original value of `mid` for which `func_1(left)` does not equal the original value of `m`, `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`**
