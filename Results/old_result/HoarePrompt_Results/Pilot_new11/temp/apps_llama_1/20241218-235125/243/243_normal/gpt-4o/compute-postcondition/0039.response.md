`left` is assigned the value of `mid`, and `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1((low + high) // 2)`, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `result` is an empty list `[]`, and `left` is `(low + high) // 2`**
