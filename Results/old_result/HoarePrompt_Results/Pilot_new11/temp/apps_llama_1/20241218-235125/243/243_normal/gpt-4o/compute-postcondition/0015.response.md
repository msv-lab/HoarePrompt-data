The code decrements the value of `left` by 1. Initially, `left` is equal to `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`. After decrementing by 1, `left` becomes `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2 - 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, `low` is `0`, `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, `result` is an empty list, `mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`, `zeroes` is equal to `m`, `left` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2 - 1`**
