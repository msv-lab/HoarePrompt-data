To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state provides the following information:
- `m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`.
- `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`.
- `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1` based on the original `mid`, which was `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`.
- `low` must be less than or equal to `high`.

The code provided is:
```python
zeroes = func_1(mid)
```

This line of code calls the function `func_1` with the argument `mid` and assigns the return value of `func_1(mid)` to the variable `zeroes`. 

Given the initial state, `mid` was originally `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`, but its current value before executing the given line of code is `(low + high) // 2`. This indicates that `mid` has been updated at some point to be the average of `low` and `high`, but we don't know the exact values of `low` and `high` except that `low` is less than or equal to `high`.

Since `zeroes` is now directly assigned the return value of `func_1(mid)`, where `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, we don't have information on what `func_1` does or what its return value would be for any given `mid`. Thus, we cannot determine a specific value for `zeroes` without knowing the implementation of `func_1`. 

However, we can say that `zeroes` is now updated to be the result of `func_1` applied to the current value of `mid`, which is the average of `low` and `high`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1((low + high) // 2)`, and `low` must be less than or equal to `high`.**
