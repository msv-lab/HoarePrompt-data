To determine the output state of the loop, we can analyze the pattern in the given output states after each iteration and consider the loop's condition.

The loop continues as long as `func_1(left)` equals `m`. This means the loop will decrement `left` until `func_1(left)` is no longer equal to `m`. 

Given the initial state and the output states after each iteration, we can observe the following:
- `m` remains a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`.
- `low` is less than or equal to `high`, but their values do not change within the loop.
- `mid` is the integer part of `(low + high) / 2`, and like `low` and `high`, its value does not change during the loop.
- `zeroes` is equal to `func_1(mid)`, which is also equal to `m` in the given output states. However, `zeroes` does not change within the loop.
- `result` remains an empty list since there are no operations modifying it within the loop.
- `left` starts as `mid` and decrements by 1 in each iteration until `func_1(left)` is no longer equal to `m`.

From this analysis, the loop's purpose appears to be finding the largest value of `left` (starting from `mid`) for which `func_1(left)` equals `m`, and then stopping. Since `func_1(left)` is not defined within the provided code snippet, we can infer its role from the loop's behavior: it seems to be a function that, given an input, returns a value that can be compared to `m`.

After the loop finishes, the following conditions will be true:
- `m` will still be the same positive integer as initially set.
- `low`, `high`, and `mid` will retain their initial values.
- `zeroes` will remain equal to `m` (or `func_1(mid)`).
- `result` will still be an empty list.
- `left` will be the first value (starting from `mid` and moving downwards) for which `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`. If `func_1(mid)` equals `m` and there's no smaller value for which this holds, `left` would decrement until it finds such a value or theoretically could go below the initial `low` if all values between `mid` and `low` (inclusive) result in `m` when passed through `func_1`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is the integer part of `(low + high) / 2`, `zeroes` is equal to `m`, `result` is an empty list, and `left` is the first value less than or equal to `mid` for which `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`.**
