To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state provides that `m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, and `low` must be less than or equal to `high`. 

The code calculates `mid` as the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high` by 2.

Therefore, `mid` is assigned the value of the average of `low` and `high`, rounded down to the nearest integer because of the integer division `//`.

Since `low` is less than or equal to `high`, the value of `mid` will be greater than or equal to `low` and less than or equal to `high`.

The value of `m` and the relationship between `low` and `high` are not directly affected by this operation.

Hence, the output state is: `m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, and `mid` is equal to the integer part of `(low + high) / 2`, which implies `low ≤ mid ≤ high`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, and `mid` is the integer part of `(low + high) / 2`.**
