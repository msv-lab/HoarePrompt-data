According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `left` and the function `func_1(left)` returning a value equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `left` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2 - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `func_1(left)` must still return `m`. Since we don't have the implementation of `func_1`, we cannot determine its behavior directly. However, we can adjust the state of `left` to ensure that it could potentially satisfy the condition again, assuming `func_1`'s behavior is consistent and the previous iteration's result was not a one-time fluke.

Given that `left` is currently `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2 - 1`, to ensure that `func_1(left)` could potentially equal `m` again, we don't need to adjust `m`, `low`, `high`, `result`, `mid`, or `zeroes` directly based on the given information, as the loop's continuation is solely dependent on the outcome of `func_1(left)` being equal to `m`.

However, considering the nature of the `while` loop and the need for `func_1(left)` to return `m`, if `func_1`'s behavior changes with different inputs or if its output depends on some internal state that changes over iterations, then simply repeating the state might not be sufficient without knowing more about `func_1`. 

But based strictly on the given information and the requirement to adjust the state so the loop can execute one more time, without making assumptions about `func_1`'s behavior, we should note that the condition `func_1(left) == m` needs to hold true. Since `left` has been calculated based on `m`, and assuming that `m` remains constant, the critical factor is the behavior of `func_1` in relation to `left`.

Therefore, without specific knowledge of `func_1`'s behavior, the safest assumption is to consider the state as it is, given that any adjustment to `left` or other variables without understanding `func_1` could lead to incorrect conclusions.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, `low` is `0`, `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, `result` is an empty list, `mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`, `zeroes` is equal to `m`, `left` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2 - 1`**
