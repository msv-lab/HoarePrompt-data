The value of `left` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `left` was such that `func_1(left)` equals `m`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, `low` is `0`, `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, `result` is an empty list, `mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`, `zeroes` is equal to `m`, `left` must be such that `func_1(left)` was previously equal to `m` and now `left` is `left - 1`.
Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, `low` is `0`, `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, `result` is an empty list, `mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`, `zeroes` is equal to `m`, `left` is `left - 1` where previously `func_1(left)` equals `m`**
