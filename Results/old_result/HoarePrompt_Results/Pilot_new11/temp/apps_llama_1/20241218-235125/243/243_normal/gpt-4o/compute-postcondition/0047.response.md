The variable `right` is assigned the value `mid + 1`. The value of `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, so `right` is `(low + high) // 2 + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`m` is unchanged, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is the original return value of `func_1((low + high) // 2)`, `low` and `high` are unchanged, `result` is an empty list `[]`, `left` is the first value less than or equal to `(low + high) // 2` for which `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, and `right` is `(low + high) // 2 + 1`**
