According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `right` and the function `func_1(right)`. If `func_1(right)` equals `m`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `right` is `((5 * (m + 1)) // 2) + 1`. Since the condition for the loop to execute is `func_1(right)` equals `m`, and we cannot guarantee the behavior of `func_1`, we should ensure that the initial conditions allow for `func_1(right)` to potentially equal `m`.

However, we know that `left` is the first value less than the original `left` for which `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, and `right` is `((5 * (m + 1)) // 2) + 1`. For the loop to execute, `func_1(right)` must equal `m`. Given that `right` is greater than `mid`, and `mid` is the middle value of the range from 0 to `5 * (m + 1)`, we need to ensure that `func_1` can indeed return `m` for some value of its argument.

Given the provided information, there is no direct constraint that needs to be adjusted on `m`, `low`, `high`, `result`, `mid`, `zeroes`, or the relationship between `left` and `right` for the loop to execute one more time. The critical condition is `func_1(right)` equals `m`. Since `right` is defined and `func_1`'s behavior is not specified, the condition that needs to be met for the loop to execute is inherently linked to the function's behavior, not directly to the values of `m`, `low`, `high`, `result`, `mid`, `zeroes`, or the relationship between `left` and `right`.

However, to ensure that `func_1(right)` can equal `m`, it must be possible for `func_1` to return `m` for some input. The given state does not guarantee this, as it depends on the definition of `func_1`. Assuming `func_1` can return `m` for some value, the state as given could potentially allow the loop to execute if `func_1(right)` happens to equal `m` for the given `right`.

Thus, the states do not need direct adjustment for the loop to potentially execute one more time, given the information provided. The critical factor is the behavior of `func_1`, which is not specified. Therefore, based on the information given and focusing strictly on the variables and their relationships provided:

State: **`m` is unchanged, `low` is 0, `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, `result` is an empty list, `mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`, `zeroes` equals the original value of `m`, `left` is the first value less than the original `left` for which `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, and `right` is `((5 * (m + 1)) // 2) + 1**
