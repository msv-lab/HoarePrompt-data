You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Mr. Santa asks all the great programmers of the world to solve a trivial problem. He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.


-----Output-----

First print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.


-----Examples-----
Input
1

Output
5
5 6 7 8 9 
Input
5

Output
0


-----Note-----

The factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.

In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input is an integer m, where 1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000, representing the required number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of a positive integer n.
def func():
    m = int(input())
    count = 0
    n = 1
    while True:
        if n // 5 ** count >= m:
            break
        
        count += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `count` will be incremented indefinitely because `n` is 1 and `m` is greater than 1, but in practical terms regarding the calculation of trailing zeroes, this loop does not behave as intended due to `n` being constant at 1. For any meaningful calculation, `n` would need to be adjustable or relevant to the division operation in a way that `n = 1` is not.
    n = 1
    ans = []
    while True:
        if n // 5 ** count < m:
            break
        
        ans.append(n)
        
        n += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is the smallest integer such that `n // 5
    print(len(ans))
    print(' '.join(map(str, ans)))
#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and prints the number of positive integers `n` such that the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `n` is at least `m`, where `m` is a user-provided integer between 1 and 100,000 (inclusive), and also prints the sequence of these integers. The function essentially finds the smallest range of integers `n` for which the condition on trailing zeroes in their factorials is met, starting from `n = 1`, and continues until it finds `m` or more trailing zeroes in the factorial of `n`. The function's output includes the count of such integers and the integers themselves. However, the code contains a logical flaw due to the constant value of `n` in the initial loop, which does not affect the calculation of trailing zeroes directly but affects the loop's termination condition. Despite this, the overall purpose of the function is to identify and print the sequence of integers `n` that satisfy the given condition regarding the trailing zeroes in their factorials. The function's actual output may not perfectly align with its intended purpose due to the mentioned flaw but aims to provide a sequence of integers that meet a specific criterion related to trailing zeroes in their factorials.

The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
