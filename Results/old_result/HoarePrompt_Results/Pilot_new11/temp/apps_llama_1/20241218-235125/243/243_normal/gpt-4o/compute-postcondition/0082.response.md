The `break` statement terminates the loop or conditional statement it is directly inside. This means that the current iteration of the loop or conditional statement is stopped, and control is passed to the code that follows it. However, in this case, there's no indication that any variables are modified within the `break` statement itself or that any computation occurs that would alter the state of the variables.

Given the initial state:
- `right` is the first value greater than the original value of `mid` for which `func_1(right)` does not equal the original value of `m`.
- `m` remains the same.
- `low` remains the same.
- `high` remains the same.
- `mid` remains the same.
- `zeroes` remains the same.
- `left` remains the first value less than or equal to the original value of `mid` for which `func_1(left)` does not equal the original value of `m`.
- `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`.

After the `break` statement, the variables retain their values since `break` does not modify them; it only controls the flow of the program.

Output State: **`right` is the first value greater than the original value of `mid` for which `func_1(right)` does not equal the original value of `m`, `m` remains the same, `low` remains the same, `high` remains the same, `mid` remains the same, `zeroes` remains the same, `left` remains the first value less than or equal to the original value of `mid` for which `func_1(left)` does not equal the original value of `m`, `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
