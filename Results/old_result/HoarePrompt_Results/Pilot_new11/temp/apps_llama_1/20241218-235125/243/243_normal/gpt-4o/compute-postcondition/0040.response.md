To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the condition of the `while` loop: `func_1(left) == m`.

Given that `left` is `(low + high) // 2` and `mid` is also `(low + high) // 2`, it means `left` and `mid` have the same value. Additionally, `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1((low + high) // 2)`, which implies `zeroes` is the result of `func_1(mid)` or equivalently `func_1(left)` since `mid` and `left` are equal.

For the loop to execute at least one time, the condition `func_1(left) == m` must be true. This means the return value of `func_1(left)` (which is currently stored in `zeroes`) must be equal to `m`. 

Since `m` is a positive integer and `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, and given that `zeroes` (the return value of `func_1(mid)` or `func_1(left)`) needs to equal `m` for the loop to execute, we don't have to adjust `m` itself but rather ensure that the condition `func_1(left) == m` is met by possibly adjusting the initial values or relationships of other variables indirectly.

However, directly from the information given, the critical factor for the loop to execute is that `func_1(left)` must equal `m`. Given that `left` is derived from `low` and `high`, and that `low` is less than or equal to `high`, these conditions do not directly impact the loop's ability to execute unless they indirectly influence `func_1(left)` to equal `m`.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need `func_1(left)` to equal `m`, which means `zeroes` (the result of `func_1(mid)` or `func_1(left)`) must also equal `m`. Since `m` is already defined within a specific range and is a positive integer, the adjustment is more about ensuring the function's return value matches `m`.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` must equal `m`, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `result` is an empty list `[]`, and `left` is `(low + high) // 2`**
