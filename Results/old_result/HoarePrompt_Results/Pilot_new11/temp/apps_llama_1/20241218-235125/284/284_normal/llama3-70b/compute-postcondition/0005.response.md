The program returns a boolean value, which is `False`. The values of `num` and `i` do not affect the return value in this case, as the return statement is a constant `False`. `num` is an integer between 4 and 1000 (inclusive) and is a multiple of `i`, which is 2, but this information is not relevant to the return value.

Output State: **The program returns False**
