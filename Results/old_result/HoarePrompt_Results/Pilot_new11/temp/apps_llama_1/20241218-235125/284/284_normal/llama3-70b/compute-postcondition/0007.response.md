According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `num`. The loop iterates over a range from 2 to the square root of `num` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `num` is not divisible by `i`, meaning `num` is odd. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. Since `i` is now 3, the condition for `num` to not be divisible by `i` still holds, but the upper limit of the loop depends on `num`. The loop can execute again if `i` (which is now 3) is less than or equal to the square root of `num`. This implies that the square root of `num` must be greater than 3, which in turn means `num` must be greater than 9 (since 3^2 = 9). Given that `num` was initially between 4 and 1000 (inclusive) and is odd (from the previous iteration), the new state should reflect that `num` is still an integer such that it's greater than 9 and less than or equal to 1000, and `i` is 3.

State: **`num` is an integer such that 9 < `num` <= 1000, `i` is 3**
