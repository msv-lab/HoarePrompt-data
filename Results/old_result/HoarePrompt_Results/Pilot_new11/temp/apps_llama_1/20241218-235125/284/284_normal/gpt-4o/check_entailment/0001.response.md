Correctness: **True**

The given program is designed to find a counterexample to PolandBall's hypothesis that for each positive integer `m`, the number `n*m + 1` is a prime number. The program takes an integer `n` as input and iterates over values of `m` from 1 to 1000. For each `m`, it checks whether `n*m + 1` is a prime number using the function `func_1`. If `n*m + 1` is not a prime number, the program prints the value of `m` and breaks out of the loop.

The function `func_1` checks whether a number `x` is prime by testing divisibility up to the square root of `x`. This is a common optimization for primality testing, as any factor larger than the square root would have a corresponding factor smaller than the square root.

The program handles all potential cases correctly. The loop iterates over a sufficient range of values for `m` (1 to 1000), and the primality test `func_1` is implemented correctly. The program outputs the first value of `m` for which `n*m + 1` is not a prime number, which satisfies the problem requirements.

I have analyzed the code and could not find any potential cases where it does not work as expected. The code correctly implements the required logic, and the examples provided in the problem description are handled correctly by the code. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct and works as expected for all potential cases.
