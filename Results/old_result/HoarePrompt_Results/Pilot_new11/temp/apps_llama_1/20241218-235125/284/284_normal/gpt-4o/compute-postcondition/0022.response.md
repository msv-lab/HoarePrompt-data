The value of `i` is incremented by 6. The previous value of `i` was 17, so the new value of `i` is 23. The value of `x` is still an odd integer not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, or 13, and `x` is greater than or equal to 290. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`x` is an odd integer not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, or 13, and `x` is greater than or equal to 290, `i` is 23**
