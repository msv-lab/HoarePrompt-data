The print statement does not change any variable values, it only outputs the string 'YES' to the console. Therefore, the states of all variables remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` input integers, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `a` and its corresponding value is the count of that integer in `a`, `c` is either 0 or 1, `a1` is the first integer with a count of `n // 2`, `a2` is the second integer with a count of `n // 2`, and 'YES' has been printed to the console.**
