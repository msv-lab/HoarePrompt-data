The `print` statement is executed, which outputs the values of `unique_numbers[-1]` and `unique_numbers[-2]`. The values of the variables do not change, but the output is displayed. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an even number between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `cards` is a list of n integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `count` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in `cards` and the values are their respective frequencies in `cards`, `unique_numbers` is a list of the unique integers in `cards` sorted by their frequencies in ascending order, the number of unique integers in `cards` is 2 or more, `count[unique_numbers[-1]]` equals `n // 2`, `count[unique_numbers[-2]]` equals `n // 2`, 'YES' has been printed, and `unique_numbers[-1]` and `unique_numbers[-2]` have been printed**.
