Based on the given loop code and the output states after a few iterations, I can determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished.

The loop iterates `n` times, and in each iteration, it appends an input integer to the list `a`. 

If `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute at least once, and `a` will contain `n` integer elements, which are the input integers. 

If `n` is 0, the loop will not execute, and `a` will remain an empty list.

After the loop finishes executing, `i` will be `n-1` if `n` is greater than 0, because the loop iterates from 0 to `n-1`. If `n` is 0, `i` will be undefined because the loop does not execute.

The original list of `n` integers (each between 1 and 100) is not modified by the loop.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` input integers, the original list of `n` integers remains unchanged, `i` is `n-1` if `n` is greater than 0, `i` is undefined if `n` is 0.**
