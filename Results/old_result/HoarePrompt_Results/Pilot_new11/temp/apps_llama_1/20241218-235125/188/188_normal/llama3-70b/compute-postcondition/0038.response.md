The value of `a1` is assigned the value of `i`. The states of the other variables are not affected. `n` is still a non-negative integer, `a` is still a list of `n` input integers with at least 1 integer, `d` is still a dictionary with at least 2 key-value pairs where each key is a unique integer from `a`, and `i` is still the next key in `d`. `a1` is now equal to `i`, which is the next key in `d`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` input integers that must have at least 1 integer, `d` is a dictionary with at least 2 key-value pairs where each key is a unique integer from `a`, `i` is the next key in `d`, `a1` is equal to `i`**
