You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Petya and Vasya decided to play a game. They have n cards (n is an even number). A single integer is written on each card.

Before the game Petya will choose an integer and after that Vasya will choose another integer (different from the number that Petya chose). During the game each player takes all the cards with number he chose. For example, if Petya chose number 5 before the game he will take all cards on which 5 is written and if Vasya chose number 10 before the game he will take all cards on which 10 is written.

The game is considered fair if Petya and Vasya can take all n cards, and the number of cards each player gets is the same.

Determine whether Petya and Vasya can choose integer numbers before the game so that the game is fair. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) — number of cards. It is guaranteed that n is an even number.

The following n lines contain a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (one integer per line, 1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100) — numbers written on the n cards.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible for Petya and Vasya to choose numbers in such a way that the game will be fair, print "NO" (without quotes) in the first line. In this case you should not print anything more.

In the other case print "YES" (without quotes) in the first line. In the second line print two distinct integers — number that Petya should choose and the number that Vasya should choose to make the game fair. If there are several solutions, print any of them.


-----Examples-----

Output

-----Note-----

In the first example the game will be fair if, for example, Petya chooses number 11, and Vasya chooses number 27. Then the will take all cards — Petya will take cards 1 and 4, and Vasya will take cards 2 and 3. Thus, each of them will take exactly two cards.

In the second example fair game is impossible because the numbers written on the cards are equal, but the numbers that Petya and Vasya should choose should be distinct.

In the third example it is impossible to take all cards. Petya and Vasya can take at most five cards — for example, Petya can choose number 10 and Vasya can choose number 20. But for the game to be fair it is necessary to take 6 cards.
Program:
```
from collections import Counter

def func():
    n = int(input())
    cards = [int(input()) for _ in range(n)]
    count = Counter(cards)
    unique_numbers = sorted(count.keys(), key=lambda x: count[x])
    if len(unique_numbers) < 2:
        print('NO')
    elif count[unique_numbers[-1]] == n // 2 and count[unique_numbers[-2]] == n // 2:
        print('YES')
        print(unique_numbers[-1], unique_numbers[-2])
    else:
        print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not work correctly in all cases. For example, consider the input where the numbers written on the cards are [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1], where n = 6. In this case, the program will print 'NO' because it does not consider the count of other unique numbers. However, if Petya chooses 1 and Vasya chooses 2, the game will not be fair, but if Petya chooses 1 and Vasya chooses another number that doesn't exist, that would be incorrect, but the correct output in this case should be 'NO' because the counts of 1 and 2 are not equal.

However, the code only checks if the counts of the most frequent and the second most frequent numbers are equal to n//2, which is not the correct condition to check if the game can be fair. 

For instance, consider the case where the input is [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3], where n = 6. In this case, the counts of 1, 2, and 3 are all equal to 2, which is equal to n//2 = 3, but the program will still print 'NO' because it does not consider all possible pairs of numbers.

A correct solution would involve checking all possible pairs of unique numbers and their counts to see if there exists a pair of numbers that can divide the cards evenly between Petya and Vasya.

The provided code only checks the two most frequent numbers and does not consider other possible pairs of numbers. Therefore, the Correctness is **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
from collections import Counter

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input is a sequence of n integers, where n is an even number between 2 and 100 (inclusive), and each integer is between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
def func():
    n = int(input())
    cards = [int(input()) for _ in range(n)]
    count = Counter(cards)
    unique_numbers = sorted(count.keys(), key=lambda x: count[x])
    if (len(unique_numbers) < 2) :
        print('NO')
    else :
        if (count[unique_numbers[-1]] == n // 2 and count[unique_numbers[-2]] == n // 2) :
            print('YES')
            print(unique_numbers[-1], unique_numbers[-2])
        else :
            print('NO')
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an even number between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `cards` is a list of n integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `count` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in `cards` and the values are their respective frequencies in `cards`, `unique_numbers` is a list of the unique integers in `cards` sorted by their frequencies in ascending order, and the number of unique integers in `cards` is 2 or more. If the frequency of the most frequent integer in `cards` is equal to `n // 2` and the frequency of the second most frequent integer in `cards` is also equal to `n // 2`, then 'YES' has been printed along with the most and second most frequent integers. Otherwise, 'NO' has been printed to the console.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is an even number between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `cards` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `count` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in `cards` and the values are their respective frequencies in `cards`, `unique_numbers` is a list of the unique integers in `cards` sorted by their frequencies in ascending order. If the number of unique integers in `cards` is less than 2, 'NO' is printed to the console. If the number of unique integers in `cards` is 2 or more, then if the frequency of the most frequent integer in `cards` is equal to `n // 2` and the frequency of the second most frequent integer in `cards` is also equal to `n // 2`, 'YES' has been printed along with the most and second most frequent integers; otherwise, 'NO' has been printed to the console.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function determines if a given sequence of n integers can be divided into two groups of equal size, each containing the same integer. It accepts a sequence of n integers as input, where n is an even number between 2 and 100 (inclusive), and each integer is between 1 and 100 (inclusive). The function returns 'YES' if the input sequence can be divided into two groups of equal size with the same integer, and it prints the two integers that make up the groups. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'. The function performs the following actions: (1) reads the input sequence of n integers, (2) counts the frequency of each integer in the sequence, (3) sorts the unique integers in ascending order of their frequencies, and (4) checks if the frequency of the most frequent integer and the second most frequent integer is equal to n // 2. If the input sequence contains less than 2 unique integers, the function immediately returns 'NO'. After executing, the program has the following state: the input sequence has been processed, and either 'YES' with the two integers that make up the groups or 'NO' has been printed to the console, depending on whether the input sequence meets the specified condition.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
