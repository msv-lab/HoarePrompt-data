The given code is a break statement, which means it will exit the most internal loop or if statement it is directly inside. The values of the variables do not change. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` input integers, `d` is a dictionary with at least 2 key-value pairs where each key is a unique integer from `a`, `i` is the next key in `d`, `a2` is equal to `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
