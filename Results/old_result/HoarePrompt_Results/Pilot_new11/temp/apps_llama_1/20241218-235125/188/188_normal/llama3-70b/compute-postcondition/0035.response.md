Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` input integers that must have at least 1 integer, `d` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where each key is a unique integer from `a`, `i` is the first key in `d`, and `d[i]` equals half of the current value of `n`. If `c` is 0, then `c` is 1, `a1` is the first key in `d` (`i`), and `a2` is -1. If `c` is not 0, then `a1` is -1, `a2` is the first key in `d`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
