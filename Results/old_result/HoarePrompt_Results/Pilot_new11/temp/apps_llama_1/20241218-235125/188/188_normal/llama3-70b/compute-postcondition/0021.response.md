The value of `d[i]` is incremented by 1. Since `i` is the third element of `a` (`a[2]`), and `d` is updated such that if `a[2]` was a key in `d`, its value is incremented by 1, `d[i]` is initially either 1 (if `a[2]` was not a key in `d` before `d` was updated) or greater than 1 (if `a[2]` was a key in `d` before `d` was updated). Therefore, after the increment operation, `d[i]` will be either 2 (if `a[2]` was not a key in `d` before `d` was updated) or greater than its previous value (if `a[2]` was a key in `d` before `d` was updated).

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` input integers, `i` is the third element of `a` (`a[2]`), and `d[i]` is incremented by 1 from its previous value which was either 1 or greater than 1, depending on whether `a[2]` was initially a key in `d` or not.**
