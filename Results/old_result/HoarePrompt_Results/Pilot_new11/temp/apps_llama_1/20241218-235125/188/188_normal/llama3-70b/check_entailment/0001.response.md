Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine whether Petya and Vasya can choose integer numbers before the game so that the game is fair. 

Here's a breakdown of why the program works as expected:

1. **Counting Cards**: The program starts by reading the number of cards `n` and the numbers on each card, storing them in a list `a`. It then uses a dictionary `d` to count the occurrences of each number on the cards.

2. **Checking for Fair Game**: The program iterates over the dictionary to find numbers that appear exactly `n // 2` times, which is the condition for a fair game. It keeps track of the first two such numbers found, storing them in `a1` and `a2`.

3. **Printing the Result**: If both `a1` and `a2` are found (meaning there are at least two numbers that appear `n // 2` times), the program prints "YES" followed by these two numbers. Otherwise, it prints "NO", indicating that a fair game is not possible.

The program correctly handles all the edge cases mentioned in the examples:

- When there are two distinct numbers, each appearing `n // 2` times (e.g., the first example), it correctly prints "YES" with the two numbers.
- When there is only one distinct number (e.g., the second example), it correctly prints "NO" because the game cannot be fair with only one number.
- When there are multiple numbers but none appear exactly `n // 2` times (e.g., the third and fourth examples), it correctly prints "NO" because a fair game is not possible.

Given the program's logic and the examples provided, it appears to correctly implement the conditions for a fair game as described in the problem statement, handling all potential cases correctly.
