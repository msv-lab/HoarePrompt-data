The code snippet is updating the dictionary `d` by adding a new key-value pair where the key is `i` (the first element in `a`) and the value is `1`. 

The initial state provides that `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` input integers, `i` is the first element in `a`, and `d` is an empty dictionary. 

After executing the code `d[i] = 1`, the state of `d` is updated. Since `i` was not a key in `d` initially and now it has been added with a value of `1`, the new state of `d` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and `1` as its value.

The values of `n`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged because the code does not modify them. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` input integers and must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in `a`, and `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` equals `1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` input integers and must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in `a`, and `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` equals `1`.**
