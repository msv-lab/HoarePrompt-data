Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program accurately follows the problem description and correctly implements the required functionality. 

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The first line reads a non-empty string `s` from the input, containing only lowercase English letters.

2. The `func_1(s)` function checks whether a given string `s` is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse (`s[::-1]`). If they are the same, the function returns `True`, indicating that `s` is a palindrome. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

3. The main part of the program checks the input string `s` for being a palindrome or not. If `s` has a length of 1 or less, it prints `0` as there are no substrings that are not palindromes.

4. If `s` is not a palindrome (`not func_1(s)`), it prints the length of `s`, as the longest non-palindromic substring is `s` itself.

5. If `s` is a palindrome but removing the first or last character results in a non-palindrome (`not func_1(s[1:])` or `not func_1(s[:-1])`), it prints the length of `s` minus 1, as the longest non-palindromic substring is `s` without the first or last character.

6. If none of the above conditions are met, it means that all substrings of `s` are palindromes. In this case, the program prints `0`.

The program handles all cases described in the problem description correctly and follows the logic required to find the longest non-palindromic substring of a given string. 

For example, for the input "mew", since "mew" is not a palindrome, the program correctly prints `3`. For the input "wuffuw", since "uffuw" is a non-palindrome substring, the program correctly prints `5`. For the input "qqqqqqqq", since all substrings are palindromes, the program correctly prints `0`. 

In summary, the program accurately implements the required functionality as described in the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly.
