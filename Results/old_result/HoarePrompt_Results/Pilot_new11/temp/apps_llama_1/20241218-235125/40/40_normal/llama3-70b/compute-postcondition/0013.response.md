To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given for loop statement and the current state.

Given loop: `for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):`

Current state: 
- `s` is a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters, contains only lowercase English letters.
- `n` is an integer and is at least 2.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is 2.
- `substr` is a string equal to `s[0:2]`.
- If `substr` is not equal to its reverse, then `max_len` is at least 2.

Since the loop iterates over `range(i + 1, n + 1)` and `j` represents the current iteration index, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to increment by 1, making it 3. 

Also, since `i` is 0 and doesn't change within the given loop (it's used to set the starting point of the range), its value remains 0. For `j` to be 3 in the next iteration, the loop condition needs to still hold true, meaning `n` must be at least 3 to allow `j` to reach 3.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters, contains only lowercase English letters, `n` is an integer and is at least 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 3**
