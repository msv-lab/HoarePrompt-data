The code `substr = s[i:j]` assigns a substring of `s` to the variable `substr`. This substring starts at index `i` and ends at index `j`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0 and `j` is 3. 

`s` is a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters and contains only lowercase English letters. Since `i` is 0 and `j` is 3, `substr` will be a substring of `s` starting from the first character up to but not including the fourth character.

The states of `s`, `n`, `i`, and `j` are not changed by this code. `n` is an integer and is at least 3, `i` remains 0, and `j` remains 3.

Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters, contains only lowercase English letters, `n` is an integer and is at least 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, and `substr` is a string equal to the first three characters of `s`.
Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters, contains only lowercase English letters, `n` is an integer and is at least 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, and `substr` is equal to `s[0:3]`.**
