To determine the output state after the given Python code snippet is executed, let's analyze the code and the initial state provided.

Initial State:
- `s` is a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters.
- `n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive) and `n` must be at least 3.
- `i` is 2.
- `max_len` is the maximum length of all non-palindromic substrings of `s` starting at index 1 and ending at any index up to `n`, or 0 if all such substrings are palindromes.
- `j` is 3.

Given Code:
```python
substr = s[i:j]
```

This line of code extracts a substring from `s` starting at index `i` (which is 2) up to but not including index `j` (which is 3), and assigns it to the variable `substr`.

Since `i` is 2 and `j` is 3, `substr` will be a string of length 1, containing the character at index 2 of `s`.

The output state after executing this code will include the new variable `substr` with its assigned value, along with the unchanged values of the other variables. Note that the indexing in Python is 0-based, so the character at index 2 is the third character in the string `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `max_len` is the maximum length of all non-palindromic substrings of `s` starting at index 1 and ending at any index up to `n`, or 0 if all such substrings are palindromes, `j` is 3, and `substr` is a string of length 1 equal to the third character of `s`.**
