To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, we need to analyze the loop code and the output states after a few iterations.

The loop code is:
```python
for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
    substr = s[i:j]
    if substr!= substr[::-1]:
        max_len = max(max_len, len(substr))
```
From the output states after a few iterations, we can observe the following patterns:

* `s` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
* `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive) and is greater than 0.
* `i` is initialized to 0 and remains unchanged throughout the loop.
* `j` takes on values from `i + 1` to `n` (inclusive).
* `substr` is a substring of `s` starting at index `i` and ending at index `j - 1`.
* If `substr` is not a palindrome, `max_len` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the length of `substr`.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, we can conclude the following:

* `s` remains unchanged, so its value is still a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters.
* `n` is still an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive) and is greater than 0.
* `i` is still 0.
* `max_len` is the maximum length of all non-palindromic substrings of `s` starting at index `i` (which is 0) and ending at any index up to `n - 1`. If all substrings are palindromes, `max_len` remains 0.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `max_len` is the maximum length of all non-palindromic substrings of `s` starting at index 0 and ending at any index up to `n - 1`, or 0 if all substrings are palindromes.**
