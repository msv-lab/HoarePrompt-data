To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the given `for` loop statement and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop statement is `for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):`, which means `j` will take on values from `i + 1` up to `n` (inclusive) in each iteration.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `s` is a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters.
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and is greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is 2.
- `substr` is `s[1:2]`.

For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to increment to the next value in the range `i + 1` to `n + 1`. Since `j` is currently 2 and the loop condition depends on `j` being less than `n + 1`, for the next iteration to occur:
- `j` must be incremented to 3 (`j + 1`).
- The condition `j` in `range(i + 1, n + 1)` implies that `n` must be at least 3 to allow `j` to take on the value 3.

Other variables like `s`, `i`, and the derived `substr` and `max_len` are not directly impacted by the loop condition itself but by the assignments or calculations within the loop body, which are not shown here. However, based on the loop condition, we only need to adjust the state of `j` and ensure `n` is sufficient to allow the loop to continue.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration:
- `s` remains unchanged as it's not directly affected by the loop iteration condition.
- `n` must be at least 3 to satisfy the loop condition for `j = 3`.
- `i` remains 1 as the loop iterates over `j`, not `i`.
- `j` increments to 3.
- `substr` would be updated based on `s` and the new value of `j`, but since we don't have the specifics of how `substr` is calculated beyond the previous iteration, we acknowledge its dependence on `s` and `j`.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 3**
