The code updates the value of `substr` to be a substring of `s` from index `i` to `j`. Initially, `i` is 1 and `j` is 4. So, `substr` becomes `s[1:4]`. 

Since `s` is a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, and the initial value of `substr` was also `s[1:4]`, this means the new value of `substr` is the same as its initial value.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is at least 4, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, `substr` is a string of length 3 equal to `s[1:4]`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is at least 4, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, `substr` is a string of length 3 equal to `s[1:4]`.**
