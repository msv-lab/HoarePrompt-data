To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

The initial state is:
- `s` is a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters.
- `n` is at least 3.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is 3.

The code snippet is:
```python
substr = s[i:j]
```

This line of code extracts a substring from `s` starting at index `i` up to but not including `j`. Given that `i` is 1 and `j` is 3, it extracts the second and third characters of the string `s` (since indexing starts at 0).

The impact on the program is the creation of a new variable `substr` which holds this extracted substring. The values of `s`, `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged because the operation does not modify them.

Given that `s` contains only lowercase English letters, the `substr` will also contain lowercase English letters. Since `i` is 1 and `j` is 3, the length of `substr` will be 2 (`j - i = 3 - 1 = 2`).

Therefore, the output state is:
- `s` is a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters.
- `n` is at least 3.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is 3.
- `substr` is a string of length 2 containing lowercase English letters, equal to `s[1:3]`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `substr` is a string of length 2 equal to `s[1:3]`.**
