Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The current implementation only checks if the input string or its substring (after removing the first or last character) is a palindrome, and if not, it returns the length of that string. However, this approach does not guarantee that the returned substring is the longest one that is not a palindrome.

A counterexample is the string "abba". The program will return 3, because the substring "abb" is not a palindrome. However, the longest substring that is not a palindrome is actually "ab" and "ba", both of length 2. Since all the substrings of "abba" that are not palindromes have length 2, the program should return 2, not 3.

The program needs to be modified to correctly find the longest substring that is not a palindrome. This can be done by checking all possible substrings of the input string and keeping track of the maximum length of a non-palindromic substring. 

For example, a correct solution would involve checking every possible substring of the string, and if a substring is not a palindrome, updating the maximum length if necessary. Here is a simple example of how this could be done:
```python
def func_1(s):
    return s == s[::-1]

def max_length_non_palindrome(s):
    max_len = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(s) + 1):
            substr = s[i:j]
            if not func_1(substr):
                max_len = max(max_len, j - i)
    return max_len

s = input().strip()
print(max_length_non_palindrome(s))
```
