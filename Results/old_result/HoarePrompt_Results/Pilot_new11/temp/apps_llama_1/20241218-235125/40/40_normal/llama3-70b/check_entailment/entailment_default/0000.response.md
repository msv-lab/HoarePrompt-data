Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly implements the problem description. It checks all possible substrings of the input string and keeps track of the maximum length of a non-palindromic substring. If no such substring exists, it prints 0. The code handles all cases specified in the problem description, including when the input string is a single character, or when it contains only characters that form palindromes. 

The output hints agree with the code, and the code correctly prints the maximum length of a non-palindromic substring if one exists. The code also handles the edge cases provided in the examples, such as when the input string is "mew", "wuffuw", or "qqqqqqqq", and produces the correct output.

Since we assume that the input will always be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the code is correct even though it does not include error checking for invalid inputs. Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case, and the correctness is True.
