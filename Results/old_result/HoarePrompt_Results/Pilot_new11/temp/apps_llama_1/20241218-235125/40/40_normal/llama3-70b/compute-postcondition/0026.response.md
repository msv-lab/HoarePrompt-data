The code updates the value of `max_len` to be the maximum of its current value and the length of `substr`. Since `substr` has a length of 2, the value of `max_len` will be updated to be the maximum of its current value and 2.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `substr` is a string of length 2 equal to `s[1:3]`, `max_len` is the maximum of its previous value and 2**
