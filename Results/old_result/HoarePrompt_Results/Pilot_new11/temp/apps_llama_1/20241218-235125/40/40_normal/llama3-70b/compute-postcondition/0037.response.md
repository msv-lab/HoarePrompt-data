The value of `max_len` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the length of `substr`. Since `substr` is a string of length 1, its length is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `max_len` is the maximum of its previous value and 1, `j` is 3, and `substr` is a string of length 1 equal to the third character of `s`, and `substr` is not a palindrome.
