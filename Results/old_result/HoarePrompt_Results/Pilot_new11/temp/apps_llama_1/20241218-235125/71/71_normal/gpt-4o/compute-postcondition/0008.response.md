The code increments `to_remove` by 1. The previous value of `to_remove` is 0, so its new value is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is 0, `to_remove` is 1, `digit` is the last character of `n`, and the last character of `n` (i.e., `digit`) is not '0'**
