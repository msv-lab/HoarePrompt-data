To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the loop statement and the current state.

The loop iterates over the digits of the string `n` in reverse order. At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:

- `n` is a non-empty string.
- `k` is an integer.

The state of `count_zeros` and `to_remove` depends on the last character of `n` that was processed:
- If the last character of `n` is '0', then `count_zeros` is 1 and `to_remove` is 0.
- If the last character of `n` is not '0', then `count_zeros` is 0 and `to_remove` is 1.

The loop breaks if `count_zeros` equals `k`, but for it to execute again, we need to consider the reverse iteration mechanics. 

For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another character in `n` that hasn't been processed yet. Since we're iterating in reverse, this means the second-to-last character (now becoming the last character in the context of the next iteration) will be processed next.

Therefore, for the loop to execute again:
- `n` should be a string that has at least one more character beyond what was just processed.
- The state of `count_zeros` and `to_remove` would reset according to the next character in reverse order. If the next character is '0', then `count_zeros` would be reset to 1 and `to_remove` to 0. If it's not '0', `count_zeros` would be 0 and `to_remove` would be 1.
- `k` remains unchanged as it's not dependent on the iteration.

However, we need to account for the fact that the loop body's specifics are omitted, so we focus solely on the iteration mechanism itself.

State: **`n` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `k` is an integer, the new last character of `n` (second-to-last originally) determines `count_zeros` and `to_remove`: if it's '0', `count_zeros` is 1 and `to_remove` is 0, if not '0', `count_zeros` is 0 and `to_remove` is 1**
