To determine the output state, let's consider the initial conditions and how the given code affects them.

Initially, `n` is a non-empty string with at least two characters, `k` is an integer, and the values of `count_zeros` and `to_remove` are determined by the second-to-last character of `n`. If this character is '0', then `count_zeros` is 1 and `to_remove` is 0. If this character is not '0', then `count_zeros` is 0 and `to_remove` is 1.

The code increments `to_remove` by 1. 

So, if the second-to-last character of `n` is '0', then initially `to_remove` is 0, and after the increment, `to_remove` becomes 1. If the second-to-last character of `n` is not '0', then initially `to_remove` is 1, and after the increment, `to_remove` becomes 2.

The values of `n`, `k`, and `count_zeros` are not changed by the code. The state of `n` remains a non-empty string with at least two characters, `k` remains an integer, and `count_zeros` remains either 0 or 1 based on the second-to-last character of `n`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-empty string with at least two characters, `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is either 0 or 1 based on whether the second-to-last character of `n` is '0' or not, and `to_remove` is either 1 (if the second-to-last character of `n` is '0') or 2 (if the second-to-last character of `n` is not '0').

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string with at least two characters, `k` is an integer, if the second-to-last character of `n` is '0' then `count_zeros` is 1 and `to_remove` is 1, else `count_zeros` is 0 and `to_remove` is 2**
