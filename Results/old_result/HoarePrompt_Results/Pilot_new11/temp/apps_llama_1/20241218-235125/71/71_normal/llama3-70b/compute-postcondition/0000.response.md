The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` updates the values of `n` and `k` based on user input. The `input().split()` function splits the input into a list of strings separated by spaces, and `map(int,...)` converts these strings to integers.

Given the initial state that `n` is an integer ranging from 0 to 2,000,000,000 and `k` is an integer between 1 and 9, inclusive, after executing the code, the values of `n` and `k` will be replaced by the input integers.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**
