It appears that the function `func` does not accept any parameters, as the definition provided is `def func():`. However, based on the given parameter constraints, it seems that the function should actually accept two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer and `k` is a positive integer between 1 and 9, such that 0 <= n <= 2,000,000,000.


Since the output cases are not provided, I will describe the functionality based on the given constraints. The function `func` should accept two parameters, `n` and `k`, with the specified constraints. However, without the output cases, I can only describe the input parameters.


Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer and `k` is a positive integer between 1 and 9, such that 0 <= n <= 2,000,000,000.
