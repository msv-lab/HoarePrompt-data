The code `n //= 10` performs integer division of `n` by 10 and assigns the result back to `n`. This effectively removes the last digit of `n`.

Given that `n` is an input integer not divisible by 10, after performing `n //= 10`, `n` will be the input integer with its last digit removed.

The variable `w` is increased by 1, but there is no code that modifies `w` in the given snippet, so `w` remains increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer with its last digit removed, `w` is increased by 1**
