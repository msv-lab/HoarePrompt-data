The code increments the value of `count_zeros` by 1. The initial state of `n` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, and `k` remains an integer. The values of `n` and `k` are not affected by the code. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `k` remains an integer, `count_zeros` is increased by 1, `to_remove` is unchanged**
