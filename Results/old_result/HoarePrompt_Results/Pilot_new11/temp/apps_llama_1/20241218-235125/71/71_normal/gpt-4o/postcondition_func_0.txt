The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is a string representation of an integer and `k` is a positive integer between 1 and 9. It calculates the number of non-zero digits from the end of `n` until it encounters `k` zeros or reaches the beginning of `n`. If `k` zeros are found, it prints the count of non-zero digits encountered before the `k` zeros. If `k` zeros are not found, it prints the length of `n` minus 1. The function does not handle cases where `n` is an empty string, `k` is outside the specified range, or `n` contains non-digit characters. After the function concludes, the state of the program is that a value has been printed to the console, which is either the count of non-zero digits or the length of `n` minus 1, and the input parameters `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
