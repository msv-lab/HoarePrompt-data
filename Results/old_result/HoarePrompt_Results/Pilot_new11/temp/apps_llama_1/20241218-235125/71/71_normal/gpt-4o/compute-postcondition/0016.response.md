Postcondition: **`n` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `k` is an integer. If the new last character of `n` (second-to-last originally) is '0', then `count_zeros` is 2 and `to_remove` is 0. If the new last character of `n` is not '0' and the original condition is met (digit == '0' is false), then `count_zeros` is 1 and `to_remove` is 1 when the digit is '0' or `count_zeros` is 0 and `to_remove` is 2 when the digit is not '0'. However, given the provided conditions and applying them correctly to the if-else statement, the accurate interpretation is: if the digit is '0', then `count_zeros` is 2 and `to_remove` is 0; if the digit is not '0', we follow the else condition which states `n` is a non-empty string with at least two characters, `k` is an integer, if the second-to-last character of `n` is '0' then `count_zeros` is 1 and `to_remove` is 1, else `count_zeros` is 0 and `to_remove` is 2. This results in the following overall postcondition: `n` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `k` is an integer, if the digit is '0', then `count_zeros` is 2 and `to_remove` is 0; if the digit is not '0', `count_zeros` and `to_remove` are determined by the second-to-last character of `n`: if it's '0', `count_zeros` is 1 and `to_remove` is 1, otherwise `count_zeros` is 0 and `to_remove` is 2.**
