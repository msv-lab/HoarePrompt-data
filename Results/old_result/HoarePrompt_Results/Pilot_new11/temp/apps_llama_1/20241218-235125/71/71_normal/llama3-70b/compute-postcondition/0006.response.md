The value of `w` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `w` is unknown. However, `n` is the input integer with its last digit removed and initially had enough digits to not be divisible by 10, which means `n` is still an integer. The states of `n` are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer with its last digit removed and initially had enough digits to not be divisible by 10, `w` is increased by 1**
