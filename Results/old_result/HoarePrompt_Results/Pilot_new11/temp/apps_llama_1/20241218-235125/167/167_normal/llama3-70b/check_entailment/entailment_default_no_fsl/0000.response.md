Correctness: **False**

The code does not work correctly in all potential cases. One of the main issues is the range of the loop for finding the values of x and y. The current code loops through all possible combinations of x and y up to 1000001, but the problem statement specifies that x and y can be up to 10^9. This means that the code will not be able to find a solution if the values of x and y are larger than 1000001.

Another issue is that the code only checks if there exists at least one pair of x and y that satisfies the condition, but it does not check if this pair is the only possible solution. The problem statement requires that the code should print "YES" if there exists any possible values of x and y that do not contradict with the sequence of moves, but the code only prints "YES" if it finds a pair of x and y that satisfies the condition, without considering other possible solutions.

Additionally, the code does not handle the case where the input list a is empty or contains non-integer values, although the problem statement assumes that the input will be valid.

For example, if the input is:
10
1 10 2 20 3 30 4 40 5 50

The code will not be able to find a solution because the values of x and y that satisfy the condition (x = 10, y = 5) are outside the range of the loop.

Therefore, the code does not work correctly in all potential cases, and the correctness is False.
