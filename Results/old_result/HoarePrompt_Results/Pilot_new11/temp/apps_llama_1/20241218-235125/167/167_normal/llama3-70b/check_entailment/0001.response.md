Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program does not work correctly for every potential case. The issue with this program is the brute force approach used to find the values of x and y. It only checks for x and y values up to 1000001, which is not sufficient as the problem statement allows x and y to be up to 10^9.

Another issue with the program is the function `func_1(x, y)`. This function checks if the given path is possible in the matrix of size x by y. However, it does not handle the case where the path starts in a cell that is not at the top-left corner of the matrix.

Also, the program does not consider the fact that there may be multiple correct answers for the same input. It stops and prints the first pair of x and y it finds, without checking if there are other possible solutions.

A correct program should iterate over all possible values of x and y, and check if the given path is possible in the matrix of size x by y. It should also handle the case where the path starts in a cell that is not at the top-left corner of the matrix, and consider the fact that there may be multiple correct answers for the same input.

For example, if the input is:

```
2
1 10
```

The program will not find the correct solution (4, 9) or (5, 8) or (2, 5) because it only checks for x and y values up to 1000001. 

A more efficient approach would be to iterate over all possible differences between consecutive elements in the path, and check if these differences are consistent with a matrix of size x by y. This approach would eliminate the need to check all possible values of x and y, and would make the program more efficient. 

However, the given program does not implement this approach correctly, and therefore it is not correct. 

This issue with the given program causes it to not work correctly for every potential case. Therefore, the Correctness is **False**.
