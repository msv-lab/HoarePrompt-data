Correctness: **False**

The given program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. 

One reason is that the loop that tries out different values of `x` and `y` only goes up to 1000001, which is less than the maximum value of 10^9 specified in the problem. This means that the program may not find a valid solution for `x` and `y` even if one exists.

Another issue with the program is that it breaks out of the inner loop as soon as it finds an `x` and `y` such that `x * y > max(a)`. However, this condition is not sufficient to conclude that no solution exists for the current value of `x`, because the problem description allows `x` and `y` to be any positive integers not exceeding 10^9, not just those that are less than or equal to the maximum value in `a`.

Furthermore, the function `func_1` checks if the absolute difference in the x and y coordinates of consecutive elements in the sequence is 1, which is correct. However, the main part of the program does not correctly utilize the results of this function, because it does not consider all possible values of `x` and `y` in the range specified by the problem description.

To fix these issues, the program should try all possible values of `x` and `y` up to 10^9, and not break out of the loop prematurely. It should also correctly utilize the results of the `func_1` function to check if a given `x` and `y` are a valid solution. 

Here's an example of how the corrected code could look like:

```python
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

for x in range(1, 10**9 + 1):
    for y in range(1, 10**9 + 1):
        if x * y >= max(a):
            if func_1(x, y):
                print('YES')
                print(x, y)
                exit()
print('NO')
```
Note that this code still has a time complexity of O(n*10^18), which is highly inefficient. A more efficient solution would be to start with the smallest possible values of `x` and `y` that satisfy `x * y >= max(a)`, and then increment `x` and `y` until a valid solution is found or it is determined that no solution exists. 

Also note that the `func_1` function is correct in terms of its logic, given the provided problem description and the code. It checks if the absolute difference in the x and y coordinates of consecutive elements in the sequence is 1, which is the correct condition for adjacent cells in the matrix. 

However, without further optimization, the code above will still be very inefficient for large inputs. A better approach would be to use a more intelligent algorithm to find a valid `x` and `y`, rather than trying all possible values.
