Postcondition: **`x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, initially `px` is 0 and `py` is 0. `a` is a list that must have at least 1 element, where `v` is the first element in `a`. The current value of `nx` is `(v - 1) // y` and the current value of `ny` is `(v - 1) % y`. `x`, `y`, `px`, `py`, `a`, `v`, `nx`, and `ny` have the aforementioned values and relationships. Additionally, the sum of the absolute differences between `nx` and `px` and between `ny` and `py` is not equal to 1.**
