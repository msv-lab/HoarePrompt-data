Postcondition: ***`x` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 1. If `digit_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `digit_sum`, `max_num` is 1, and `digit_sum` is greater than 1. Otherwise, `max_sum` and `max_num` remain unchanged, and the original values of `max_sum` and `max_num` are retained.***
