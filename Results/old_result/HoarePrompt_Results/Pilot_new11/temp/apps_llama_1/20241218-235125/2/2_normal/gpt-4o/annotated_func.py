#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^18.
def func_1(n):
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))
    #The program returns the sum of the digits of the positive integer `n`, where `n` is a number with up to 18 digits
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a single parameter `n`, a positive integer with up to 18 digits, and returns the sum of its digits. The function handles all positive integers from 1 to 10^18, inclusively, and correctly calculates the sum of digits for numbers of any digit length within this range, including single-digit, two-digit, and up to 18-digit numbers. The input number `n` remains unchanged throughout the function's execution, and the function does not perform any modifications to external state or have any side effects beyond returning the calculated sum of digits. The return value is an integer that represents the sum of all digits in the input number `n`.
