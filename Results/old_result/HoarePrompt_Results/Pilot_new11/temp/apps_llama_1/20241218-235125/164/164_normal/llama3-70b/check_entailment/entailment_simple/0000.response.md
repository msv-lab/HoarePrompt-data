Correctness: **False**

The program is not entirely correct because it does not fully consider all possible jump scenarios as described in the problem. The problem states that the grasshopper can jump to any empty cell that is exactly k cells away, to the left or to the right, and it doesn't matter if the intermediate cells are empty or obstacles.

However, the program only checks if the grasshopper can reach the target insect by jumping in the same direction (either all to the left or all to the right). It does not consider the possibility of the grasshopper changing direction during its jumps.

For example, consider the input:
```
7 2
T...#G
```
In this case, the program will print "NO" because it checks the absolute difference between the positions of 'T' and 'G' and sees that it's not a multiple of k (2). However, the grasshopper can actually reach the target by jumping to the left first and then to the right, like this: `G -> (G-2) -> (G-2-2) = T`. This means that the program does not always do what the problem description says.

To fix this, the program would need to implement a more sophisticated algorithm, such as a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS), to explore all possible jump sequences and determine if the grasshopper can reach the target insect.

Here's an example of how the corrected program could look:
```python
from collections import deque

def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    g, t = -1, -1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'G':
            g = i
        elif s[i] == 'T':
            t = i

    if g == -1 or t == -1:
        print('NO')
    else:
        queue = deque([(g, [g])])
        visited = set([g])
        while queue:
            curr, path = queue.popleft()
            if curr == t:
                print('YES')
                return
            for next_pos in [curr + k, curr - k]:
                if 0 <= next_pos < n and s[next_pos]!= '#' and next_pos not in visited:
                    queue.append((next_pos, path + [next_pos]))
                    visited.add(next_pos)
        print('NO')
```
This corrected program uses a BFS algorithm to explore all possible jump sequences and determine if the grasshopper can reach the target insect. It maintains a queue of positions to visit, along with the path taken to reach each position, and checks if the current position is the target. If it is, it prints "YES" and returns. If it exhausts all possible positions without finding the target, it prints "NO".
