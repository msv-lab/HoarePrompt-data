Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `line` is an input string. If the original index of 'G' in `line` is greater than the original index of 'T' in `line`, then the current value of `G_pos` is the original index of 'T' in `line` and the current value of `T_pos` is the original index of 'G' in `line`. Otherwise, the values of `G_pos` and `T_pos` remain unchanged, with `G_pos` being the index of 'G' in `line` and `T_pos` being the index of 'T' in `line`.**
