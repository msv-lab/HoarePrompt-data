The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional statement. Since there are no loops or conditional statements provided in the code snippet, the impact of the `break` statement on the variables is that it does not change their values, but it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside.

The value of `n` remains an input integer, `k` remains an input integer greater than 0, `line` remains an input string containing both 'G' and 'T', `G_pos` remains defined based on the positions of 'G' and 'T' in `line` and is less than or equal to `T_pos`, `pos` remains `G_pos + k`, and `reachable` remains True.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `line` is an input string containing both 'G' and 'T', `G_pos` is defined based on the positions of 'G' and 'T' in `line` and is less than or equal to `T_pos`, `pos` is `G_pos + k`, `reachable` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
