The value of `g` is updated to be equal to `i`, which is 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `k` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `i` is 2, `g` is 2. If the character at index 2 of string `s` is 'G', then `t` depends on the character at index 2 of string `s`. If the character at index 2 of string `s` is 'T', then `t` is 1 and `g` is 2. For any other character at index 2 of string `s`, the state of `t` and `g` is unchanged, with `t` depending on the character at index 2 of string `s` and `g` is 2.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 2, `k` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `i` is 2, `g` is 2, if the character at index 2 of string `s` is 'G' then `t` depends on 'G', if the character at index 2 of string `s` is 'T' then `t` is 1, for any other character at index 2 of string `s`, `t` depends on the character at index 2 of string `s`**
