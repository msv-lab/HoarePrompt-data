Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `line` is an input string containing both 'G' and 'T', initially `reachable` is `False`, `G_pos` is defined based on the positions of 'G' and 'T' in `line` and is less than or equal to `T_pos`. The current value of `pos` is equal to `T_pos`. If the current value of `line` at position `pos` is '#', then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the execution continues, considering the current state where `pos` equals `T_pos`.**
