You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: On the way to Rio de Janeiro Ostap kills time playing with a grasshopper he took with him in a special box. Ostap builds a line of length n such that some cells of this line are empty and some contain obstacles. Then, he places his grasshopper to one of the empty cells and a small insect in another empty cell. The grasshopper wants to eat the insect.

Ostap knows that grasshopper is able to jump to any empty cell that is exactly k cells away from the current (to the left or to the right). Note that it doesn't matter whether intermediate cells are empty or not as the grasshopper makes a jump over them. For example, if k = 1 the grasshopper can jump to a neighboring cell only, and if k = 2 the grasshopper can jump over a single cell.

Your goal is to determine whether there is a sequence of jumps such that grasshopper will get from his initial position to the cell with an insect.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1) — the number of cells in the line and the length of one grasshopper's jump.

The second line contains a string of length n consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G' and 'T'. Character '.' means that the corresponding cell is empty, character '#' means that the corresponding cell contains an obstacle and grasshopper can't jump there. Character 'G' means that the grasshopper starts at this position and, finally, 'T' means that the target insect is located at this cell. It's guaranteed that characters 'G' and 'T' appear in this line exactly once.


-----Output-----

If there exists a sequence of jumps (each jump of length k), such that the grasshopper can get from his initial position to the cell with the insect, print "YES" (without quotes) in the only line of the input. Otherwise, print "NO" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
5 2
#G#T#

Output
YES

Input
6 1
T....G

Output
YES

Input
7 3
T..#..G

Output
NO

Input
6 2
..GT..

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first sample, the grasshopper can make one jump to the right in order to get from cell 2 to cell 4.

In the second sample, the grasshopper is only able to jump to neighboring cells but the way to the insect is free — he can get there by jumping left 5 times.

In the third sample, the grasshopper can't make a single jump.

In the fourth sample, the grasshopper can only jump to the cells with odd indices, thus he won't be able to reach the insect.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    (g, t) = (-1, -1)
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'G':
            g = i
        elif s[i] == 'T':
            t = i
    if g == -1 or t == -1:
        print('NO')
    elif abs(t - g) % k == 0 and all((s[(g + i * k) % n] != '#' for i in range(abs(t - g) // k + 1))):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the problem description for every potential case. The issue lies in the line where it checks if the grasshopper can make the jumps without encountering any obstacles. The condition `all((s[(g + i * k) % n]!= '#' for i in range(abs(t - g) // k + 1)))` only checks the cells that the grasshopper will land on, but it does not consider the intermediate cells.

However, according to the problem description, it doesn't matter whether intermediate cells are empty or not, as the grasshopper makes a jump over them. The current implementation does not correctly handle this scenario.

For example, if we have the input:
```
6 2
..G..T
```
The program will print "NO" because it checks the cells that the grasshopper will land on and sees that they are not obstacles. However, the correct implementation should allow the grasshopper to jump over the intermediate cells.

A correct implementation would involve performing a breadth-first search (BFS) from the grasshopper's initial position, exploring all possible jumps, and checking if the target position can be reached. 

Here is an example of how the correct implementation could look:
```python
from collections import deque

def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    (g, t) = (-1, -1)
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'G':
            g = i
        elif s[i] == 'T':
            t = i
    if g == -1 or t == -1:
        print('NO')
    else:
        visited = set()
        queue = deque([g])
        visited.add(g)
        while queue:
            current = queue.popleft()
            if current == t:
                print('YES')
                return
            for jump in [-k, k]:
                next_pos = current + jump
                if 0 <= next_pos < n and next_pos not in visited and s[next_pos]!= '#':
                    queue.append(next_pos)
                    visited.add(next_pos)
        print('NO')
```

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), k is a positive integer between 1 and n-1 (inclusive), and there exists a string of length n consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once, representing the initial position of the grasshopper and the target insect, respectively, and '.' and '#' represent empty cells and obstacles, respectively.
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    g, t = -1, -1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'G':
            g = i

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `i` is `n-1`, `g` is the index of the last 'G' in the first `n` characters of `s` or -1 if 'G' is not found, `t` is the index of the last 'T' in the first `n` characters of `s` or -1 if 'T' is not found.
    if (g == -1 or t == -1) :
        print('NO')
    else :
        if (abs(t - g) % k == 0 and all(s[(g + i * k) % n] != '#' for i in range(abs(t -
    g) // k + 1))) :

If the absolute difference between `t` and `g` is a multiple of `k` and all characters at indices `(g + i * k) % n` for `i` ranging from 0 to `abs(t - g) // k` (inclusive) in the string `s` are not '#', then 'YES' has been printed to the console. Otherwise, 'NO' has been printed to the console, with the condition that either `abs(t - g)` is not a multiple of `k` or there exists at least one `i` in the range from 0 to `abs(t - g) // k` (inclusive) such that `s[(g + i * k) % n]` is equal to '#'.

In all other cases, where either `abs(t - g)` is not a multiple of `k` or there exists at least one `i` in the range from 0 to `abs(t - g) // k` (inclusive) such that `s[(g + i * k) % n]` is equal to '#', 'NO' has been printed to the console.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function determines whether a grasshopper can reach a target insect in a circular environment with obstacles, given the environment size (n), the grasshopper's hop size (k), and the initial positions of the grasshopper, the target insect, empty cells, and obstacles. It accepts input parameters n and k, and a string s of length n, where 'G' represents the grasshopper, 'T' represents the target insect, '.' represents empty cells, and '#' represents obstacles. The function checks if the grasshopper and the target insect are present in the string, and if their positions are reachable with the given hop size, considering the presence of obstacles. It returns 'YES' if the target insect is reachable and 'NO' otherwise, handling potential edge cases such as the absence of the grasshopper or the target insect, invalid input parameters, or the presence of obstacles blocking the path. The function also considers the circular nature of the environment, wrapping around the string when the grasshopper's hop exceeds the environment size.
