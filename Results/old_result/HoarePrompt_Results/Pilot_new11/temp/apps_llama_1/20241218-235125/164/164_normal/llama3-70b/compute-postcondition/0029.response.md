Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `i` is `n-1`, `g` is the index of the last 'G' in the first `n` characters of `s`, `t` is the index of the last 'T' in the first `n` characters of `s`, and both `g` and `t` are not equal to -1. If the absolute difference between `t` and `g` is a multiple of `k` and all characters at indices `(g + i * k) % n` for `i` ranging from 0 to `abs(t - g) // k` (inclusive) in the string `s` are not '#', then 'YES' has been printed to the console. Otherwise, 'NO' has been printed to the console, with the condition that either `abs(t - g)` is not a multiple of `k` or there exists at least one `i` in the range from 0 to `abs(t - g) // k` (inclusive) such that `s[(g + i * k) % n]` is equal to '#'.**
