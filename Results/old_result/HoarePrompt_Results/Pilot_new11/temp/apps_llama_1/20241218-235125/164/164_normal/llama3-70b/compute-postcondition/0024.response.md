Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `i` is `n-1`, `g` is the index of the last 'G' in the first `n` characters of `s`, `t` is the index of the last 'T' in the first `n` characters of `s`, and both `g` and `t` are not equal to -1, meaning 'G' and 'T' are found in the first `n` characters of `s`.**
