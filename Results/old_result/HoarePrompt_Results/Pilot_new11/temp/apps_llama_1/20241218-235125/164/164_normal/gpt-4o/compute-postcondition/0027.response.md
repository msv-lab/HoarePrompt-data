Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `line` is an input string containing both 'G' and 'T', `G_pos` is defined based on the positions of 'G' and 'T' in `line` and is less than or equal to `T_pos`, `pos` is `G_pos + k`. If `pos` equals `T_pos`, then `reachable` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `pos` does not equal `T_pos`, then the state remains as before the if statement execution.***
