Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `i` is `n-1`, `g` is the index of the last 'G' in the first `n` characters of `s` or -1 if 'G' is not found, `t` is the index of the last 'T' in the first `n` characters of `s` or -1 if 'T' is not found. The current value of either `g` or `t` (or both) is -1, indicating that either 'G' or 'T' (or both) is not found in the first `n` characters of `s`.**
