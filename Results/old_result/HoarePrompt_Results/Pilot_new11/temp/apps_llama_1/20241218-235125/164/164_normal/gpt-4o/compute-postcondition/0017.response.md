The `break` statement is executed, which means we exit the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. The values of the variables do not change. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `line` is an input string containing both 'G' and 'T', `G_pos` is defined based on the positions of 'G' and 'T' in `line` and is less than or equal to `T_pos`, `pos` is the previous value of `pos` plus `k` and is less than or equal to `T_pos`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
