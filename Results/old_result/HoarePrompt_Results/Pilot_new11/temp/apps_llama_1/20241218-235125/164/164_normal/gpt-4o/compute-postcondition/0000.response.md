The values of `n` and `k` are updated based on the input. `n` and `k` are assigned the values of two integers from the input, which are split by a space. The previous constraints on `n` and `k` are no longer valid as they are overwritten by the input values. However, since `n` and `k` are assigned integer values from the input, they are now integer values, where `n` is the first integer and `k` is the second integer from the input.


Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**
