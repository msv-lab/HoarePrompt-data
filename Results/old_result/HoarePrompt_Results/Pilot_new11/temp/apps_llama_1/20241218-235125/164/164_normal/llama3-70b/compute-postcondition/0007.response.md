Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, initially `g` was -1 and `t` was -1, and the index `i` was initialized to 0. Given that the character at index `i` of string `s` is not 'G', the current value of the character at index `i` of string `s` is 'T'.**
