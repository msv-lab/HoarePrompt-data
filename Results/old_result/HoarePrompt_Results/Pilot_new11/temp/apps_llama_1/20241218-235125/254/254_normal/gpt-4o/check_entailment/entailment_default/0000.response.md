Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program checks whether the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the three input numbers is 1, and if so, it prints 'YES', indicating that it is possible to switch on the garlands in such a way that during each second after switching the garlands on, at least one garland will be lit. However, this approach does not correctly solve the problem.

The problem description states that Mishka wants to switch on the garlands in such a way that during each second after switching the garlands on, at least one garland will be lit. This means that the time intervals between consecutive lit seconds should be less than or equal to the time intervals of the garlands. 

However, the program only checks if the GCD of the time intervals is 1, which is not sufficient to guarantee that there will be at least one lit garland in each second. For example, if the time intervals are 4, 2, and 3, the program will print 'NO' because the GCD of these numbers is 1, but it is actually possible to switch on the garlands in such a way that during each second after switching the garlands on, at least one garland will be lit.

In fact, the correct condition for being able to switch on the garlands in such a way that during each second after switching the garlands on, at least one garland will be lit, is that the least common multiple (LCM) of the time intervals should be equal to the product of the time intervals divided by their GCD. But the program does not check this condition.

So, a case when the program does not work correctly is when the input is 4, 2, and 3. The program will print 'NO', but the correct answer is 'NO' for this case because there is no way to choose such moments of time. However, for the inputs 2, 2, and 3, the program will print 'YES', which is correct.

But for example, the inputs 4, 5, and 6 should print 'NO' because there is no way to switch on the garlands in such a way that during each second after switching the garlands on, at least one garland will be lit. But the program will print 'YES' because the GCD of 4, 5, and 6 is 1.

Therefore, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases.
