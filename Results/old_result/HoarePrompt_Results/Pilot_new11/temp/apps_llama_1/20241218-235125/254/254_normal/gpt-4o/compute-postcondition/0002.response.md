The value of `gcd_all` is assigned the greatest common divisor of `gcd_k1_k2` and `k3`. The greatest common divisor of `k1` and `k2` is `gcd_k1_k2`. `k1` is an integer between 1 and 1500, `k2` is an integer between 1 and 1500, and `k3` is an integer between 1 and 1500.

The states of `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` are not affected. The value of `gcd_k1_k2` is also not affected. 

`gcd_all` is a new variable that is equal to the greatest common divisor of `gcd_k1_k2` and `k3`.

Output State: **`k1` is an integer between 1 and 1500, `k2` is an integer between 1 and 1500, `k3` is an integer between 1 and 1500, `gcd_k1_k2` is the greatest common divisor of `k1` and `k2`, and `gcd_all` is the greatest common divisor of `gcd_k1_k2` and `k3`.**
