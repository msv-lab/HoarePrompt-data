Postcondition: **`k1` is an integer between 1 and 1500, `k2` is an integer between 1 and 1500, `k3` is an integer between 1 and 1500, `gcd_k1_k2` is the greatest common divisor of `k1` and `k2`, and `gcd_all` is the greatest common divisor of `gcd_k1_k2` and `k3`. The greatest common divisor of `gcd_k1_k2` and `k3`, `gcd_all`, is greater than 1.**
