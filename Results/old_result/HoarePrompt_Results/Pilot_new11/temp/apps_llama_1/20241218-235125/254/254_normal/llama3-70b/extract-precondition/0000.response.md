It appears that the function definition provided does not match the problem description. Based on the problem description, it seems that the function should take three parameters, not two. However, I will provide the precondition based on the problem description.


Precondition: **a, b, and another parameter (let's call it c) are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b, c <= 1500, representing the time intervals of the garlands.**
