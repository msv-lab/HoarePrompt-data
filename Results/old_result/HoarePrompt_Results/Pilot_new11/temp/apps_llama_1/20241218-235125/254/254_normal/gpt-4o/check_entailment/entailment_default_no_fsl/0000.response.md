Correctness: **False**

The provided code checks if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the three input numbers `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` is 1. However, this does not necessarily guarantee that it is possible to switch on the garlands in such a way that each second after switching them on, at least one garland will be lit.

For example, consider the case where `k1 = 2`, `k2 = 3`, and `k3 = 5`. The GCD of these numbers is 1, so the code will print 'YES'. However, it is not possible to choose `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` such that each second after switching on the garlands, at least one garland will be lit.

In this case, the first garland will be lit during seconds `x1`, `x1 + 2`, `x1 + 4`,..., the second garland will be lit during seconds `x2`, `x2 + 3`, `x2 + 6`,..., and the third garland will be lit during seconds `x3`, `x3 + 5`, `x3 + 10`,.... Regardless of the values of `x1`, `x2`, and `x3`, there will always be some seconds where no garland is lit.

Therefore, the code does not correctly solve the problem, and its correctness is False.
