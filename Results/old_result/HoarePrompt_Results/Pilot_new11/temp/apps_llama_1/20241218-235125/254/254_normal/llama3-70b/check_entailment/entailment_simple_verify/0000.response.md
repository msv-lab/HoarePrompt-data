Based on the provided problem description, code, and annotations, I have re-evaluated the program's correctness.

The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it only checks if the LCM is divisible by each of the intervals, which is not a sufficient condition to guarantee that at least one garland will be lit every second. However, this assessment seems to be too harsh.

The program calculates the LCM of the three garland intervals and checks if it is divisible by each of the intervals. This approach is actually correct because if the LCM is divisible by each of the intervals, it means that there exists a common multiple of all three intervals, which implies that it is possible to switch on the garlands such that at least one is lit every second.

The annotated version of the code provides more insight into the program's behavior. The function `func_1` calculates the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. The program uses this function to calculate the LCM of the three garland intervals.

The key insight here is that the program is not trying to find the exact moments of time to switch on the garlands, but rather checking if it is possible to do so. The LCM calculation and divisibility checks provide a necessary and sufficient condition for this possibility.

Therefore, I believe that the original assessment is not accurate, and the program is actually correct.

Final: **True**
