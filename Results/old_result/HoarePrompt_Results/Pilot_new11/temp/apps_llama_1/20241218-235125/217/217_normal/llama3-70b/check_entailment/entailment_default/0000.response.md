Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: 
The code does not correctly solve the problem as described. The goal is to find the maximum possible value of `B - C` by partitioning the sequence into two sequences `b` and `c`. However, the code simply sorts the sequence in descending order and then alternates between adding elements to `b` and `c`. This approach does not guarantee the maximum possible value of `B - C`.

A counterexample can be seen in the case when the input is `3` followed by `1 -2 0`. The code will sort the sequence to `[1, 0, -2]` and then assign `b = 1 + (-2) = -1` and `c = 0`. The output will be `-1 - 0 = -1`. However, the correct maximum value of `B - C` should be `3`, which can be achieved by choosing `b = {1, 0}` and `c = {-2}`.

The correct approach should be to try all possible combinations of partitioning the sequence into `b` and `c` and return the maximum value of `B - C`. The given code does not explore all possible combinations, and therefore, it does not guarantee the correct result.
