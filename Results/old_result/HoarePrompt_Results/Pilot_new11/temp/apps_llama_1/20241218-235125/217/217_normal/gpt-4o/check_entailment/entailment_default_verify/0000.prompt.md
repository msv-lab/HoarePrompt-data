You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a sequence a consisting of n integers. You may partition this sequence into two sequences b and c in such a way that every element belongs exactly to one of these sequences. 

Let B be the sum of elements belonging to b, and C be the sum of elements belonging to c (if some of these sequences is empty, then its sum is 0). What is the maximum possible value of B - C?


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of elements in a.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ( - 100 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100) — the elements of sequence a.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible value of B - C, where B is the sum of elements of sequence b, and C is the sum of elements of sequence c.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
1 -2 0

Output
3

Input
6
16 23 16 15 42 8

Output
120



-----Note-----

In the first example we may choose b = {1, 0}, c = { - 2}. Then B = 1, C =  - 2, B - C = 3.

In the second example we choose b = {16, 23, 16, 15, 42, 8}, c = {} (an empty sequence). Then B = 120, C = 0, B - C = 120.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    B = sum((x for x in a if x > 0))
    C = sum((x for x in a if x < 0))
    result = B - C
    print(result)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The given program correctly calculates the maximum possible value of B - C by summing up all the positive numbers in the sequence `a` and subtracting the sum of all the negative numbers. 

This approach works because it ensures that all positive numbers are included in sequence `b` (thus maximizing `B`) and all negative numbers are included in sequence `c` (thus minimizing `C`). This means that `B - C` will be maximized, as all positive numbers will contribute to `B` and all negative numbers will subtract from `C`. 

In the problem description, it's mentioned that we can partition the sequence `a` into two sequences `b` and `c` such that every element belongs exactly to one of these sequences. The program takes advantage of this by including all positive numbers in `b` and all negative numbers in `c`, which results in the maximum possible value of `B - C`. 

For example, consider the input sequence `[-2, 1, 3]`. The program will include `1` and `3` in `b` and `-2` in `c`, resulting in `B = 1 + 3 = 4` and `C = -2`, so `B - C = 6`, which is indeed the maximum possible value.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the examples provided, the program appears to work correctly for all potential cases, and I couldn't find any example where the program does not work as expected.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads an integer n and a sequence of n integers from input, calculates the difference between the sum of all positive integers and the sum of all negative integers in the sequence, and prints the result. The function handles sequences with any combination of positive, negative, and zero integers, and it correctly calculates the result even if the input sequence contains zeros, since zeros are excluded from both the sum of positive and negative integers. The function does not perform any error checking or handling for invalid inputs, such as non-integer values or a sequence length that does not match the specified integer n. After the function concludes, the program state will have been modified by the input and output operations, but the function's local variables (n, a, B, C, result) will no longer be accessible. The output will be the calculated difference between the sum of positive and negative integers in the input sequence.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
