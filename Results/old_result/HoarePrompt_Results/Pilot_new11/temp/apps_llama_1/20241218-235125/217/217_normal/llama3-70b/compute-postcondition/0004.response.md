According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `n` is already given as an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), this condition is met. Before the loop starts, `i` needs to be initialized to the first value in the range, which is 0. 

State: **The input is well-formed, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers in descending order, where -100 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100, `b` is 0, `c` is 0, `i` is 0**
