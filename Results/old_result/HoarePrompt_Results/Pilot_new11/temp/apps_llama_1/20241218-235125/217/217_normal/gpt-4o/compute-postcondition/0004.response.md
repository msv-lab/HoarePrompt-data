The value of `result` is assigned the difference between `B` and `C`, where `B` is the sum of all positive integers in `a` and `C` is the sum of all negative integers in `a`. The states of the other variables are not affected. The value of `n` remains an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive; `a` is a list of input integers; `B` is the sum of all positive integers in `a`; `C` is the sum of all negative integers in `a`; `result` is equal to `B - C`**
