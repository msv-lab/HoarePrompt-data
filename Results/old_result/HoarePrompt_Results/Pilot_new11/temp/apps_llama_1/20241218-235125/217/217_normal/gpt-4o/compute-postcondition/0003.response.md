To find the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state provides that `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive; `a` is a list of input integers; and `B` is the sum of all positive integers in `a`. 

The code calculates `C` as the sum of all integers `x` in `a` where `x` is less than 0. This implies `C` is the sum of all negative integers in `a`.

Given this, the value of `n` and the definition of `B` as the sum of all positive integers in `a` remain unchanged by the code. The code introduces a new variable `C`, which is the sum of all negative integers in `a`.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive; `a` is a list of input integers; `B` is the sum of all positive integers in `a`; and `C` is the sum of all negative integers in `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive; `a` is a list of input integers; `B` is the sum of all positive integers in `a`; `C` is the sum of all negative integers in `a`.**
