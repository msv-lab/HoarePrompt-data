The code `a.sort(reverse=True)` sorts the list `a` in descending order. The input is well-formed, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and `a` is a list of `n` integers. After sorting, the list `a` will still have `n` integers, but they will be arranged in descending order. The values of the integers in the list are still between -100 and 100 (inclusive).

Output State: **The input is well-formed, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers in descending order, where -100 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100**
