The code introduces two new variables, `b` and `c`, and assigns them the value 0. The values of `n` and `a` are not affected. 

Output State: **The input is well-formed, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers in descending order, where -100 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100, `b` is 0, `c` is 0**
