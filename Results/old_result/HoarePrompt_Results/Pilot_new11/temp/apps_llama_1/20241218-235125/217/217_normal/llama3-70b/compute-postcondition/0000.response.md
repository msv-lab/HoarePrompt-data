The input is well-formed, consisting of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2,..., a_{n} (-100 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100). The code reads the first line and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. 

Output State: **The input is well-formed, the first line has been read, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and the second line contains `n` integers a_1, a_2,..., a_{n} (-100 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100).**
