According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i+1`, `n` is greater than `i`. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than the new `i` (which is `i+1`). 

Also, the list `a` has `n` integers in descending order and its state does not need to be changed as `n` is still the same.

So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` must be greater than the new `i`.

Considering the new `i`, if it is even, we need to consider the parity of the initial `i+1`. If the initial `i+1` was even, then `b` is updated to `a[0] + a[i]` and `c` is 0. If the initial `i+1` was odd, then `b` is `a[i]` and `c` is `a[i+1]`. If the new `i` is odd, then if the new `i+1` is even, `b` is `a[0]` and `c` is `a[i]`, if the new `i+1` is odd, `b` is 0 and `c` is `a[i] + a[i+1]`. 

However, we do not know the exact parity of `i+1` in the previous iteration, or the new `i+1`. Hence, we will describe the updated rules based on the current `i`. 

If `i` is even after the increment (which means `i` was odd before the increment), then we need to consider the two cases:
1) if the new `i+1` is even (which means `i` was odd and `i+1` is even now, so `i+1` was even before), then `b` is updated to `a[0]` and `c` is updated to `a[i]`.
2) if the new `i+1` is odd, then `b` is updated to 0 and `c` is updated to `a[i] + a[i+1]`.

If `i` is odd after the increment, then `i` was even before the increment. We also consider the two cases:
1) if the initial `i+1` was even (which means `i` is odd now, and `i+1` is even now), then `b` is updated to `a[0] + a[i-1]` (note that we use `i-1` here, since `i` has been incremented) and `c` is updated to 0.
2) if the initial `i+1` was odd, then `b` is `a[i-1]` and `c` is `a[i]`.

However, because we are dealing with `i` after it has been incremented, so it is better to describe the state based on `i` and `n`.

State: **the input is well-formed, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and `n` is greater than `i+1`, `a` is a list of `n` integers in descending order, where -100 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100, `i` is `i+1`. The exact values of `b` and `c` depend on the parity of `i` before and after the increment, but `b` and `c` will be updated based on the updated `i` and the list `a`.**
