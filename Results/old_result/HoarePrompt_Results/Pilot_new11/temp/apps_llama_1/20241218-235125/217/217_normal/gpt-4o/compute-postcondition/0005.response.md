The provided code snippet is a `print` statement that outputs the value of `result`. This operation does not modify any variables. 

The value of `result` is equal to `B - C`, where `B` is the sum of all positive integers in `a` and `C` is the sum of all negative integers in `a`. 

The `print` statement has the effect of displaying the value of `result`, but it does not change the state of any variable.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive; `a` is a list of input integers; `B` is the sum of all positive integers in `a`; `C` is the sum of all negative integers in `a`; `result` is equal to `B - C`, and the value of `result` (which is `B - C`) has been printed.**
