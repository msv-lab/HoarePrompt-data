Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. 

1. It reads three positive real numbers `x`, `y`, and `z` from standard input, which is in line with the problem description. The problem description states that the input will be valid, so the program does not need to handle cases where the input is not valid.

2. It calculates the 12 different expressions involving exponentiation of `x`, `y`, and `z` as required by the problem description. The expressions are calculated in the correct order, and all possible combinations are considered.

3. It determines the maximum value among these expressions and prints the string representation of the expression that yields this maximum value. If there are multiple expressions that yield the maximum value, it will print the first one encountered, which is also in line with the problem description.

The program does not need to explicitly handle cases where the maximum value could be the result of multiple expressions because Python's `max` function with a `key` argument will return the first maximum value it encounters in the list of expressions.

The program also does not need to handle cases where the input is not a valid list of three positive real numbers because the problem description states that the input will be valid. 

Therefore, the program is correct and always does what the problem description says.
