The code `x, y, z = map(float, input().split())` updates the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` based on the input. The `map(float, input().split())` expression splits the input into three parts, converts each part to a float, and returns these float values. 

The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are now the input floats. The precondition that `x`, `y`, and `z` are positive real numbers is still valid, but the constraint of having exactly one digit after the decimal point is no longer guaranteed because the input values can have any number of decimal places.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are positive real numbers, input by the user, and are assigned the values of the three input floats.**
