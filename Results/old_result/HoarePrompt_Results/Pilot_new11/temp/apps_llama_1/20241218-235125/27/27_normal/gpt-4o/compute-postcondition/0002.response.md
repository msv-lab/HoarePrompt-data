The code creates a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a mathematical expression and its string representation. The expressions involve the input floating point numbers `x`, `y`, and `z`, and the exponentiation operator `**`.

The value of `expressions` is a list of 12 tuples, where each tuple is of the form `(result, formula)`, with `result` being the result of the exponentiation and `formula` being a string describing the formula used to calculate the result.

The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are not changed by the code. The code only creates a new variable `expressions` and assigns it a list of tuples.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are the three input floating point numbers, `expressions` is a list of 12 tuples, where each tuple contains a mathematical expression and its string representation, involving `x`, `y`, and `z` in different exponentiation operations**.
