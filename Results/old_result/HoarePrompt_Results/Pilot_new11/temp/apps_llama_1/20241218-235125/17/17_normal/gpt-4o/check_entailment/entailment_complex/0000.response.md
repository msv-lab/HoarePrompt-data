Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description requires that the program determine whether it is possible to form a regular bracket sequence by choosing the correct order of the given strings.

The given strings are of length 2 and are represented as follows:
- cnt_1: number of strings "("
- cnt_2: number of strings "()"
- cnt_3: number of strings ")("
- cnt_4: number of strings ")"

To form a regular bracket sequence, the total number of opening brackets must equal the total number of closing brackets. This is represented by the condition `cnt1 + cnt2 == cnt3 + cnt4`.

Additionally, the program must ensure that the number of "()" strings is sufficient to balance the number of ")(" strings. This is because each ")(" string can be balanced by a corresponding "()" string. This is represented by the condition `cnt2 >= cnt3`.

The program correctly checks these conditions and prints 1 if they are met, indicating that it is possible to form a regular bracket sequence. Otherwise, it prints 0, indicating that it is not possible to form a regular bracket sequence.

The program does not need to consider the actual sequence of the strings, as the problem description only asks whether it is possible to form a regular bracket sequence. The conditions checked by the program are sufficient to determine this possibility.

Therefore, the program is correct, and it meets the requirements specified in the problem description for all potential cases.
