Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The condition `if cnt3 > cnt1` is not sufficient to determine whether a regular bracket sequence can be formed. 

A correct condition would be `if cnt3 + cnt4 > cnt1 + cnt2 + 1` or `if cnt1 > cnt3 + cnt4 + 1` and `(cnt1 - cnt3 - cnt4) % 2 == cnt2` when `cnt1 >= cnt3 + cnt4`. When `cnt1 < cnt3 + cnt4`, we should also check `cnt2 >= cnt3 + cnt4 - cnt1` to ensure that every opening bracket can be matched. Otherwise, the program should print `0`.

A counterexample for the given program is when `cnt1 = 1`, `cnt2 = 3`, `cnt3 = 0`, `cnt4 = 0`. In this case, the program will print `1`, but the correct output should be `0` because it's impossible to form a regular bracket sequence with these strings. 

Here's a correct implementation in Python:
```python
def func():
    (cnt1, cnt2, cnt3, cnt4) = map(int, [input() for _ in range(4)])
    if cnt1 > cnt3 + cnt4:
        print(1 if (cnt1 - cnt3 - cnt4) % 2 == cnt2 else 0)
    elif cnt1 < cnt3 + cnt4:
        print(1 if cnt2 >= cnt3 + cnt4 - cnt1 else 0)
    else:
        print(1 if cnt2 >= 1 or cnt2 == 0 and cnt3 + cnt4 == 0 else 0)
```
