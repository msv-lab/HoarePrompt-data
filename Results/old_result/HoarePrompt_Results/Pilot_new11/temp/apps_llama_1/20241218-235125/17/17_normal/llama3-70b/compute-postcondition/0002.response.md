The code simply prints the value 0. This operation does not modify the values of any variables. The previous values of `cnt1`, `cnt2`, `cnt3`, and `cnt4` are still valid, and the condition that `cnt3` is higher than `cnt1` remains unchanged. The value 0 has been printed, and the state of the variables remains as it was before the execution of the code.

Output State: **`cnt1` is a non-negative integer input, `cnt2` is a non-negative integer input, `cnt3` is a non-negative integer input, `cnt4` is a non-negative integer input, `cnt3` is higher than `cnt1`, and the value 0 has been printed**
