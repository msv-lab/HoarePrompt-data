Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It takes the number of digits and the base of two numbers, X and Y, as input, followed by the digits of X and Y. It then converts these numbers from their respective bases to decimal using the `func_1` function. 

The `func_1` function correctly converts a number from any base to decimal. It does this by iterating through the digits of the number from left to right, and for each digit, it multiplies the current decimal value by the base and adds the digit. This is equivalent to the formula for converting a number from any base to decimal: `decimal_value = Î£ digits[i]*base^(n-1-i) for i from 0 to n-1`, where `n` is the number of digits in the number.

After converting both numbers to decimal, the program compares the decimal values and prints '<' if X is less than Y, '>' if X is greater than Y, and '=' if X is equal to Y. This matches the problem description's requirements for the output.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including the conversion of numbers with different bases and the comparison of the decimal values. It assumes that the input is valid, as stated in the problem description, so it does not perform any error checking on the input parameters.

Therefore, the program is correct and always follows the problem description.
