You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: After seeing the "ALL YOUR BASE ARE BELONG TO US" meme for the first time, numbers X and Y realised that they have different bases, which complicated their relations.

You're given a number X represented in base b_{x} and a number Y represented in base b_{y}. Compare those two numbers.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers n and b_{x} (1 ≤ n ≤ 10, 2 ≤ b_{x} ≤ 40), where n is the number of digits in the b_{x}-based representation of X. 

The second line contains n space-separated integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n} (0 ≤ x_{i} < b_{x}) — the digits of X. They are given in the order from the most significant digit to the least significant one.

The following two lines describe Y in the same way: the third line contains two space-separated integers m and b_{y} (1 ≤ m ≤ 10, 2 ≤ b_{y} ≤ 40, b_{x} ≠ b_{y}), where m is the number of digits in the b_{y}-based representation of Y, and the fourth line contains m space-separated integers y_1, y_2, ..., y_{m} (0 ≤ y_{i} < b_{y}) — the digits of Y.

There will be no leading zeroes. Both X and Y will be positive. All digits of both numbers are given in the standard decimal numeral system.


-----Output-----

Output a single character (quotes for clarity):   '<' if X < Y  '>' if X > Y  '=' if X = Y 


-----Examples-----
Input
6 2
1 0 1 1 1 1
2 10
4 7

Output

15 15 4 0 0 7 10
7 9
4 8 0 3 1 5 0

Output

-----Note-----

In the first sample, X = 101111_2 = 47_10 = Y.

In the second sample, X = 102_3 = 21_5 and Y = 24_5 = 112_3, thus X < Y.

In the third sample, $X = FF 4007 A_{16}$ and Y = 4803150_9. We may notice that X starts with much larger digits and b_{x} is much larger than b_{y}, so X is clearly larger than Y.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
(n, base_x) = map(int, input().split())
digits_x = list(map(int, input().split()))
(m, base_y) = map(int, input().split())
digits_y = list(map(int, input().split()))
decimal_x = func_1(digits_x, base_x)
decimal_y = func_1(digits_y, base_y)
if decimal_x < decimal_y:
    print('<')
elif decimal_x > decimal_y:
    print('>')
else:
    print('=')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: digits is a list of integers, and base is an integer such that 2 <= base <= 40 and all elements of digits are integers between 0 and base - 1.
def func_1(digits, base):
    decimal_value = 0
    for digit in digits:
        decimal_value = decimal_value * base + digit
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the given information and the loop code step by step.
    #
    #1. **Initial State**: 
    #   - `digits` is a list of integers.
    #   - `base` is an integer such that 2 <= `base` <= 40.
    #   - All elements of `digits` are integers between 0 and `base` - 1.
    #   - `decimal_value` is 0.
    #
    #2. **Loop Code**:
    #   ```
    #   for digit in digits:
    #       decimal_value = decimal_value * base + digit
    #   ```
    #
    #3. **Output States after a few iterations**:
    #   - After 1 iteration: `decimal_value` equals the first digit in `digits`.
    #   - After 2 iterations: `decimal_value` equals the first digit multiplied by `base` plus the second digit.
    #   - After 3 iterations: `decimal_value` equals `(digits[0] * base + digits[1]) * base + digits[2]`, which can be generalized to a polynomial expression representing the conversion of a number from base `base` to decimal.
    #
    #Given the pattern observed from the output states after a few iterations, we can infer that `decimal_value` is calculated by converting the number represented by the list `digits` from base `base` to decimal. The formula for converting a number from any base to decimal is the sum of each digit times the base raised to the power of its position from right to left, starting at 0.
    #
    #Thus, if `digits` has `n` elements, the decimal value can be calculated as:
    #```
    #decimal_value = digits[n-1] + digits[n-2]*base + digits[n-3]*base^2 +... + digits[0]*base^(n-1)
    #```
    #Or more concisely using sigma notation:
    #```
    #decimal_value = Σ digits[i]*base^(n-1-i) for i from 0 to n-1
    #```
    #
    #If the list `digits` is empty, the loop will not execute, and `decimal_value` will remain 0, which is the decimal representation of an empty list in any base.
    #
    #**Output State**: **`decimal_value` is the decimal equivalent of the number represented by `digits` in base `base`, `base` is an integer such that 2 <= `base` <= 40, `digits` is a list of integers where all elements are between 0 and `base` - 1.**
    return decimal_value
    #The program returns `decimal_value`, which is the decimal equivalent of the number represented by `digits` in base `base`, where `base` is an integer between 2 and 40 (inclusive), and `digits` is a list of integers with all elements between 0 and `base` - 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:This function converts a number represented as a list of digits in a given base to its decimal equivalent. It accepts two parameters: a list of integers `digits` and an integer `base`, where `base` is between 2 and 40 (inclusive) and all elements of `digits` are between 0 and `base` - 1. The function returns the decimal value of the number represented by `digits` in base `base`. If the list `digits` is empty, the function returns 0, which is the decimal representation of an empty list in any base. The function correctly handles all potential edge cases, including the conversion of numbers with leading zeros and the handling of empty input lists. It does not perform any error checking on the input parameters, so it assumes that the inputs are valid. The final state of the program is that it returns the decimal equivalent of the input number, leaving the input parameters unchanged.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
