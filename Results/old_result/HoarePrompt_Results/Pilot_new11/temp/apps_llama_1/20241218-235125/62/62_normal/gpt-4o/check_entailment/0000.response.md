Correctness: **True**

The given program compares two numbers X and Y, represented in different bases. The program correctly converts each number to decimal using the provided base and then compares their decimal values. The conversion function `func_1` accurately calculates the decimal equivalent of a given number by iterating over its digits and applying the standard base conversion formula.

The comparison logic is also sound: it checks if X is less than, greater than, or equal to Y and prints the corresponding character ('<', '>', or '='). The program handles all possible cases, including when the two numbers are equal, as shown in the examples.

Since the program correctly implements the required functionality and handles all potential cases as described, it is considered correct. The provided examples in the problem description also validate the program's behavior, demonstrating that it produces the expected output for different inputs.

In summary, the program is correct because:

1. It accurately converts numbers from their respective bases to decimal.
2. It correctly compares the decimal values of the two numbers.
3. It handles all possible comparison outcomes (less than, greater than, and equal) and prints the corresponding character.

Without finding any case where the program does not behave as expected according to the problem description, the conclusion is that the program is correct.
