You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: After seeing the "ALL YOUR BASE ARE BELONG TO US" meme for the first time, numbers X and Y realised that they have different bases, which complicated their relations.

You're given a number X represented in base b_{x} and a number Y represented in base b_{y}. Compare those two numbers.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers n and b_{x} (1 ≤ n ≤ 10, 2 ≤ b_{x} ≤ 40), where n is the number of digits in the b_{x}-based representation of X. 

The second line contains n space-separated integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n} (0 ≤ x_{i} < b_{x}) — the digits of X. They are given in the order from the most significant digit to the least significant one.

The following two lines describe Y in the same way: the third line contains two space-separated integers m and b_{y} (1 ≤ m ≤ 10, 2 ≤ b_{y} ≤ 40, b_{x} ≠ b_{y}), where m is the number of digits in the b_{y}-based representation of Y, and the fourth line contains m space-separated integers y_1, y_2, ..., y_{m} (0 ≤ y_{i} < b_{y}) — the digits of Y.

There will be no leading zeroes. Both X and Y will be positive. All digits of both numbers are given in the standard decimal numeral system.


-----Output-----

Output a single character (quotes for clarity):   '<' if X < Y  '>' if X > Y  '=' if X = Y 


-----Examples-----
Input
6 2
1 0 1 1 1 1
2 10
4 7

Output

15 15 4 0 0 7 10
7 9
4 8 0 3 1 5 0

Output

-----Note-----

In the first sample, X = 101111_2 = 47_10 = Y.

In the second sample, X = 102_3 = 21_5 and Y = 24_5 = 112_3, thus X < Y.

In the third sample, $X = FF 4007 A_{16}$ and Y = 4803150_9. We may notice that X starts with much larger digits and b_{x} is much larger than b_{y}, so X is clearly larger than Y.
Program:
```
(n, bx) = map(int, input().split())
x_digits = list(map(int, input().split()))
(m, by) = map(int, input().split())
y_digits = list(map(int, input().split()))
x = func_1(x_digits, bx)
y = func_1(y_digits, by)
if x < y:
    print('<')
elif x > y:
    print('>')
else:
    print('=')

def func_1(digits, base):
    result = 0
    for digit in digits:
        result = result * base + digit
    return result


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The program appears to be correct and follows the problem description. It correctly converts the input numbers from their respective bases to decimal and then compares them.

Here's a breakdown of how the program works:

1. The first two lines of the input are read, containing the number of digits `n` and the base `bx` of the first number `X`, as well as the digits of `X` in base `bx`.
2. The same process is repeated for the second number `Y`, reading the number of digits `m`, the base `by`, and the digits of `Y` in base `by`.
3. The `func_1` function is used to convert the digits of `X` and `Y` from their respective bases to decimal.
4. The converted decimal values of `X` and `Y` are compared, and the program outputs the correct comparison result (`<`, `>`, or `=`).

The `func_1` function uses the standard method for converting a number from a given base to decimal, iterating over the digits and calculating the decimal value using the formula `result = result * base + digit`.

I couldn't find any potential cases where the program would not work correctly, and it seems to handle all possible inputs according to the problem description. The examples provided also demonstrate the program's correctness.

However, it's worth noting that the program assumes that the input is well-formed and follows the specified format. If the input could be malformed or contain invalid data, additional error checking and handling might be necessary to ensure the program's correctness in all cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
(n, bx) = map(int, input().split())
x_digits = list(map(int, input().split()))
(m, by) = map(int, input().split())
y_digits = list(map(int, input().split()))
x = func_1(x_digits, bx)
y = func_1(y_digits, by)
if x < y:
    print('<')
elif x > y:
    print('>')
else:
    print('=')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: digits is a list of integers, and base is an integer such that 2 <= base <= 40 and all elements in digits are between 0 and base - 1.
def func_1(digits, base):
    result = 0
    for digit in digits:
        result = result * base + digit
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `digits` is a list of integers, `base` is an integer such that 2 <= `base` <= 40, all elements in `digits` are between 0 and `base` - 1, `result` is the polynomial evaluation of `digits` in base `base`, i.e., `result` equals the sum of each digit in `digits` multiplied by `base` raised to the power of its 0-indexed position.
    return result
    #The program returns the polynomial evaluation of the list 'digits' in base 'base', where 'digits' is a list of integers and 'base' is an integer between 2 and 40, and all elements in 'digits' are between 0 and 'base' - 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `digits` and an integer `base`, and returns the decimal equivalent of the polynomial evaluation of `digits` in base `base`. The inputs are constrained such that `base` is between 2 and 40 (inclusive), and all elements in `digits` are between 0 and `base` - 1. The function correctly handles various valid inputs, converting them into their decimal representations, but does not explicitly handle edge cases such as empty input lists or invalid input types. For valid inputs, the function returns the expected decimal value, which is the sum of each digit in `digits` multiplied by `base` raised to the power of its 0-indexed position. If the input list `digits` is empty, the function will return 0, as the initial value of `result` is 0 and no operations will be performed to change this value. The function does not include any error checking or handling for cases where the inputs may not meet the specified constraints, implying that it assumes well-formed inputs.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
