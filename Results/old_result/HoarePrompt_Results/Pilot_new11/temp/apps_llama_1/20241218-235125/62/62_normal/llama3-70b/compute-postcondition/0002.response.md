The value of `result` is updated by multiplying the current `result` by `base` and adding the value of `digit`. The initial value of `result` is 0, so `result` becomes `0 * base + digit`, which simplifies to just `digit`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`digits` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 digit, `base` is an integer such that 2 <= `base` <= 40, all elements in `digits` are between 0 and `base` - 1, `result` is equal to the value of `digit`, `digit` is the first digit in the list**
