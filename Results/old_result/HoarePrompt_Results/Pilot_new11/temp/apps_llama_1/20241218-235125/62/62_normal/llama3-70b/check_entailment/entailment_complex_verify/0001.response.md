The original assessment of the program's correctness is **True**. The provided program correctly compares two numbers represented in different bases. The key to the solution is the `func_1` function, which converts a number from any base to base 10 (decimal system). This is done by iterating over the digits of the number from left to right, multiplying the current result by the base, and adding the current digit.

The annotated version of the code confirms this assessment. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the decimal equivalent of a number in a given base. The annotations state that the function returns the polynomial evaluation of the list 'digits' in base 'base', which is the correct approach to convert a number from any base to base 10.

The program handles all the examples provided in the problem description correctly. For example, in the first sample, `X = 101111_2 = 47_10` and `Y = 47_10`, so the program correctly prints `=`.

The annotated version also mentions that the function does not explicitly handle edge cases such as empty input lists or invalid input types. However, since we are assuming that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, this does not affect the correctness of the program.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code, I maintain the original assessment of the program's correctness.

Final: **True**
