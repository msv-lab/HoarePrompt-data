Correctness: **True**.

The program appears to be correct and follows the problem description. It correctly converts the input numbers from their respective bases to decimal and then compares them.

Here's a breakdown of how the program works:

1. The first two lines of the input are read, containing the number of digits `n` and the base `bx` of the first number `X`, as well as the digits of `X` in base `bx`.
2. The same process is repeated for the second number `Y`, reading the number of digits `m`, the base `by`, and the digits of `Y` in base `by`.
3. The `func_1` function is used to convert the digits of `X` and `Y` from their respective bases to decimal.
4. The converted decimal values of `X` and `Y` are compared, and the program outputs the correct comparison result (`<`, `>`, or `=`).

The `func_1` function uses the standard method for converting a number from a given base to decimal, iterating over the digits and calculating the decimal value using the formula `result = result * base + digit`.

I couldn't find any potential cases where the program would not work correctly, and it seems to handle all possible inputs according to the problem description. The examples provided also demonstrate the program's correctness.

However, it's worth noting that the program assumes that the input is well-formed and follows the specified format. If the input could be malformed or contain invalid data, additional error checking and handling might be necessary to ensure the program's correctness in all cases.
