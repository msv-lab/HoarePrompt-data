#State of the program right berfore the function call: digits is a list of integers, and base is an integer such that 2 <= base <= 40 and all elements in digits are between 0 and base - 1.
def func_1(digits, base):
    result = 0
    for digit in digits:
        result = result * base + digit
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `digits` is a list of integers, `base` is an integer such that 2 <= `base` <= 40, all elements in `digits` are between 0 and `base` - 1, `result` is the polynomial evaluation of `digits` in base `base`, i.e., `result` equals the sum of each digit in `digits` multiplied by `base` raised to the power of its 0-indexed position.
    return result
    #The program returns the polynomial evaluation of the list 'digits' in base 'base', where 'digits' is a list of integers and 'base' is an integer between 2 and 40, and all elements in 'digits' are between 0 and 'base' - 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `digits` and an integer `base`, and returns the decimal equivalent of the polynomial evaluation of `digits` in base `base`. The inputs are constrained such that `base` is between 2 and 40 (inclusive), and all elements in `digits` are between 0 and `base` - 1. The function correctly handles various valid inputs, converting them into their decimal representations, but does not explicitly handle edge cases such as empty input lists or invalid input types. For valid inputs, the function returns the expected decimal value, which is the sum of each digit in `digits` multiplied by `base` raised to the power of its 0-indexed position. If the input list `digits` is empty, the function will return 0, as the initial value of `result` is 0 and no operations will be performed to change this value. The function does not include any error checking or handling for cases where the inputs may not meet the specified constraints, implying that it assumes well-formed inputs.
