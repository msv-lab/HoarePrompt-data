Functionality: **The function takes four integers as input (N, M, K, L) and checks two conditions: if M is greater than or equal to N - K + 1 and if M is greater than or equal to L. If both conditions are met, it prints 1, indicating a valid state; otherwise, it prints -1, indicating an invalid state. After execution, the program will have printed either 1 or -1, depending on the conditions, and the input integers will remain unchanged. The function does not handle cases where the input integers do not meet the initial constraints (1 <= K <= N and 1 <= M, L, and 1 <= L <= N - K), as it does not include any error checking or handling for invalid inputs.**
