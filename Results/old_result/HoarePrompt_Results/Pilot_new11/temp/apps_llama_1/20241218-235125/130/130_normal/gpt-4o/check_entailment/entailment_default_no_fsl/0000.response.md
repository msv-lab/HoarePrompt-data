Correctness: **True**

The code provided is a solution to the problem of finding the minimum number of coins each of Ivan's friends needs to gift him, such that he receives at least `L` new coins. 

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the code is correct:

1. The code calculates `min_x`, which is the minimum number of coins each friend needs to gift Ivan, using the formula `(L + M - 1) // M`. This formula ensures that the total number of coins gifted is at least `L`.

2. The code then checks if it's possible to receive at least `L` new coins without exceeding the total number of available coins (`N - K`). If `M * min_x` is less than or equal to `N - K`, it prints `min_x`, indicating the minimum number of coins each friend needs to gift.

3. If `M * min_x` is greater than `N - K`, it means that the minimum number of rounds required to receive `L` new coins would exceed the available coins. In this case, the code prints `-1`, indicating that it's impossible to fulfill Ivan's requirement.

The code correctly handles all possible cases, including the examples provided in the problem statement. 

For example, if we input `20 15 2 3`, the code calculates `min_x` as `(3 + 15 - 1) // 15 = 1`, and since `15 * 1` is less than `20 - 2 = 18`, it prints `1`. 

Similarly, if we input `10 11 2 4`, the code calculates `min_x` as `(4 + 11 - 1) // 11 = 1`, but since `11 * 1` is less than `10 - 2 = 8` is false, and `(4 + 11 - 1) // 11` is actually `1` but then `11*1 = 11` which is greater than `8`, so it prints `-1`. 

The code assumes that the input is valid, as specified in the problem statement, and it handles all possible cases correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the code is **True**.
