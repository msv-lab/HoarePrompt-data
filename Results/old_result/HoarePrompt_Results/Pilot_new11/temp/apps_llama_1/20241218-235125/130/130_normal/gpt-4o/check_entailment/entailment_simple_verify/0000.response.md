Based on the provided problem description, code, and annotations, I will analyze the correctness of the program.

The original assessment claims that the program correctly calculates the minimum number of coins each friend must gift to Ivan, satisfying the given conditions. The assessment provides a step-by-step explanation of the program's logic, which seems to align with the problem description.

The annotated code also supports the original assessment. The annotations describe the state of the program at different points, including the input values, the calculation of `min_x`, and the condition for printing `min_x` or `-1`. These annotations confirm that the program follows the logic described in the original assessment.

However, upon closer inspection, I notice that the program does not explicitly check if `M` (the number of friends) is greater than `N` (the total number of different collectible coins). If `M` is indeed greater than `N`, it means that there are not enough distinct coins for each friend to gift a different coin, which would make it impossible to satisfy the conditions.

But, the program indirectly checks this condition through the `if (M * min_x <= N - K)` statement. If `M` is greater than `N`, `min_x` would likely be small (e.g., 1), and the product `M * min_x` would still exceed `N - K`. In such cases, the program would print `-1`, indicating that it's impossible to satisfy the conditions.

Given the provided information, I conclude that the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly handles the conditions and scenarios described in the problem description. The annotations support the original assessment, and I did not find any flaws in the program's logic.

Final: **True**
