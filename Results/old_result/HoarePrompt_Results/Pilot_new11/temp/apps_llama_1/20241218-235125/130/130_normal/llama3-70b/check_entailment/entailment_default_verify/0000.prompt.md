You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Ivan is collecting coins. There are only $N$ different collectible coins, Ivan has $K$ of them. He will be celebrating his birthday soon, so all his $M$ freinds decided to gift him coins. They all agreed to three terms:  Everyone must gift as many coins as others. All coins given to Ivan must be different. Not less than $L$ coins from gifts altogether, must be new in Ivan's collection.

But his friends don't know which coins have Ivan already got in his collection. They don't want to spend money so they want to buy minimum quantity of coins, that satisfy all terms, irrespective of the Ivan's collection. Help them to find this minimum number of coins or define it's not possible to meet all the terms.


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains 4 integers $N$, $M$, $K$, $L$ ($1 \le K \le N \le 10^{18}$; $1 \le M, \,\, L \le 10^{18}$) — quantity of different coins, number of Ivan's friends, size of Ivan's collection and quantity of coins, that must be new in Ivan's collection.


-----Output-----

Print one number — minimal number of coins one friend can gift to satisfy all the conditions. If it is impossible to satisfy all three conditions print "-1" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
20 15 2 3

Output
1
Input
10 11 2 4

Output
-1


-----Note-----

In the first test, one coin from each friend is enough, as he will be presented with 15 different coins and 13 of them will definitely be new.

In the second test, Ivan has 11 friends, but there are only 10 different coins. So all friends can't present him different coins.
Program:
```
def func():
    (N, M, K, L) = map(int, input().split())
    if M >= N - K + 1 and M >= L:
        print(1)
    else:
        print(-1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. It only checks if the number of friends is greater than or equal to the number of new coins Ivan can get and the required number of new coins, and if so, prints 1. However, this does not take into account the fact that each friend must give the same number of coins, and that the total number of given coins must be minimized.

For example, consider the input `N = 10, M = 1, K = 5, L = 2`. The program will print `1`, but this is incorrect because one friend cannot give 1 coin to satisfy the condition that at least 2 new coins are given.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of coins that each friend must give, such that the total number of coins given is minimized and the conditions are satisfied. 

This requires a more complex solution that takes into account the number of new coins Ivan can get, the required number of new coins, and the fact that each friend must give the same number of coins. 

For example, for the input `N = 10, M = 1, K = 5, L = 2`, the correct output should be `-1` because one friend cannot give a number of coins that satisfies the conditions. 

Another example, for the input `N = 10, M = 2, K = 5, L = 3`, the correct output should be `-1` because two friends cannot give the same number of coins that satisfies the conditions. 

However, for the input `N = 20, M = 15, K = 2, L = 3`, the correct output should be `1` because each friend can give 1 coin and the conditions will be satisfied. 

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function takes four integers as input (N, M, K, L) and checks two conditions: if M is greater than or equal to N - K + 1 and if M is greater than or equal to L. If both conditions are met, it prints 1, indicating a valid state; otherwise, it prints -1, indicating an invalid state. After execution, the program will have printed either 1 or -1, depending on the conditions, and the input integers will remain unchanged. The function does not handle cases where the input integers do not meet the initial constraints (1 <= K <= N and 1 <= M, L, and 1 <= L <= N - K), as it does not include any error checking or handling for invalid inputs.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
