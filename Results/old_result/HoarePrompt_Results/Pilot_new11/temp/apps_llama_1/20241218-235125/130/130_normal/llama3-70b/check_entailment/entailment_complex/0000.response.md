Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct based on the given problem description. It checks two conditions:

1. `M >= N - K + 1`: This condition ensures that there are enough friends (`M`) to gift at least `N - K + 1` different coins. Since each friend gifts the same number of coins and all gifted coins must be different, this is a necessary condition to guarantee that at least `N - K` new coins can be gifted.

2. `M >= L`: This condition ensures that the number of friends (`M`) is sufficient to guarantee that at least `L` new coins are gifted.

If both conditions are met, the program prints `1`, indicating that each friend can gift `1` coin to satisfy all the conditions. If either condition is not met, it prints `-1`, indicating that it's impossible to satisfy all the conditions.

The program's logic aligns with the problem description's requirements:

- Everyone must gift as many coins as others: The program implies that each friend gifts the same number of coins (either `1` or an impossible scenario).
- All coins given to Ivan must be different: The condition `M >= N - K + 1` ensures that there are enough unique coins to be gifted.
- Not less than `L` coins from gifts altogether must be new in Ivan's collection: The condition `M >= L` ensures that the number of friends is sufficient to guarantee at least `L` new coins.

For every potential case, the program correctly determines whether the conditions can be met and outputs the minimum number of coins one friend can gift to satisfy all the conditions or determines that it's impossible. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
