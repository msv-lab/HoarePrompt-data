Postcondition: **`N` is an integer, the total number of different collectible coins, `M` is an integer, the number of friends, `K` is an integer, the number of coins Ivan already has, `L` is an integer, the minimum number of new coins Ivan must receive, `input` is a consumed input string, `min_x` is an integer equal to `(L + M - 1) // M`, and the current value of `M * min_x` is less than or equal to the difference between `N` and `K`, meaning `M` times the minimum number of coins each friend must receive is less than or equal to the number of coins Ivan still needs to collect.**
