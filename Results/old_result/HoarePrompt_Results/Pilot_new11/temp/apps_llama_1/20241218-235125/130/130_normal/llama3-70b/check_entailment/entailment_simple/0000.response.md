Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. 

Here is why it is correct:
- The program first takes four integers as input: `N`, `M`, `K`, and `L`, where `N` represents the total number of different coins, `M` represents the number of friends, `K` represents the number of coins Ivan already has, and `L` represents the minimum number of new coins that must be given to Ivan.
- The program checks two conditions:
  - `M >= N - K + 1`: This ensures that there are enough friends to give Ivan at least `N - K + 1` different coins, which guarantees that Ivan will receive at least `N - K` new coins and possibly the one he already has.
  - `M >= L`: This ensures that the number of friends is at least as large as the minimum number of new coins that must be given to Ivan.
- If both conditions are met, the program prints `1`, indicating that each friend should give Ivan one coin. This strategy ensures that all three terms are satisfied:
  - Everyone gifts as many coins as others (one coin each).
  - All coins given to Ivan are different (since each friend gives at most one coin, and there are at least `N - K + 1` friends, there will be at least `N - K` new coins given to Ivan).
  - Not less than `L` coins from gifts altogether must be new in Ivan's collection (since `M >= L`, there will be at least `L` new coins given to Ivan, assuming `L` is less than or equal to `N - K`).
- If the conditions are not met, the program prints `-1`, indicating that it's impossible to satisfy all three terms.

Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description, as it meets the requirements for finding the minimum number of coins each friend can gift to satisfy all the conditions, or determines that it's impossible to do so.
