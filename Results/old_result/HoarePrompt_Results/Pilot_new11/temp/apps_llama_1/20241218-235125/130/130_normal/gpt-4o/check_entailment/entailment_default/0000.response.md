Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The code provided determines the minimum number of coins one friend can gift to satisfy all the conditions given in the problem description. The conditions are that everyone must gift as many coins as others, all coins given to Ivan must be different, and not less than L coins from gifts altogether must be new in Ivan's collection. 

The code calculates `min_x` as `(L + M - 1) // M`, which ensures that each friend gives at least `min_x` coins, and the total number of new coins given to Ivan is at least L.

The condition `if M * min_x <= N - K` checks whether it's possible to distribute the minimum number of coins `min_x` to M friends such that each friend gives a different coin, and the total number of coins given does not exceed the available new coins (N - K). If this condition is met, the code prints `min_x`; otherwise, it prints -1, indicating that it's impossible to fulfill Ivan's requirement.

The provided output hints agree with the code, and the examples given in the problem description are correctly handled by the code. For instance, in the first example with input (20, 15, 2, 3), the code correctly outputs 1, and in the second example with input (10, 11, 2, 4), it correctly outputs -1.

Given that the input is assumed to be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the code correctly handles all potential cases as described in the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the code is True.
