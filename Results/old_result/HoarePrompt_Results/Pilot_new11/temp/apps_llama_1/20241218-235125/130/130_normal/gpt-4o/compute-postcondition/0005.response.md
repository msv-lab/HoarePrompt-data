Postcondition: **`N` is an integer, the total number of different collectible coins, `M` is an integer, the number of friends, `K` is an integer, the number of coins Ivan already has, `L` is an integer, the minimum number of new coins Ivan must receive, `input` is a consumed input string, and `min_x` is an integer equal to `(L + M - 1) // M`. Additionally, the product of `M` and `min_x` is greater than `N - K`, meaning `M * min_x > N - K`.**
