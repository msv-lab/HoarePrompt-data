To calculate the output state, we first need to understand the impact of the given Python code on the variables.

The code `min_x = (L + M - 1) // M` calculates the minimum number of new coins (`min_x`) Ivan must receive, given the minimum number of new coins he must have (`L`), and the number of friends (`M`).

Here, the expression `(L + M - 1) // M` performs ceiling division, which rounds up to the nearest whole number. This means that `min_x` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `L / M`.

The initial state provides the following information:
- `N` is an integer, the total number of different collectible coins.
- `M` is an integer, the number of friends.
- `K` is an integer, the number of coins Ivan already has.
- `L` is an integer, the minimum number of new coins Ivan must receive.
- `input` is a consumed input string.

After executing the code, the variable `min_x` is introduced and calculated based on `L` and `M`. The other variables (`N`, `M`, `K`, `L`, and `input`) remain unchanged as they are not directly modified by the code.

Thus, the output state includes the original variables with their descriptions, plus the new variable `min_x` which is calculated as `(L + M - 1) // M`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer, the total number of different collectible coins, `M` is an integer, the number of friends, `K` is an integer, the number of coins Ivan already has, `L` is an integer, the minimum number of new coins Ivan must receive, `input` is a consumed input string, and `min_x` is an integer equal to `(L + M - 1) // M`.**
