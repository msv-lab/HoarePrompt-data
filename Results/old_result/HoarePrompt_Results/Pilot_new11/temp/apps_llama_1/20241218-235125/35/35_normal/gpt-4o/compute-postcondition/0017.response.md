Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that `2 <= n <= a + b`, `low` is less than `high`. If `can_distribute(mid)` is true, then `low` is updated to `mid + 1` and `mid` needs to be recalculated based on the new `low`. If `can_distribute(mid)` is false, then `high` is updated to `mid`.**
