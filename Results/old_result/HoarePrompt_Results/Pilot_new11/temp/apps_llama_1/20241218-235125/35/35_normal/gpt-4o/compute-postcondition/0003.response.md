Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of plates, `a` is a positive integer representing the number of pieces of the first cake, `b` is a positive integer representing the number of pieces of the second cake, such that 2 <= `n` <= `a` + `b`. Initially, `low` is 1, `high` is `min(a, b) + 1`, and `mid` is `(min(a, b) + 2) // 2`. The current value of `mid` is such that it is possible to distribute the cakes with this mid value, i.e., `can_distribute(mid)` is True.**
