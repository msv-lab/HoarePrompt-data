According to the code, the loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will continue to execute indefinitely until it encounters a `break` statement. Since there are no conditional statements that could potentially terminate the loop, we don't need to adjust any states for the loop to execute one more time. The state at the end of the previous iteration will be repeated.

State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers with values determined by the user's input, potentially adhering to the constraints 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`; `x` is the minimum value among `n`, `a`, and `b` minus 1**
