The value of `mid` becomes the average of `low` and `high`, rounded down to the nearest integer. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that `2 <= n <= a + b`, `low` is less than `high`, and `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that `2 <= n <= a + b`, `low` is less than `high`, and `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`**
