Functionality: **The function calculates and returns the maximum number of pieces per plate that can be distributed among 'n' plates when there are 'a' pieces of the first cake and 'b' pieces of the second cake available, such that it is one less than the smallest number of pieces per plate at which the distribution becomes consistently possible. The function assumes that 'n' is a positive integer representing the number of plates, and 'a' and 'b' are positive integers representing the number of pieces of each cake, where the total number of pieces ('a + b') is enough to fill at least 'n' plates with at least 2 pieces each. The function relies on the external function 'can_distribute' to determine the possibility of distributing the cakes with a given number of pieces per plate. The return value represents the point just before the distribution becomes feasible with the given number of plates and cakes, taking into account the binary search logic performed within the function.**
