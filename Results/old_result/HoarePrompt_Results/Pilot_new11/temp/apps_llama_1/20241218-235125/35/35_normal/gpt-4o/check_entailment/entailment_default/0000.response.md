Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not correctly solve the problem described. The main issue lies in the function `can_distribute(x)` which is supposed to check if the total number of plates that can be filled with at least `x` pieces from two cakes is greater than or equal to a given non-negative integer `n`. However, the function is missing parameters `a`, `b`, and `n`, and it incorrectly calculates the distribution by performing integer division of `a` and `b` by `x` and summing up the results.

To correctly solve the problem, the function `can_distribute(x)` should take `n`, `a`, and `b` as parameters and check if there exists a distribution of `x` pieces per plate for both cakes. One possible way to achieve this is by iterating over all possible combinations of plates for the first cake, and then checking if the remaining pieces can be distributed among the remaining plates for the second cake.

Another issue is that the binary search logic in the function `func_1(n, a, b)` may not find the correct solution. The function should find the maximum value of `x` such that it is possible to distribute the cakes among `n` plates with at least `x` pieces per plate. However, the function may not correctly handle the case when `a` and `b` are close to `n`, or when `n` is close to `a + b`.

For example, if we have `n = 4`, `a = 7`, and `b = 10`, the function `func_1(n, a, b)` should return `3`, because we can distribute the cakes as follows: two plates with 3 pieces of the first cake and two plates with 5 pieces of the second cake. However, the function may not correctly find this solution due to the issues mentioned above.

To correctly solve the problem, a different approach should be used, such as iterating over all possible values of `x` and checking if it is possible to distribute the cakes among `n` plates with at least `x` pieces per plate. 

Here's an example of correct code:

```python
def can_distribute(n, a, b, x):
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if i * x <= a and (n - i) * x <= b:
            return True
    return False

def func_1(n, a, b):
    low, high = 1, max(a, b) + 1
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if can_distribute(n, a, b, mid):
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
    return low - 1

n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(n, a, b))
```
