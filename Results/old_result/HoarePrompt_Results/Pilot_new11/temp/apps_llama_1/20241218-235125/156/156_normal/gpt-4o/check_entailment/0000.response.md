Correctness: **True**

The program provided seems to be correct based on the problem description. Here's why:

- The program first checks if the number of steps `k` is less than `n-1`, which covers the case where Lara is still moving down the leftmost column. If so, it directly calculates her current position as `(k+1, 1)`.
- If `k` is greater than or equal to `n-1`, it then calculates the number of full rows (or cycles of movement) Lara would have completed, and the remaining steps after those full cycles.
- Depending on whether the number of full rows is even or odd, it calculates Lara's current position accordingly, taking into account the direction of her movement at that point.

After reviewing the code and the problem description, I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The program seems to handle the initial downward movement, the subsequent snake-like pattern correctly, and it also takes into account the even and odd cases for the number of full rows.

The code seems to be logically consistent with the description of Lara's movement through the dungeon. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct for all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
