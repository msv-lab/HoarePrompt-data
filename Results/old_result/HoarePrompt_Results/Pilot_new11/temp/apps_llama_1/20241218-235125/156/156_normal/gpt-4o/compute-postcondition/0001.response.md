The `print` function is used to output the value of `k + 1` and `1`. This does not change the values of the variables `n`, `m`, or `k`. However, since the value of `k` is printed after being incremented by 1, we can say that the printed value of `k` is `k + 1`. 

The values of `n` and `m` are still positive integers greater than or equal to 2, with `n` being even. The value of `k` is still a non-negative integer such that `0 <= k < n*m`, and `k` is still less than `n - 1`. Since `k` is less than `n - 1` and `n` is at least 2, `k + 1` is less than `n`. 

The output of the `print` function is `(k + 1, 1)`, which means the value of `k + 1` is returned at the output. 

Output State: **`n` is an even positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= k < n*m` and `k` is less than `n - 1`, and `k + 1` is returned at the output.**
