Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the remainder of the division of the original `k` by `n * 2 - 2`. If `k` is less than `n - 1`, then `k + 1` and `1` have been printed. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1` and less than `n * 2 - 2`, then `n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1` and `(k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1` have been printed. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n * 2 - 2`, then `1` and `2` have been printed.***
