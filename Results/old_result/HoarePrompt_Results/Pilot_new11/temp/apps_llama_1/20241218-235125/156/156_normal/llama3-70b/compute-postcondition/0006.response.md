To solve this, let's break down the given information and the code's impact step by step.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `m` is an input integer.
   - `k` is the remainder of the division of the original `k` by `n * 2 - 2`, which means `k` is equal to `k % (2*n - 2)`.
   - Initially, `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`.
   - Currently, the value of `k` is less than `n * 2 - 2`, and since `k` is a remainder, its value is between `n - 1` and `n * 2 - 3`.

2. **Code Impact**:
   - The code prints two values: 
     - The first value is `n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1`.
     - The second value is `(k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1`.

Given that `k` is between `n - 1` and `n * 2 - 3`, and it's a remainder of a division by `n * 2 - 2`, we know `k` will always satisfy these conditions due to its definition. Let's examine the printed expressions:

1. **First Printed Value**: `n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1`
   - This expression can be simplified by understanding that `(k - n + 1) % (n - 1)` will give a value between 0 and `n - 2` because `k - n + 1` ranges from 0 to `n * 2 - n - 2` (since `k` ranges from `n - 1` to `n * 2 - 3`), which simplifies to a range of 0 to `n - 2` after subtracting `n - 1`.
   - Subtracting this result from `n` and then subtracting 1 gives a value that effectively cycles through 0 to `n - 2` when `k` varies, due to the modulo operation.

2. **Second Printed Value**: `(k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1`
   - This expression calculates the integer division of `k - n + 1` by `n - 1` and then adds 1.
   - Given `k`'s range, `k - n + 1` will range from 0 to `n - 2`, making the division result range from 0 to 1 (since `n - 2` divided by `n - 1` will be less than 1, and any number less than `n - 1` divided by `n - 1` will be 0).
   - Adding 1 to this result gives a final range of 1 to 2.

Thus, the first value cycles through a specific range based on `n` and `k`, while the second value will either be 1 or 2 based on the same variables.

**Output State**: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is between `n - 1` and `n * 2 - 3`, and two values have been printed: the first is `n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1`, and the second is `(k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1`, where the first value cycles through a range determined by `n` and the second value is either 1 or 2.**
