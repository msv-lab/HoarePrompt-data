The given Python code snippet is a print statement that prints the value of `k + 1` and `1`. This statement does not modify any variables, it only outputs the values.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the remainder of the division of the original `k` by `n * 2 - 2`, which can also be expressed as `k` is equal to `k % (2*n - 2)`, the current value of `k` is less than `n - 1`, and the value `k + 1` and `1` have been printed.**
