Postcondition: ***n and m are positive integers greater than or equal to 2, n is even, and k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < n*m. If k is less than n - 1, then the function returns k + 1. Otherwise, the function calculates full_rows as the integer division of k by m - 1, and remaining_steps as k modulo m - 1. Then, it determines row and col based on whether full_rows is even or odd: if full_rows is even, row is n - full_rows and col is 2 + remaining_steps; if full_rows is odd, row is n - full_rows and col is m - (k % (m - 1)). The values of row and col are returned as output.***
