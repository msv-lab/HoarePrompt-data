Correctness: **True**

The program is correct and follows the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Handling Input**: The program reads input `n`, `m`, and `k` from the user, which matches the problem description.

2. **Movement Pattern**: Lara moves down to the bottom left corner (`n`, 1) and then starts moving in a snake-like pattern. The program calculates the remainder of `k` divided by `n * 2 - 2` to handle this pattern efficiently.

3. **Printing Position**: 
   - If `k` is less than `n - 1`, Lara is moving down the first column. In this case, the program prints `k + 1` as the row and `1` as the column, which is correct according to the problem description.
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1` and less than `n * 2 - 2`, Lara is moving in the snake-like pattern. The program calculates the row and column based on this pattern. The row is calculated as `n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1`, which correctly determines the row based on the number of times Lara has moved up and down. The column is calculated as `(k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1`, which correctly determines the column based on the number of times Lara has moved to the right.
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to `n * 2 - 2`, the program prints `1` and `2` as the row and column, which is correct according to the problem description because Lara ends up in cell (1, 2) after completing the snake-like pattern.

4. **Assuming Valid Input**: As per the problem statement, we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. This means we don't need to handle cases where `n` is not even, `k` is negative, or `k` is greater than or equal to `n * m`.

In summary, the program correctly calculates Lara's position based on the number of times she has moved (`k`) and matches the problem description.
