You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You might have heard about the next game in Lara Croft series coming out this year. You also might have watched its trailer. Though you definitely missed the main idea about its plot, so let me lift the veil of secrecy.

Lara is going to explore yet another dangerous dungeon. Game designers decided to use good old 2D environment. The dungeon can be represented as a rectangle matrix of n rows and m columns. Cell (x, y) is the cell in the x-th row in the y-th column. Lara can move between the neighbouring by side cells in all four directions.

Moreover, she has even chosen the path for herself to avoid all the traps. She enters the dungeon in cell (1, 1), that is top left corner of the matrix. Then she goes down all the way to cell (n, 1) — the bottom left corner. Then she starts moving in the snake fashion — all the way to the right, one cell up, then to the left to the cell in 2-nd column, one cell up. She moves until she runs out of non-visited cells. n and m given are such that she always end up in cell (1, 2).

Lara has already moved to a neighbouring cell k times. Can you determine her current position?


-----Input-----

The only line contains three integers n, m and k (2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9, n is always even, 0 ≤ k < n·m). Note that k doesn't fit into 32-bit integer type!


-----Output-----

Print the cell (the row and the column where the cell is situated) where Lara ends up after she moves k times.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 0

Output
1 1

Input
4 3 11

Output
1 2

Input
4 3 7

Output
3 2



-----Note-----

Here is her path on matrix 4 by 3: [Image]
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers with n being even, k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < n*m.
def func():
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    k %= n * 2 - 2
    if (k < n - 1) :
        print(k + 1, 1)
    else :
        if (k < n * 2 - 2) :
            print(n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1, (k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1)
        else :
            print(1, 2)
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is equal to `k % (2*n - 2)` and is greater than or equal to `n - 1`. If `k` is less than `n * 2 - 2`, then two values have been printed: the first is `n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1`, which cycles through a range determined by `n`, and the second is `(k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1`, which is either 1 or 2. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n * 2 - 2`, then the values 1 and 2 have been printed.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the remainder of the division of the original `k` by `n * 2 - 2`. If `k` is less than `n - 1`, then `k + 1` and `1` have been printed. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1` and less than `n * 2 - 2`, then `n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1` and `(k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1` have been printed. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n * 2 - 2`, then `1` and `2` have been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters, n, m, and k, from user input, where n and m are expected to be positive integers with n being even, and k is a non-negative integer. The function normalizes k to be within the range 0 to 2n - 3 by taking k modulo (2n - 2). It then prints two values based on the normalized value of k. If k is less than n - 1, it prints k + 1 and 1. If k is greater than or equal to n - 1 and less than n * 2 - 2, it prints two computed values that cycle through a range determined by n. If k is greater than or equal to n * 2 - 2, it prints 1 and 2, although this case is technically impossible due to the initial normalization of k. The function does not return any value, as it's designed to print output directly. After execution, the program state reflects the input values of n, m, and the normalized k, with the printed values being the primary outcome. The function does not explicitly validate the input conditions (n being even, k being within the specified range before normalization), but it will operate based on the provided inputs, potentially leading to unexpected behavior if these conditions are not met.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
