The value of `n` is updated to be an input integer. The previous value of `n` and the values of `a` and `b` are not affected, so the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a positive integer (1 ≤ a ≤ 10 000 000) representing the cost of one bottle of Ber-Cola, and `b` is a positive integer (1 ≤ b ≤ 10 000 000) representing the cost of one Bars bar.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a positive integer (1 ≤ a ≤ 10 000 000), `b` is a positive integer (1 ≤ b ≤ 10 000 000)**
