Correctness: **True**

The provided Python code accurately solves the problem described. The function `func_1` takes three inputs: the amount of money `n` and the costs of two items `a` and `b`. It iterates over all possible combinations of buying `x` items of cost `a` and checks if the remaining amount of money can be spent on items of cost `b` by verifying if `(n - x * a)` is divisible by `b`. If such a combination is found, it prints "YES" followed by the values of `x` and `y`, where `y` is calculated as `(n - x * a) // b`. If no such combination is found after checking all possibilities, it prints "NO".

The code correctly handles cases where the amount of money is not enough to buy at least one item, as well as cases where the costs of the items are such that no combination can sum up to the given amount of money. The provided output hints agree with the code, and the examples given in the problem description are correctly handled by the code.

The loop `for x in range(n // a + 1):` ensures that all possible non-negative integer values of `x` are considered, and the condition `if (n - x * a) % b == 0:` checks if the remaining amount can be spent on items of cost `b`. The calculation of `y` as `(n - x * a) // b` is correct, given that `(n - x * a)` is divisible by `b`.

Therefore, the code accurately fulfills the problem's requirements and handles all potential cases correctly.
