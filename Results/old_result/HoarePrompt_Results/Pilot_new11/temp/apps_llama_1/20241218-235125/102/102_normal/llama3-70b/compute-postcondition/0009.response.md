Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-zero input integer, `b` is an input integer. If `x * a + y * b` equals `n`, where `x` is 0 and `y` is `n // b`, then 'YES' has been printed, `0` and `n // b` have been printed, and the program has been terminated. Otherwise, the postcondition is not explicitly defined for other cases.***
