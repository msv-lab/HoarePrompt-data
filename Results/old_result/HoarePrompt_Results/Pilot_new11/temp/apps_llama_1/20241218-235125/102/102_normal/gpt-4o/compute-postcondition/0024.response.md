The function `func_1` seems to be missing parameters based on the provided constraints. However, given the constraints, the function should accept parameters `n`, `a`, and `b`, where `n` is the amount of money, `a` is the cost of one bottle of Ber-Cola, and `b` is the cost of one Bars bar. `n`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers with values between 1 and 10,000,000.

Given the return cases provided (Case_1, Case_2, Case_3), all of them result in the function returning `None`. This indicates that regardless of the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` (as long as they adhere to the given constraints), the function does not return any meaningful value related to the parameters' relationship or any calculated outcome. It simply returns `None`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept parameters representing the amount of money and the costs of two items but returns `None` regardless of the input values.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters representing the amount of money and item costs but returns None.**
