The code `print(x, y)` prints the current values of `x` and `y`, which are `2` and `(n - 2 * a) // b` respectively. The values of the variables do not change, but the values of `x` and `y` are printed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `a` is a non-zero integer, `n` is greater than or equal to `-a`, `x` is 2, `x` is less than or equal to `n // a`, `y` is `(n - 2 * a) // b`, 'YES' has been printed, and the values `2` and `(n - 2 * a) // b` have been printed**
