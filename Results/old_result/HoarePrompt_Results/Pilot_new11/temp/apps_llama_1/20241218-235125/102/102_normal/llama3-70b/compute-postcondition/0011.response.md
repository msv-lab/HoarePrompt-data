To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a non-zero input integer.
   - `b` is an input integer.
   - `x` is 1.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code calculates `y = (n - x * a) // b`.
   - Given `x` is 1, the expression simplifies to `y = (n - a) // b`.

3. **Impact on Variables**:
   - `n`, `a`, `b`, and `x` retain their initial values since they are not reassigned in the code.
   - `y` is assigned a new value based on the calculation involving `n`, `a`, and `b`.

4. **Calculating `y`**:
   - Since `x` is 1, `y` becomes `(n - a) // b`.
   - The value of `y` depends on the input values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
   - Because `a` is non-zero and `b` can be any input integer, we must consider `b` could be zero, which would result in an error (division by zero). However, assuming `b` is not zero for the sake of calculating `y`, `y` will be the integer part of the division of `(n - a)` by `b`.

5. **Output State**:
   - `n` remains an input integer.
   - `a` remains a non-zero input integer.
   - `b` remains an input integer.
   - `x` remains 1.
   - `y` is the integer part of `(n - a)` divided by `b`, or `(n - a) // b`.

Therefore, considering all the given conditions and the changes made by the code:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-zero input integer, `b` is an input integer, `x` is 1, and `y` is `(n - a) // b`.**
