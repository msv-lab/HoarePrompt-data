Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-zero input integer, `b` is an input integer, if `x * a + y * b` equals `n`, then `x` is 1, `y` is `(n - a) // b`, 'YES' has been printed, the values of `x` and `y` have been printed, and the program has been terminated; otherwise, the program continues execution with `n` as an input integer, `a` as a non-zero input integer, `b` as an input integer, `x` as 1, and `y` as `(n - a) // b`.***
