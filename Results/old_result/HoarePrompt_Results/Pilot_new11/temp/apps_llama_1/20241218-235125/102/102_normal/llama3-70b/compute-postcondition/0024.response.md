It seems like the function definition provided is incomplete as it does not include the parameters. However, based on the parameter constraints given, I will describe the functionality assuming the function is defined with parameters n, a, and b.


The function `func` accepts parameters `n`, `a`, and `b`, where `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers. The constraints on these integers are such that 1 <= `n` <= 10,000,000, 1 <= `a` <= 10,000,000, and 1 <= `b` <= 10,000,000. 

Since there's no specific output or return value cases provided for this function, and the original definition does not include parameters, I must infer based on typical mathematical functions involving such constraints that this function could potentially calculate or return a value based on `n`, `a`, and `b`. However, without the exact output or return conditions, I can only state the parameter constraints.


Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, a, and b, which are integers with specific constraints, and its return value depends on the conditions not specified in the problem.**
