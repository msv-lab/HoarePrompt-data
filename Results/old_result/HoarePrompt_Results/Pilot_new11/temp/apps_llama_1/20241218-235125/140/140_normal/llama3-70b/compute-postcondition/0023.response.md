Postcondition: **`node` is a valid vertex in the graph, `graph` is an adjacency list or matrix representing a directed graph where `graph[node]` has at least three neighbors, `visited` is a list or set of integers where `visited[node]` is `True`, and `rec_stack` is a list or set of integers representing the current recursion stack where `rec_stack[node]` is `True`. If the third neighbor of `node` has not been visited and `func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack)` returns True, the program returns a boolean value True. If the third neighbor of `node` has not been visited but `func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack)` does not return True, no additional changes are made to the program state. If the third neighbor of `node` has been visited and it is in the recursion stack `rec_stack`, the program returns True, indicating a cycle detection. Otherwise, if the third neighbor of `node` has been visited but it is not in the recursion stack `rec_stack`, the state of the program remains unchanged.**
