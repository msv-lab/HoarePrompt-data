Postcondition: ***`node` is a valid vertex in the graph, `graph` is an adjacency list or matrix representing a directed graph where `graph[node]` has at least two neighbors, `visited` is a list or set of integers where `visited[node]` is `True`, and `rec_stack` is a list or set of integers representing the current recursion stack where `rec_stack[node]` is `True`. If the second neighbor of `node` in `graph[node]` has not been visited and `func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack)` returns True, the program returns True. If the second neighbor of `node` in `graph[node]` has been visited and is in the recursion stack, the program returns True. Otherwise, no specific action is taken or return value is specified, with the program continuing in an undefined state regarding return values, but with the given conditions on `node`, `graph`, `visited`, and `rec_stack` still holding.***
