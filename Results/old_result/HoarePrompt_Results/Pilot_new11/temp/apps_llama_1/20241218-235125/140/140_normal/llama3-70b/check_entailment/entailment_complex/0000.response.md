Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem description asks to determine if it is possible to make the directed graph acyclic by removing at most one edge. The given program checks if the graph is acyclic, but it does not check if removing at most one edge can make the graph acyclic.

In the given program, it checks for the presence of a cycle in the graph by calling the function `func_1` for each unvisited node. If a cycle is detected, it immediately returns 'NO'. However, this approach does not consider the possibility of removing an edge to break the cycle.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should check all possible edges that can be removed and then check if the resulting graph is acyclic. If the graph becomes acyclic after removing at most one edge, the program should return 'YES'. Otherwise, it should return 'NO'.

The given program only checks if the graph is acyclic in its current state, without considering the possibility of removing edges to break cycles. Therefore, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect. 

Here is an example of where the program fails to meet the problem description:
Input:
3 4
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1

The given program will return 'NO' because the graph contains a cycle. However, the correct answer is 'YES' because removing the edge 2 -> 3 can make the graph acyclic. 

To fix this, the program needs to be modified to check all possible edges that can be removed and then check if the resulting graph is acyclic.
