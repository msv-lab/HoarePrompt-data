Postcondition: ***`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph, `n` is a non-negative integer, `in_degree` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex in the graph including `node` and each value is the updated in-degree of that vertex, `count` is any number, and `node` has at least one more neighbor in `graph[node]`. If `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0, then `neighbor` is included as the rightmost node in `queue`; otherwise, `queue` contains either the same number of nodes as before or one less node than before.***
