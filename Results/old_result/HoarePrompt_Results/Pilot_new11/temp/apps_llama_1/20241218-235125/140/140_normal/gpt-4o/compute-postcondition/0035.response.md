Postcondition: ***`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph, `n` is a non-negative integer, `in_degree` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex in the graph including `node` and each value is the updated in-degree of that vertex, `queue` is not empty and contains either the same number of nodes as before with `neighbor` as the rightmost node if `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0, or one less node than before, `count` is any number, and `node` is the leftmost node that was in `queue`***
