Postcondition: **`node` is a valid vertex in the graph, `graph` is an adjacency list or matrix representing a directed graph where `graph[node]` has at least two neighbors, `visited` is a list or set of integers where `visited[node]` is `True`, `rec_stack` is a list or set of integers representing the current recursion stack where `rec_stack[node]` is `True`, and `neighbor` is the second neighbor of `node` in `graph[node]`. If `func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack)` returns True, the program returns True, otherwise, the program continues without a specified return value.**
