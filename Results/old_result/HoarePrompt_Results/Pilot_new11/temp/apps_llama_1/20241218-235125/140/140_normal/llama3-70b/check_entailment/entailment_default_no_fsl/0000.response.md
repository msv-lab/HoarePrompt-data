Correctness: **False**

The program is supposed to check if a directed graph can be made acyclic by removing at most one edge. However, the current implementation only checks if the graph is acyclic or not, but it does not consider the case where removing one edge can make the graph acyclic.

The code checks for cycles in the graph using a recursive function, but it does not attempt to remove any edges to break potential cycles. As a result, the program may return 'NO' even if the graph can be made acyclic by removing one edge.

For example, in the input:
```
3 4
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1
```
The program correctly outputs 'YES' because removing the edge 2 -> 3 makes the graph acyclic. However, the program does not actually check if removing one edge can make the graph acyclic; it simply checks if the graph is already acyclic. If the graph were different, and there was a case where removing one edge would make it acyclic, the program would not be able to detect this.

To fix this, the program would need to be modified to check all possible edge removals and see if any of them result in an acyclic graph. This would require significantly more complex code, involving nested loops and recursive function calls. The current implementation does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
