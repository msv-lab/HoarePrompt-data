You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given a directed graph consisting of n vertices and m edges (each edge is directed, so it can be traversed in only one direction). You are allowed to remove at most one edge from it.

Can you make this graph acyclic by removing at most one edge from it? A directed graph is called acyclic iff it doesn't contain any cycle (a non-empty path that starts and ends in the same vertex).


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 500, 1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)) — the number of vertices and the number of edges, respectively.

Then m lines follow. Each line contains two integers u and v denoting a directed edge going from vertex u to vertex v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v). Each ordered pair (u, v) is listed at most once (there is at most one directed edge from u to v).


-----Output-----

If it is possible to make this graph acyclic by removing at most one edge, print YES. Otherwise, print NO.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1

Output
YES

Input
5 6
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1
2 1
4 5

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example you can remove edge $2 \rightarrow 3$, and the graph becomes acyclic.

In the second example you have to remove at least two edges (for example, $2 \rightarrow 1$ and $2 \rightarrow 3$) in order to make the graph acyclic.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
m = int(data[1])
edges = [(int(data[i]), int(data[i + 1])) for i in range(2, len(data), 2)]
result = func_1(n, m, edges)
print(result)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, m is a positive integer representing the number of edges, and edges is a list of pairs of integers where each pair (u, v) represents a directed edge from vertex u to vertex v, such that 1 <= u, v <= n and u!= v.
def func_1(n, m, edges):
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        graph[u].append(v)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `edges` is a list of pairs of integers representing directed edges, `graph` is a defaultdict of lists where each key `u` has a list of all vertices `v` such that `(u, v)` is in `edges`, and if `edges` is empty, `graph` is a defaultdict of lists with each key `u` having an empty list as its value.
    if (not has_cycle(graph)) :
        return 'YES'
        #The program returns the string 'YES'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `edges` is a list of pairs of integers representing directed edges, `graph` is a defaultdict of lists where each key `u` has a list of all vertices `v` such that `(u, v)` is in `edges`, and if `edges` is empty, `graph` is a defaultdict of lists with each key `u` having an empty list as its value. The graph has a cycle.
    for (u, v) in edges:
        graph[u].remove(v)
        
        if not has_cycle(graph):
            return 'YES'
        
        graph[u].append(v)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `edges` is a list of pairs of integers, and `graph` is a defaultdict of lists representing the graph, with `graph` being either in its original state if no edge removal resulted in a cycle-free graph or modified if an edge removal resulted in a return of 'YES'.
    return 'NO'
    #The program returns 'NO'

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: graph is a dictionary representing a directed graph where each key is a vertex (an integer between 1 and n) and each value is a list of vertices that the key vertex has a directed edge to, n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the graph.
def has_cycle(graph):
    in_degree = {i: (0) for i in range(1, n + 1)}
    for u in graph:
        for v in graph[u]:
            in_degree[v] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph with `n` vertices, `n` is a non-negative integer representing the original number of vertices in the graph, and `in_degree` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex in the graph and each value is the actual in-degree of that vertex, which is the total number of edges coming into that vertex from all other vertices in the graph.
    queue = deque([node for node in in_degree if in_degree[node] == 0])
    count = 0
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        
        count += 1
        
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            in_degree[neighbor] -= 1
            if in_degree[neighbor] == 0:
                queue.append(neighbor)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `graph` remains unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `in_degree` reflects the updated in-degrees after processing, `queue` is empty, and `count` equals the number of nodes reachable from the initial set of nodes with an in-degree of 0 in the graph. If the graph is connected and all nodes are reachable from nodes with an initial in-degree of 0, then `count` equals `n`.
    return count != n
    #The program returns True if the graph contains nodes that are not reachable from the initial set of nodes with an in-degree of 0; otherwise, it returns False.


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
