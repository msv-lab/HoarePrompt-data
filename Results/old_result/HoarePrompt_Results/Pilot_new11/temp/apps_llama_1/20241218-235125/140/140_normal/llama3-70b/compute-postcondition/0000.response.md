The code `visited[node] = True` sets the value of the `node` index in the `visited` list to `True`. This means that the vertex represented by `node` is now marked as visited.

The values of `graph`, `rec_stack`, and `node` itself are not affected by this operation. The state of `visited` is updated only at the index corresponding to `node`.

Output State: **`node` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is an adjacency list or matrix representing a directed graph with n vertices, `visited` is a list or set of integers where `visited[node]` is `True` and other values may be `True` or `False` depending on previous operations, and `rec_stack` is a list or set of integers representing the current recursion stack.**
