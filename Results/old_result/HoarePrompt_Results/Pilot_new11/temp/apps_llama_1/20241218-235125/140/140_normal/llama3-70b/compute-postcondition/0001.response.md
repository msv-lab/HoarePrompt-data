The code sets `rec_stack[node]` to `True`, indicating that the current node is added to the recursion stack. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `node` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is an adjacency list or matrix representing a directed graph with n vertices, `visited` is a list or set of integers where `visited[node]` is `True` and other values may be `True` or `False` depending on previous operations, and `rec_stack` is a list or set of integers representing the current recursion stack where `rec_stack[node]` is `True`.
