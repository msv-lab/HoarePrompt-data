The function `has_cycle` accepts two parameters: `graph` and implicitly `n`. `graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph where each key is a vertex (an integer between 1 and n) and each value is a list of vertices that the key vertex has a directed edge to, and `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the graph. After executing the function body, the function returns `True` if the graph contains nodes that are not reachable from the initial set of nodes with an in-degree of 0; otherwise, it returns `False`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters representing a directed graph and returns `True` if the graph contains nodes that are not reachable from the initial set of nodes with an in-degree of 0, otherwise returns `False`.**
