The code `node = queue.popleft()` removes the leftmost element from the queue and assigns it to the variable `node`. 

The value of `queue` is updated since one node is removed from it, and the value of `node` is now the leftmost node that was in `queue`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph with `n` vertices, `n` is a non-negative integer representing the original number of vertices in the graph, `in_degree` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex in the graph and each value is the actual in-degree of that vertex, `queue` contains one less node than before and is not empty, `count` is 0, and `node` is the leftmost node that was in `queue`.**
