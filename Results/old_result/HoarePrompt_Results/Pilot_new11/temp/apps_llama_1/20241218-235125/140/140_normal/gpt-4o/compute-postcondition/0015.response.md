The code `in_degree[v] += 1` increments the value of `in_degree[v]` by 1. Given the initial state, `graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph with at least one vertex `u` that has at least three adjacent vertices, `n` is at least 2, `in_degree` has values updated to reflect the in-degrees of vertices directly reachable from `u`, `u` is a vertex in `graph` with at least three adjacent vertices, and `v` is the third adjacent vertex of `u`. The states of `graph`, `n`, `u`, and the fact that `v` is the third adjacent vertex of `u` are not affected. However, the in-degree of vertex `v` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph with at least one vertex `u` that has at least three adjacent vertices, `n` is at least 2, `u` is a vertex in `graph` with at least three adjacent vertices, `v` is the third adjacent vertex of `u`, and `in_degree` has values updated to reflect the in-degrees of vertices directly reachable from `u`, with `in_degree[v]` increased by 1**
