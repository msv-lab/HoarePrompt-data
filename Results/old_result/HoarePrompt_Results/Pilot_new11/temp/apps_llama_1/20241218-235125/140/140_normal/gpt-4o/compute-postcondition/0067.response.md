Postcondition: **`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph with `n` vertices where `n` is a non-negative integer, `in_degree` reflects the updated in-degrees of all vertices after processing with `in_degree[neighbor]` decreased by 1, `queue` is one node shorter and does not contain the last node that was processed, `node` is the node that was just removed from the `queue` and has at least one neighbor in `graph`, and `count` is `count + 1`. The current value of `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0, meaning the neighbor has no more incoming edges.**
