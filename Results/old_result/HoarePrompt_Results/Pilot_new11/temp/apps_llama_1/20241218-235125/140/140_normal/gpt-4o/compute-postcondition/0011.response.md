The value of `in_degree[v]` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph with at least one vertex `u` that has at least one adjacent vertex, `n` is at least 2, `in_degree` has values updated to reflect the in-degrees of vertices directly reachable from `u` with `in_degree[v]` increased by 1, `u` is a vertex in `graph` with at least one adjacent vertex, and `v` is the first adjacent vertex of `u`.
Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph with at least one vertex `u` that has at least one adjacent vertex, `n` is at least 2, `in_degree` has values updated to reflect the in-degrees of vertices directly reachable from `u` with `in_degree[v]` equal to its previous value plus 1, `u` is a vertex in `graph` with at least one adjacent vertex, and `v` is the first adjacent vertex of `u`.**
