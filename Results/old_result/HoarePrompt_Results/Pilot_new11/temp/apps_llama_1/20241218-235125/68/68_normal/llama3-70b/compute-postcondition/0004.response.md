Postcondition: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers (0 <= x, y, z <= 100) representing the number of persons who would upvote, downvote, or vote with unknown outcome, where their values are determined by the input to the program. The current value of `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`, and the current value of `x` is less than `y`.**
