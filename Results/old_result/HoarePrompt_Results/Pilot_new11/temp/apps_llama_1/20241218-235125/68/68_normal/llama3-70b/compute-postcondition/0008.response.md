Postcondition: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers (0 <= x, y, z <= 100) representing the number of persons who would upvote, downvote, or vote with unknown outcome. The current value of `x` is equal to the current value of `y`, and `x` (which equals `y`) is greater than or equal to `y` (which is the same as `x`), `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`. Additionally, the current value of `z` is 0, meaning there are no votes with unknown outcome.**
