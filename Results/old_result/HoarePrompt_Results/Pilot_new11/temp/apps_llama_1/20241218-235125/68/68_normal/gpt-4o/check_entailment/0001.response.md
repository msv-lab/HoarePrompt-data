Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly determines the result of Nauuo's comment based on the number of upvotes, downvotes, and unknown votes. It calculates the minimum and maximum possible upvotes and downvotes by considering the unknown votes as either all upvotes or all downvotes. 

The program then checks if the maximum possible upvotes are less than the minimum possible downvotes, in which case it prints '-'. If the maximum possible downvotes are less than the minimum possible upvotes, it prints '+'. In all other cases, the program prints '?' to indicate that the result is uncertain.

This logic covers all possible scenarios and edge cases as described in the problem statement. For example, if there are no unknown votes (z = 0), the program will print the definitive result based on the number of upvotes and downvotes. If there are unknown votes, the program will print '?' if the result could be different depending on how the unknown votes are cast.

The provided examples in the problem statement also demonstrate the correctness of the program. The program handles these examples correctly and produces the expected output. After analyzing the program and the problem description, I could not find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
