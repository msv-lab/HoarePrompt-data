The given Python code snippet is a simple print statement that prints a hyphen (-) to the console. This statement does not modify the values of any variables. 

Given the initial state, `x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers (0 <= x, y, z <= 100), the value of `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`, and the value of `x` is less than `y`. These conditions remain unchanged after executing the print statement.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers (0 <= x, y, z <= 100), `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`, `x` is less than `y`, and a hyphen (-) has been printed to the console.**
