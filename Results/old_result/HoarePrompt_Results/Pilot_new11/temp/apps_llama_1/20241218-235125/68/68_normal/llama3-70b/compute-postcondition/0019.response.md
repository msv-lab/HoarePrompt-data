Functionality: **The function reads three non-negative integers x, y, z, representing upvotes, downvotes, and unknown outcome votes, and prints an outcome based on these inputs. The outcome is '+' if x is greater than y + z, '-' if x is less than y, '0' if x equals y and z is 0, and '?' in all other cases where x is less than or equal to y + z and either x equals y with z greater than 0 or x is greater than y. After execution, the state of the program will have printed one of these four outcomes to the console, with x, y, and z remaining as input non-negative integers. The function does not modify the input values or return any value, only printing the determined outcome to the console.**
