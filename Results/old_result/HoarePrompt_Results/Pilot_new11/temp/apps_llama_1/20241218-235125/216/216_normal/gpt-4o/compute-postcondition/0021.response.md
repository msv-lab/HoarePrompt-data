The code `current_set.clear()` clears the elements of `current_set`. However, since `current_set` is not mentioned in the initial state, we can assume it was previously defined but its initial state is unknown.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer
- `s` is an input string with at least 2 characters
- `char` is the second character in the string `s`
- `max_count` is the maximum of its previous value and `current_count`

The operation `current_set.clear()` does not affect the values of `n`, `s`, `char`, or `max_count`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string with at least 2 characters, `char` is the second character in the string `s`, `max_count` is the maximum of its previous value and `current_count`, and `current_set` is an empty set**
