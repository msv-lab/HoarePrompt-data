The code updates the value of `max_count` to be the maximum of its current value and `current_count`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Given that `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string with at least 3 characters, `char` is the third character in the string, `current_set` remains unchanged, `current_count` remains unchanged, the new `max_count` will be equal to the maximum of the old `max_count` and `current_count`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string with at least 3 characters, `char` is the third character in the string, `current_set` remains unchanged, `current_count` remains unchanged, `max_count` is the maximum of the old `max_count` and `current_count`**
