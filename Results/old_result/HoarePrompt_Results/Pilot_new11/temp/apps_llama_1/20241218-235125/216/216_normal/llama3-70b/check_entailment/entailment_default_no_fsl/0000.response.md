Correctness: **False**

The code does not do what the problem description says for every potential case. The problem asks for the maximum number of elements in a pretty set of positions, which means the set of positions should contain distinct lowercase letters and there should be no uppercase letters between these positions. However, the provided code simply counts the total number of lowercase letters in the string, which does not consider the conditions for a "pretty set".

For example, in the first example provided in the problem description, the desired output is 2 because the positions 6 and 8 (or 7 and 8) contain distinct lowercase letters and there are no uppercase letters between them. However, the provided code would output 7, which is the total number of lowercase letters in the string, not the maximum number of elements in a pretty set.

Another issue with the code is that it does not consider the case when there are duplicate lowercase letters. The problem requires that the letters on positions from A should be all distinct, but the code does not check for this condition.

To correctly solve this problem, the code should iterate through the string, find all sets of positions that meet the conditions for a "pretty set", and return the maximum size of these sets. The provided code does not implement this logic, so it is incorrect.
