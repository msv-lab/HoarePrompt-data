Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` checks all possible combinations of buying houses, cars, and computers with the given initial amount of game-coins `n`. If it finds a combination where the total cost of houses and cars leaves a remainder that is exactly divisible by the cost of a computer, it returns 'YES'. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the program is correct:

1. The program iterates over all possible numbers of houses that can be bought with `n` game-coins, using the loop `for a in range(n // house_cost + 1)`.
2. For each possible number of houses, it calculates the remaining amount of game-coins after buying those houses, using `remaining_after_houses = n - a * house_cost`.
3. Then, it iterates over all possible numbers of cars that can be bought with the remaining game-coins, using the loop `for b in range(remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1)`.
4. For each possible number of cars, it calculates the remaining amount of game-coins after buying those cars, using `remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`.
5. Finally, it checks if the remaining amount of game-coins is divisible by the cost of a computer, using `if remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0`.
6. If it finds a combination where the remaining amount is divisible by the cost of a computer, it returns 'YES'.
7. If it exhausts all possible combinations without finding a suitable one, it returns 'NO'.

The program correctly checks all possible combinations of buying houses, cars, and computers, and returns 'YES' if it finds a valid combination and 'NO' otherwise. Therefore, it meets the requirements specified in the problem description, and its correctness is **True**.
