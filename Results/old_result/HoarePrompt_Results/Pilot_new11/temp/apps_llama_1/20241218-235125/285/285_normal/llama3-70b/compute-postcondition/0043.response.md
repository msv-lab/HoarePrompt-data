Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to `2 * 1234567`, `a` is 2, `b` is 0, `c` is `k // 1234` where `k = n - 2 * 1234567` and `c` is greater than or equal to 0. If `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234 == n`, then the string 'YES' has been printed to the console and the program has terminated. Otherwise, the program continues execution.***
