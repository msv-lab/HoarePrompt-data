The `exit()` function is used to terminate the program. When `exit()` is called, the program stops execution immediately. 

The values of the variables `n`, `c`, `a`, `b` do not change but the program terminates. 'YES' has been printed to the console before the program terminated. 

The expression `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234` still equals `n`. `n // 1234567 + 1` is at least 1 and `n // 123456 + 1` is at least 1. 

The current value of `c` is still `n // 1234`. `a` is still 0 and `b` is still 0. 

The program has been terminated.

Output State: **The program has been terminated, `n` is an input integer, `n // 1234567 + 1` is at least 1, `n // 123456 + 1` is at least 1, `c` is `n // 1234`, `a` is 0, `b` is 0, and the expression `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234` equals `n`, 'YES' has been printed to the console**
