The value of `remaining_after_cars` is updated to `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`. Given that `b` is 1 and `car_cost` is 123456, `remaining_after_cars` becomes `remaining_after_houses - 123456`. Since `remaining_after_houses` is `n - 1234567`, the new value of `remaining_after_cars` is `(n - 1234567) - 123456`, which simplifies to `n - 1234567 - 123456`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer and is greater than or equal to `house_cost`, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is 1, `b` is 1, `remaining_after_houses` is `n - 1234567` and is greater than or equal to `car_cost`, `remaining_after_cars` is `n - 1234567 - 123456` and `remaining_after_cars` modulo `computer_cost` is not equal to 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and is greater than or equal to `house_cost`, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is 1, `b` is 1, `remaining_after_houses` is `n - 1234567` and is greater than or equal to `car_cost`, `remaining_after_cars` is `n - 1234567 - 123456` and `remaining_after_cars` modulo `computer_cost` is not equal to 0**
