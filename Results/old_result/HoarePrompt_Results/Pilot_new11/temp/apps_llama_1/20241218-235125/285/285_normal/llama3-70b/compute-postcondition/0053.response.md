Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to `2 * 1234567`, `a` is 2, `b` is 2, `c` is `(n - 2715046) // 1234`. If `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234` equals `n`, then 'YES' has been printed and the program has been terminated using `exit()`. Otherwise, the program continues execution without any changes to `n`, `a`, `b`, or `c`.***
