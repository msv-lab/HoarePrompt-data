Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer and is greater than or equal to `house_cost`, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is 1, `b` is 0, `remaining_after_houses` is `n - 1234567` and is greater than or equal to 0, `remaining_after_cars` is `n - 1234567`. The current value of `remaining_after_cars` is a multiple of `computer_cost`, meaning `remaining_after_cars` is divisible by `computer_cost` with no remainder, since `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0`.**
