To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the loop code and the given output states for the first few iterations.

The loop code is:
```python
for b in range((n - a * 1234567) // 123456 + 1):
    c = (n - a * 1234567 - b * 123456) // 1234
    if a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234 == n:
        print('YES')
        exit()
```
From the given output states, we can see that:

* `n` remains the same throughout the execution of the loop.
* `a` is 0 throughout the execution of the loop.
* `b` takes on values from 0 to `(n - a * 1234567) // 123456`.
* `c` is calculated based on `n`, `a`, and `b`.
* If `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234` equals `n`, the program prints 'YES' and exits.

Now, let's analyze the loop code:

* The loop iterates over the range `range((n - a * 1234567) // 123456 + 1)`.
* In each iteration, `c` is calculated based on `n`, `a`, and `b`.
* The `if` statement checks if `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234` equals `n`. If it does, the program prints 'YES' and exits.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, we can conclude that:

* `n` remains the same as its original value.
* `a` remains 0.
* `b` will have taken on all values from 0 to `(n - a * 1234567) // 123456`.
* `c` will have been calculated for each value of `b`.
* If `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234` equals `n` for any value of `b`, the program will have printed 'YES' and exited.

However, if the loop completes without finding a match, the final values of `b` and `c` will be the last values calculated in the loop.

So, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished can be described as:
Output State: **`n` is the original input integer, `a` is 0, the loop has checked all possible combinations of `b` and `c` such that `b` is in the range `range((n - a * 1234567) // 123456 + 1)` and `c` is `(n - a * 1234567 - b * 123456) // 1234`, if a combination is found where `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234` equals `n`, then 'YES' has been printed to the console, otherwise the program has continued with its current state.**
