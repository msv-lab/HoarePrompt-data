To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given for loop statement and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

Given loop:
```python
for a in range(n // house_cost + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

State at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer and is greater than or equal to `house_cost`.
- `house_cost` is 1234567.
- `car_cost` is 123456.
- `computer_cost` is 1234.
- `a` is 0.
- `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n`.
- `b` is `remaining_after_houses // car_cost` unless the loop returned 'YES' due to `remaining_after_cars` being a multiple of `computer_cost` at some iteration, in which case the loop terminated early.

Analysis:
- The loop iterates over a range that depends on `n` and `house_cost`. The range is from 0 to `n // house_cost` (inclusive), because the upper limit in the `range()` function is exclusive, but the `+ 1` makes it inclusive of `n // house_cost`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `a` is 0. To execute the loop one more time, `a` needs to be incremented by 1, so `a` becomes 1.
- The state of `n`, `house_cost`, `car_cost`, and `computer_cost` does not change because they are not modified within the loop's scope as described.
- `remaining_after_houses` and `b` depend on the loop body which is omitted, but we know that for the loop to proceed, `a` must be within the defined range. Thus, we focus on the condition that allows the loop to continue, which is `a` being less than `n // house_cost + 1`.
- Since `a` starts at 0 and increments by 1 at the end of each iteration, for the loop to execute again, `a` must still be within the defined range, meaning `n // house_cost + 1` must be greater than the current `a`.

Adjusting the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- `a` needs to be incremented by 1, so it becomes 1.
- The condition for `n` relative to `house_cost` must still hold, but since `n` is not changing, this condition remains as is.
- The loop will continue as long as `a` is less than `n // house_cost + 1`, implying that `n // house_cost + 1` must be at least 2 for `a` to reach 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer and is greater than or equal to `house_cost`, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is 1, `remaining_after_houses`'s condition may change based on the loop body but is dependent on `a` and `n`, and `b`'s value depends on `remaining_after_houses` which in turn depends on the loop's progress**
