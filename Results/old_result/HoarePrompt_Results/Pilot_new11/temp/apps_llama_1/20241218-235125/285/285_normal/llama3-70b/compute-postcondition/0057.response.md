The function `func` does not seem to accept any parameters, as the provided function definition is `def func():`. 

However, it is stated that there is a parameter constraint for `n`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), representing Kolya's initial game-coin score. 

Since the function definition does not match the parameter constraint, I will proceed with the information given about the parameter constraint.

The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), representing Kolya's initial game-coin score. 

However, since there is no information about the return value, I will leave that part out.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, which is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), but the return value is not specified.**
