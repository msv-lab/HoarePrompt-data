Correctness: **True**.

The code provided seems to be correct and follows the problem description. The function `func_1` checks all possible combinations of buying houses, cars, and computers with the given initial amount of money `n`, and returns 'YES' if it finds a combination that leaves no remaining balance, and 'NO' otherwise.

The function uses a nested loop structure to iterate over all possible combinations of buying houses and cars, and then checks if the remaining amount can be exactly divided by the cost of a computer. If it finds such a combination, it immediately returns 'YES'. If it exhausts all possible combinations without finding a suitable one, it returns 'NO'.

The code handles all positive integer inputs within the specified range (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and correctly determines whether it is possible to buy a combination of houses, cars, and computers with the given amount of money.

The provided examples in the problem description also seem to be correctly handled by the code. For instance, when the input is 1359257, the function returns 'YES' because one possible solution is to buy one house, one car, and one computer, which costs 1234567 + 123456 + 1234 = 1359257.

Overall, the code seems to be correct and works as expected for all potential cases.
