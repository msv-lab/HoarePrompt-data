Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `n // 1234567 + 1` is at least 1 and `n // 123456 + 1` is at least 1. The current value of `c` is `n // 1234`. `a` is 0 and `b` is 0. The expression `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234` equals `n`, meaning that the linear combination of `a`, `b`, and `c` with the given coefficients equals the input integer `n`.**
