According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`s` is the input string of length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer greater than 2 where 2 < `n` â‰¤ 500000, `i` is 2**
