Postcondition: **`s` is the input string of length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is the integer equal to the length of `s` where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 500000, `i` is -1, `f` is `True` if a ']' character is found in `s`, otherwise `f` is `False`, the current value of `bind` is either -1 or the index of the ':' character if a ']' character is found before it, and the current value of `ind` is either -1 or the index of the first ':' after a '[' in `s`. The current state of `ind` and `bind` is such that either `ind` is -1, indicating no ':' was found after a '[' in `s`, or `bind` is -1, indicating either no ']' was found in `s` or no ':' was found after it; this implies that at least one of the conditions for `ind` or `bind` to be set to an index was not met.**
