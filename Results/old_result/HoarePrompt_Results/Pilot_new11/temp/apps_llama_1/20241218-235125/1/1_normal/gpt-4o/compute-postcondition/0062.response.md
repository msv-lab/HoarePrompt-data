The `break` statement does not modify any variables, it only exits the most internal loop or conditional statement. Therefore, the values of all variables remain unchanged. The Output State is: `s` is a string of length between 1 and 500000 consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], : and |, with at least one '[' and one ']', `n` is an integer between 1 and 500000, equal to `len(s)`, `ind` is the index of the first '[' in `s` and is not -1, `bind` is the index of the last ']' in `s` and is not -1, `ind` is less than `bind - 3`, `i` is `bind - 3`, `end_colon` is `bind - 3`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
