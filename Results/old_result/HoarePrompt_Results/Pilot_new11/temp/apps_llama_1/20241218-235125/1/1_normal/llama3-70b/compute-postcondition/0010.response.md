The value of `ind` is updated to be equal to `i`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Since `i` is 0, `ind` becomes 0. 

Output State: **`s` is the input string of length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s` where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 500000, `ind` is 0, the current value of `f` is True, `i` is 0, the character at index `i` of string `s` is ':'**
