Postcondition: ***`s` is the input string of length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is the integer equal to the length of `s`, `i` is either -1 or `bind - 1` if `ind` is less than `bind`, `f` is `True` if a ']' character is found in `s`, otherwise `f` is `False`, `bind` is either -1 or the index of the ':' character if a ']' character is found before it, `ind` is either -1 or the index of the first ':' after a '[' in `s`. If `ind` is -1 or `bind` is -1, the function returns -1. Otherwise, if `ind` is greater than or equal to `bind`, the function returns -1. If `ind` is less than `bind`, `i` is `bind - 1` and the function returns `ans` which is 4 plus the number of '|' characters in `s` between indices `ind + 1` and `bind - 1`.***
