The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables. It only exits the most internal loop or if statement we are directly inside. The states of `s`, `n`, `ind`, `i`, and `bind` are not affected. 
Output State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 500000 consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], : and |, `n` is an integer between 1 and 500000, equal to `len(s)`, `ind` is either -1 if no '[' is found in `s` or the index of the first '[' in `s` otherwise, `i` is `n - 2`, `bind` is `n - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
