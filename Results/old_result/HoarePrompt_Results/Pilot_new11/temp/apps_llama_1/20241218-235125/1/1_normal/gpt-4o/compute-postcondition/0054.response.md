The `break` statement exits the innermost loop or if statement that we are currently inside. It does not affect the values of the variables. 

Output State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 500000 consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], : and |, with at least one '[' and one ']', `n` is an integer between 1 and 500000, equal to `len(s)`, `ind` is the index of the first '[' in `s` and is not -1, `bind` is the index of the last ']' in `s` and is not -1, `ind` is less than `bind - 1`, `start_colon` is the index of the first ':' character between the first '[' and the last ']' if it exists, otherwise -1, `i` is equal to `bind - 1`, `end_colon` is equal to `bind - 1`, the current value of `s[bind - 1]` is ':', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
