Postcondition: **`s` is the input string of length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is the integer equal to the length of `s` where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 500000, `f` is `True`, `ind` and `bind` are the indices of the ':' characters and are not equal to -1. If `ind` is greater than or equal to `bind`, then the value -1 has been printed. Otherwise, `i` is `bind - 1` and the function returns `ans` which is 4 plus the number of '|' characters in `s` between indices `ind + 1` and `bind - 1`.**
