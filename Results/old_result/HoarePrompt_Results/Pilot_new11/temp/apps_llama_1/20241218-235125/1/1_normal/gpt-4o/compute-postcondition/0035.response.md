The value of `start_colon` is assigned to -1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of length between 1 and 500000 consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], : and |, `n` is an integer between 1 and 500000, equal to `len(s)`, `ind` is the index of the first '[' in `s`, `i` is `0`, `bind` is the index of the last ']' in `s`, `ind` is not -1, `bind` is not -1, `ind` is less than `bind`, and `start_colon` is -1.
