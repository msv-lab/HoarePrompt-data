According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 2`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be decremented by 1, so `i` becomes `n - 3`. The loop will execute again if `n - 3` is greater than or equal to 0, which means `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`s` is the input string of length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is the integer equal to the length of `s` where 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 500000, `i` is equal to `n - 3**
