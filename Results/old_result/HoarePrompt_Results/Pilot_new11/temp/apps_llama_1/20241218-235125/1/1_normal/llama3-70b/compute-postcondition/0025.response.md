The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is the input string of length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer greater than 2 where 2 < `n` ≤ 500000, `i` is 2, `ind` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
