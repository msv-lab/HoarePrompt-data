Postcondition: **`s` is the input string of length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is the integer equal to the length of `s` where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 500000, `i` is -1, `f` is `True` if a ']' character is found in `s`, otherwise `f` is `False`, `bind` is the index of the ':' character if a ']' character is found before it, otherwise `bind` is -1, and `ind` is the index of the first ':' after a '[' in `s`, or -1 if no such ':' is found. Additionally, both `ind` and `bind` are not equal to -1, meaning that a '[' followed by a ':' and a ']' before a ':' have been found in `s`. Furthermore, `ind` is less than `bind`.**
