Postcondition: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 500000 consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], : and |, with at least one '[' and one ']', `n` is an integer between 1 and 500000, equal to `len(s)`, `ind` is the index of the first '[' in `s` and is not -1, `bind` is the index of the last ']' in `s` and is not -1, `ind` is less than `bind - 3`, `i` is `bind - 3`, if `s[i]` is ':', then `end_colon` is `bind - 3` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise no changes are made**
