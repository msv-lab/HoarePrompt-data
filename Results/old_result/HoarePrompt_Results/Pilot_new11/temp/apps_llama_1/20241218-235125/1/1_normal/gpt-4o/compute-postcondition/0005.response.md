The code `ind = i` assigns the value of `i` to `ind`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0 and the value of `s` at index `i` is '[', which means `ind` will be assigned the value 0. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of length between 1 and 500000 consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], : and |, `n` is an integer between 1 and 500000, equal to `len(s)`, `n` is greater than 0, `ind` is 0, and `i` is 0.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 500000 consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], : and |, `n` is an integer between 1 and 500000, equal to `len(s)`, `n` is greater than 0, `ind` is 0, and `i` is 0**
