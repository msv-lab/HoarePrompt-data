The `break` statement is used to terminate the loop or conditional statement it is directly inside of. In this case, no variables are modified by the `break` statement. Therefore, the values of `s`, `n`, `ind`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 500000 consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], : and |, `n` is an integer between 1 and 500000, equal to `len(s)`, `n` is greater than 0, `ind` is 0, `i` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
