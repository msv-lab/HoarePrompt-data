Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. It takes the number of kegs (`n`) and the desired volume of kvass to pour (`s`) as input, along with the volumes of the kegs (`v`).

The program sorts the volumes of the kegs in ascending order and then uses a binary search to find the minimum volume that can be left in each keg after pouring `s` liters of kvass.

The binary search works by maintaining two pointers, `low` and `high`, which represent the range of possible minimum volumes that can be left in each keg. Initially, `low` is set to 0 and `high` is set to the minimum volume of the kegs.

In each iteration of the binary search, the program calculates the midpoint `mid` of the range and checks if the sum of the minimum volumes that can be left in each keg after pouring `s` liters of kvass is less than or equal to `s`. If it is, the program updates `low` to `mid`. Otherwise, it updates `high` to `mid - 1`.

Once the binary search is complete, the program checks if the sum of the minimum volumes that can be left in each keg after pouring `s` liters of kvass is equal to `s`. If it is, the program prints the minimum volume that can be left in each keg. Otherwise, it prints -1.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the binary search algorithm and checks for the condition that the sum of the minimum volumes that can be left in each keg after pouring `s` liters of kvass is equal to `s`. The program also handles the case where it is not possible to pour `s` liters of kvass by printing -1.

The time complexity of the program is O(n log min(v)), where n is the number of kegs and min(v) is the minimum volume of the kegs. This is because the program sorts the volumes of the kegs and then uses a binary search to find the minimum volume that can be left in each keg. The space complexity of the program is O(n), where n is the number of kegs, because the program needs to store the volumes of the kegs in a list.
