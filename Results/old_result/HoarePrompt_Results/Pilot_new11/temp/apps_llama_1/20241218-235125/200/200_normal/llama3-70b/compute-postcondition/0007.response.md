Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `v` is a sorted list of integers with all elements greater than 0, the current value of `low` is 0, the current value of `high` is the smallest element in `v`, the current value of `mid` is `(the smallest element in `v` + 1) // 2`, the current value of `total` is `mid * len(v)`. The total, which is the product of mid and the length of `v`, is less than `s`.**
