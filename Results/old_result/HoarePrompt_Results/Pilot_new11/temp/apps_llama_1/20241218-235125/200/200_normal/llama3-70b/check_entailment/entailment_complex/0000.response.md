Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input: It reads the number of kegs `n` and the target volume `s`, as well as the volumes of each keg `v`.
2. It sorts the volumes of the kegs in ascending order: This is necessary to find the minimum volume that can be left in each keg after pouring.
3. It performs a binary search to find the minimum volume that can be left in each keg: The program uses a binary search approach to find the smallest integer `low` such that the sum of the minimum between `low` and each element in the sorted list `v` is equal to or greater than the target sum `s`.
4. It checks if the sum of the minimum between `low` and each element in `v` is equal to `s`: If the sum is not equal to `s`, the program prints `-1`, indicating that it is not possible to pour the glass by `s` liters of kvass.
5. If the sum is equal to `s`, the program prints the value of `low`: This represents the minimum volume that can be left in each keg after pouring.

The program handles all potential cases, including:

* When the sum of the minimum between `low` and each element in `v` is not equal to `s`, it correctly prints `-1`.
* When the input list `v` contains integers that are greater than the target sum `s`, it still finds the correct minimum volume that can be left in each keg.
* When the number of kegs `n` is 1, it correctly prints the minimum volume that can be left in the single keg.

Overall, the program correctly implements the binary search approach to find the minimum volume that can be left in each keg after pouring, and it handles all potential cases as specified in the problem description.
