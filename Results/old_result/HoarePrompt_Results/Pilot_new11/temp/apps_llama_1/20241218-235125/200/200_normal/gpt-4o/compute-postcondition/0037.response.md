The given code snippet is a print statement that prints the value of `min_keg_volume`. The print statement does not modify any variables, it only outputs the value of `min_keg_volume` to the console.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is the original input integer, `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `total_volume` is the sum of the integers in `volumes` and is larger than or equal to `s`, `min_keg_volume` has been printed and is equal to `volumes[0] - (remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n` if `remaining_kvass` is greater than 0, and `i` is the last index that was processed if `remaining_kvass` is greater than 0, the value of `min_keg_volume` has been returned at the output state**
