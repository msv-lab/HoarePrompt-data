Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is an input integer, `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `total_volume` is the sum of the integers in `volumes` and is larger than or equal to `s`, `min_keg_volume` is equal to `volumes[0]`, `i` is 1, and if `volumes[i]` is less than or equal to `min_keg_volume`, the program moves to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, `possible_to_take` is the minimum of `volumes[1] - volumes[0]` and `remaining_kvass`, and `remaining_kvass` is either 0 or `remaining_kvass - (volumes[1] - volumes[0])`.***
