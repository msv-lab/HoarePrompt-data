Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, and `total_volume` is the sum of the integers in `volumes`. If `total_volume` is less than `s`, the value -1 has been printed and returned. Otherwise, `total_volume` is larger than or equal to `s`, and the value of `min_keg_volume` has been calculated as `volumes[0] - (remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n` if `remaining_kvass` is greater than 0, and this value has been printed and returned, with `i` being the last index that was processed if `remaining_kvass` is greater than 0.***
