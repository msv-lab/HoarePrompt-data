Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements of the problem description. Here's a step-by-step explanation of why it always does what the problem description says:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input from the user, which consists of two integers `n` and `s` (the number of kegs and the desired amount of kvass), and a list of `n` integers representing the volumes of the kegs. It assumes that the input is valid, as stated in the problem description.

2. **Sorting Volumes**: The program sorts the list of volumes in ascending order. This is done to easily identify the keg with the least amount of kvass (`volumes[0]`), which is a crucial step in solving the problem.

3. **Checking Total Volume**: The program calculates the total volume of all kegs and checks if it is less than the desired amount `s`. If it is, the program prints `-1`, indicating that it is not possible to pour the desired amount of kvass. This step is correctly implemented according to the problem description.

4. **Calculating Minimum Keg Volume**: If the total volume is sufficient, the program calculates the minimum amount of kvass that can be left in the keg with the least amount of kvass. It iterates over the sorted list of volumes, attempting to remove as much kvass as possible from each keg while keeping the remaining amount in the least keg as high as possible.

5. **Handling Remaining Kvass**: If there is still some remaining kvass (`remaining_kvass > 0`) after iterating over all kegs, the program distributes this amount evenly among all kegs by subtracting `(remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n` from the minimum keg volume. This step ensures that the minimum amount of kvass left in the least keg is maximized.

6. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the calculated minimum keg volume, which represents the maximum amount of kvass that can be left in the keg with the least amount of kvass while still pouring the desired amount `s`.

In summary, the program correctly implements all steps required to solve the problem as described. It handles the input, calculates the minimum keg volume based on the desired amount of kvass, and outputs the correct result according to the problem description.
