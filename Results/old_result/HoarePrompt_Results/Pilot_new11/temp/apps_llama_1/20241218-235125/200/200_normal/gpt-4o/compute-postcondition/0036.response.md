Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `s` is the original input integer, `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `total_volume` is the sum of the integers in `volumes` and is larger than or equal to `s`. If `remaining_kvass` is greater than 0, then `min_keg_volume` is equal to `volumes[0] - (remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n`, and `i` is the last index that was processed. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged as there is no else part to modify them.***
