The value of `high` is updated to be `mid - 1`. Since `mid` is `(low + high + 1) // 2`, we can substitute this into the new value of `high` to get `high = (low + high + 1) // 2 - 1`. However, since `high` is being reassigned, we use the original value of `high` to calculate the new `high`. The states of the other variables are not affected. The relationship between `low` and `high` is updated to `low` is strictly less than `mid - 1`. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `v` is a sorted list of integers with all elements greater than 0, `low` is strictly less than `mid - 1`, `mid` is `(low + high + 1) // 2`, `high` is `mid - 1`, and `total` is the sum of the minimum values between `mid` and each element in `v`.**
