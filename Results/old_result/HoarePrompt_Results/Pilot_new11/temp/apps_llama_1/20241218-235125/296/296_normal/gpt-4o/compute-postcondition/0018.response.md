The value of `divisors` is updated by appending the value `n // i`. Since `i` is 4, `n // i` is equivalent to `n // 4`. The previous values of `n` and `i` are still valid. 

The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that 4 <= `int(math.sqrt(n))` <= `int(math.sqrt(10^9))` and `n` is strictly larger than 2. This constraint on `n` is still valid.

The initial state also specifies that `int(math.sqrt(n))` is at least 4. This constraint on `n` is still valid.

Additionally, the initial state specifies that `divisors` includes the value 4, with additional values depending on the divisibility of `n` by 3 (3 and `n // 3` if `n` is divisible by 3 and not equal to 9). After appending `n // 4` to `divisors`, it will include the values 4, and any other values it had initially (3 and `n // 3` if `n` is divisible by 3 and not equal to 9), as well as `n // 4`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 4 <= `int(math.sqrt(n))` <= `int(math.sqrt(10^9))` and `n` is strictly larger than 2, `i` is 4, `int(math.sqrt(n))` is at least 4, and `divisors` includes the values 4, and any other initial values (3 and `n // 3` if `n` is divisible by 3 and not equal to 9), and `n // 4`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 <= `int(math.sqrt(n))` <= `int(math.sqrt(10^9))` and `n` is strictly larger than 2, `i` is 4, `int(math.sqrt(n))` is at least 4, and `divisors` includes the values 4, 3 and `n // 3` if `n` is divisible by 3 and not equal to 9, and `n // 4`.**
