You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a positive integer $n$.

Find a sequence of fractions $\frac{a_i}{b_i}$, $i = 1 \ldots k$ (where $a_i$ and $b_i$ are positive integers) for some $k$ such that:

$$ \begin{cases} \text{$b_i$ divides $n$, $1 < b_i < n$ for $i = 1 \ldots k$} \\ \text{$1 \le a_i < b_i$ for $i = 1 \ldots k$} \\ \text{$\sum\limits_{i=1}^k \frac{a_i}{b_i} = 1 - \frac{1}{n}$} \end{cases} $$


-----Input-----

The input consists of a single integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

In the first line print "YES" if there exists such a sequence of fractions or "NO" otherwise.

If there exists such a sequence, next lines should contain a description of the sequence in the following format.

The second line should contain integer $k$ ($1 \le k \le 100\,000$) — the number of elements in the sequence. It is guaranteed that if such a sequence exists, then there exists a sequence of length at most $100\,000$.

Next $k$ lines should contain fractions of the sequence with two integers $a_i$ and $b_i$ on each line.


-----Examples-----
Input
2

Output
NO

Input
6

Output
YES
2
1 2
1 3



-----Note-----

In the second example there is a sequence $\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}$ such that $\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} = 1 - \frac{1}{6}$.
Program:
```
import math

n = int(input().strip())
result = func_1(n)
print(result)

def func_1(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return 'NO'
    divisors = []
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
            if i != n // i:
                divisors.append(n // i)
    if not divisors:
        return 'NO'
    k = len(divisors)
    fractions = [(1, d) for d in divisors]
    return f'YES\n{k}\n' + '\n'.join((f'{a} {b}' for (a, b) in fractions))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The given program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the program does not correctly calculate the sequence of fractions that sum up to 1 - 1/n.

One potential case where the program does not work correctly is when n = 6. The program outputs:

```
YES
4
1 2
1 3
1 6
1 3
```

However, the correct sequence of fractions for n = 6 is:

```
YES
2
1 2
1 3
```

This is because 1/2 + 1/3 = 1 - 1/6, which meets the requirements of the problem.

Another issue with the program is that it does not correctly calculate the sum of the fractions. The program simply generates a list of divisors and their corresponding fractions, but it does not check if the sum of these fractions equals 1 - 1/n.

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to correctly calculate the sequence of fractions that sum up to 1 - 1/n. This can be done by iterating over all possible combinations of divisors and fractions, and checking if their sum equals 1 - 1/n.

Here is an example of how the program could be modified to correctly calculate the sequence of fractions:

```python
import math
from itertools import combinations

n = int(input().strip())
result = func_1(n)
print(result)

def func_1(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return 'NO'
    divisors = []
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
            if i!= n // i:
                divisors.append(n // i)
    if not divisors:
        return 'NO'
    target = 1 - 1/n
    for r in range(1, len(divisors) + 1):
        for combo in combinations(divisors, r):
            fractions = []
            total = 0
            for d in combo:
                for a in range(1, d):
                    fraction = a / d
                    if total + fraction <= target:
                        fractions.append((a, d))
                        total += fraction
            if math.isclose(total, target):
                return f'YES\n{len(fractions)}\n' + '\n'.join((f'{a} {b}' for (a, b) in fractions))
    return 'NO'
```

This modified program correctly calculates the sequence of fractions that sum up to 1 - 1/n by iterating over all possible combinations of divisors and fractions, and checking if their sum equals 1 - 1/n.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: This function determines if a given integer `n` has any divisors other than 1 and itself, and if so, lists these divisors and their corresponding fractions. The function accepts an integer `n` between 2 and 10^9 and returns either 'NO' if `n` is less than or equal to 2 or has no divisors other than 1 and itself, or a string that confirms the presence of divisors, lists them, and includes their corresponding fractions. The function considers divisors up to the square root of `n`, ensuring that all divisors are found due to the mathematical property that a larger factor of the number would be a multiple of a smaller factor that has already been accounted for. If divisors are found, the function returns a string that starts with 'YES', followed by the count of divisors (including their corresponding quotients if they are not equal to the divisor), and then lists fractions with 1 as the numerator and each divisor as the denominator. The function handles edge cases where `n` is less than or equal to 2, and where `n` is a prime number (i.e., has no divisors other than 1 and itself), returning 'NO' in these cases.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
