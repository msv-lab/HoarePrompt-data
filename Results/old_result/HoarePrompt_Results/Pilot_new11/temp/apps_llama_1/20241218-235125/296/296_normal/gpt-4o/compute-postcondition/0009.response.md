Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9 and `n` is strictly larger than 2, `i` is 2, `int(math.sqrt(n))` is at least 2, and `n` is a multiple of `i`. If `i` is not equal to `n // i`, then `divisors` is a list containing the values 2 and `n / 2`. Otherwise, the state of `divisors` remains as a list containing the value 2.***
