Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 <= `int(math.sqrt(n))` <= `int(math.sqrt(10^9))` and `n` is strictly larger than 2, `i` is 4, `int(math.sqrt(n))` is at least 4. If `n` is divisible by 4, then `divisors` includes the values 4 and `n // 4`, and if `n` is also divisible by 3 and not equal to 9, `divisors` also includes the values 3 and `n // 3`, otherwise the state of `divisors` remains unchanged if `n` is not divisible by 4, but was already set to include 3 and `n // 3` if `n` is divisible by 3 and not equal to 9.***
