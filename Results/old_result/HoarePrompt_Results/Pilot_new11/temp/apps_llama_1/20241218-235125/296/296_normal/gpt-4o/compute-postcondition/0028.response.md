The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, where `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9. After executing the function body, there are multiple possible return values based on certain conditions. 

Case_1: The function returns 'NO'. 
Case_2: The function also returns 'NO'. 
Case_3: If neither of the above cases is met, the function returns a string that starts with 'YES', followed by the number of divisors and their quotients up to the square root of `n`, and then lists fractions with 1 as the numerator and each divisor `d` of `n` as the denominator.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` within the specified range and return either 'NO' or a detailed string describing the divisors of `n` if certain conditions are met.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, an integer between 2 and 10^9, and returns either 'NO' or a string that confirms the presence of divisors, lists them, and includes their corresponding fractions, depending on the conditions met by the input value n.**
