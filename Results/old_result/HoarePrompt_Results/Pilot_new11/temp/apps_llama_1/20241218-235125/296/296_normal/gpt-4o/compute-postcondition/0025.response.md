The value of `k` is assigned the length of the list `divisors`. The length of `divisors` is the number of divisors of `n` up to the square root of `n` and their corresponding quotients (if they are not equal to the divisor). The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9 and `n` is strictly larger than 2, `i` is `int(math.sqrt(n))`, `divisors` is a list containing all divisors of `n` up to the square root of `n` and their corresponding quotients (if they are not equal to the divisor), `divisors` is not empty, and `k` is the number of elements in `divisors`.**
