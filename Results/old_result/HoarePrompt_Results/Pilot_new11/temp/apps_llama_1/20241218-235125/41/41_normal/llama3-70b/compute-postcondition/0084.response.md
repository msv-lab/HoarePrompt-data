The value of `rated` is set to `True`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `i` is at least 2, `n` is greater than `i`, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists of `n` input integers, `rated` is `True`, and `maybe` and `unrated` depend on the values of `ratings_before` and `ratings_after`.
