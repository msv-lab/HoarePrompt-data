Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `ratings_before` is a list of `n` input integers, `ratings_after` is a list of `n` input integers, `rated` remains `False`, `unrated` remains `False`, `maybe` remains `True`, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2. If `ratings_before[i]` is less than `ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i]` is greater than `ratings_after[j]`, then we break out of the most internal loop or conditional statement; otherwise, the program continues its execution without any changes to the variables.***
