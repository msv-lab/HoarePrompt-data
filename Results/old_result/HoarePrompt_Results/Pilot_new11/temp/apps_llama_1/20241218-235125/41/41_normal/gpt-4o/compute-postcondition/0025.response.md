The `break` statement terminates the loop that it is inside of, so the loop that contained this statement is now exited. No changes are made to the variables `n`, `ratings`, `is_rated`, `is_unrated`, or `i`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, inclusive, `ratings` is a list of `n` tuples of integers, `is_rated` is `False`, `is_unrated` is `True`, `i` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the first element of the tuple at index `i-1` in `ratings` is less than the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `ratings`.**
