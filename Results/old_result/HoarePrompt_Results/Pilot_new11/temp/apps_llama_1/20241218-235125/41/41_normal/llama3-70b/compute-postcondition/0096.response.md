Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists of `n` input integers, `maybe` is `True`. If `rated` is `True`, then 'rated' has been printed to the console and `unrated` is `False` if there exists a pair of elements in `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` where `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]`, otherwise `unrated` is `True`. If `rated` is `False`, then either 'unrated' has been printed and `unrated` is `True` if for all pairs of elements in `ratings_before` and `ratings_after`, `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j]` implies `ratings_after[i] <= ratings_after[j]`, or 'maybe' has been printed and `unrated` is `False`, indicating the existence of at least one pair of elements in `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` where `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]`.***
