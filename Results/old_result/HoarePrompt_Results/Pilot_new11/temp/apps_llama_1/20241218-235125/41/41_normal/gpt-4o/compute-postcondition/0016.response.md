The code snippet provided assigns the values of two input integers to the variables `a` and `b`. 

The values of `n`, `ratings`, and `is_rated` are not affected by this code. 

`a` and `b` are now input integers from the standard input, separated by a space.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than the number of iterations that have occurred so far and less than or equal to 1000, `ratings` is a list containing at least one element which is a tuple of two integers and includes the tuple `(a, b)`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, the state of `is_rated` remains as previously determined by the comparison of `a` and `b`.**
