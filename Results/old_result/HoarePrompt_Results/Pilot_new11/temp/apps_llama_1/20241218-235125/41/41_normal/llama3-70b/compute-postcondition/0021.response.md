Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `ratings_before` is a list of `n` input integers, `ratings_after` is a list of `n` input integers, `rated` is `False`, `unrated` is `True`, `maybe` is `True`, `i` is 0, `j` will be 1 at the start of the loop. The current value of `ratings_before` at index `i` is less than the current value of `ratings_before` at index `j`, and the current value of `ratings_after` at index `i` is greater than the current value of `ratings_after` at index `j`.**
