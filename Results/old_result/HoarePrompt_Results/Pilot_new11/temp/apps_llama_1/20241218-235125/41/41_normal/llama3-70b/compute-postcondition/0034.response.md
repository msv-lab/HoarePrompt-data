Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists of `n` input integers, `rated` is `False`, `maybe` is `True`, and the current value of `unrated` is `False`, indicating that at least one pair of ratings meets the inconsistency condition, and the value of `i` depends on the context of an outer loop, if present.**
