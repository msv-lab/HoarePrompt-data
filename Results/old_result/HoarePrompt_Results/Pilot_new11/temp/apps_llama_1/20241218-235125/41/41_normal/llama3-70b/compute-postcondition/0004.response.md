The provided code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes an input, splits it into two parts, converts each part into an integer, and assigns these integers to `a` and `b`, respectively. 

Since `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `ratings_before` is an empty list, and `ratings_after` is an empty list, and the code does not affect these variables, their states remain unchanged.

However, `a` and `b` are assigned the values of the two integers input by the user, so their values are now the input integers.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `ratings_before` is an empty list, `ratings_after` is an empty list, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `ratings_before` is an empty list, `ratings_after` is an empty list, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**
