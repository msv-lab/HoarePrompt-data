The `break` statement breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. It does not change the values of any variables. 


Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 1000, `i` is an integer less than `n` and `i` is increased by 1, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists of `n` input integers, `unrated` is `False`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
