Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is less than `n - 1`, `i` is an integer, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists of `n` input integers. If at indices `i` and `j`, the value at index `i` in `ratings_before` is less than the value at index `j` in `ratings_before`, and the value at index `i` in `ratings_after` is greater than the value at index `j` in `ratings_after`, then `unrated` is `False`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
