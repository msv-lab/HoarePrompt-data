The variable `rated` is assigned the value `False`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `ratings_before` is a list of `n` input integers, `ratings_after` is a list of `n` input integers, `rated` is `False`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `ratings_before` is a list of `n` input integers, `ratings_after` is a list of `n` input integers, `rated` is `False`**
