The code sets `is_rated` to `True`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
The value of `n` is still an integer between 2 and 1000, inclusive. 
The value of `ratings` is still a list containing at least one element which is a tuple of two integers (`a`, `b`). 
The value of `is_unrated` is still `False`. 
The values of `a` and `b` are still input integers and are not equal.
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, inclusive, `ratings` is a list containing at least one element which is a tuple of two integers (`a`, `b`), `is_rated` is `True`, `is_unrated` is `False`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, and `a` is not equal to `b`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, inclusive, `ratings` is a list containing at least one element which is a tuple of two integers (`a`, `b`), `is_rated` is `True`, `is_unrated` is `False`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, and `a` is not equal to `b`.**
