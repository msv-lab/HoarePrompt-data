Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 1000, `i` is an integer less than `n - 1`, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists of `n` input integers. The current value of `ratings_before` at index `i` is less than the current value of `ratings_before` at some index `j`, and the current value of `ratings_after` at index `i` is greater than the current value of `ratings_after` at index `j`.**
