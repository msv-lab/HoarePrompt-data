To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop code and the provided output states for the first few iterations.

1. **Loop Iterations**: The loop runs `n` times, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, inclusive. This means the loop will always execute at least once, and `n` determines the number of executions.

2. **Variables**:
   - `n`: The number of iterations the loop will perform. Its value does not change during the loop execution.
   - `ratings`: Initially an empty list. In each iteration, a tuple `(a, b)` of input integers is appended to it.
   - `is_rated`: Initially `False`. Set to `True` if `a` is not equal to `b` in any iteration.
   - `is_unrated`: Initially `False`. Its value does not change in the provided loop code.

From the given output states:
- After each iteration, `ratings` contains at least one more tuple of integers `(a, b)`, which were input during that iteration.
- `is_rated` becomes `True` if there exists at least one pair `(a, b)` where `a` is not equal to `b`. Otherwise, it remains `False`.
- `is_unrated` remains unchanged as `False` throughout the loop executions described.

Considering the loop code and the initial states:
- `n` remains unchanged throughout the loop execution, retaining its initial value.
- `ratings` will accumulate tuples of `(a, b)` for each iteration, resulting in a list of `n` tuples after all iterations.
- `is_rated` will be `True` if at least one `a` is not equal to `b` among all the input pairs; otherwise, it remains `False`.
- `is_unrated` remains `False` as there is no condition in the loop to change its state.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop have finished:
- `n` retains its original value, an integer between 2 and 1000, inclusive.
- `ratings` is a list of `n` tuples, each containing a pair of integers `(a, b)` input during the loop.
- `is_rated` is `True` if there was at least one pair `(a, b)` where `a` was not equal to `b`; otherwise, it is `False`.
- `is_unrated` remains `False`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, inclusive, `ratings` is a list of `n` tuples of integers, `is_rated` is `True` if any input pair `(a, b)` had `a` not equal to `b`, otherwise `False`, and `is_unrated` is `False`.**
