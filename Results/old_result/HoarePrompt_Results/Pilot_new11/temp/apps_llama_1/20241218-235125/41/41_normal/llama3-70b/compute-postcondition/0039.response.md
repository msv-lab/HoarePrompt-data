Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is less than `n - 1`. The current value of `i` is an integer that satisfies the condition `i < n - 1`. `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists of `n` input integers. The current values of `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists where at indices `i` and `j`, the following condition is met: the value at index `i` in `ratings_before` is less than the value at index `j` in `ratings_before`, and the value at index `i` in `ratings_after` is greater than the value at index `j` in `ratings_after`.**
