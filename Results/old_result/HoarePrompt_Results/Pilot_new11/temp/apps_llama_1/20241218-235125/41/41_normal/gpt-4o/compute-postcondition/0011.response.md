The code snippet given is assigning the results of `map(int, input().split())` to the variables `a` and `b`. This means `a` and `b` are being assigned two integer values that are input by the user, separated by a space.

Given the initial state, `n` remains an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 1000, and `ratings` remains a list containing at least one element which is a tuple of two integers. However, since `a` and `b` are now assigned the input integer values, their states are updated to be the specific integer values input by the user.

The states of `is_rated` and `is_unrated` depend on the comparison of `a` and `b`, but without specific details on how these variables are updated based on `a` and `b`, we can only say that `a` and `b` are now specific integers input by the user.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 1000, `ratings` is a list containing at least one element which is a tuple of two integers, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, the states of `is_rated` and `is_unrated` depend on the comparison of `a` and `b`.**
