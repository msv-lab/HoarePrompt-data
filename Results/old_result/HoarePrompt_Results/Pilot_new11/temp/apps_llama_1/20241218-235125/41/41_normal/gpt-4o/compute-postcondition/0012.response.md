The code appends a tuple `(a, b)` to the `ratings` list. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `is_rated`, and `is_unrated` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 1000, `ratings` is a list containing at least one element which is a tuple of two integers and now also includes the tuple `(a, b)`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, the states of `is_rated` and `is_unrated` depend on the comparison of `a` and `b`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 1000, `ratings` is a list containing at least one element which is a tuple of two integers and includes the tuple `(a, b)`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, the states of `is_rated` and `is_unrated` depend on the comparison of `a` and `b`**
