Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `i` is at least 1, `n` is greater than `i`, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists of `n` input integers. If `ratings_before[i]` is not equal to `ratings_after[i]`, then `rated` is `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, with `maybe` and `unrated` depending on the values of `ratings_before` and `ratings_after`. If `ratings_before[i]` is equal to `ratings_after[i]`, then the state of `rated`, `maybe`, and `unrated` remains unchanged, still depending on the values of `ratings_before` and `ratings_after`.***
