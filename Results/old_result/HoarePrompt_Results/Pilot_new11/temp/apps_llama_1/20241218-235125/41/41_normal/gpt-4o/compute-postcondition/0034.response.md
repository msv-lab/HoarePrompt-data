Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 1000, inclusive, `ratings` is a list of `n` tuples of integers, `i` is 3, `is_rated` is `False`, `is_unrated` is `True`. If the first element of the tuple at index `i-1` is less than the first element of the tuple at index `i`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged as there is no else part to modify them.**
