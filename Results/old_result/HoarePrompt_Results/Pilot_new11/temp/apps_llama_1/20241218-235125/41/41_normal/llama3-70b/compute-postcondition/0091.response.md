Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists of `n` input integers, `maybe` is `True`, and for all pairs of elements in `ratings_before` and `ratings_after`, if `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j]`, then `ratings_after[i] <= ratings_after[j]`. The current value of `unrated` is `True`, and the current value of `rated` is `False`, meaning all elements in `ratings_before` are equal to the corresponding elements in `ratings_after`.**
