The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside the current loop and moves on to the next iteration. Since we are already inside a loop and `j` is 1, after the `continue` statement, we move on to the next iteration of the loop. 

The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `n` and `m` are input integer values, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d` tuples, each tuple containing four input integers: `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `left_count` is a list of at least `d` integers, `right_count` is a list of at least `d` integers, `top_count` is a list of at least `d` integers, `bottom_count` is a list of at least `d` integers, `i` and `j` are either both 1 or `i` and `j` are not equal and we move to the next iteration of the loop, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the four integers in the first tuple of `sofas`, and `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the four integers in the `(j + 1)`-th tuple of `sofas`, `j` is 1 and we continue to the next iteration.
