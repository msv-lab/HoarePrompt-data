The value of `left` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `left` is unknown, so the output state is: variable `left` is increased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `sofa` is a list of four integers, `sofas` is a list of lists that must have at least 2 sofas, `s` is the second sofa in the `sofas` list, `left` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`sofa` is a list of four integers, `sofas` is a list of lists that must have at least 2 sofas, `s` is the second sofa in the `sofas` list, `left` is increased by 1**
