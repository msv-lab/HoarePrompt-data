To determine the output state, let's analyze the code snippet: `right_count[i] += 1`. 

1. **Initial State Analysis**: 
   - `d` is an integer greater than 3 and less than or equal to 10^5.
   - `n` and `m` are input integer values.
   - `sofas` is a list containing at least `d` tuples, each tuple containing four input integers.
   - `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers.
   - `j` is the next index plus one.
   - `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are the four input integers corresponding to the `(j+1)-th` tuple in `sofas`.
   - `right_count` is implied to be a list or array where `i` is a valid index.

2. **Code Impact Analysis**:
   - The value of `right_count` at index `i` is incremented by 1. This means that if `right_count[i]` previously had a value, that value is now increased by 1.

3. **Output State Calculation**:
   - The increment operation directly affects the value of `right_count[i]`. Since we're only given that `right_count[i]` is increased by 1 and not its initial value, we express its new value as `right_count[i] + 1`.
   - All other variables (`d`, `n`, `m`, `sofas`, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b`, `j`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j`) are not modified by the given code snippet.

Given the above analysis, the output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`d` is an integer greater than 3 and less than or equal to 10^5, `n` and `m` are input integer values, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d` tuples, each tuple containing four input integers, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `j` is the next index plus one, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are the four input integers corresponding to the `(j+1)-th` tuple in `sofas`, and `right_count[i]` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**
