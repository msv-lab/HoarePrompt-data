The value of `left_count[i]` is incremented by 1. The previous values of the other variables are not affected, so `d` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `n` and `m` are input integer values, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d` tuples, each tuple containing four input integers, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are equal to the `(j+1)-th` tuple elements in `sofas`, `j` is equal to the last iteration number plus one, and if `x1` is less than `x1_j` and `x2` is less than `x1_j`, then `right_count[i]` is increased by 1. If `i` equals `j`, the loop continues to the next iteration, otherwise the loop ends.
