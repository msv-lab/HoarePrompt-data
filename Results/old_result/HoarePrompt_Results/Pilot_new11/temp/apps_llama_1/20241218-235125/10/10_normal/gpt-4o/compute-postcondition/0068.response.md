Since `i` equals `j` is not true, `i` is 1 and `j` is 0. 

`x1_j, y1_j, x2_j, y2_j` are assigned the values of the tuple at index `j` of `sofas`, which is the first tuple of `sofas` because `j` is 0.

So, `x1_j` is `x1`, `y1_j` is `y1`, `x2_j` is `x2`, and `y2_j` is `y2`.

The output state remains the same for all variables except `x1_j, y1_j, x2_j, y2_j` which have been assigned the values of the first tuple of `sofas`.

Output State: **`d` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `n` and `m` are input integer values, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d` tuples, each tuple containing four input integers, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `left_count`, `right_count`, `top_count`, and `bottom_count` are lists of at least `d` integers where each element is the original count plus the number of sofas satisfying the respective conditions, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the four integers in the second tuple of `sofas`, `x1_j` is `x1`, `y1_j` is `y1`, `x2_j` is `x2`, `y2_j` is `y2`, `i` is 1 and `j` is 0**
