The code snippet provided is used to get new input integer values for `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`. 

The values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are updated to the new input integer values, and other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is an integer between 2 and 10^5, `n` and `m` are input integer values, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are new input integers, `counts` are between 1 and `d`-1, `sofas` is a list containing two tuples: `(old input integer values)` and `(new input integers)` which are the new values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`.

Output State: **`d` is an integer between 2 and 10^5, `n` and `m` are input integer values, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are new input integers, `counts` are between 1 and `d`-1, `sofas` is a list containing two tuples: `(n, m)` and `(x1, y1, x2, y2)` where `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the new input integers**
