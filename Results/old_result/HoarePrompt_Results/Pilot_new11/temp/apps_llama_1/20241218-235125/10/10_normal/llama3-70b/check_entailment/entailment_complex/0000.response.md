Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. The issue lies in the function `func_1`, which calculates the number of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of a given sofa.

According to the problem description, a sofa A is considered to be to the left of sofa B if there exist two cells a and b such that x_a < x_b, a is covered by A, and b is covered by B. However, the function `func_1` checks if the x-coordinates of the first point of two sofas are equal, which does not guarantee that the two sofas are in the same row.

For example, if the storehouse has two sofas: 
- The first sofa has coordinates (1, 1) and (1, 2)
- The second sofa has coordinates (2, 1) and (2, 2)

The function `func_1` will incorrectly count the second sofa as being to the right of the first sofa, even though they are in different rows.

Additionally, the function only checks the coordinates of the first point of each sofa, which is not sufficient to determine the position of the sofa. It should check all possible pairs of points between the two sofas.

To fix this issue, the function `func_1` should be modified to check all possible pairs of points between the two sofas and count the number of sofas that meet the conditions specified in the problem description.

Here is a corrected version of the function `func_1`:
```python
def func_1(sofa, sofas):
    left, right, top, bottom = 0, 0, 0, 0
    points = [sofa[0], sofa[1]]
    for s in sofas:
        if s!= sofa:
            s_points = [s[0], s[1]]
            for point in points:
                for s_point in s_points:
                    if point[0] < s_point[0]:  # sofa A is to the left of sofa B
                        left += 1
                        break
                    elif point[0] > s_point[0]:  # sofa A is to the right of sofa B
                        right += 1
                        break
                    elif point[1] < s_point[1]:  # sofa A is to the top of sofa B
                        top += 1
                        break
                    elif point[1] > s_point[1]:  # sofa A is to the bottom of sofa B
                        bottom += 1
                        break
    return left, right, top, bottom
```
However, this function still has a bug. It increments the count for each pair of points that meet the condition, which means that the count can be greater than the number of sofas. 

To fix this issue, we need to modify the function to only increment the count once for each sofa that meets the condition. We can do this by using a set to keep track of the sofas that we have already counted.
```python
def func_1(sofa, sofas):
    left, right, top, bottom = 0, 0, 0, 0
    left_set = set()
    right_set = set()
    top_set = set()
    bottom_set = set()
    points = [sofa[0], sofa[1]]
    for s in sofas:
        if s!= sofa:
            s_points = [s[0], s[1]]
            for point in points:
                for s_point in s_points:
                    if point[0] < s_point[0] and s not in left_set:  # sofa A is to the left of sofa B
                        left_set.add(s)
                        left += 1
                    elif point[0] > s_point[0] and s not in right_set:  # sofa A is to the right of sofa B
                        right_set.add(s)
                        right += 1
                    elif point[1] < s_point[1] and s not in top_set:  # sofa A is to the top of sofa B
                        top_set.add(s)
                        top += 1
                    elif point[1] > s_point[1] and s not in bottom_set:  # sofa A is to the bottom of sofa B
                        bottom_set.add(s)
                        bottom += 1
    return left, right, top, bottom
```
