The value of `left_count[i]` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is an integer greater than 3 and less than or equal to 10^5, `n` and `m` are input integer values, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d` tuples, each tuple containing four input integers, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `j` is the next index plus one, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are the four input integers corresponding to the `(j+1)-th` tuple in `sofas`, and `left_count[i]` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. If `x1` is less than `x1_j` and `x2` is less than `x1_j`, then `right_count[i]` is unchanged. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`d` is an integer greater than 3 and less than or equal to 10^5, `n` and `m` are input integer values, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d` tuples, each tuple containing four input integers, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `j` is the next index plus one, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are the four input integers corresponding to the `(j+1)-th` tuple in `sofas`, `left_count[i]` is the previous value of `left_count[i]` plus 1, and the conditions for `right_count[i]` remain the same as before**
