The given code appends a tuple containing the new input integer values `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` to the `sofas` list. The previous values of the variables are not affected, except for the `sofas` list which now contains two tuples. 

Output State: **`d` is an integer between 2 and 10^5, `n` and `m` are input integer values, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are new input integers, `counts` are between 0 and `d`-2, `sofas` is a list containing two tuples: `(old input integer values)` and `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`**
