After analyzing the given Python program, I found that it does not correctly implement the problem description.

The issue lies in the `func_1` function where it checks the positions of the sofas. The function only checks the position of the first point of each sofa, which is not enough to determine the correct position. The problem description states that sofa A is standing to the left of sofa B if there exist two such cells a and b that x_a < x_b, a is covered by A and b is covered by B. This means that we need to check the positions of both points of each sofa, not just the first point.

Here's a case where the program does not work correctly:

Input:
3
3 3
1 1 1 2
2 1 2 2
3 1 3 2
1 1 1 1

In this case, the program will output 1, but the correct output should be -1. This is because the program does not correctly count the number of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of each sofa.

Correctness: **False**
