The values of `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are assigned based on the `j-th` tuple in the `sofas` list. Since `sofas` is a list containing at least `d` tuples, each tuple containing four input integers, we can conclude that `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are input integers. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`d` is an integer greater than 3 and less than or equal to 10^5, `n` and `m` are input integer values, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d` tuples, each tuple containing four input integers, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `left_count` is a list of at least `d` integers, `top_count` is a list of at least `d` integers, and `bottom_count` is a list of at least `d` integers, `j` is the next index, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are input integers corresponding to the `j-th` tuple in `sofas`, and If `i` equals `j`, the loop skips to the next iteration.**
