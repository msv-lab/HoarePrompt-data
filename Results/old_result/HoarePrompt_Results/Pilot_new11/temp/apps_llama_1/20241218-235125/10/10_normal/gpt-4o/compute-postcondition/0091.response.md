The value of `top_count[i]` is incremented by 1. The previous values of `d`, `n`, `m`, `sofas`, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j`, `bottom_count[i]`, and `left_count[i]` are not affected by this operation, so they remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`d` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `n` and `m` are input integer values, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d` tuples, each tuple containing four input integers, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are equal to the `j-th` tuple elements in `sofas`, `top_count[i]` is the old value of `top_count[i]` plus 1, `bottom_count[i]` and `left_count[i]` are unchanged and follow the same conditions as before**
