The value of `right_count[i]` is incremented by 1, where `i` is 1. The previous value of `right_count[i]` was the original count plus the number of sofas satisfying the respective conditions. 

Output State: **`d` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `n` and `m` are input integer values, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d` tuples, each tuple containing four input integers, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `left_count`, `top_count`, and `bottom_count` are lists of at least `d` integers where each element is the original count plus the number of sofas satisfying the respective conditions, `right_count` is a list of at least `d` integers where the element at index `i` is the original count plus the number of sofas satisfying the respective conditions plus 1, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the four integers in the second tuple of `sofas`, `x1_j` is `x1`, `y1_j` is `y1`, `x2_j` is `x2`, `y2_j` is `y2`, `i` is 1 and `j` is 0, `x1` is less than `x1_j` and `x2` is less than `x1_j`.**
