Postcondition: **`sofa` is a list of four integers, `sofas` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 sofa, `s` is the first sofa in the `sofas` list, `s` is not equal to `sofa`. The first element of `sofa` is greater than the first element of `s` and the second element of `sofa` is equal to the second element of `s`. `left`, `right`, `top`, `bottom` are all equal to 0, and their values are determined by the condition: if the first element of `sofa` was less than the first element of `s` and the second element of `sofa` was equal to the second element of `s`, then `left` would be 1, `right` would be 0, `top` would be 0, `bottom` would be 0, but since this condition is not met, `left`, `right`, `top`, `bottom` remain unchanged, all equal to 0.**
