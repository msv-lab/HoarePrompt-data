The value of `right` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `right` is unknown, so the output state is: `sofa` is a list of four integers, `sofas` is a list of lists that must have at least 3 sofas, `s` is the third sofa in the `sofas` list. If the first element of the first sublist in `sofa` is less than the first element of the first sublist in `s` and the second element of the first sublist in `sofa` equals the second element of the first sublist in `s`, then `left` is increased by 1. `right` is increased by 1.
