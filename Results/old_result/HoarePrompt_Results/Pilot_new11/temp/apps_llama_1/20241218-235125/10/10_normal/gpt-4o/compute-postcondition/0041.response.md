To calculate the output state, we consider the impact of the code on the program and check the previous values of the affected variables.

The code increments the `i`-th element of the `right_count` list by 1. The value of `i` can be either 1 or another value such that `i` and `j` are not equal. 

Given this information, we can determine the output state as follows:

- `d` remains an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^5.
- `n` and `m` remain input integer values.
- `sofas` remains a list containing at least `d` tuples, each tuple containing four input integers.
- `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` remain input integers.
- `left_count` remains a list of at least `d` integers.
- `right_count` is updated such that its `i`-th element is incremented by 1.
- `top_count` remains a list of at least `d` integers.
- `bottom_count` remains a list of at least `d` integers.
- `i` and `j` remain either both 1 or `i` and `j` are not equal.
- `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` remain the four integers in the first tuple of `sofas`.
- `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` remain the four integers in the `(j + 1)`-th tuple of `sofas`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`d` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `n` and `m` are input integer values, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d` tuples, each tuple containing four input integers, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `left_count` is a list of at least `d` integers, `right_count` is a list of at least `d` integers where `right_count[i]` is incremented by 1, `top_count` is a list of at least `d` integers, `bottom_count` is a list of at least `d` integers, `i` and `j` are either both 1 or `i` and `j` are not equal, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the four integers in the first tuple of `sofas`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the four integers in the `(j + 1)`-th tuple of `sofas`.**
