Postcondition: ***`d` is an integer greater than 3 and less than or equal to 10^5, `n` and `m` are input integer values, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d` tuples, each tuple containing four input integers, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `left_count` is a list of at least `d` integers, `top_count` is a list of at least `d` integers, and `bottom_count` is a list of at least `d` integers, and `j` is the next index. If `i` equals `j`, the loop skips to the next iteration.***
