To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the loop code and the output states after the first few iterations.

The loop code calculates the cost of partitioning the sticks around the stick length `i` and the stick length `i - 1`. The cost is calculated as the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each stick length `x` in `sticks` and `i` and `i - 1`. If this cost is less than the current minimum cost `min_cost`, then `min_cost` is updated to this cost and `min_t` is updated to `i`.

From the output states after the first few iterations, we can see that `i` takes on the values `mid + 1`, `mid + 2`, `mid + 3`, and so on, up to 100. For each value of `i`, the cost is calculated and compared to the current `min_cost`. If the cost is less than `min_cost`, then `min_cost` and `min_t` are updated.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, `i` will have taken on all values from `mid + 1` to 100. The final value of `min_cost` will be the minimum cost found among all these values of `i`, and the final value of `min_t` will be the value of `i` that yielded this minimum cost.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer where `1 <= n <= 1000`, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `mid` is the stick length at index `n // 2` of `sticks`, `min_cost` is the minimum cost achievable by considering partitions around stick lengths from `mid` to `100`, and `min_t` is the stick length that yields `min_cost`.**
