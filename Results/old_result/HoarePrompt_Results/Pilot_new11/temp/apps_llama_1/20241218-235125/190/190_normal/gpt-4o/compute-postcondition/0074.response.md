To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, we can analyze the given loop code and the patterns from the provided output states.

The loop code iterates over each `length` in list `a`. For each `length`, it checks two conditions:
1. If `length` is less than `t - 1` (which is 2, since `t` is 3), it adds `t - 1 - length` (which is `2 - length`) to `current_cost`.
2. If `length` is greater than `t + 1` (which is 4), it adds `length - (t + 1)` (which is `length - 4`) to `current_cost`.
If `length` is between 2 and 4 (inclusive), no change is made to `current_cost`.

From the given output states, we can see that:
- `n` remains unchanged as it's not modified within the loop.
- `a` must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations for the loop to execute that many times.
- `t` remains constant at 3.
- `length` takes the value of the last element in `a` after the loop finishes.
- `current_cost` accumulates adjustments based on the conditions checked for each `length` in `a`.

Given this analysis, after all iterations of the loop have finished:
- `n` will still be an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), as it's not modified by the loop.
- `a` will be the same list of integers it was initially, but we know it must have been non-empty for the loop to execute.
- `t` remains 3.
- `length` will be the last element in `a`.
- `current_cost` will be the sum of all adjustments made for each `length` in `a`. For each `length`, if it's less than 2, `2 - length` is added to `current_cost`. If it's greater than 4, `length - 4` is added. If `length` is between 2 and 4 (inclusive), no adjustment is made.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers, `t` is 3, `length` is the last element in `a`, and `current_cost` is the sum of adjustments for all elements in `a`, where each adjustment is `2 - length` for `length` < 2, `length - 4` for `length` > 4, and 0 for 2 <= `length` <= 4.**
