The function calculates the optimal target length (`best_t`) and the corresponding minimum cost (`min_cost`) for adjusting a list of stick lengths to be within 1 unit of the target length, based on input values for the number of sticks and their lengths. It accepts no parameters, operates on predefined input values, and returns the calculated `best_t` and `min_cost` as output. The function handles stick lengths between 1 and 100 and considers target lengths from 1 to 100. It calculates the minimum cost by summing the adjustments needed for each stick to reach the target length, considering cases where the stick length is less than or greater than the target length. The function covers all potential edge cases, including stick lengths at the boundaries (1 and 100) and target lengths at the boundaries (1 and 100). After execution, the program state includes the optimal target length (`best_t`) and the corresponding minimum cost (`min_cost`), which are printed as output.
