Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers, `min_cost` is positive infinity, `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1, and the current value of `current_cost` is the sum of all `length - 2` for `length` in `a` where `length > 2`, plus the sum of all `0 - length` for `length` in `a` where `length < 0` (which will be 0 since lengths are non-negative), and the current value of `current_cost` is less than the current value of `min_cost`.**
