The given code prints the values of `best_t` and `min_cost`. This operation does not change the values of any variables, it only outputs the current values of `best_t` and `min_cost`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers, `min_cost` is the minimum cost achievable by adjusting lengths in `a` to be within 1 unit of `t` for `t` in the range 1 to 101, `best_t` is the value of `t` that achieves `min_cost`, and the values of `best_t` and `min_cost` have been printed.**
