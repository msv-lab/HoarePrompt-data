Since `length` is less than 0 and `t` is 1, `t - 1 - length` is equal to `1 - 1 - length` which is `-length`. Since `length` is negative, `-length` is positive. The value of `current_cost` is increased by this positive value.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `min_cost` is positive infinity, `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1, `length` is less than 0, `current_cost` is `current_cost + (1 - 1 - length)` which simplifies to `current_cost - length`**
