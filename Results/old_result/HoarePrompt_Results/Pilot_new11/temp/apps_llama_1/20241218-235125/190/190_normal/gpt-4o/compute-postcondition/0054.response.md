According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is less than 100, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be increased by 1. So, `t` becomes 3. The other variables `n`, `a`, `min_cost`, `best_t`, and `current_cost` are not affected by the loop condition. 

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers, `t` is 3**
