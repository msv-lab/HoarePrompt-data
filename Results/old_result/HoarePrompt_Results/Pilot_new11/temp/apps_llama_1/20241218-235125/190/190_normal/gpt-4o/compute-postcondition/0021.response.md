To calculate the output state, we first need to understand the given initial state and the impact of the provided code snippet. The initial state gives us the following information:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive).
- `a` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements.
- `min_cost` is positive infinity.
- `best_t` is -1.
- `t` is 2.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
current_cost += length - (t + 1)
```
However, to analyze the impact of this code, we need to consider the variables and their initial values:
- The variable `current_cost` is not defined in the initial state, so its value before the operation is unknown.
- `length` is not defined in the initial state, so its value is also unknown.
- `t` is given as 2.

Given that `t` is 2, the expression `(t + 1)` equals 3. Therefore, the code can be simplified to:
```python
current_cost += length - 3
```
This means `current_cost` is increased by the difference between `length` and 3. Since `length` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `current_cost` after the operation. However, we can express the change in `current_cost` in terms of `length`.

The states of `n`, `a`, `min_cost`, and `best_t` are not affected by the code snippet because they are not referenced or modified within it.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `min_cost` is positive infinity, `best_t` is -1, `t` is 2, and `current_cost` is increased by `length - 3`, where `length` is an unspecified value.**
