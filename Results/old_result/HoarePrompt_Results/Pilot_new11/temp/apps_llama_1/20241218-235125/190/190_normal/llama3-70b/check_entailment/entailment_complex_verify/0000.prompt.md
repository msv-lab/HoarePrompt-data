You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Salem gave you $n$ sticks with integer positive lengths $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$.

For every stick, you can change its length to any other positive integer length (that is, either shrink or stretch it). The cost of changing the stick's length from $a$ to $b$ is $|a - b|$, where $|x|$ means the absolute value of $x$.

A stick length $a_i$ is called almost good for some integer $t$ if $|a_i - t| \le 1$.

Salem asks you to change the lengths of some sticks (possibly all or none), such that all sticks' lengths are almost good for some positive integer $t$ and the total cost of changing is minimum possible. The value of $t$ is not fixed in advance and you can choose it as any positive integer. 

As an answer, print the value of $t$ and the minimum cost. If there are multiple optimal choices for $t$, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 1000$) — the number of sticks.

The second line contains $n$ integers $a_i$ ($1 \le a_i \le 100$) — the lengths of the sticks.


-----Output-----

Print the value of $t$ and the minimum possible cost. If there are multiple optimal choices for $t$, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
10 1 4

Output
3 7

Input
5
1 1 2 2 3

Output
2 0



-----Note-----

In the first example, we can change $1$ into $2$ and $10$ into $4$ with cost $|1 - 2| + |10 - 4| = 1 + 6 = 7$ and the resulting lengths $[2, 4, 4]$ are almost good for $t = 3$.

In the second example, the sticks lengths are already almost good for $t = 2$, so we don't have to do anything.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    sticks = list(map(int, input().split()))
    sticks.sort()
    mid = sticks[n // 2]
    cost = sum((abs(x - mid) for x in sticks))
    t = mid
    min_cost = cost
    min_t = t
    for i in range(mid - 1, 0, -1):
        cost = sum((min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i + 1))) for x in sticks))
        if cost < min_cost:
            min_cost = cost
            min_t = i
    for i in range(mid + 1, 101):
        cost = sum((min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i - 1))) for x in sticks))
        if cost < min_cost:
            min_cost = cost
            min_t = i
    print(min_t, min_cost)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided code correctly solves the problem statement by determining the optimal value of `t` that minimizes the total cost of changing stick lengths. 

Here's a breakdown of why the code works:

1. **Sorting the sticks**: The code sorts the stick lengths in ascending order. This is not strictly necessary for the algorithm but makes the initial midpoint calculation easier.

2. **Initial midpoint calculation**: The code calculates an initial midpoint `mid` as the middle value of the sorted stick lengths. This provides a reasonable starting point for the search.

3. **Cost calculation**: The code calculates the cost of changing stick lengths to be almost good for a given `t`. The cost function correctly calculates the minimum cost for each stick by taking the minimum of the absolute differences between the stick length and `t` or `t - 1` (or `t + 1`, depending on the direction).

4. **Search for optimal `t`**: The code searches for the optimal `t` by iterating over possible values of `t` below and above the initial `mid`. This ensures that all possible values of `t` are considered.

5. **Update of minimum cost and `t`**: The code updates the minimum cost and corresponding `t` whenever it finds a better solution.

Given the problem constraints (stick lengths are between 1 and 100), the code will always find the optimal solution by exhaustively searching the possible range of `t` values.

The examples provided demonstrate the correctness of the code for specific inputs. Without being able to find any counterexample or scenario where the code does not behave as expected according to the problem description, it is reasonable to conclude that the code is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: There is a list of n positive integers representing stick lengths, where 1 <= n <= 1000 and 1 <= each stick length <= 100.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    sticks = list(map(int, input().split()))
    sticks.sort()
    mid = sticks[n // 2]
    cost = sum(abs(x - mid) for x in sticks)
    t = mid
    min_cost = cost
    min_t = t
    for i in range(mid - 1, 0, -1):
        cost = sum(min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i + 1))) for x in sticks)
        
        if cost < min_cost:
            min_cost = cost
            min_t = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an input integer where `1 <= n <= 1000`, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `mid` is the stick length at index `n // 2` of `sticks`, `min_cost` is the minimum cost achievable by considering partitions around stick lengths from `mid - 1` down to `1`, and `min_t` is the stick length that yields `min_cost`.
    for i in range(mid + 1, 101):
        cost = sum(min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i - 1))) for x in sticks)
        
        if cost < min_cost:
            min_cost = cost
            min_t = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an input integer where `1 <= n <= 1000`, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `mid` is the stick length at index `n // 2` of `sticks`, `min_cost` is the minimum cost achievable by considering partitions around stick lengths from `mid` to `100`, and `min_t` is the stick length that yields `min_cost`.
    print(min_t, min_cost)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of positive integers representing stick lengths and returns the optimal stick length and the minimum cost achievable by considering partitions around this length. The function first sorts the input list in ascending order, then iterates through potential stick lengths from the middle value down to 1 and up to 100, calculating the minimum cost at each step. The minimum cost is determined by summing the minimum absolute differences between each stick length and the current potential stick length or its adjacent length. The function returns the optimal stick length and the corresponding minimum cost achievable, handling all input scenarios within the defined constraints (1 <= n <= 1000 and 1 <= each stick length <= 100) and edge cases such as empty lists or lists with a single element are implicitly handled by the input validation and iteration logic, though explicit error handling for these cases is not included in the provided code.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
