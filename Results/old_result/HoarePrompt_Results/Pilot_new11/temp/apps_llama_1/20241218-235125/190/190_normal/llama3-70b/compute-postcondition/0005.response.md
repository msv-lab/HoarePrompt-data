To determine the output state after executing the given Python code snippet, let's break down the information provided and the operation performed by the code.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is an input integer, where 1 <= `n` <= 1000.
   - `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers representing stick lengths, where each stick length is between 1 and 100 (inclusive), in ascending order.
   - `mid` is the stick length at index `n // 2` of `sticks`.
   - `cost` is equal to `sum(abs(x - sticks[n // 2]) for x in sticks)`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The code snippet is `t = mid`. This means a new variable `t` is introduced and assigned the value of `mid`.

3. **Output State**:
   - Since `t` is assigned the value of `mid`, and `mid` is the stick length at index `n // 2` of `sticks`, `t` equals the stick length at the middle index of `sticks`.
   - The values of `n`, `sticks`, `mid`, and `cost` remain unchanged as the code snippet only introduces a new variable `t` without modifying any existing variables.

Given these points, the output state after executing the code is that `n` remains an input integer between 1 and 1000, `sticks` remains a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `mid` remains the stick length at index `n // 2` of `sticks`, `cost` remains the sum of the absolute differences between each stick length and the middle stick length, and a new variable `t` is introduced with the value equal to `mid`, which is the stick length at the index `n // 2` of `sticks`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer where 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `mid` is the stick length at index `n // 2` of `sticks`, `cost` equals `sum(abs(x - sticks[n // 2]) for x in sticks)`, and `t` equals `mid`, which is `sticks[n // 2]`.**
