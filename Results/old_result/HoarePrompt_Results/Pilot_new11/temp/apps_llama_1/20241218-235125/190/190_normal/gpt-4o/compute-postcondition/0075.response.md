Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers, `t` is 3, `length` is the last element in `a`, and `current_cost` is the sum of adjustments for all elements in `a`, where each adjustment is `2 - length` for `length` < 2, `length - 4` for `length` > 4, and 0 for 2 <= `length` <= 4. The current value of `current_cost` is less than the current value of `min_cost`.**
