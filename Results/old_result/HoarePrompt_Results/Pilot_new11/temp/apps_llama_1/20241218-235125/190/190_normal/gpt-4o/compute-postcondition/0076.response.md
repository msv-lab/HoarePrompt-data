The code `min_cost = current_cost` assigns the value of `current_cost` to `min_cost`. The value of `current_cost` is the sum of adjustments for all elements in `a`, and it is less than the previous value of `min_cost`. 

After this assignment, `min_cost` will be equal to `current_cost`, which is the sum of adjustments for all elements in `a`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers, `t` is 3, `length` is the last element in `a`, `current_cost` is the sum of adjustments for all elements in `a`, and `min_cost` is equal to `current_cost`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers, `t` is 3, `length` is the last element in `a`, `current_cost` is the sum of adjustments for all elements in `a`, and `min_cost` is equal to `current_cost`.**
