Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `length` is the third element of `a`, `min_cost` is the minimum cost found so far, `best_t` is either -1 or 1, `t` is 3. If `length` is less than 2, `current_cost` is increased by `2 - length`. If `length` is greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 4, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `length` is greater than 4, `current_cost` is the old value of `current_cost` plus `length - 4`.***
