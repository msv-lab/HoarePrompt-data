Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `t` is 3, `current_cost` is 0, the first element in `a` is defined as `length`, and initially, the length is greater than or equal to 2. The current value of `length` is greater than `t + 1`, which means `length` is greater than 4.**
