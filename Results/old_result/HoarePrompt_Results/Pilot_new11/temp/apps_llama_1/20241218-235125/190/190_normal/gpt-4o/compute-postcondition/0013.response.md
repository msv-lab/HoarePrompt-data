Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `min_cost` is positive infinity, `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1. If `length` is less than `t - 1`, `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost - length`. If `length` is greater than or equal to `t - 1`, then if the length of `a` is greater than `t + 1`, `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + length - 2`, otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
