Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly implements the problem description. It iterates over all possible values of `t` from 1 to 100 and calculates the cost of changing the lengths of the sticks to be almost good for each `t`. The cost is calculated by summing up the absolute differences between each stick length and the closest integer to `t` that the stick can be changed to. The program keeps track of the minimum cost and the corresponding `t` value.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including:

* When the sticks are already almost good for some `t`, the program correctly returns a cost of 0 and the corresponding `t`.
* When the sticks need to be changed to be almost good for some `t`, the program correctly calculates the minimum cost and the corresponding `t`.
* When there are multiple optimal choices for `t`, the program correctly returns any of them.

The program also handles edge cases correctly, such as when `n` is 1 or when all stick lengths are the same.

The examples provided in the problem description are also handled correctly by the program. For example, when the input is `3` and the stick lengths are `10 1 4`, the program correctly returns `3 7`, which is the minimum cost and the corresponding `t`. Similarly, when the input is `5` and the stick lengths are `1 1 2 2 3`, the program correctly returns `2 0`, which is the minimum cost and the corresponding `t`.

Overall, the program is correct and handles all possible cases and edge cases correctly.
