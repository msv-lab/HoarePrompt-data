Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `t` is 3, if `length` is greater than 4, `current_cost` is `length - 4`. Otherwise, `current_cost` remains 0, and `length` is the first element in `a`, where `length` is greater than or equal to 2.**
