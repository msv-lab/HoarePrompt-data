Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `t` is 3, `length` is the third element in `a`. If `length` is greater than 4, then `current_cost` is `x + length - 4`, otherwise no additional conditions are applied.***
