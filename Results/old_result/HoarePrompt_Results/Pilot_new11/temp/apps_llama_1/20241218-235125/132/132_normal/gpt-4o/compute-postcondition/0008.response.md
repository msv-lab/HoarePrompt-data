The given Python code snippet simply prints 'Yes' to the console. This operation does not modify any variables or their values. Therefore, the state of all variables remains unchanged.


Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50, `x` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 1000 (inclusive), `y` is a list of integers with each integer between 0 and 1000 (inclusive), `total_x` is an integer between 0 and 50000 (inclusive) equal to the sum of all elements in `x`, `total_y` is an integer equal to the sum of all elements in `y`, `total_y` is less than or equal to `total_x`, and 'Yes' has been printed**
