The code `y.sort()` sorts the list `y` in ascending order. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
The value of `n` remains a positive integer between 1 and 50. 
The list `x` remains a sorted list of input integers. 
The sum of the elements in `x` is still equal to the sum of the elements in `y`, because sorting a list does not change the sum of its elements. 
After sorting, `y` becomes a sorted list of input integers.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50, `x` is a sorted list of input integers, `y` is a sorted list of input integers, and the sum of the elements in `x` is equal to the sum of the elements in `y`.**
