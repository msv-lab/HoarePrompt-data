The code `print('Yes')` simply prints the string 'Yes' to the console and does not modify any variables. Therefore, the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50, `x` is a sorted list of input integers, `y` is a sorted list of input integers, the sum of the elements in `x` is equal to the sum of the elements in `y`, `x` is equal to `y`, and 'Yes' has been printed to the console**
