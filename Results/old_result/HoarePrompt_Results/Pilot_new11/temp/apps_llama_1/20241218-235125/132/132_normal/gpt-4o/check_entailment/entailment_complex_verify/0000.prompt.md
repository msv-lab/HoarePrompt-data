You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There is a beautiful garden of stones in Innopolis.

Its most beautiful place is the $n$ piles with stones numbered from $1$ to $n$.

EJOI participants have visited this place twice. 

When they first visited it, the number of stones in piles was $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$, correspondingly. One of the participants wrote down this sequence in a notebook. 

They visited it again the following day, and the number of stones in piles was equal to $y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n$. One of the participants also wrote it down in a notebook.

It is well known that every member of the EJOI jury during the night either sits in the room $108$ or comes to the place with stones. Each jury member who comes there either takes one stone for himself or moves one stone from one pile to another. We can assume that there is an unlimited number of jury members. No one except the jury goes to the place with stones at night.

Participants want to know whether their notes can be correct or they are sure to have made a mistake.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input file contains a single integer $n$, the number of piles with stones in the garden ($1 \leq n \leq 50$).

The second line contains $n$ integers separated by spaces $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$, the number of stones in piles recorded in the notebook when the participants came to the place with stones for the first time ($0 \leq x_i \leq 1000$).

The third line contains $n$ integers separated by spaces $y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n$, the number of stones in piles recorded in the notebook when the participants came to the place with stones for the second time ($0 \leq y_i \leq 1000$).


-----Output-----

If the records can be consistent output "Yes", otherwise output "No" (quotes for clarity).


-----Examples-----
Input
5
1 2 3 4 5
2 1 4 3 5

Output
Yes

Input
5
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1

Output
Yes

Input
3
2 3 9
1 7 9

Output
No



-----Note-----

In the first example, the following could have happened during the night: one of the jury members moved one stone from the second pile to the first pile, and the other jury member moved one stone from the fourth pile to the third pile.

In the second example, the jury took stones from the second and fourth piles.

It can be proved that it is impossible for the jury members to move and took stones to convert the first array into the second array.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    y = list(map(int, input().split()))
    total_x = sum(x)
    total_y = sum(y)
    if total_y > total_x:
        print('No')
    else:
        print('Yes')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The program checks if the total number of stones in the second observation is greater than the total number of stones in the first observation. If it is, the program outputs 'No', indicating that the records cannot be consistent, as the jury members cannot add stones to the piles.

If the total number of stones in the second observation is less than or equal to the total number of stones in the first observation, the program outputs 'Yes', indicating that the records can be consistent, as the jury members can either take stones from the piles or move stones from one pile to another.

This logic is correct according to the problem description, and it handles all possible cases. The program does not need to check the individual piles, as the problem only concerns the total number of stones. Therefore, the program is correct and will output the correct result for all possible inputs. 

The key insight here is that the total number of stones cannot increase, only decrease or stay the same, which is exactly what the program checks. This makes the program correct according to the problem description. 

For example, consider the input:
```
5
1 2 3 4 5
2 1 4 3 5
```
The total number of stones in the first observation is 1+2+3+4+5 = 15, and the total number of stones in the second observation is also 2+1+4+3+5 = 15. Since the total number of stones is the same, the program outputs 'Yes', which is correct.

As another example, consider the input:
```
3
2 3 9
1 7 9
```
The total number of stones in the first observation is 2+3+9 = 14, and the total number of stones in the second observation is 1+7+9 = 17. Since the total number of stones in the second observation is greater than the total number of stones in the first observation, the program outputs 'No', which is also correct.

In general, the program correctly handles all possible cases, and therefore, it is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of a positive integer n, two lists of non-negative integers x and y, each of length n, where 1 <= n <= 50 and 0 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000 for all i.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    y = list(map(int, input().split()))
    total_x = sum(x)
    total_y = sum(y)
    if (total_y > total_x) :
        print('No')
    else :
        print('Yes')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50, `x` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 1000 (inclusive), `y` is a list of integers with each integer between 0 and 1000 (inclusive), `total_x` is an integer between 0 and 50000 (inclusive) equal to the sum of all elements in `x`, and `total_y` is an integer equal to the sum of all elements in `y`. If `total_y` is greater than `total_x`, 'No' has been printed. Otherwise, 'Yes' has been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function determines whether the sum of elements in list `y` is less than or equal to the sum of elements in list `x` for two input lists `x` and `y` of the same length `n`, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50, and each element in both lists is a non-negative integer between 0 and 1000 (inclusive). It accepts no parameters but instead reads `n`, `x`, and `y` directly from the input. The function then prints 'Yes' if the sum of `y` is less than or equal to the sum of `x`, and 'No' otherwise, after which the program concludes, leaving the input variables in their initial state. The function does not modify the input lists or `n`. It handles all potential edge cases as specified by the input constraints, including when the sums of `x` and `y` are equal, or when one is greater than the other. The function does not handle cases where `n` is outside the specified range or where the lists `x` and `y` are not of the correct length or contain invalid values, as these cases are not explicitly addressed in the provided code.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
