The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input integer to the variable `n`. Since the input is a positive integer, the value of `n` will be a positive integer. The previous information about the bounds of `n` (1 <= n <= 50) is still valid.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50, two lists of non-negative integers `x` and `y` are expected, each of length `n`, where 0 <= `x_i`, `y_i` <= 1000 for all `i`.**
