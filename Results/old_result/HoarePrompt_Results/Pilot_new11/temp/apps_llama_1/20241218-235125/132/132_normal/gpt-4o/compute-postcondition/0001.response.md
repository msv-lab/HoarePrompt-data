The given code takes an input of space-separated integers, converts them into integers using the `map` function, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `x`. 

Given that `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50 and `x` and `y` are lists of non-negative integers, each of length `n`, the impact of the code on the program is to update the list `x` with the input values. 

The new `x` will be a list of integers, where the length of `x` is equal to the number of input integers and the values are the input integers themselves. The length of `x` should be `n` as per the initial condition, and the values in `x` should be between 0 and 1000 (inclusive) to satisfy the initial state condition.

However, without the exact input values, we cannot determine the exact values in `x`. But we can state that `x` is now a list of `n` integers, each between 0 and 1000 (inclusive), as provided by the input.

The states of `n` and `y` are not affected by this code. Therefore, `n` remains a positive integer between 1 and 50, and `y` remains a list of `n` non-negative integers, each between 0 and 1000 (inclusive).

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50, `x` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 1000 (inclusive) as provided by the input, `y` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each between 0 and 1000 (inclusive)**
