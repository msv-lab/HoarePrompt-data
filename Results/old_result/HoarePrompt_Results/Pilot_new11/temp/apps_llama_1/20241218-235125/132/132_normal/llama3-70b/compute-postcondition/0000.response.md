The input consists of three lines, but only the first line is used in the given code. The first line contains a positive integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 50) representing the number of piles.

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input integer to `n`. 

The values of the number of stones in each pile on the first and second days are not used in this code snippet.

Output State: **The number of piles `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50, the number of stones in each pile on the first and second days are not used in this snippet but are still available as input in the subsequent lines.**
