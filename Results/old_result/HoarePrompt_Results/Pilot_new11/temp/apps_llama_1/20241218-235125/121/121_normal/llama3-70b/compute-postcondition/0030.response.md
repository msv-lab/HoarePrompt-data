Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must have at least 1 character, `c` is '?', `nc` is 'A', `avg` is `n // 4`. If `count['A']` is greater than 0, then `count` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and the count of 'A' in the dictionary is decreased by 1, `res` is 'A'.**
