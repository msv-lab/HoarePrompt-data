The code `res += nc` modifies the variable `res` by adding the value of `nc` to it. Since `nc` is 'G', the value of `res` becomes `res` plus 'G'. The initial value of `res` is not provided, so we cannot determine its exact value after the operation. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string with at least 1 character, `c` is 'A', `nc` is 'G', `avg` is `n // 4`, `res` is `res` + 'G'**
