Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string with at least 2 characters, `avg` is `n // 4`, `c` is the second character of `s`, `res` contains the second character from 'ACGT' that had a count greater than 0 in `count` if the second character of `s` is '?', or `res` is a string containing the second character of `s` which is not '?`, `count` remains a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' where each key's value is `n // 4 - original_count[key]`, and `nc` is 'A'. The current value of `count['A']` is greater than 0**
