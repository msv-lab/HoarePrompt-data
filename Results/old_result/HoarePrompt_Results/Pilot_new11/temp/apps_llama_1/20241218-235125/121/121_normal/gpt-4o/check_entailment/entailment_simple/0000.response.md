Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. The program first checks if the length of the genome (`n`) is divisible by 4. If not, it immediately prints "===" and returns, as the problem description states that the length of the genome should be divisible by 4 with no remainder.

2. It then initializes a dictionary `counts` to keep track of the count of each nucleotide ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') in the string `s`. It iterates over the string `s` and increments the count for each nucleotide it encounters.

3. After counting the nucleotides, it checks if any of the counts exceed the target count (`target_count = n // 4`). If any count does exceed the target count, it prints "===" and returns, as this means that it's impossible to decode the genome such that each nucleotide has the same count.

4. If all counts are less than or equal to the target count, it then iterates over the string `s` again, replacing each '?' with the first nucleotide that has a count less than the target count. This ensures that each nucleotide has the same count, which is the target count.

5. Finally, it prints the resulting string, which is the decoded genome.

The program always does what the problem description says because it:

- Checks if the length of the genome is divisible by 4 and handles the case where it's not.
- Correctly counts the nucleotides in the string `s`.
- Checks if any nucleotide count exceeds the target count and handles the case where it does.
- Replaces each '?' with a nucleotide that needs more occurrences to reach the target count.
- Prints the resulting decoded genome.

Overall, the program correctly implements the problem description and should produce the expected output for all valid inputs.
