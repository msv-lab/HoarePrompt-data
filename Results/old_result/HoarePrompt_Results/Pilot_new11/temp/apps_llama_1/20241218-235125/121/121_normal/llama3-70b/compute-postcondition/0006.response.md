Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must have at least 1 character, `c` is the first character in the string. If `c` is not '?', then `count` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' where the value of `count[c]` is 1 and the values of the other keys remain 0. If `c` is '?', the state of `count` remains unchanged with all values being 0.**
