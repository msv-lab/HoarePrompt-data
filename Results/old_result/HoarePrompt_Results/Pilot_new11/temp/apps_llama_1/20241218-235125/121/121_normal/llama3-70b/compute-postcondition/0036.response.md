To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an input integer
- `s` is an input string with at least 1 character
- `c` is 'A'
- `nc` is 'C'
- `avg` is `n // 4`

Loop statement:
```python
for nc in 'ACGT':
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Since `nc` is the loop variable and it iterates over the string 'ACGT', at the end of the previous iteration, `nc` was 'C'. For the loop to execute again, `nc` needs to move to the next character in the string 'ACGT', which would be 'G'.

The state of `n`, `s`, `c`, and `avg` does not directly depend on the loop variable `nc` or the loop itself, as per the given information. However, since `nc` has moved past 'C', if there was any conditional action based on `count['C']` being greater than 0 (as mentioned in the context of breaking out of the loop or an if statement), that condition would no longer apply because `nc` is now 'G', not 'C'. Yet, this detail about `count['C']` doesn't directly affect the state variables described (`n`, `s`, `c`, `nc`, `avg`), assuming `count` is not one of the state variables we're tracking.

Thus, considering only the provided state variables and the loop statement, the adjustment would primarily be to `nc`, moving it to the next character in the sequence 'ACGT', which is 'G'.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string with at least 1 character, `c` is 'A', `nc` is 'G', `avg` is `n // 4`**
