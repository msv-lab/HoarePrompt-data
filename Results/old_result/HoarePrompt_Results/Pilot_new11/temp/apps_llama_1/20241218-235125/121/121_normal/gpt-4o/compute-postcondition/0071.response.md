The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer divisible by 4 and greater than 1, `s` is the original string, `data` is a list of strings, `target_count` is `n // 4`, `counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and `counts['C']` is increased by 1, `char` is 'C', `i` is 2, `result[2]` is 'C' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
