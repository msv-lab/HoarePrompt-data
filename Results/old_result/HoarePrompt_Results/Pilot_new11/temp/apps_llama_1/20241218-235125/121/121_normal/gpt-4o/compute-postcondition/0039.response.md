Postcondition: **`n` is an integer divisible by 4 and greater than 0, `s` is a string, `data` is a list of strings, `target_count` is `n // 4`, `counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and at least one key must have a count less than or equal to `target_count`, `result` is a list of characters in `s` with at least one element, `i` is 0, the current value of `result` at index `i` is '?', and `char` is one of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T`. The current value of `counts` for the character `char` is less than `target_count`.**
