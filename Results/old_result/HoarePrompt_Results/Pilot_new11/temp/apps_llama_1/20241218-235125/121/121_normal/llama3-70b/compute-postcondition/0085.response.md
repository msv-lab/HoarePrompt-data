To calculate the output state, we need to analyze the given code and initial state. 

The initial state is: `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string with at least 3 characters, `avg` is `n // 4`, and `c` is not equal to '?'. 

The code is: `res += c`

This code adds the value of `c` to `res`. 

Since `res` is not defined in the initial state, we assume it is a variable that has been initialized before this line of code. 

Given that `c` is not equal to '?', it can be any character except '?'. 

After the code is executed, the value of `res` will be the previous value of `res` plus `c`. 

The values of `n`, `s`, `avg`, and `c` are not changed by the code.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string with at least 3 characters, `avg` is `n // 4`, `c` is not equal to '?', and `res` is the previous value of `res` plus `c`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string with at least 3 characters, `avg` is `n // 4`, `c` is not equal to '?', and `res` is the previous value of `res` plus `c`**
