The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. Given that `ans` was either 1 or 2 based on the condition of `s` at index `i` and `i-1`, `ans` will now be either 2 or 3, respectively. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an input string, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `ans` is either 2 (if the current value of `s` at index `i` is equal to the current value of `s` at index `i-1`) or 3 (if the current value of `s` at index `i` is not equal to the current value of `s` at index `i-1`).
Output State: **`s` is an input string, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `ans` is either 2 or 3**
