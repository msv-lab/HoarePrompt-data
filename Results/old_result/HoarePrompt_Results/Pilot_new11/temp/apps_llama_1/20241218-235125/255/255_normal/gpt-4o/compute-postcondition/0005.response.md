The code increments the value of `operations` by 1. The initial value of `operations` is 1, so the new value of `operations` is 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and must be at least 2, `s` is the input string of length `n`, `operations` is 2, `i` is 1, and `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i - 1]`.**
