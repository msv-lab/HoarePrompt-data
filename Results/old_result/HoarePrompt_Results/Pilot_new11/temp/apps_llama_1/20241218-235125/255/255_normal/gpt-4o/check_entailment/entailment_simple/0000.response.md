Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements in the problem description. 

Here's a breakdown of why it's correct:

1. The program reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s` from the input, which matches the problem description.

2. The program initializes a variable `operations` to 1, which represents the minimum number of operations required to delete the whole string. This is because even if the string is empty or contains only one character, at least one operation is required to delete it.

3. The program then iterates over the string `s` from the second character to the end. For each character, it checks if it's different from the previous character. If it's different, it increments the `operations` counter by 1. This effectively counts the number of transitions between different characters in the string.

4. After iterating over the entire string, the `operations` variable holds the minimum number of operations required to delete the whole string. This is because each transition between different characters represents a separate operation, and the first character always requires one operation.

5. Finally, the program prints the `operations` variable, which matches the problem description's output requirement.

The program handles all potential cases, including:

* Strings with only one character
* Strings with multiple identical characters
* Strings with alternating characters
* Strings with repeated patterns of characters

In each case, the program correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to delete the whole string, matching the problem description's requirements.
