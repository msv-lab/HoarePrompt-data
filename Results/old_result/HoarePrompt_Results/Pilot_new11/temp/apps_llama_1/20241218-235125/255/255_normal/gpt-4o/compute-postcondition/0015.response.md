The function does not accept any parameters, but rather reads input from two lines. However, I will describe its functionality based on the input it reads.


The function reads two lines of input. The first line contains a positive integer `n`, where 1 <= `n` <= 500. The second line contains a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. 

However, you didn't specify what the function returns, so I will leave that out.


Functionality: **The function reads a positive integer n and a string s of length n, but the return values are not specified.**
