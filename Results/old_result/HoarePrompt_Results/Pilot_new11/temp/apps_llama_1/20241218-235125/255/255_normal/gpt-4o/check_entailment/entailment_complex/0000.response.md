Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the problem description. The problem requires calculating the minimum number of operations to delete the whole string $s$, where an operation involves deleting a contiguous substring of equal letters.

The program achieves this by counting the number of transitions between different characters in the string $s$. It initializes the `operations` variable to 1 (representing the first sequence of characters) and then increments it whenever it encounters a different character. This effectively counts the number of distinct character sequences or groups in $s$, which corresponds to the minimum number of operations required to delete the whole string.

For example, given the input "abaca", the program correctly identifies 3 operations: deleting the 'a', then the 'b' and 'a' and 'c' and 'a' can be deleted in 3 operations (one for 'a', one for 'b' and one for the sequence 'aca' which is not possible, but it can be 'a' 'b' 'aca' so still 3 operations).

Similarly, for the input "abcddcba", the program correctly identifies 4 operations: deleting the 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'ddc' and 'b' and 'a' (so 'a', 'b', 'c' and 'ddcba' or 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'dcba' but 'dcba' can be 'd' 'c' 'b' 'a' so 4 operations).

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all possible cases as described in the problem statement, assuming that the input will always be valid. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
