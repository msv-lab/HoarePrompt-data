According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n-1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`s` is an input string, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and if the current value of `s` at index `i` is not equal to the current value of `s` at index `i-1`, then `ans` is 2, otherwise `ans` remains 1**
