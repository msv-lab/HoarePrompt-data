The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ans` was 1, so the new value of `ans` is 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. The current value of `s` at index `i` is still not equal to the current value of `s` at index `i-1`, and `n` is still greater than 1. 

Output State: **`s` is an input string, `n` is greater than 1, `ans` is 2, `i` is 1, and the current value of `s` at index `i` is not equal to the current value of `s` at index `i-1`.**
