Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. 

Here's why:

1. The program reads the input correctly: It reads the number of digits and the base for both numbers X and Y, and then it reads the digits themselves.

2. It correctly converts the numbers from their respective bases to base 10: The function `func_1` performs the conversion by iteratively multiplying the current result by the base and adding the next digit. This is the standard algorithm for converting a number from any base to base 10.

3. It correctly compares the two numbers: After converting both numbers to base 10, the program compares them and prints the correct result ('<' if X < Y, '>' if X > Y, and '=' if X = Y).

4. The program handles all potential edge cases: Since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, we don't need to worry about cases like empty input lists or invalid bases. However, the function `func_1` does handle the case where the input list `digits` is empty, in which case it returns 0.

Overall, the program correctly implements the problem description, and it will produce the correct result for any valid input.
