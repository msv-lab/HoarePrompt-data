The `result` is the base 10 equivalent of the number represented by `digits` in base `base`. Given that `base` is an integer between 2 and 40 (inclusive) and all elements in `digits` are between 0 and `base` - 1, the `result` will be the decimal value calculated from the given base and digits. If `digits` is empty, `result` is 0.

Output State: **The program returns the base 10 equivalent of the number represented by `digits` in base `base`, which is an integer between 2 and 40 (inclusive), or 0 if `digits` is empty**
