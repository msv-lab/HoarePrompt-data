The code initializes a dictionary `in_degree` where the key is an integer ranging from 1 to `n` (inclusive) and the value for each key is set to 0. This means that for every vertex in the graph represented by the dictionary `graph`, the in-degree (number of incoming edges) is initialized to 0.

Output State: **`in_degree` is a dictionary where keys are integers from 1 to `n` and each value is 0; `graph` remains unchanged**
