Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the annotated version of the code, the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly detects cycles in the graph using DFS. However, it does not address the requirement of checking whether the graph can become acyclic by removing at most one edge. The annotated version shows that the program does not implement any logic to test edge removals or determine if removing a single edge would break the cycle. Therefore, even though the cycle detection logic is correct, the program fails to meet the problem's requirement, making it incorrect.
