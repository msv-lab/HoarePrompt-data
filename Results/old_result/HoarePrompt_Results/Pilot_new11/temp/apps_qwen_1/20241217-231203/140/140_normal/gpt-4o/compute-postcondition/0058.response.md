`in_degree[neighbor]` is decremented by 1, which means the value of `in_degree[neighbor]` is reduced by 1 from its previous value. The value of `queue` might contain `neighbor_y` if `in_degree[neighbor_y]` was 0 before this operation, but since `neighbor` is used instead of `neighbor_y`, we cannot determine if `queue` changes without more context. The value of `count` is increased by 1, meaning it now holds the value it had previously plus 1. The value of `graph[node]` remains unchanged because the code does not modify it.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1.
- `count` is increased by 1.
- `queue` might contain `neighbor` if `in_degree[neighbor]` was 0 before the decrement.

Output State: **`in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1, `count` is increased by 1, and `queue` contains `neighbor` if `in_degree[neighbor]` was 0 before the decrement.**
