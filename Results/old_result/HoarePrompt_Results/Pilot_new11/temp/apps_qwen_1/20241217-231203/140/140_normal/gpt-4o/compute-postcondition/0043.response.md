Postcondition: ***`in_degree` is a dictionary where keys are integers from 1 to `n`. `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1. `queue` is a deque containing nodes with an in-degree of 0 and includes the new value of `neighbor` if `in_degree[neighbor]` was reduced to 0. `count` is incremented by 2, and `node` is set to 2.***
