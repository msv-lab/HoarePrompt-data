The code `queue.append(neighbor)` appends the value of `neighbor` to the end of the `queue`. The previous values of the variables are as follows: `in_degree` is a dictionary where keys are integers from 1 to `n`, `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1, `queue` is a deque containing nodes with an in-degree of 0, possibly updated with the new value of `neighbor` if `in_degree[neighbor]` was reduced to 0, `count` is `count + 2`, and `node` is 2.

After executing the code, the value of `queue` will include the new value of `neighbor` appended to it. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`in_degree` is a dictionary where keys are integers from 1 to `n`, `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1, `queue` is a deque containing nodes with an in-degree of 0 and includes the new value of `neighbor`, `count` is `count + 2`, `node` is 2**
