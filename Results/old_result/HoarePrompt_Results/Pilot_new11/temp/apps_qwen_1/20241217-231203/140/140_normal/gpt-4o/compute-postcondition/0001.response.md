State before the loop starts: `in_degree` is a dictionary where keys are integers from 1 to `n` and each value is 0; `graph` remains unchanged.

Now, let's think step by step:

1. The loop iterates over the keys in the `graph` dictionary.
2. For the loop to execute, `graph` must contain at least one key.
3. The initial state of `in_degree` (a dictionary where keys are integers from 1 to `n` and each value is 0) does not affect whether the loop will execute or not.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `graph` must have at least one key.

State: **`in_degree` is a dictionary where keys are integers from 1 to `n` and each value is 0, `graph` must have at least one key**
