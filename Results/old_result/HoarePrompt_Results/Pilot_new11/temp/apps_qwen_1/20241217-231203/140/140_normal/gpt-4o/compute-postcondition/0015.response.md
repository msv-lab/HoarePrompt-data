The code `in_degree[v] += 1` increments the value of `in_degree[v]` by 1. Given the initial state, for any vertex `v` in `graph[u]`, the value of `in_degree[v]` was originally the original number of edges directed into `v` plus 2. After executing this line of code, the new value of `in_degree[v]` will be the original number of edges directed into `v` plus 3.

The variables `in_degree`, `u`, and `graph` remain otherwise unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is:

- `in_degree` is a dictionary where keys are integers from 1 to `n`, and for any vertex `v` in `graph[u]`, the value of `in_degree[v]` is the original number of edges directed into `v` plus 3.
- `u` remains the same.
- `graph[u]` contains at least one vertex.

Output State: **`in_degree` is a dictionary where keys are integers from 1 to `n`, and for any vertex `v` in `graph[u]`, the value of `in_degree[v]` is the original number of edges directed into `v` plus 3; `u` remains the same; `graph[u]` contains at least one vertex.**
