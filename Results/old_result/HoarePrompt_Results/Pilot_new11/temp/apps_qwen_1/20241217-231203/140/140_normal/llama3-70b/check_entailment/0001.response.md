Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to detect cycles in a directed graph using depth-first search (DFS) with recursion. However, it does not handle the requirement to check if the graph can become acyclic by removing at most one edge. 

The function `func_1` correctly identifies cycles but does not attempt to remove any edges or check if removing a single edge could eliminate the cycle. To meet the problem's requirements, the program needs to simulate the removal of each edge and check if the graph becomes acyclic after such removal. The current implementation only checks for cycles without considering edge removals.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3 4
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1
```

The program will output "NO" because it does not attempt to remove any edge and check if the graph becomes acyclic. However, by removing the edge `2 -> 3`, the graph becomes acyclic, which means the correct output should be "YES". Therefore, the program is incorrect.
