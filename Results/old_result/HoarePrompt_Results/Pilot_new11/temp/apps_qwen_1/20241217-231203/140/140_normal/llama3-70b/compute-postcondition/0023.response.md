Postcondition: ***`node` is an integer existing as a key in the `graph` dictionary, `graph[node]` is a non-empty list, `visited` is a set including `node` and at least one unvisited neighbor, `rec_stack` is a set where `rec_stack[node]` is `True`, and there is at least one more unvisited neighbor in `graph[node]`. The function returns `True` if either `func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack)` returns `True` or `rec_stack[neighbor]` is `True`. Otherwise, the function does not return anything.***
