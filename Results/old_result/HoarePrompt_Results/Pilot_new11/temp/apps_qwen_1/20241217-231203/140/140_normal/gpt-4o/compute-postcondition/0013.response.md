The code `in_degree[v] += 1` increments the value of `in_degree[v]` by 1, where `v` is the current vertex. Given the initial state where `in_degree[v]` is defined for all vertices `v` from 1 to `n` and is equal to the number of edges directed into `v` plus 1, the value of `in_degree[v]` for the specified vertex `v` will be incremented by 1.

Other variables remain unchanged in their initial states: `u` remains the same, and `graph[u]` must contain at least one more vertex.

Output State: **`in_degree` is a dictionary where keys are integers from 1 to `n`, and for any vertex `v`, the value of `in_degree[v]` is the original number of edges directed into `v` plus 2, `u` remains the same, and `graph[u]` must contain at least one more vertex.**
