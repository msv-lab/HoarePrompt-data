Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
   - `in_degree[neighbor]` is either -1 or 0.
   - `queue` contains the elements it had before possibly including `neighbor`.
   - `node` is the first node from `queue`.
   - If `in_degree[neighbor]` was 0 before the if statement, `queue` includes `neighbor`.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each `neighbor` in `graph[node]`.

3. **State Adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `node` needs to be set to the next node in the `queue`.
   - The `queue` should contain all nodes that need to be processed in the next iteration.

Given these points, let's adjust the states accordingly:

- The `node` will be the next node in the `queue` after processing the current `neighbor`.
- The `queue` should be updated to reflect the remaining nodes to be processed.

Here's the detailed adjustment:

- Since `node` is the first node from `queue`, after processing `neighbor`, the next node in `queue` becomes the new `node`.
- `queue` will contain the remaining nodes after removing the current `node`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `in_degree[neighbor]` is -1 or 0, `queue` contains the remaining elements after processing the current `node`, and `node` is the next node from `queue`.**

To express this clearly:

**State: **`in_degree[neighbor]` is -1 or 0, `queue` contains the remaining elements after processing the current `node`, and `node` is the next node from `queue`**.
