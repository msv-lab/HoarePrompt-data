Postcondition: ***`node` is an integer existing as a key in the `graph` dictionary, `graph[node]` is a non-empty list, `visited` is a set including `node`, and `rec_stack` is a set where `rec_stack[node]` is `True`. If `neighbor` has already been visited (`neighbor` is in `visited`), the function does nothing. Otherwise, `neighbor` is marked as visited (`neighbor` added to `visited`) and remains in `rec_stack` with `rec_stack[neighbor]` being `False`.***
