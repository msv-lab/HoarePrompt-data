You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: node is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, graph is a dictionary where each key is a vertex and its value is a list of vertices that the key vertex points to, visited is a set of integers representing vertices that have been visited during the recursion, and rec_stack is a set of integers representing vertices in the current recursion stack.
def func_1(node, graph, visited, rec_stack):
    visited[node] = True
    rec_stack[node] = True
    for neighbor in graph[node]:
        if not visited[neighbor]:
            if func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack):
                return True
        elif rec_stack[neighbor]:
            return True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `node` is an integer existing as a key in the `graph` dictionary, `graph[node]` is a list (possibly empty), `visited` is a set containing all vertices that can be reached from `node` through a series of edges, `rec_stack` is a set where `rec_stack[node]` is `True`. If any `neighbor` in `graph[node]` has already been visited and is also in `rec_stack`, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, the function returns `False` if no such `neighbor` exists and the loop completes without returning.
    rec_stack[node] = False
    return False
    #`The program returns False`
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `node`, `graph`, `visited`, and `rec_stack`. 
#
#- `node` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph.
#- `graph` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex and its value is a list of vertices that the key vertex points to.
#- `visited` is a set of integers representing vertices that have been visited during the recursion.
#- `rec_stack` is a set of integers representing vertices in the current recursion stack.
#
#The function has multiple return points:
#- Case_1 to Case_6: The program returns True.
#- Case_7: The program returns False.
#
#Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `node`, a graph represented as a dictionary, a set of visited vertices, and a set of vertices in the current recursion stack, and it returns True in multiple cases and False in one case.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns True

Case_2: The program returns True

Case_3: `The program returns True`

Case_4: The program returns True

Case_5: The program returns True

Case_6: The program returns True

Case_7: `The program returns False`


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
