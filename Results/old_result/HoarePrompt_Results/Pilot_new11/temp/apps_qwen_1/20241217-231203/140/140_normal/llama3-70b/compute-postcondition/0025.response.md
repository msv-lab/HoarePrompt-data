`rec_stack[node]` is assigned the value `False`. This changes the value of `rec_stack[node]` from `True` to `False`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`node` is an integer existing as a key in the `graph` dictionary, `graph[node]` is a list (possibly empty), `visited` is a set containing all vertices that can be reached from `node` through a series of edges, `rec_stack[node]` is `False`.**
