Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of actions needed to turn over all skewers. According to the problem description, each action turns \(k\) skewers around a central skewer. The current implementation suggests turning every \(2k + 1\) skewers starting from the first skewer, which does not necessarily cover all skewers in the most optimal way.

For example, consider the input \(n = 5\) and \(k = 1\):

- The program would output: `2 1 6`
- However, the correct solution should be: `2 1 4` or `2 5`.

The program fails to handle cases where the optimal sequence of actions involves turning different skewers. Specifically, it only considers turning every \(2k + 1\) skewers starting from the first skewer, which might leave some skewers unturned or require more actions than necessary.
