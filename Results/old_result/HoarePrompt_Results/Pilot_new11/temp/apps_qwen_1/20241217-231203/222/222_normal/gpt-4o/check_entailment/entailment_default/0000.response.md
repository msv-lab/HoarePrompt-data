Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to turn over all \( n \) skewers with the minimal possible number of actions. According to the problem description, turning a skewer affects \( k \) skewers on each side of it. The code, however, simply appends every \( 2k + 1 \)-th skewer to the list, which does not guarantee that all skewers will be turned over with the minimal number of actions.

For example, consider the case where \( n = 7 \) and \( k = 1 \). The code would generate the list \([1, 3, 5, 7]\), meaning it would turn skewers 1, 3, 5, and 7. However, according to the problem description, turning skewer 1 would affect skewers 1, 2, and 3; turning skewer 3 would affect skewers 2, 3, and 4; and so on. Thus, the correct sequence would be to turn skewers 1 and 6, which is demonstrated in the correct output for this case.

Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
