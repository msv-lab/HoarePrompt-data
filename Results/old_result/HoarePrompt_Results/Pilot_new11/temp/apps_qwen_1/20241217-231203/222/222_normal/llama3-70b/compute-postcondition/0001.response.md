`l` is assigned the value of `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)`. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and `k` is an integer between 0 and 1000, the value of `l` will depend on these inputs. The previous values of `n` and `k` are still valid, but now `l` is updated based on the given formula.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 1000; `l` is `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)`**
