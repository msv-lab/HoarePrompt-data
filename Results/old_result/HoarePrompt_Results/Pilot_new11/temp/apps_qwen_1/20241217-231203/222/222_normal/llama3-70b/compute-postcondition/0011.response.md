The code `print(' '.join(map(str, res)))` does not change any variable values directly. Instead, it prints the elements of the list `res` separated by spaces. The elements of `res` are already determined based on the initial conditions given. The list `res` contains all integers of the form \(i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1\) for \(0 \leq i < l\), where \(l\) is the length of the list `res`.

Since the list `res` is not modified by the given code snippet, the only thing that happens is the printing of the elements of `res`. Therefore, the output of the print statement will be the list of numbers generated according to the formula, but the variables `n`, `k`, `res`, and `l` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\); `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq 1000\); `n > k + 2`; `res` is a list containing all integers of the form \(i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1\) for \(0 \leq i < l\); `l` is the length of the list `res`. The elements of `res` are printed but the variables remain unchanged.**
