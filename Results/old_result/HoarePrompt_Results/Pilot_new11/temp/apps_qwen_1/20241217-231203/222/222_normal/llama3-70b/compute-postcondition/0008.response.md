The code `res.append(i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1)` appends a new element to the list `res`. The new element is calculated as `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1`.

From the initial state, we know:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\)
- `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq 1000\)
- `n > k + 2`
- `res` is a list containing an additional element, meaning `res` originally contains at least one element.
- `i` is `i + 2`

Let's calculate the new element added to `res`:
- The new element is `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1`.
- Since `i` is `i + 2`, we can replace `i` in the calculation with `i + 2`.

Thus, the new element added to `res` is \((i + 2) * (k * 2 + 1) + 1\).

Therefore, the updated state of the variables is:
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `k` remains unchanged.
- `res` now contains its original elements plus the new element \((i + 2) * (k * 2 + 1) + 1\).
- `i` is no longer needed as it was only used in the calculation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\); `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq 1000\); `n > k + 2`; `res` is a list containing its original elements plus the new element \((i + 2) * (k * 2 + 1) + 1\)**.
