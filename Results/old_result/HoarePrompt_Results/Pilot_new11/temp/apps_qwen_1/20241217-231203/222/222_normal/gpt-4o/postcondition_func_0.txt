The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers with the constraints \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\) and \(0 \leq k \leq 1000\). After executing the function, it prints the length of the `positions` list, which contains all odd numbers starting from 1 up to the largest odd number less than or equal to the minimum of `n` and 1000. Additionally, it prints the elements of the `positions` list separated by spaces.
