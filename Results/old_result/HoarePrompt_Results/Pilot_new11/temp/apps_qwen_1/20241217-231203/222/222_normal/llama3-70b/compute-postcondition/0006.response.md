The code snippet appends a new value to the list `res`. The value being appended is calculated as `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1`, where `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `i`, we know that before the execution of this line, `i` was already an integer. After executing the line, `i` is incremented by 1.

The other variables `n`, `k`, and `res` remain unchanged except that the new value is added to `res`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq 1000\), and `n > k + 2`; `res` is a list containing an additional element `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1` where `i` is an integer that was incremented by 1, `i` is now `i + 1**
