The code `print(ans)` simply prints the value of the variable `ans` without changing its value or the values of other variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\); `pos` is an integer such that \(1 \leq pos \leq n\); `l` is an integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq n\); `r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq n\); `ans` is \((pos - r) + \min(pos - 1, n - r) + \max(0, l - 1)\).**
