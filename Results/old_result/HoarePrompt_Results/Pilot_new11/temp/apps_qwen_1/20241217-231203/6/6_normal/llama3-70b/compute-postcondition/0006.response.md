The value of `ans` is incremented by the difference between `pos` and `r`. Given that the current value of `pos` is greater than `r`, the value of `ans` will be the difference between these two variables. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `pos` is an integer such that 1 ≤ pos ≤ n; `l` is an integer such that 1 ≤ l ≤ n; `r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n; `ans` is `pos - r`; the current value of `pos` is greater than `r`.**
