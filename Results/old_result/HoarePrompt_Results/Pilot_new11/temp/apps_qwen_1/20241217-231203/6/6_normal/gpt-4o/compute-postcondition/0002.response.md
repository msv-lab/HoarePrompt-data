The code `print(0)` simply prints the integer `0`. This does not change the values of any variables but affects the output of the program. The variables `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `l` is 1, `r` is `n`, the program prints `0`.**
