Functionality: **The function takes no explicit parameters but operates within a predefined context where `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`, and `l` and `r` are integers such that `1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n`. It determines the minimum number of moves required to move a position `pos` to either end of the range `[l, r]`. If `l == 1` and `r == n`, it prints `0` indicating no moves are needed. If `l == 1`, it calculates the moves to reach `r` and prints the result. If `r == n`, it calculates the moves to reach `l` and prints the result. Otherwise, it calculates the moves to reach both ends and prints the minimum of the two. The function returns nothing but prints the result directly.**
