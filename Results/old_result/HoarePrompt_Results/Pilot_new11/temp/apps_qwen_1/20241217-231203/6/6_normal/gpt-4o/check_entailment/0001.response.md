Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, consider the following input:

Input
```
6 5 2 4
```

In this case, the cursor is at the 5th tab, and Luba needs to keep tabs 2 to 4 open. According to the problem description, Luba should be able to achieve this goal in 3 seconds:

1. Move the cursor to the 4th tab.
2. Close all tabs to the left of the cursor (tabs 1 and 2).
3. Move the cursor to the 3rd tab.

However, the program will output 4, which is incorrect because it does not account for the optimal sequence of moves. Therefore, the program is not correct for this input.
