The code reads four integers from input and assigns them to `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` respectively. The values of `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` are obtained from the input, and the original values of these variables are replaced by the new input values. The preconditions remain true after the assignment.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `pos` is an integer such that 1 ≤ pos ≤ n; `l` is an integer such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n; `r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n**
