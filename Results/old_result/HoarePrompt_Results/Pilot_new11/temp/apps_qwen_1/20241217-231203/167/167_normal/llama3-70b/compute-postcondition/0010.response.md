Postcondition: ***`x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^9\), `y` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq y \leq 10^9\), `a` is a list with at least one element, `v_new` is the next element in the list `a`, `nx` is \((v_new - 1) // y\), `ny` is \((v_new - 1) \% y\). The function returns `False` if the absolute difference between `nx` and `px` plus the absolute difference between `ny` and `py` is not equal to 1. There is no change in other variables in the else part.***
