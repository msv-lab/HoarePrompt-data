Postcondition: **`x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^9\), `y` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq y \leq 10^9\), `a` is a non-empty list representing a valid path in the matrix, `px` is 0, `py` is 0, `nx` is \((v - 1) // y\), `ny` is \((v - 1) % y\), and the absolute difference between `nx` and `px` plus the absolute difference between `ny` and `py` is equal to 1**
