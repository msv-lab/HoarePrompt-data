Postcondition: ***`x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^9\), `y` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq y \leq 10^9\), `a` is a non-empty list representing a valid path in the matrix, `px` is 0, `py` is 0, `nx` is \((v - 1) // y\), `ny` is \((v - 1) \% y\). The absolute distance between `nx` and `px` plus the absolute distance between `ny` and `py` is not equal to 1.***
