The code assigns the value of `nx` to `px` and the value of `ny` to `py`. Therefore, the variables `px` and `py` now hold the values of `nx` and `ny`, respectively. The values of `x`, `y`, `a`, `v_new`, and the conditions for `nx` and `ny` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^9\), `y` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq y \leq 10^9\), `a` is a list with at least one element, `v_new` is the next element in the list `a`, `nx` is \((v_new - 1) // y\), `ny` is \((v_new - 1) \% y\), `px` is `nx`, `py` is `ny`.**
