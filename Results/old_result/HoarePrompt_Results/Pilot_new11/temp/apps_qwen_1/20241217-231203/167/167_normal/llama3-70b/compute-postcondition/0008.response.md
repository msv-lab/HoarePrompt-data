The code updates the variables `nx` and `ny` using the expressions `(v - 1) // y` and `(v - 1) % y` respectively. Here, `v` is `v_new`, which is the next element in the list `a`. Given the initial conditions, `nx` and `ny` are calculated based on these expressions.

Given the preconditions:
- `px` is \((v_new - 1) // y\)
- `py` is \((v_new - 1) \% y\)
- The absolute difference between `nx` and `px` plus the absolute difference between `ny` and `py` is equal to 1

After running the code:
- `nx` is set to \((v_new - 1) // y\)
- `ny` is set to \((v_new - 1) \% y\)

Since `nx` and `ny` are directly assigned new values based on `v_new`, the absolute difference condition is satisfied by the definitions of `px` and `py`.

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^9\), `y` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq y \leq 10^9\), `a` is a list with at least one element, `v_new` is the next element in the list `a`, `nx` is \((v_new - 1) // y\), `ny` is \((v_new - 1) \% y\), and the absolute difference between `nx` and `px` plus the absolute difference between `ny` and `py` is equal to 1.**
