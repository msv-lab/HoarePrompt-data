Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the condition that the matrix dimensions \(x\) and \(y\) must satisfy the given path constraints. Specifically, the function `func_1` checks if the Manhattan distance between consecutive cells is exactly 1, which is a necessary condition. However, the program does not ensure that the dimensions \(x\) and \(y\) are chosen such that the path is possible within the matrix bounds.

To illustrate, consider the following example:

- Input:
```
8
1 2 3 6 9 8 5 2
```

- Expected output:
```
YES
3 3
```

This example is handled correctly in the reference solution. However, consider another example:

- Input:
```
6
1 2 1 2 5 3
```

- Expected output:
```
NO
```

The reference solution handles this correctly. Now, consider a more complex example that the current program might fail:

- Input:
```
7
1 2 3 4 8 7 6
```

For this input, the path goes through cells with numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 7, and 6. Let's see if we can find valid \(x\) and \(y\):

- The positions of these cells in the matrix are:
  - Cell 1: (1,1)
  - Cell 2: (1,2)
  - Cell 3: (1,3)
  - Cell 4: (1,4)
  - Cell 8: (2,4)
  - Cell 7: (2,3)
  - Cell 6: (2,2)

Checking the Manhattan distances:
- From (1,1) to (1,2): Distance is 1
- From (1,2) to (1,3): Distance is 1
- From (1,3) to (1,4): Distance is 1
- From (1,4) to (2,4): Distance is 1
- From (2,4) to (2,3): Distance is 1
- From (2,3) to (2,2): Distance is 1

Since all distances are 1, the path is valid. However, the program will fail because it does not check if the path is possible within the matrix bounds for any \(x\) and \(y\). The program assumes \(x\) and \(y\) up to 1,000,000, but it does not ensure the path is within the bounds of the matrix for smaller \(x\) and \(y\).

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not handle all potential cases correctly.
