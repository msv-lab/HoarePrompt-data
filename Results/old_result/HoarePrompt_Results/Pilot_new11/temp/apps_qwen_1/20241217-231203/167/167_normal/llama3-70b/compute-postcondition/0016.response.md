The code assigns `nx` to `px` and `ny` to `py`. Therefore, the values of `px` and `py` are updated to be the same as `nx` and `ny`, respectively. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `a` is a list with at least one element, `v_new` is the next element in the list `a`, `nx` is \(\frac{v_new - 1}{y}\), `ny` is \((v_new - 1) \% y\), `px` is \(\frac{v_new - 1}{y}\), `py` is \((v_new - 1) \% y\)**
