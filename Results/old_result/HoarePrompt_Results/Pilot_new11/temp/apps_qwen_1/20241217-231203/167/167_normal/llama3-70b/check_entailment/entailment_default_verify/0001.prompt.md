You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There is a matrix A of size x × y filled with integers. For every $i \in [ 1 . . x ]$, $j \in [ 1 . . y ]$ A_{i}, j = y(i - 1) + j. Obviously, every integer from [1..xy] occurs exactly once in this matrix. 

You have traversed some path in this matrix. Your path can be described as a sequence of visited cells a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} denoting that you started in the cell containing the number a_1, then moved to the cell with the number a_2, and so on.

From the cell located in i-th line and j-th column (we denote this cell as (i, j)) you can move into one of the following cells: (i + 1, j) — only if i < x;  (i, j + 1) — only if j < y;  (i - 1, j) — only if i > 1;  (i, j - 1) — only if j > 1.

Notice that making a move requires you to go to an adjacent cell. It is not allowed to stay in the same cell. You don't know x and y exactly, but you have to find any possible values for these numbers such that you could start in the cell containing the integer a_1, then move to the cell containing a_2 (in one step), then move to the cell containing a_3 (also in one step) and so on. Can you choose x and y so that they don't contradict with your sequence of moves?


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000) — the number of cells you visited on your path (if some cell is visited twice, then it's listed twice).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the integers in the cells on your path.


-----Output-----

If all possible values of x and y such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9 contradict with the information about your path, print NO.

Otherwise, print YES in the first line, and in the second line print the values x and y such that your path was possible with such number of lines and columns in the matrix. Remember that they must be positive integers not exceeding 10^9.

Also there exist multiple correct answers for both the first and the third examples.
Program:
```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
dx = [0, 1, 0, -1]
dy = [1, 0, -1, 0]
for x in range(1, 1000001):
    for y in range(1, 1000001):
        if x * y > max(a):
            break
        if all((1 <= v <= x * y for v in a)) and func_1(x, y):
            print('YES')
            print(x, y)
            exit()
print('NO')

def func_1(x, y):
    (px, py) = (0, 0)
    for v in a:
        (nx, ny) = ((v - 1) // y, (v - 1) % y)
        if abs(nx - px) + abs(ny - py) != 1:
            return False
        (px, py) = (nx, ny)
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the condition that the matrix dimensions \(x\) and \(y\) must satisfy the given path constraints. Specifically, the function `func_1` checks if the Manhattan distance between consecutive cells is exactly 1, which is a necessary condition. However, the program does not ensure that the dimensions \(x\) and \(y\) are chosen such that the path is possible within the matrix bounds.

To illustrate, consider the following example:

- Input:
```
8
1 2 3 6 9 8 5 2
```

- Expected output:
```
YES
3 3
```

This example is handled correctly in the reference solution. However, consider another example:

- Input:
```
6
1 2 1 2 5 3
```

- Expected output:
```
NO
```

The reference solution handles this correctly. Now, consider a more complex example that the current program might fail:

- Input:
```
7
1 2 3 4 8 7 6
```

For this input, the path goes through cells with numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 7, and 6. Let's see if we can find valid \(x\) and \(y\):

- The positions of these cells in the matrix are:
  - Cell 1: (1,1)
  - Cell 2: (1,2)
  - Cell 3: (1,3)
  - Cell 4: (1,4)
  - Cell 8: (2,4)
  - Cell 7: (2,3)
  - Cell 6: (2,2)

Checking the Manhattan distances:
- From (1,1) to (1,2): Distance is 1
- From (1,2) to (1,3): Distance is 1
- From (1,3) to (1,4): Distance is 1
- From (1,4) to (2,4): Distance is 1
- From (2,4) to (2,3): Distance is 1
- From (2,3) to (2,2): Distance is 1

Since all distances are 1, the path is valid. However, the program will fail because it does not check if the path is possible within the matrix bounds for any \(x\) and \(y\). The program assumes \(x\) and \(y\) up to 1,000,000, but it does not ensure the path is within the bounds of the matrix for smaller \(x\) and \(y\).

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not handle all potential cases correctly.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`, which represent the dimensions of a matrix. It also takes a list `a` representing a path through this matrix. The function checks whether the path represented by `a` is valid, meaning each step in the path moves to an adjacent cell (up, down, left, or right) in the matrix. If the path is valid, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. 

Potential edge cases include:
1. The list `a` might be empty, in which case the function should return `False` since no path can be formed.
2. The values in `a` must be within the range `[1, xy]`, where `xy` is the total number of cells in the matrix (`x * y`). If any value in `a` is out of this range, the function should return `False`.

Missing functionality in the current code:
1. The function should handle the case where `a` is an empty list, which is currently not covered by the existing code.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
