`k` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition.

Output State: **`prefix_sum[0]` is `0`, `prefix_sum[i]` for `i` from `1` to `n` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `a`, the sum of the first `n` elements of `a` is not `0`, `k` is `2`, `l` is `1`, `r` is `1`, `prefix_sum[r]` is not `0` and `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`**
