According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `A` is a list of `n` integers.
- `total_sum` is 0.
- `i` is 4.
- If `A[4] != 0`, the string '2' is printed. Otherwise, nothing changes.

To determine the new state at the start of the next iteration, we need to check the condition `i < n`:
1. `i` is currently 4.
2. For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.

Since `i` is 4, for the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than 4.

The state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `n` must be greater than 4.
- `A` remains a list of `n` integers.
- `total_sum` remains 0.
- `i` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 5.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` must be greater than 4, `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 5**
