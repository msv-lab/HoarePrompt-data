`k` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `k` was 3, so after incrementing, `k` becomes 4. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`prefix_sum[0]` is `0`, `prefix_sum[i]` for `i` from `1` to `n` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `a`, the sum of the first `n` elements of `a` is not `0`, `k` is `4`, `l` is `2`, `r` is `3`, and `prefix_sum[r]` is not `0` and not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`.**
