The code `print('2')` simply prints the string '2' to the console. This does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `A`, `total_sum`, and `i`. The only change is that the string '2' is printed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `A` is a list of `n` integers; `total_sum` is 0; `i` is 1; the string '2' is printed to the console.**
