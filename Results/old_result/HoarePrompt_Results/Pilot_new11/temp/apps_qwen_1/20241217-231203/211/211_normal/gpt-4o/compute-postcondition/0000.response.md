`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` is updated based on user input, and the list `A` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 (updated based on user input), and the list `A` consists of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^3 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^3.**
