Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Information
- The initial state before the loop starts is:
  - `prefix_sum[0]` is `0`
  - For `i` from `1` to `n`, `prefix_sum[i]` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `a`
  - The sum of the first `n` elements of `a` is not `0`
  - `k` is `1`
  - `l` is `1`

- The loop statement is:
  ```python
  for r in range(1, n + 1):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Analysis
1. **Range of `r`:**
   - The loop runs for `r` values from `1` to `n` inclusive.
   - This means `r` will take on values `1, 2, ..., n`.

2. **Initial Value of `r`:**
   - The loop starts with `r = 1` because `range(1, n + 1)` starts from `1`.

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `r` is within the specified range (`1` to `n`).

4. **States to Adjust:**
   - We need to ensure that the loop can start executing, i.e., `r` should start at `1`.
   - Since the loop starts with `r = 1`, no adjustment is needed for `r` itself.
   - However, we need to ensure that the condition `r` being in the range `1` to `n` holds true.

5. **Other Variables:**
   - `prefix_sum[0]` is `0`, which is fine for starting the loop.
   - `prefix_sum[i]` for `i` from `1` to `n` is already defined correctly.
   - The sum of the first `n` elements of `a` is not `0`, which ensures that there are valid values for `prefix_sum[i]` for all `i` from `1` to `n`.
   - `k` and `l` are set to `1`, which is fine for starting the loop.

### Conclusion
The only thing that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that `r` is within the range `1` to `n` when the loop starts. Since the loop starts with `r = 1`, this condition is inherently satisfied.

### Final State Adjustment
State: **`prefix_sum[0]` is `0`, `prefix_sum[i]` for `i` from `1` to `n` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `a`, the sum of the first `n` elements of `a` is not `0`, `k` is `1`, `l` is `1`, `r` is `1`**

This ensures that the loop can start executing with `r` at `1` and continue for values up to `n`.
