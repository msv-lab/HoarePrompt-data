The function `func` accepts a single integer `n` as its first parameter, which represents the number of elements in the array A. The function then takes an array A consisting of `n` integers as its second parameter, where each integer `a_i` satisfies the condition `-10^3 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^3`.

The output of the function depends on the processing of the array A, but since no specific output format or value is mentioned, we can infer that the function processes the array and returns a result based on the given constraints.

However, based on the given information alone, the parameters the function accepts are `n` (an integer representing the number of elements) and an array A (containing `n` integers). 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: an integer `n` representing the number of elements in the array A, and an array A consisting of `n` integers.**
