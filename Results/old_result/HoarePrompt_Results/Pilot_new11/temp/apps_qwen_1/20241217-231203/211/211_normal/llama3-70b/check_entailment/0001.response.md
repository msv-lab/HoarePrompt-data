Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to ensure that each subarray has a non-zero sum and that the subarrays, when concatenated, form the original array. Hereâ€™s a counterexample:

Consider the input:
```
3
-1 1 -1
```

The program outputs:
```
YES
1
1 3
```

However, this is incorrect because the entire array `[-1, 1, -1]` does not meet the requirement that each subarray's sum should be non-zero. The correct output should either be `NO` or split the array into subarrays with non-zero sums.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that each subarray has a non-zero sum. The current implementation does not check for this condition properly.
