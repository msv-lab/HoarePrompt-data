Postcondition: ***`prefix_sum[0]` is `0`, `prefix_sum[i]` for `i` from `1` to `n` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `a`, the sum of the first `n` elements of `a` is not `0`, `k` is `4`, `l` is `3`, `r` is `3`, and `prefix_sum[r]` is not `0` and not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`. Since the if condition `prefix_sum[r] != 0 and prefix_sum[r] != prefix_sum[n]` holds true, the values of `k` and `l` remain unchanged.***
