Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the program does not correctly handle the case where the array contains only zeros. According to the problem description, if it is not possible to split the array such that each subarray's sum is not zero, the output should be "NO". However, the current implementation only checks if the total sum of the array is zero and handles this case, but it fails to consider other cases where all elements are zero. For example, if the input is:

```
1
0
```

The program will output "YES" and provide a split, which is incorrect since no valid split exists according to the problem constraints. The annotated version confirms that the program only considers the total sum and does not properly handle the case where all elements are zero. Therefore, the original assessment of **False** is correct.
