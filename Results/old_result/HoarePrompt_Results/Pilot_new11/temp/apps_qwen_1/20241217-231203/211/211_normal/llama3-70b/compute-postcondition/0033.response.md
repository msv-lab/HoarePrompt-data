The code prints the values of `k`, `l`, and `n`. Given the initial state:
- `prefix_sum[0]` is `0`
- `prefix_sum[i]` for `i` from `1` to `n` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `a`
- The sum of the first `n` elements of `a` is not `0`
- `k` is `n+1`
- `l` is the largest index `r` such that `prefix_sum[r] != 0 and prefix_sum[r] != prefix_sum[n]`
- `r` is `n`

The code does not change the values of any variables but simply prints them. Therefore, the values printed will be:
- `k` is `n+1`
- `l` is the largest index `r` such that `prefix_sum[r] != 0 and prefix_sum[r] != prefix_sum[n]`
- `n` remains `n`

The output state after executing the code is:
Output State: **`k` is `n+1`, `l` is the largest index `r` such that `prefix_sum[r] != 0 and prefix_sum[r] != prefix_sum[n]`, `n` is `n`**
