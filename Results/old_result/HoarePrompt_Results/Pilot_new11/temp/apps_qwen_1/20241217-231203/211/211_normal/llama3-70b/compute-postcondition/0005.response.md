According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `prefix_sum[0]` is `p0`, and `prefix_sum[1]` is `p0 + a0`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. Additionally, for the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 1 (since `i` is now 1).

Therefore, we need to update the states accordingly.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `prefix_sum[0]` is `p0`, `prefix_sum[1]` is `p0 + a0`**
