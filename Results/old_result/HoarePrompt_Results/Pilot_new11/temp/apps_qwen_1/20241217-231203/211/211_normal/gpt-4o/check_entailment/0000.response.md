Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the array contains only zeros correctly. According to the problem description, if it is not possible to split the array such that each subarray's sum is not zero, the output should be "NO". However, the current implementation only checks if the total sum of the array is zero and handles this case, but it fails to consider other cases where all elements are zero. For example, if the input is:

```
1
0
```

The program will output "YES" and provide a split, which is incorrect since no valid split exists according to the problem constraints.
