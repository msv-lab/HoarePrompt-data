Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `i` is 2
- `prefix_sum[0]` is `p0`
- `prefix_sum[1]` is `p0 + a0`
- `prefix_sum[3]` is `(p0 + a0) + a2`

### Loop Analysis:
The for loop iterates over the range `range(n)` starting from the value of `i`. In the previous iteration, `i` was 2.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` must be greater than 1.

2. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the next iteration of the loop, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 3.

3. **Condition Check**:
   - We need to check if `i < n`.
   - Since `i` becomes 3, the condition `3 < n` must hold true for the loop to execute again.

4. **State Adjustments**:
   - `i` should be updated to 3.
   - `n` must still be greater than 3 because the loop continues as long as `i < n`.

5. **Prefix Sum Adjustments**:
   - The prefix sum array does not change within the loop based on the given information. Hence, we do not need to adjust the values of `prefix_sum[0]`, `prefix_sum[1]`, or `prefix_sum[3]`.

### Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- `n` must be greater than 3 (since `i` will be 3 and it needs to satisfy `i < n`)
- `i` is 3
- `prefix_sum[0]` is `p0`
- `prefix_sum[1]` is `p0 + a0`
- `prefix_sum[3]` is `(p0 + a0) + a2`

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `prefix_sum[0]` is `p0`, `prefix_sum[1]` is `p0 + a0`, `prefix_sum[3]` is `(p0 + a0) + a2`**
