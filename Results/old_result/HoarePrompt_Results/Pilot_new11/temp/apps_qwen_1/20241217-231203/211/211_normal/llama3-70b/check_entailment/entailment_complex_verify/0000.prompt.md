You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One spring day on his way to university Lesha found an array A. Lesha likes to split arrays into several parts. This time Lesha decided to split the array A into several, possibly one, new arrays so that the sum of elements in each of the new arrays is not zero. One more condition is that if we place the new arrays one after another they will form the old array A.

Lesha is tired now so he asked you to split the array. Help Lesha!


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of elements in the array A.

The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ( - 10^3 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^3) — the elements of the array A.


-----Output-----

If it is not possible to split the array A and satisfy all the constraints, print single line containing "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise in the first line print "YES" (without quotes). In the next line print single integer k — the number of new arrays. In each of the next k lines print two integers l_{i} and r_{i} which denote the subarray A[l_{i}... r_{i}] of the initial array A being the i-th new array. Integers l_{i}, r_{i} should satisfy the following conditions:  l_1 = 1  r_{k} = n  r_{i} + 1 = l_{i} + 1 for each 1 ≤ i < k. 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + a[i]
    if prefix_sum[n] == 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        k = 1
        l = 1
        for r in range(1, n + 1):
            if prefix_sum[r] != 0 and prefix_sum[r] != prefix_sum[n]:
                print(k, l, r)
                k += 1
                l = r
        print(k, l, n)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the entire array sums to zero correctly. According to the problem description, if the sum of the entire array is zero, it should output "NO". However, the current implementation only checks if `prefix_sum[n]` is zero and prints "NO" without considering other potential subarrays. 

For example, consider the input:
```
3
-1 1 -1
```

The sum of the entire array is zero, but the program would incorrectly print "YES" because it finds a subarray from index 1 to 2 whose sum is not zero, and then prints "YES" without checking the final condition. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements in all potential cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of elements in the array A. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-10^3 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^3) representing the elements of the array A.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + a[i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `prefix_sum[0]` is `0`, `prefix_sum[i]` for `i` from `1` to `n` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `a`.
    if (prefix_sum[n] == 0) :
        print('NO')
    else :
        print('YES')
        k = 1
        l = 1
        for r in range(1, n + 1):
            if prefix_sum[r] != 0 and prefix_sum[r] != prefix_sum[n]:
                print(k, l, r)
                k += 1
                l = r
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `prefix_sum[0]` is `0`, `prefix_sum[i]` for `i` from `1` to `n` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `a`, the sum of the first `n` elements of `a` is not `0`, `k` is `n+1`, `l` is the largest index `r` such that `prefix_sum[r] != 0 and prefix_sum[r] != prefix_sum[n]`, and `r` is `n`
        print(k, l, n)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`prefix_sum[0]` is 0, `prefix_sum[i]` for `i` from `1` to `n` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `a`. If `prefix_sum[n]` equals 0, then no changes are made. Otherwise, `k` is set to `n+1`, `l` is the largest index `r` such that `prefix_sum[r]` is neither 0 nor equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, and `n` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` and an array `A` of `n` integers from the standard input. It calculates the prefix sums of the array `A` and stores them in the list `prefix_sum`. After calculating the prefix sums, the function checks if the sum of the entire array `A` is zero. If it is zero, the function prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it finds the largest index `r` such that the prefix sum up to `r` is neither zero nor equal to the total sum of the array `A`. It then prints the starting and ending indices `k` and `l` for each subarray whose sum is non-zero and not equal to the total sum. The function finally prints `k` and `l` again for the entire array `A`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
1. If the input array `A` is empty (i.e., `n` is 0), the function does not handle this case. In practice, the function would need to check for this condition and possibly handle it appropriately.
2. The function assumes that the input values for `n` and the elements of `A` are within the specified ranges (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and -10^3 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^3). However, it does not validate these inputs, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the inputs are out of range.
3. The function correctly handles the case where the sum of the entire array `A` is zero, printing 'NO' and not finding any subarrays. This is correctly reflected in the postcondition.
4. The function correctly identifies the largest index `r` such that the prefix sum up to `r` is neither zero nor equal to the total sum of the array `A`. This ensures that the printed subarrays cover all valid segments.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
