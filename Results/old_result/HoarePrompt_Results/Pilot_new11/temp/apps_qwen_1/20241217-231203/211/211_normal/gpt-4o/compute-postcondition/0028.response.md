The code `break` does not affect any variables directly and simply breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or match-case statement. Since there is no such loop or match-case statement in the given code, it means the program would exit the context where it was expected (if there was one) and continue execution after that point. However, since the code snippet only contains `break` and no other operations, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 4, `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 5, and the output is '7 4'**
