The code `print(0)` simply prints the number 0 to the console and does not affect the values of any variables. The conditions and the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cnt1` is an input integer, `cnt2` is an input integer, `cnt3` is the value of `int(input())`, `cnt4` is the new input integer, the sum of `cnt1` and `cnt2` is not equal to the sum of `cnt3` and `cnt4`, or `cnt2` is less than `cnt3`.**
