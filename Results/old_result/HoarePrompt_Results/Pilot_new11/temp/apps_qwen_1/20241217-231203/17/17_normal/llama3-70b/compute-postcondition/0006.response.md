The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it expects four integers \(cnt_1\), \(cnt_2\), \(cnt_3\), and \(cnt_4\) to be provided, where each integer represents the count of specific string patterns: "(()", "()", ")(", and "))" respectively.

The output depends on the values of these counts. However, since the problem statement only describes the parameters and not the exact output logic, we can summarize the functionality based on the input parameters as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts four integer values \(cnt_1\), \(cnt_2\), \(cnt_3\), and \(cnt_4\), which represent the counts of the string patterns "(()", "()", ")(", and "))" respectively, and returns based on these counts.**
