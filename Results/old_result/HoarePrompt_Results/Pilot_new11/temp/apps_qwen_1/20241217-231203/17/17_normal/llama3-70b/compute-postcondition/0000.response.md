The code reads four integers from input, each representing the counts of different types of strings, and assigns them to the variables `cnt1`, `cnt2`, `cnt3`, and `cnt4`. After executing this code, the values of these four variables are set to the integers provided by the input. The other preconditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cnt1` is the first input integer, `cnt2` is the second input integer, `cnt3` is the third input integer, `cnt4` is the fourth input integer**
