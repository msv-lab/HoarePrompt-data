Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the condition that at least \( L \) coins from the gifts must be new in Ivan's collection. Let's consider the following example:

**Input:**
```
20 15 2 10
```

**Expected Output:**
Since Ivan already has 2 coins out of 20, his friends need to give him at least 10 new coins. To ensure that these 10 coins are new, each friend needs to give at least 2 coins (since \( 15 \times 2 = 30 \) and \( 30 - 2 = 28 \), which is more than 10 new coins).

However, the current implementation calculates `min_x` as `(L + M - 1) // M`, which results in `min_x = (10 + 15 - 1) // 15 = 1`. This means the program would suggest that each friend gives only 1 coin, which is insufficient because it would only provide 15 coins in total, out of which only 13 might be new (since Ivan already has 2 coins).

Therefore, the program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of coins each friend needs to give to satisfy all the conditions. Hence, the output for this specific input is incorrect, making the program incorrect.
