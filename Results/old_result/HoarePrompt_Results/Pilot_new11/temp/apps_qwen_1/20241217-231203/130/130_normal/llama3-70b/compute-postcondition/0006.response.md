The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly in the given code snippet. However, based on the constraints provided, the function seems to work with the variables $N$, $M$, $K$, and $L$. The function's behavior is defined by the conditions on these variables.

Given the constraints:
- $N$, $M$, $K$, and $L$ are integers.
- $1 \le K \le N \le 10^{18}$
- $1 \le M, \,\, L \le 10^{18}$
- $M \times \text{minimum number of coins each friend can gift} \ge L$

The output of the function is not specified in the problem statement. Based on the provided information, the function likely checks if the given conditions are met and returns a boolean value indicating whether the conditions are satisfied or not.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters directly but works with the variables \(N\), \(M\), \(K\), and \(L\) and returns a boolean value indicating if the conditions \(1 \le K \le N \le 10^{18}\), \(1 \le M, \,\, L \le 10^{18}\), and \(M \times \text{minimum number of coins each friend can gift} \ge L\) are satisfied.**
