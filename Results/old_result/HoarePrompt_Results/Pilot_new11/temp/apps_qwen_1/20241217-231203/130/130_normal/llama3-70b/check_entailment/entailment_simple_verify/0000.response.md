Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The annotated version confirms that the program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of coins one friend can gift to satisfy all the conditions. 

- The program checks if the total number of friends \(M\) is at least as large as the difference between the total number of different coins \(N\) and the number of coins Ivan already has \(K\), plus one additional coin to ensure at least \(L\) new coins. This ensures that all coins gifted are different.
- If this condition is met, it prints `1`, indicating that each friend needs to gift just one coin to satisfy the conditions.
- If the condition is not met, it prints `-1`.

The annotations support the correctness of the program by confirming that:
- The initial state of the variables \(N\), \(M\), \(K\), and \(L\) adheres to the specified constraints.
- The if-else block correctly evaluates the conditions and prints the appropriate output.

Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases based on the problem description and the provided annotations.
