The code prints `-1`. This does not affect the values of any variables, but it indicates that a specific condition was met which caused the print statement to execute. Therefore, the only change is the output of `-1`.

Output State: **`N`, `M`, `K`, `L` are integers such that 1 ≤ `K` ≤ `N` ≤ 10^18 and 1 ≤ `M`, `L` ≤ 10^18, and `M` * (`N` - `K`) ≥ `L`; `min_x` is `(L + M - 1) // M`, and `M * min_x > N - K`; `-1` is printed**
