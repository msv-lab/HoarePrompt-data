`mex` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `mex` is 1, so after executing `mex += 1`, the new value of `mex` will be 2. The states of the other variables (`a`, `n`, and `num`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `n` is an integer, `mex` is 2, and the current value of `num` is greater than or equal to 1.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers, `n` is an integer, `mex` is 2, and the current value of `num` is greater than or equal to 1**
