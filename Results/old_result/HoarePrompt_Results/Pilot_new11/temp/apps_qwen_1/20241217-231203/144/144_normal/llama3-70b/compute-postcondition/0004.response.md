According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in the list `arr`. For the loop to execute, `arr` must contain at least one element. The initial value of `mex` (minimum excluded) is given as 1.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Check `arr`:** Since the loop iterates over each element in `arr`, `arr` must have at least one element for the loop to execute.
2. **Check `mex`:** The value of `mex` is initially set to 1. This does not affect the condition for the loop to execute directly but is relevant for understanding the context within the loop body.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state such that `arr` contains at least one element.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least one element, `mex` is 1**
