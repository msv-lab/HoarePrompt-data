The line of code `mex = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `mex`. This does not affect the values of `a` or `n`. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `mex` and retains the initial values of `a` and `n`.

Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is an integer, `mex` is 1**
