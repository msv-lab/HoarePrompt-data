Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of elements `n` and the list of integers `a` from the input. It handles the constraints specified (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000 and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).

2. **Sorting**: The list `a` is sorted in ascending order using `a.sort()`. Sorting helps in easily finding the missing smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the list.

3. **Finding Mex**: 
   - The variable `mex` is initialized to 1, which is the smallest non-negative integer.
   - A loop iterates through each element `num` in the sorted list `a`.
   - If `num` is greater than or equal to `mex`, it means `mex` is not missing from the list, so `mex` is incremented by 1.
   - The loop ensures that the first value of `mex` that is not found in the list `a` is identified, which is the maximum possible value of `mex`.

4. **Output**: The program prints the value of `mex`, which is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the list.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If all elements in the list are distinct and cover all integers up to the highest element, `mex` will be `highest_element + 1`.
   - If there are gaps in the sequence, `mex` will be the smallest gap.

Given these points, the program correctly calculates the maximum possible value of `mex` for any valid input as per the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
