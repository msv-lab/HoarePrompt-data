Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least one element, `mex` remains 1, and if `num` is greater than 1, then no change is made to `mex` and `num`. Since there is no else part, `mex` and `num` remain unchanged when `num` is not greater than 1.***
