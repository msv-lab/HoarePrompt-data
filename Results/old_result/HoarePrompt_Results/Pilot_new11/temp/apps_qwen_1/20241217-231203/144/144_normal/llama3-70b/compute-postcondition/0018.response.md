The `mex` variable is incremented by 1. Since `mex` was either 1 or 2, after adding 1, `mex` will be either 2 or 3. The states of the other variables (`n` and `arr`) are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is the current element from the list `arr`, `arr` is the list after removing one element, `mex` is either 2 or 3**
