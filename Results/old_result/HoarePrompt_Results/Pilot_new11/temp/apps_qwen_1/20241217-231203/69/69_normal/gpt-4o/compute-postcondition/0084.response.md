The code `current_x += 1` increments the value of `current_x` by 1. The initial value of `current_x` is determined based on `operations[1]`. Since the exact value of `operations[1]` is not provided, we'll denote it as `initial_current_x`. After the increment, the new value of `current_x` will be `initial_current_x + 1`.

All other variables remain unchanged according to the given code snippet.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `current_x` is `initial_current_x + 1`, `current_y` is determined based on `operations[1]`, `target_pos` is (`current_x` + `dx`, `current_y` + `dy`), `min_length` is either unchanged or updated to the minimum of its current value and `1 - position_map[target_pos]`, and `position_map` contains the key-value pair `((current_x, current_y), 1).`**
