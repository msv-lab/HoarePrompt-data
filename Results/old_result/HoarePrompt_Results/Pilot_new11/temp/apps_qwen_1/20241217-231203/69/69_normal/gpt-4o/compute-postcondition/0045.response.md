The given code initializes a dictionary `position_map` with a key `(0, 0)` and assigns the value `-1`. This does not affect any of the previously mentioned variables (`current_y`, `n`, `operations`, `x`, `y`, `final_x`, `final_y`, `dx`, `dy`, `min_length`, `current_x`). Therefore, the only change is in the `position_map` itself.

Output State: **`current_y` is 0; `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `operations` is a string consisting of `n` characters each being 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R'; `x` and `y` are integers such that \(-10^9 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\); `final_x` is the sum of the contributions of 'R' and 'L' operations to the x-coordinate; `final_y` is the sum of the contributions of 'U' and 'D' operations to the y-coordinate; `x` and `y` are the final positions after executing all operations in `operations`; `dx` is equal to `x - final_x`; `dy` is equal to `y - final_y`; `min_length` is `inf`; `current_x` is 0; `position_map` is {(0, 0): -1}.**
