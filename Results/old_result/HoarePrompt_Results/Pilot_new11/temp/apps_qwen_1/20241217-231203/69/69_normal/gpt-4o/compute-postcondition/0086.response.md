Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1. Depending on the condition of `operations[i]`, `current_x` and `current_y` are updated accordingly. Specifically, if `operations[i]` equals 'L', then `current_x` is `current_x - 1`, otherwise `current_x` is `initial_current_x + 1`. `current_y` is determined based on `operations[1]`, `target_pos` is (`current_x` + `dx`, `current_y` + `dy`), `min_length` is either unchanged or updated to the minimum of its current value and `1 - position_map[target_pos]`, and `position_map` contains the key-value pair `((current_x, current_y), 1).`***
