`final_x` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `final_x` was 1 if the next operation character `op` is 'R', otherwise it was 0. After decrementing, if the next operation character `op` is 'R', `final_x` will be 0, otherwise it will be -1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `operations` is a string consisting of `n` characters each being 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` and `y` are integers such that \(-10^9 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\), `final_x` is 0 if the next operation character `op` is 'R', otherwise `final_x` is -1, `final_y` is 1 if the next operation character `op` is 'U', otherwise `final_y` is -1 if the next operation character `op` is 'D'**
