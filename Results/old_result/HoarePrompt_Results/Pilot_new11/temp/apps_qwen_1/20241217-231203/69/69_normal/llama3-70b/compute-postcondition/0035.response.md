Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer input from the user, `sequence` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` and `y` are integers input from the user, `ops` must have at least three characters, and if `op == 'R'`, `ux` is updated to `ux + 1` and `uy` is based on the last processed character. If `op == 'L'`, then `ux` is updated to `ux - 1` and `uy` remains unchanged.***
