Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `operations` is a string consisting of `n` characters each being 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` and `y` are integers such that \(-10^9 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\). Depending on the next operation character `op`:
- If `op` is 'U', `final_x` is 1 if the original `final_x` was 1 and 0 if the original `final_x` was 0, and `final_y` is 2 if the original `final_y` was 2 and 0 if the original `final_y` was 0.
- If `op` is 'D', `final_x` is -1 and `final_y` is -1 if the original `final_y` was -1, and `final_y` is -2 if the original `final_y` was 0.***

This postcondition summarizes both the if and else parts, taking into account the possible outcomes of the if statement based on the value of `op`.
