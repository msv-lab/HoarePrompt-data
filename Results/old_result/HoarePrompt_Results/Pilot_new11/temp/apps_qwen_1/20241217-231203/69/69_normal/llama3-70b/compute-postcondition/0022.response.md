The code subtracts 1 from `uy`. The value of `uy` was not specified in the initial state, but since it is updated based on the last processed character, we only know that `uy` is decreased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user, `sequence` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` and `y` are integers input from the user, `ops` is a string that must have at least two characters, `uy` is decreased by 1.**
