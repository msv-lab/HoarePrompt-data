`current_y` is incremented by 1. The value of `current_x` remains unchanged as the code only affects `current_y`. All other variables are not directly impacted by this line of code.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `current_x` is determined based on `operations[1]`, `current_y` is increased by 1, `target_pos` is (`current_x` + `dx`, `current_y` + `dy`), `min_length` is either unchanged or updated to the minimum of its current value and `1 - position_map[target_pos]`, and `position_map` contains the key-value pair `((current_x, current_y), 1)`.**
