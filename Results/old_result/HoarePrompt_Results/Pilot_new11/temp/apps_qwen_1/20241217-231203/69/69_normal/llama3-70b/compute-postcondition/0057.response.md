The code `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. Given the initial state, `res` was 0, so now it will be 1. The other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user, `sequence` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` and `y` are integers input from the user, `ops` must be a non-empty string, `ux` is the final value of horizontal movement (sum of all 'R' and 'L' movements), `uy` is the final value of vertical movement (sum of all 'U' and 'D' movements), `dx` is `x - ux`, `dy` is `y - uy`, `res` is 1, and `dx` is greater than or equal to 0 or `dy` is less than or equal to 0, and the operation `op` is not 'L' or `dx` is greater than 0**.
