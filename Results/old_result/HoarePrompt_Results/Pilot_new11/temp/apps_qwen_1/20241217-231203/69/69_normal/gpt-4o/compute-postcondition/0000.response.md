The code initializes `final_x` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `operations`, `x`, `y`, or their relationships. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `operations` is a string consisting of n characters each being 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', and `x`, `y` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9; `final_x` is 0.**
