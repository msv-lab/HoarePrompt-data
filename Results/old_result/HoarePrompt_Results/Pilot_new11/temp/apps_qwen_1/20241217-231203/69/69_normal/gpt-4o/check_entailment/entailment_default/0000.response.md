Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case. Specifically, the code fails to consider the scenario where the target position \((x, y)\) cannot be reached from any previously visited position, leading to `min_length` remaining infinity and the function returning `-1`. This is a critical oversight because the problem description requires the program to handle such cases properly and return `-1` if it's impossible to reach the target position.

To illustrate, let's consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  3
  RUR
  100 100
  ```

The robot starts at \((0, 0)\), and the operations sequence is "RUR". After performing these operations, the robot ends up at \((1, 1)\). Given the target position \((100, 100)\), the target cannot be reached by any subsequence of the given operations. The code will not detect this and will incorrectly return a non-negative value, failing to recognize that the target is unreachable.

This oversight indicates that the code does not meet the requirements for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
