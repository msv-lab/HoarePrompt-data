Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `current_x` and `current_y` are updated based on `operations[2]`, `target_pos` is `current_x + dx, current_y + dy`, `min_length` is the minimum of its current value and 1, and `position_map` contains the key-value pair `((current_x, current_y), 1)`.***
