`dx` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `dx` is its previous value plus 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `ops` must be a non-empty string, `op` is the current operation being processed, `dx` is the updated value of horizontal movement (`dx + 1`), `dy` is the updated value of vertical movement, and `res` is 0.

Output State: **`ops` must be a non-empty string, `op` is the current operation being processed, `dx` is `dx + 1`, `dy` is the updated value of vertical movement, and `res` is 0**
