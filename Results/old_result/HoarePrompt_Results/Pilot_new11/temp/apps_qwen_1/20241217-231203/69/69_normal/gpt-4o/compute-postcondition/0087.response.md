Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, and `current_x` and `current_y` are updated based on the condition of `operations[i]`. If `operations[i]` is 'D', then `current_y` is decreased by 1, `min_length` is either unchanged or updated to the minimum of its current value and `1 - position_map[target_pos]`, and `position_map` contains the key-value pair `((current_x, current_y - 1), 1)`. If `operations[i]` is 'L', then `current_x` is updated to `current_x - 1` or `initial_current_x + 1` (depending on the condition), `current_y` is determined based on `operations[1]`, `target_pos` is (`current_x` + `dx`, `current_y` + `dy`), `min_length` is either unchanged or updated to the minimum of its current value and `1 - position_map[target_pos]`, and `position_map` contains the key-value pair `((current_x, current_y), 1).`***
