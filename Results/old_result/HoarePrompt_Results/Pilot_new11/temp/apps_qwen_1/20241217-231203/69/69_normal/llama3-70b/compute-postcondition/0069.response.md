Postcondition: ***`ops` is a non-empty string, `op` is the current operation being processed. If `op` is 'R' and `dx` is greater than 0, then `dx` is updated to `dx - 1`. Otherwise, if `op` is 'L' and `dx` is less than 0, then `dx` is updated to `dx + 1` and `res` is 0. Otherwise, `res` is 1. The values of `dy` and `res` depend on the execution path taken.***
