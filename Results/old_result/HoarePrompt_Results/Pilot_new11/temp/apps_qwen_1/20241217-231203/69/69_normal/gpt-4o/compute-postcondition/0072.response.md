Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `current_x` is 2, `current_y` is determined based on `operations[1]`, `target_pos` is (`current_x` + `dx`, `current_y` + `dy`), `min_length` is unchanged, `position_map` contains the key-value pair `((current_x, current_y), 1)`. Since the if condition `operations[i] == 'R'` is the only condition specified and the else part is none, the postcondition remains as the one from the if part.***
