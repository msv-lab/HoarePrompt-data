`dy` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `dy` is less than or equal to 0 if the next operation in the string `ops` is 'U', otherwise it remains unchanged. Since no other variables are affected by this line of code, their values remain the same.

Output State: **`ops` is a non-empty string, `op` is the next operation in the string, `dx` is the updated value of horizontal movement (less than or equal to 0 if 'R', otherwise unchanged), `dy` is the updated value of vertical movement reduced by 1 (less than or equal to -1 if 'U', otherwise less than or equal to the original value), and `res` is 0.**
