Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer input from the user, `sequence` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` and `y` are integers input from the user, `ops` must have at least three characters, and depending on the value of `op`:
- If `op == 'U'`, `uy` is increased by 1.
- If `op == 'D'`, `uy` is decreased by 1.
- If `op == 'R'`, `ux` is updated to `ux + 1` and `uy` is based on the last processed character.
- If `op == 'L'`, `ux` is updated to `ux - 1` and `uy` remains unchanged.***
