Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. If `operations[i]` equals 'D', then `current_y` is decreased by 1. If `operations[i]` equals 'L', then `current_x` is set to -1. If `operations[i]` equals 'R', then `current_x` is set to 1. In any other case, the values of `current_x` and `current_y` remain unchanged.***
