Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the given problem. Here are the reasons why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Final Coordinates:**
   - The program calculates the final coordinates `final_x` and `final_y` by iterating through the operations string once. However, it does not check whether the initial sequence of operations actually leads to the desired final coordinates `(x, y)`. It should first verify if the initial sequence of operations leads to the required `(x, y)` or not.

2. **Missing Initial Verification:**
   - The program should first check if the initial sequence of operations already leads to the desired `(x, y)`. If it does, it should return `0` immediately without further processing. If it doesn't, it should proceed to find the minimal subsequence to change.

3. **Dynamic Programming or Brute Force Approach:**
   - The approach used in the program (using a map to store visited positions and calculating the minimum length) is correct, but the initial verification step is missing. This means that the program might not handle cases where the initial sequence already reaches the desired coordinates.

4. **Example Analysis:**
   - Consider the first example: `5 RURUU -2 3`.
     - The initial sequence is `RURUU`, and it should be modified to `LULUU` to reach `(-2, 3)`.
     - The program should return `3` because the minimum subsequence to change is `RUU` to `LUU`.
   - In the second example: `4 RULR 1 1`.
     - The initial sequence `RULR` already reaches `(1, 1)`, so the correct answer should be `0`.
   - In the third example: `3 UUU 100 100`.
     - The initial sequence `UUU` cannot reach `(100, 100)`, so the correct answer should be `-1`.

Given these points, the program is missing the initial verification step, which makes it incomplete and potentially incorrect for certain cases. Therefore, the program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description.

To fix this, the program should include an initial check to see if the initial sequence already leads to the desired coordinates, and if not, then proceed with the dynamic programming approach.
