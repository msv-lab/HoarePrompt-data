`final_x` is incremented by 1, so its new value is 1. The values of `n`, `operations`, `x`, `y`, `final_y`, `op`, and their initial conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `operations` is a string consisting of n characters each being 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', and `x`, `y` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9; `final_x` is 1; `final_y` is 0; `x` and `y` are initialized to 0; `op` is the current operation character in the loop; `op` is 'R'; `final_x` and `final_y` remain unchanged.**
