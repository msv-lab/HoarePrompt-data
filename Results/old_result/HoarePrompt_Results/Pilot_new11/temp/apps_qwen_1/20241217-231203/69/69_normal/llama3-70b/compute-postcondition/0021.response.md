`uy` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `uy` is unknown. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer input from the user, `sequence` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` and `y` are integers input from the user, `ops` is a string that must have at least two characters, `ux` and `uy` are integers updated based on the last processed character; `uy` is increased by 1.
