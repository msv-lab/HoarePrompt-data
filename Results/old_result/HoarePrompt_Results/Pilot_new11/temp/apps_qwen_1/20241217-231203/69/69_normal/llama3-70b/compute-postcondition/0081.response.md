Postcondition: ***`ops` is a non-empty string, `op` is the next operation in the string. `dx` and `dy` are updated as follows: 
- If `op` is 'U' and `dy` is greater than 0, then `dy` is reduced by 1.
- Otherwise, if `op` is 'D' and `dy` is less than 0, `dy` is incremented by 1.
- If `op` is 'R' and `dx` is greater than 0, `dx` is decremented by 1.
- Otherwise, if `op` is not 'L' or `dx` is not less than 0, `dx` is incremented by 1.
- `res` remains 0 if `dx` is unchanged or incremented, and becomes 1 if `dx` is decremented.***
