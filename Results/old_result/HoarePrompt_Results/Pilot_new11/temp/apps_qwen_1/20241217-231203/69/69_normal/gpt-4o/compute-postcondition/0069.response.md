`current_y` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `current_y` is determined by `operations[1]`, so after subtracting 1, the new value of `current_y` is `operations[1] - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `current_x` is determined based on `operations[1]`, `current_y` is `operations[1] - 1`, `target_pos` is (`current_x` + `dx`, `current_y` + `dy`), `min_length` is unchanged, `position_map` contains the key-value pair `((current_x, current_y), 1)`**
