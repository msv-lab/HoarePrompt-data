`uy` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `uy` is 0, so after executing `uy -= 1`, the value of `uy` becomes -1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer input from the user, `sequence` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` and `y` are integers input from the user, `ops` is a string that must have at least one character, `ux` is 0, `uy` is -1, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, the character `op` is 'D'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user, `sequence` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` and `y` are integers input from the user, `ops` is a string that must have at least one character, `ux` is 0, `uy` is -1, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, the character `op` is 'D'**
