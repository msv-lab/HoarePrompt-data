The code `dx -= 1` decreases the value of `dx` by 1. Given the precondition that `dx` is `x - ux` and `dx` is greater than or equal to 0, after subtracting 1 from `dx`, the new value of `dx` will be `x - ux - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user, `sequence` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` and `y` are integers input from the user, `ops` must be a non-empty string, `ux` is the final value of horizontal movement (sum of all 'R' and 'L' movements), `uy` is the final value of vertical movement (sum of all 'U' and 'D' movements), `dx` is `x - ux - 1`, `dy` is `y - uy`, `res` is 0, `dx` is now greater than or equal to 0 (since it was originally greater and we only decreased it by 1), and the current operation `op` is 'R' with `dx` still greater than 0**.
