`ux` is decremented by 1. The other variables (`n`, `sequence`, `x`, `y`, `ops`, and `uy`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer input from the user, `sequence` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` and `y` are integers input from the user, `ops` must have at least three characters, `ux` is the original value of `ux` minus 1, and `uy` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user, `sequence` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` and `y` are integers input from the user, `ops` must have at least three characters, `ux` is the original value of `ux` - 1, and `uy` remains unchanged.**
