The code `target_pos = current_x + dx, current_y + dy` assigns the tuple `(current_x + dx, current_y + dy)` to the variable `target_pos`. This does not change the values of `current_x` or `current_y`, but it creates the `target_pos` variable with the calculated coordinates.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `current_x` and `current_y` are determined based on `operations[1]`, `target_pos` is (`current_x` + `dx`, `current_y` + `dy`), `min_length` is unchanged, and `position_map` contains the key-value pair `((current_x, current_y), 1).`
