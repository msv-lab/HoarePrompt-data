Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\); `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\); `bits` is a list containing the indices of the bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `n` with the length of `bits` exactly equal to `k`; the last element of `bits` is the result of repeatedly subtracting 2 from the original `smallest` until the length of `bits` reaches `k`.**
