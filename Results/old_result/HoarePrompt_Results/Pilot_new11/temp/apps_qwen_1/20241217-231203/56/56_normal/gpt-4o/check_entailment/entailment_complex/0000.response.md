Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of why it adheres to the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the input as a string and processes it correctly to extract `n` and `k`. This part is handled via the `sys.stdin.read()` method.

2. **Initial Validation**:
   - The program checks if `k` is greater than `n`. If so, it returns 'No', which correctly handles the case where the number of required integers (`k`) cannot satisfy the sum condition (`n`).

3. **Bit Manipulation**:
   - It converts `n` into its binary representation and collects the indices of the bits set to 1 in the `bits` list. This ensures that the indices correspond to the exponents needed to achieve the sum `n` when using powers of 2.

4. **Length Check**:
   - The program checks if the number of set bits in `n` is less than `k`. If so, it returns 'No', ensuring that there are enough bits to form the required sequence.

5. **Adjustment to Meet Length Requirement**:
   - If the length of `bits` is less than `k`, the program ensures that the last element of `bits` is adjusted by repeatedly subtracting 2 from it until the length of `bits` equals `k`. This step guarantees that the largest integer in the sequence is minimized while maintaining the required sum.

6. **Sorting and Output**:
   - Finally, the `bits` list is sorted in reverse order to ensure the sequence is lexicographically largest. The program then outputs 'Yes' followed by the sequence of integers.

### Edge Cases Considered:
- **Case Where `k` is Greater Than `n`**: The program correctly returns 'No'.
- **Case Where Number of Set Bits is Less Than `k`**: The program also correctly returns 'No'.
- **Case Where Exact Length of Set Bits Equals `k`**: The program processes these cases by simply sorting the `bits` list in reverse order and outputs the result.

In summary, the program correctly handles all scenarios as described in the problem statement, making it **correct**.
