Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed explanation of why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input correctly using `sys.stdin.read`, splits it into `n` and `k`, and calls the function `func_1` with these values. This handles the input according to the problem description.

2. **Initial Validation**: 
   - The program checks if `k > n`. If this condition is true, it immediately returns `'No'`. This ensures that if `k` is greater than `n`, the program correctly identifies that no valid sequence exists.
   - After this check, the program proceeds to process `n` and `k` further.

3. **Binary Representation Analysis**:
   - The program converts `n` into its binary representation by finding the indices of the bits set to 1. This step correctly identifies the positions of the powers of 2 that sum up to `n`.

4. **Handling Bit Length**:
   - The program checks if the number of bits (`len(bits)`) is greater than `k`. If it is, it returns `'No'`, indicating that it's not possible to form a sequence of length `k` that sums to `n`.

5. **Ensuring Sequence Length**:
   - If the number of bits is less than `k`, the program appends additional elements to the `bits` list to ensure the length of `bits` is exactly `k`. It does this by appending `smallest - 1` twice to the list, ensuring the sequence is extended while maintaining the lexicographically largest order.

6. **Sorting and Output**:
   - Finally, the program sorts the `bits` list in reverse order to get the lexicographically largest sequence and returns `'Yes'` followed by the sequence as a space-separated string.

### Summary:
- The program correctly checks the initial conditions and constraints.
- It processes the binary representation of `n` to identify the necessary powers of 2.
- It extends the sequence to meet the length requirement `k` while maintaining the lexicographically largest order.
- The final output is formatted correctly to meet the problem's requirements.

Thus, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all cases as required.
