Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Conditions**: 
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\).
   - `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\).
   - `smallest` is `smallest - 1`.
   - `bits` is a list containing the indices of the bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `n` with the last element removed and now contains `smallest - 1` as its last element, and its length is less than `k` + 1.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   ```python
   while len(bits) < k:
   ```

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as the length of `bits` is less than `k`.

4. **Current State**:
   - `len(bits)` is less than `k`.

5. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `len(bits) < k` must remain true.
   - Since the loop increments the length of `bits` during its execution, we need to ensure that the length of `bits` is still less than `k` at the start of the next iteration.

6. **Ensuring the Loop Continues**:
   - The only way to ensure that the length of `bits` remains less than `k` is to ensure that the length of `bits` is currently less than `k - 1`.
   - Therefore, the length of `bits` must be exactly `k - 1` at the end of the current iteration.

7. **Final State**:
   - `n` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\).
   - `k` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\).
   - `smallest` is `smallest - 1`.
   - `bits` is a list containing the indices of the bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `n` with the last element removed and now contains `smallest - 1` as its last element, and its length is exactly `k - 1`.

**Answer**:
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\), `smallest` is `smallest - 1`, `bits` is a list containing the indices of the bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `n` with the last element removed and now contains `smallest - 1` as its last element, and its length is exactly `k - 1`**.
