You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Jamie is preparing a Codeforces round. He has got an idea for a problem, but does not know how to solve it. Help him write a solution to the following problem:

Find k integers such that the sum of two to the power of each number equals to the number n and the largest integer in the answer is as small as possible. As there may be multiple answers, you are asked to output the lexicographically largest one. 

To be more clear, consider all integer sequence with length k (a_1, a_2, ..., a_{k}) with $\sum_{i = 1}^{k} 2^{a_{i}} = n$. Give a value $y = \operatorname{max}_{1 \leq i \leq k} a_{i}$ to each sequence. Among all sequence(s) that have the minimum y value, output the one that is the lexicographically largest.

For definitions of powers and lexicographical order see notes.


-----Input-----

The first line consists of two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5) — the required sum and the length of the sequence.


-----Output-----

Output "No" (without quotes) in a single line if there does not exist such sequence. Otherwise, output "Yes" (without quotes) in the first line, and k numbers separated by space in the second line — the required sequence.

It is guaranteed that the integers in the answer sequence fit the range [ - 10^18, 10^18].


-----Examples-----
Input
23 5

Output
Yes
3 3 2 1 0 

Input
13 2

Output
No

Input
1 2

Output
Yes
-1 -1 



-----Note-----

Sample 1:

2^3 + 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0 = 8 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 23

Answers like (3, 3, 2, 0, 1) or (0, 1, 2, 3, 3) are not lexicographically largest.

Answers like (4, 1, 1, 1, 0) do not have the minimum y value.

Sample 2:

It can be shown there does not exist a sequence with length 2.

Sample 3:

$2^{-1} + 2^{-1} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1$

Powers of 2:

If x > 0, then 2^{x} = 2·2·2·...·2 (x times).

If x = 0, then 2^{x} = 1.

If x < 0, then $2^{x} = \frac{1}{2^{-x}}$.

Lexicographical order:

Given two different sequences of the same length, (a_1, a_2, ... , a_{k}) and (b_1, b_2, ... , b_{k}), the first one is smaller than the second one for the lexicographical order, if and only if a_{i} < b_{i}, for the first i where a_{i} and b_{i} differ.
Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().strip().split()
n = int(data[0])
k = int(data[1])
print(func_1(n, k))

def func_1(n, k):
    if k > n:
        return 'No'
    bits = []
    for i in range(60, -1, -1):
        if n >> i & 1:
            bits.append(i)
    if len(bits) > k:
        return 'No'
    while len(bits) < k:
        smallest = bits.pop()
        bits.append(smallest - 1)
        bits.append(smallest - 1)
    bits.sort(reverse=True)
    return 'Yes\n' + ' '.join(map(str, bits))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the number of bits required to represent `n` is less than `k`. Specifically, if the number of set bits in the binary representation of `n` is less than `k`, the program incorrectly returns "No" without attempting to fill the remaining positions with `-1`.

For example, consider the input:
```
1 3
```
The correct output should be:
```
Yes
-1 -1 0
```
However, the program will return "No" because it checks if the number of bits is greater than `k`, which is not the correct condition to check.

To fix this, the program should attempt to fill the remaining positions with `-1` if the number of bits is less than `k`. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().strip().split()
n = int(data[0])
k = int(data[1])

def func_1(n, k):
    if k > n.bit_length():
        return 'No'
    bits = []
    for i in range(60, -1, -1):
        if n >> i & 1:
            bits.append(i)
    while len(bits) < k:
        bits.append(-1)
    bits.sort(reverse=True)
    return 'Yes\n' + ' '.join(map(str, bits))

print(func_1(n, k))
```

This version correctly handles the case where the number of bits required to represent `n` is less than `k` by filling the remaining positions with `-1`.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().strip().split()
n = int(data[0])
k = int(data[1])
print(func_1(n, k))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, and k is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5.
def func_1(n, k):
    if (k > n) :
        return 'No'
        #The program returns 'No'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, k is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5, and k is less than or equal to n
    bits = []
    for i in range(60, -1, -1):
        if n >> i & 1:
            bits.append(i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\), `bits` is a list containing the indices of the bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `n`.
    if (len(bits) > k) :
        return 'No'
        #The program returns 'No'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\), `bits` is a list containing the indices of the bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `n`. The length of `bits` is less than or equal to `k`
    while len(bits) < k:
        smallest = bits.pop()
        
        bits.append(smallest - 1)
        
        bits.append(smallest - 1)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\); `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\); `bits` is a list containing the indices of the bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `n` with the length of `bits` exactly equal to `k`; the last element of `bits` is the result of repeatedly subtracting 2 from the original `smallest` until the length of `bits` reaches `k`.
    bits.sort(reverse=True)
    return 'Yes\n' + ' '.join(map(str, bits))
    #'Yes\n' followed by a space-separated list of integers contained in the variable 'bits'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\) and `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\). The function checks if the number of set bits (1s) in the binary representation of `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.

1. If `k` is greater than `n`, the function immediately returns 'No'.
2. Otherwise, it creates a list `bits` containing the indices of the bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `n`.
3. If the length of `bits` is greater than `k`, the function returns 'No'.
4. If the length of `bits` is less than `k`, the function repeatedly modifies the list by appending the previous value of the smallest index in `bits` minus 1, until the length of `bits` equals `k`.
5. Finally, the list `bits` is sorted in reverse order, and the function returns 'Yes' followed by a space-separated list of integers contained in the variable `bits`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function correctly handles the case where `k` is greater than `n` by returning 'No'.
- The function correctly handles the case where the number of set bits in `n` is less than `k` by returning 'No'.
- The function ensures that the last element of `bits` is the result of repeatedly subtracting 2 from the original `smallest` until the length of `bits` reaches `k`, which is a unique aspect of the function.

After the function concludes, the state of the program is that `n` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, and the function returns either 'No' or 'Yes' followed by a space-separated list of integers contained in the variable `bits`, where `bits` contains the indices of `k` set bits from `n` sorted in reverse order.
