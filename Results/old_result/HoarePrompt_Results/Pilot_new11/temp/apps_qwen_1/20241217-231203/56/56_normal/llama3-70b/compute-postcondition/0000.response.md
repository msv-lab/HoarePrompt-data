`n` and `k` are assigned the values obtained from `input().split()`, which converts the input into integers. The values of `n` and `k` are now specific integers within the given ranges (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5). The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^5**
