The code `x = n.bit_length() - 1` calculates the bit length of `n` and subtracts 1 from it. The bit length of `n` is the number of bits required to represent `n` in binary form. Since `n` must be greater than \(2^x\), the bit length of `n` will be one more than the exponent `x` when `n` is represented as a power of 2.

Given that `n > 2^x`, the bit length of `n` is `x + 1`. Subtracting 1 from the bit length gives us `x`.

Therefore, after executing the code, `x` will be set to the value of `n.bit_length() - 1`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than \(2^x\); `x` is `n.bit_length() - 1`**
