Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle cases where the required sequence has negative elements. For example, consider the input `1 2`. The correct output should be `Yes -1 -1` because \(2^{-1} + 2^{-1} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1\). However, the current implementation only considers non-negative exponents and thus would incorrectly output `No` for this case.
