The code `break` does not assign any new values to the variables. It simply breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the values of `n` and `x` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the loop or if statement.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `x` is `n.bit_length() - 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
