The code `bits.append(smallest - 1)` appends the value of `smallest - 1` to the list `bits`. Given that `smallest` is the last element of `bits` before popping, we know that `smallest` is the last element in `bits` right before this operation.

Since `smallest` is the last element of `bits` before popping, the value of `smallest` is one more than the last element of `bits` after the pop operation. However, since the exact value of `smallest` is not provided, we can denote it as `last_element + 1`, where `last_element` is the last element of `bits` after the pop operation.

After appending `smallest - 1` to `bits`, the new last element of `bits` is `smallest - 1`.

Therefore, the updated state of the variables is:
- `n` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\).
- `k` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\).
- `smallest` remains the last element of `bits` before popping.
- `bits` now contains the indices of the bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `n`, with the last element being `smallest - 1` (where `smallest` is the last element of `bits` before the pop operation).

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\); `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\); `smallest` is the last element of `bits` before popping; `bits` is a list containing the indices of the bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `n` with the last element being `smallest - 1`.**
