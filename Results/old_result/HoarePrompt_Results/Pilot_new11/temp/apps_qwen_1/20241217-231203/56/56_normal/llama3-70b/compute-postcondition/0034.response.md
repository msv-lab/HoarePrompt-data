The code `print('Yes')` simply prints the string 'Yes' to the console. This does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is 0, `a` is a list containing the first `k` elements of its original list, `i` is -1, the length of `a` is exactly `k`.**
