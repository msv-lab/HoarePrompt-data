`subtasks_solved` is increased by the value of `max_subtasks_for_this_task`. The value of `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is the next element in the list `t`. Therefore, `subtasks_solved` becomes the current value of `subtasks_solved` plus the next element in the list `t`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` has at least one element, `subtasks_solved` is increased by the next element in the list `t`, `remaining_time` is 0, and `subtask_time` is the next element in the list `t`**
