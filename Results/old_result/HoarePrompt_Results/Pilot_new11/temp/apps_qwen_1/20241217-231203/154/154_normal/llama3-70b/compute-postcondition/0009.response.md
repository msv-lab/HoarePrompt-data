Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `k` is a valid integer within the range 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, `M` must be at least 1, `t` is a sorted list of integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(k+1) x (M+1)` where `dp[1][j]` is 1 for all `j` such that `1 ≤ j ≤ M` and `j >= t[0]` if `j >= t[i-1]`, and all other elements of `dp` are 0.**
