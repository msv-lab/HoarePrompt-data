Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The program attempts to use dynamic programming to determine the maximum number of non-overlapping intervals that can fit into a segment of length `M`, but it fails to account for the fact that completing a task gives an additional point if all subtasks are solved. Additionally, the program does not correctly handle the scenario where completing a task is beneficial compared to just solving individual subtasks. The output hints suggest that the program focuses on non-overlapping intervals rather than the total points Polycarp can earn by completing tasks. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
3 4 11
1 2 3 4
```
The correct solution would be to complete the first task (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 minutes, 5 points) and then solve one more subtask (e.g., the first subtask of the second task, which takes 1 minute, earning 1 more point, totaling 6 points). However, the program does not account for this strategy and instead calculates the maximum number of non-overlapping intervals, leading to an incorrect result.
