The code updates the `remaining_time` variable to `M - time_used`. The `remaining_time` is initially `non-zero` and must be greater than or equal to the smallest element in `t`. Given that `time_used` is `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, the updated `remaining_time` is calculated as `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is a list of `k` positive integers, `subtasks_solved` is 1, `remaining_time` is `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is unchanged, `max_points` is the maximum of its current value and `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `time_used` is `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`**
