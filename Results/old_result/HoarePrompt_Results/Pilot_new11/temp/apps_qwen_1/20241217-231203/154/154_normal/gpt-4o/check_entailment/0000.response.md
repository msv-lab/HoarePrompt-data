Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the scenario where solving additional subtasks after completing some tasks might yield more points. Specifically, the program calculates the maximum points by considering only the points from completed tasks and the subtasks solved from the remaining time without fully exploring the possibility of solving subtasks from multiple tasks optimally.

For instance, consider the following input:

```
4 3 10
2 3 5
```

- If Polycarp completes 2 tasks fully, he gets \(2 \times (3 + 1) = 8\) points and spends \(2 \times (2 + 3 + 5) = 16\) minutes, which exceeds the available 10 minutes.
- Instead, Polycarp could complete 1 task fully (3 + 1 = 4 points) and spend 10 minutes solving 2 subtasks from another task (2 out of 3 subtasks, since \(10 - 8 = 2\) minutes are left and each subtask takes 2 minutes). This would give him a total of \(4 + 2 = 6\) points, which is the maximum possible.

The current implementation does not account for this optimal strategy, hence it is incorrect.
