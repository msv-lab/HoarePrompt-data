Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `max_points` is `max(0, complete_tasks * (k + 1) + min(subtasks_solved, (n - complete_tasks) * k))`
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 45\)
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 45\)
- `M` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq M \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\)
- `t` is a list of `k` positive integers where each element `t_j` satisfies \(1 \leq t_j \leq 1000000\)
- `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in list `t`
- `time_used` is greater than `M`
- `points` is `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`
- `remaining_time` is the remaining time after processing all subtasks
- `subtasks_solved` is updated to the minimum of its current value and \((n - complete_tasks) \cdot k\)
- `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is the maximum number of subtasks solved for the last task

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for complete_tasks in range(n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `complete_tasks` from 0 to `n` inclusive.
2. **Increment of `complete_tasks`**: At the start of each iteration, `complete_tasks` increases by 1.
3. **Range of `complete_tasks`**: Since `complete_tasks` starts from 0 and goes up to `n`, if `complete_tasks` is currently at `i`, then for the next iteration, it will be `i + 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `complete_tasks` is at some value `i`.
- `complete_tasks` needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

### Adjusted States:
- `complete_tasks` will be updated to `i + 1`.
- The other states remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by the increment of `complete_tasks`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`max_points` is `max(0, (i + 1) * (k + 1) + min(subtasks_solved, (n - (i + 1)) * k))`, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 45\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 45\), `M` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq M \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\), `t` is a list of `k` positive integers where each element `t_j` satisfies \(1 \leq t_j \leq 1000000\), `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in list `t`, `time_used` is greater than `M`, `points` is `(i + 1) * (k + 1)`, `remaining_time` is the remaining time after processing all subtasks, `subtasks_solved` is updated to the minimum of its current value and \((n - (i + 1)) \cdot k\), and `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is the maximum number of subtasks solved for the last task.**

Note: The exact values of `max_points`, `points`, `remaining_time`, and `subtasks_solved` depend on the specific values of the variables at the end of the previous iteration, but the general form of these states is as stated above.
