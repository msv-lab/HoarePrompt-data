Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program seems to correctly implement the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why:

1. **Dynamic Programming Table Initialization**: The `dp` table is initialized with dimensions `(k+1) x (M+1)` where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum number of points that can be earned using up to `i` subtasks within `j` minutes.

2. **Filling the DP Table**: The nested loops iterate over the number of subtasks (`i`) and the remaining time (`j`). For each combination, it updates the `dp` table based on whether including the current subtask would increase the score or not.

3. **Result Calculation**: The final result is calculated by summing up the maximum points for all possible subtask counts (`i` from 0 to `k`) within the given time `M`, and adding the extra point for completing all subtasks of a task.

The logic appears sound and covers all cases as described in the problem statement. There are no obvious flaws or edge cases that the program does not handle, and it follows the problem constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
