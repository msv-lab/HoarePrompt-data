Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where completing additional subtasks after completing some tasks might yield more points than just completing more tasks. Specifically, the program does not consider the scenario where solving more subtasks from partially completed tasks could result in more points.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3 4 15
1 2 3 4
```

- According to the problem description, the optimal strategy might involve completing the first task fully (10 minutes, 5 points) and then using the remaining 5 minutes to solve more subtasks from the second and third tasks.
- However, the current implementation only considers completing tasks fully or not at all, which might not yield the maximum points in this scenario.

To illustrate, let's manually calculate the optimal solution:
- Complete the first task (10 minutes, 5 points).
- Use the remaining 5 minutes to solve subtasks from the second and third tasks:
  - From the second task: 1 + 2 = 3 minutes (2 points)
  - From the third task: 1 + 2 = 3 minutes (2 points)

Total points: 5 (from the first task) + 2 (from the second task) + 2 (from the third task) = 9 points.

The program, however, would only consider completing the first task and solving subtasks from the remaining time, which results in fewer points. Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly.
