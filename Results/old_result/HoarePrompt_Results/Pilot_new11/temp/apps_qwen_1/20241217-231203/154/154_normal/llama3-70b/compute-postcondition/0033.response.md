Output State: **`i` is 46, `k` is a valid integer within the range \(1 \leq k \leq 45\), `M` is a non-negative integer, `t` is a sorted list of integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions \((k+1) \times (M+1)\). For every pair \((i', j)\) where \(1 \leq i' \leq 46\) and \(1 \leq j \leq M\), `dp[i'][j]` is the maximum number of non-overlapping intervals of length `t[i'-1]` that can fit into a segment of length `j`, starting from `dp[1][1]` up to `dp[46][M]`.**
