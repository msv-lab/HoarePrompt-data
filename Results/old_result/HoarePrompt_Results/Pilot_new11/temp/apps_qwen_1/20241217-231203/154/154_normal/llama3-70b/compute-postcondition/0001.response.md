The code `t = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from input and converts each integer to a list element. This affects the variable `t` but does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, or `M`. 

Since the input values for `n`, `k`, and `M` are not provided in the code execution, we cannot determine their specific values after the code runs. However, we know that `t` will now contain the integers split from the input line.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 45, `k` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, `M` is an input integer within the range 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9, `t` is a list of integers read from input and converted to integers**.
