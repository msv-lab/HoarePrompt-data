You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp takes part in a math show. He is given n tasks, each consists of k subtasks, numbered 1 through k. It takes him t_{j} minutes to solve the j-th subtask of any task. Thus, time required to solve a subtask depends only on its index, but not on the task itself. Polycarp can solve subtasks in any order.

By solving subtask of arbitrary problem he earns one point. Thus, the number of points for task is equal to the number of solved subtasks in it. Moreover, if Polycarp completely solves the task (solves all k of its subtasks), he recieves one extra point. Thus, total number of points he recieves for the complete solution of the task is k + 1.

Polycarp has M minutes of time. What is the maximum number of points he can earn?


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integer numbers n, k and M (1 ≤ n ≤ 45, 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9).

The second line contains k integer numbers, values t_{j} (1 ≤ t_{j} ≤ 1000000), where t_{j} is the time in minutes required to solve j-th subtask of any task.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum amount of points Polycarp can earn in M minutes.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4 11
1 2 3 4

Output
6

Input
5 5 10
1 2 4 8 16

Output
7



-----Note-----

In the first example Polycarp can complete the first task and spend 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 minutes. He also has the time to solve one subtask of the second task in one minute.

In the second example Polycarp can solve the first subtask of all five tasks and spend 5·1 = 5 minutes. Also he can solve the second subtasks of two tasks and spend 2·2 = 4 minutes. Thus, he earns 5 + 2 = 7 points in total.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k, M) = map(int, input().split())
    t = list(map(int, input().split()))
    t.sort()
    dp = [[0] * (M + 1) for _ in range(k + 1)]
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        for j in range(1, M + 1):
            dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]
            if j >= t[i - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1)
    print(sum((dp[i][M] for i in range(k + 1))) + sum((1 for i in range(k + 1) if dp[i][M] == i)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program seems to correctly implement the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. Here’s a breakdown of why:

1. **Dynamic Programming Table Initialization**: The `dp` table is initialized with dimensions `(k+1) x (M+1)` where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum number of points that can be earned using up to `i` subtasks within `j` minutes.

2. **Filling the DP Table**: The nested loops iterate over the number of subtasks (`i`) and the remaining time (`j`). For each combination, it updates the `dp` table based on whether including the current subtask would increase the score or not.

3. **Result Calculation**: The final result is calculated by summing up the maximum points for all possible subtask counts (`i` from 0 to `k`) within the given time `M`, and adding the extra point for completing all subtasks of a task.

The logic appears sound and covers all cases as described in the problem statement. There are no obvious flaws or edge cases that the program does not handle, and it follows the problem constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `M` (where `M` is an integer such that 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9), and a list `t` of `k` integers (each integer in `t` is such that 1 ≤ t_j ≤ 1000000). The function first reads these inputs and sorts the list `t`. It then uses dynamic programming to calculate a 2D list `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum number of non-overlapping intervals of length `t[i-1]` that can fit into a segment of length `j`. After the dynamic programming process, the function calculates the total number of non-overlapping intervals across all segments of length `M` and counts how many of those intervals have the same index as their value in `dp`. Finally, the function prints the sum of these two values.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
