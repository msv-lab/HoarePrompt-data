Postcondition: ***`t` has at least one element, `subtasks_solved` is increased by the next element in the list `t`, and `subtask_time` is the next element in the list `t`. If `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`, then these updates occur. Otherwise, the values of `subtasks_solved` and `subtask_time` remain unchanged.***
