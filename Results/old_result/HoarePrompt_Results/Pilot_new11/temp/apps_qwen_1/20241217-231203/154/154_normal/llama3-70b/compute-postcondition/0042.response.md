The code updates the value of `dp[i][j]` based on the previous value of `dp[i][j]` and `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`. The initial state is that `j` is `1` and `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i][0]`.

Given this, let's calculate the new value of `dp[i][j]`:

1. Initially, `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i][0]`.
2. The code sets `dp[i][j]` to the maximum of its current value (`dp[i][0]`) and the value of `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`.

Since `j` is `1`, `dp[i][j]` is updated to `max(dp[i][0], dp[i - 1][1 - t[i - 1]] + 1)`.

- `j` remains `1`.
- `dp[i][j]` is updated to `max(dp[i][0], dp[i - 1][1 - t[i - 1]] + 1)`.

The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`j` is `1`; `dp[i][j]` is `max(dp[i][0], dp[i - 1][1 - t[i - 1]] + 1)`**
