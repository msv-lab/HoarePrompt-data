The code snippet sorts the list `t`. Since `t` was a list of integers, sorting it will rearrange the elements in ascending order. The values of `n`, `k`, and `M` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the sorting operation.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 45, `k` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, `M` is an input integer within the range 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9, `t` is a sorted list of integers**
