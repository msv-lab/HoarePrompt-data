`remaining_time` is decreased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time`. The initial state is such that `t` has at least one element, `subtasks_solved` is increased by the next element in the list `t`, `remaining_time` is 0, and `subtask_time` is the next element in the list `t`. Since `remaining_time` is initially 0, subtracting any value from it will make it 0 (or remain 0 if the value is 0). Therefore, `remaining_time` becomes 0 after the operation.

Output State: **`remaining_time` is 0, `subtasks_solved` is increased by the next element in the list `t`, and `subtask_time` is the next element in the list `t`**
