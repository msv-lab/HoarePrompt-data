According to the given for loop statement:

```
for j in range(1, M + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Let's break down the requirements for the loop to execute:

1. The loop starts with `j` being 1.
2. The loop continues as long as `j` is less than or equal to `M`.
3. After each iteration, `j` is incremented by 1.

Given that the loop has already completed its iterations, we need to determine the final state of `j` and `M`.

Since the loop has completed its iterations, `j` must have reached the value of `M + 1`. This is because the loop runs from 1 up to but not including `M + 1`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted (or more accurately, verified) is the final value of `j`, which should be `M + 1`.

However, since the problem statement says "No adjustment needed as the loop has completed its iterations," we can infer that the loop indeed ran successfully and `j` ended up being `M + 1`.

So, the final state after the loop completes is:

State: **`j` is `M + 1`**

But since no adjustments were needed according to the problem statement, we can confirm that the initial state was correct and the loop executed as expected.
