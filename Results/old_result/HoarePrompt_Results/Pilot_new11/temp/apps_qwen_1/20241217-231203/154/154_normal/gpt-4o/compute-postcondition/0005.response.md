The code `break` is used to exit a loop or the most nested block it is within. In this case, there is no loop or conditional block being exited explicitly by the `break` statement. Therefore, the variables `max_points`, `n`, `k`, `M`, `t`, `total_time_per_task`, and `time_used` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`max_points` is 0, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 45\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 45\), `M` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq M \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\), `t` is a list of `k` positive integers where each element `t_j` satisfies \(1 \leq t_j \leq 1000000\), `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in list `t`, `time_used` is greater than `M`.**
