`max_subtasks_for_this_task` is assigned the value of `remaining_time` divided by `subtask_time` using integer division (`//`). This means the value of `max_subtasks_for_this_task` will be the quotient of the division of `remaining_time` by `subtask_time`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`; `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is the quotient of `remaining_time` divided by `subtask_time`**
