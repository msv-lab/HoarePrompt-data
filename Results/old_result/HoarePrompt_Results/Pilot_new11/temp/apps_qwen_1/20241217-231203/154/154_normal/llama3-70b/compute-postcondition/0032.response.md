Postcondition: **`i` is 46; `k` is a valid integer within the range \(1 \leq k \leq 45\); `M` is at least 1; `t` is a sorted list of integers; `dp[46][j]` is either `dp[46][j - 1]` or updated to `max(dp[46][j], dp[45][j - t[45]] + 1)` depending on whether `j \geq t[i - 1]`. `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions \((k+1) \times (M+1)\); `j` is \(j_{next} = j_{prev} + 1\) where \(j_{next} \geq t[45]\) leads to `dp[46][j_{next}]` being updated, otherwise it remains unchanged.**
