`subtasks_solved` is incremented by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`. The value of `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is the quotient of `remaining_time` divided by `subtask_time`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`; `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is the quotient of `remaining_time` divided by `subtask_time`; `subtasks_solved` is increased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`.

Output State: **`remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`; `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is the quotient of `remaining_time` divided by `subtask_time`; `subtasks_solved` is increased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`**
