Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variable**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `subtask_time`, which iterates over the list `t`.

2. **Determine the Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `max_points` is 0.
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 45\).
   - `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 45\).
   - `M` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq M \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\).
   - `t` is a list of `k` positive integers where each element `t_j` satisfies \(1 \leq t_j \leq 1000000\).
   - `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in list `t`.
   - `time_used` is greater than `M`.
   - `points` is `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`.
   - `remaining_time` is \((M - time\_used) - ((M - time\_used) // s) \times subtask\_time\) or `M - time_used` if `remaining_time < subtask_time`.
   - `subtasks_solved` is `subtasks_solved + (M - time_used) // s` if `remaining_time >= subtask_time`.
   - `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is \((M - time_used) // s\) if `remaining_time >= subtask_time`.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each `subtask_time` in the list `t`.

4. **Update States After One Iteration**:
   - Since the loop iterates over each `subtask_time` in the list `t`, the next `subtask_time` will be the current value of `subtask_time` plus one position in the list.
   - Therefore, `subtask_time` will change to the next value in the list `t`.

5. **Adjust Other Relevant States**:
   - `remaining_time` and `subtasks_solved` will be updated based on the new `subtask_time`.
   - `time_used` might change if `subtask_time` is used up within `remaining_time`.

Given the above analysis, we need to adjust the states for the next iteration of the loop.

**State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
- `max_points` remains 0.
- `n` remains as it is.
- `k` remains as it is.
- `M` remains as it is.
- `t` remains as it is, but the next `subtask_time` will be the next element in the list.
- `total_time_per_task` remains as it is.
- `time_used` might change but is not specified to change directly in the loop.
- `points` remains as it is.
- `remaining_time` will be recalculated based on the new `subtask_time`.
- `subtasks_solved` will be updated based on the new `remaining_time`.
- `max_subtasks_for_this_task` will be updated based on the new `remaining_time`.

Therefore, the relevant states to adjust are `subtask_time` and `remaining_time`.

**State: **`max_points` is 0, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 45\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 45\), `M` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq M \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\), `t` is a list of `k` positive integers where each element `t_j` satisfies \(1 \leq t_j \leq 1000000\), `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in list `t`, `time_used` is greater than `M`, `points` is `complete_tasks * (k + 1)\), `remaining_time` is recalculated for the next `subtask_time`, `subtasks_solved` is updated based on the new `remaining_time`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is updated based on the new `remaining_time`.
