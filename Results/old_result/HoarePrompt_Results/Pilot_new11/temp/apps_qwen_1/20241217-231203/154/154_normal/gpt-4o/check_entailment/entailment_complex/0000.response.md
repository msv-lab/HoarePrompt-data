Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed explanation of why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the input correctly, splitting the input into the necessary variables `n`, `k`, `M`, and the list `t`. This is done using the `sys.stdin.read` method followed by splitting the string and converting the relevant parts to integers.

2. **Function Logic:**
   - The function `func_1` iterates over the number of complete tasks from 0 to `n`. For each iteration, it calculates the time used to complete these tasks (`complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`) and checks if this exceeds the available time `M`. If it does, the loop breaks.
   - For each complete task, the function calculates the points earned as `(k + 1)` and the remaining time after accounting for the time used.
   - The function then iterates over the subtasks, determining how many subtasks can be solved with the remaining time and updating the `subtasks_solved` count accordingly.
   - The function ensures that the maximum points are updated based on the points from completed tasks plus the points from solved subtasks.

3. **Output:**
   - The function returns `max_points`, which is the maximum number of points that can be earned within the given time constraint.

### Why the Program Meets the Problem Description:
- **Correct Calculation of Points:**
  - The function correctly accounts for both the points earned from completely solving tasks and the points earned from solving individual subtasks.
  - It uses the correct formula for calculating the total time per task and ensures that the number of subtasks solved is limited by the remaining time.

- **Time Constraint Handling:**
  - The function properly handles the time constraint `M` by breaking the outer loop when the time used exceeds `M`.

- **Iterative Approach:**
  - The program iteratively tries different numbers of completely solved tasks and calculates the optimal number of subtasks to solve within the remaining time, ensuring that it finds the maximum possible points.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement for all valid inputs, thus meeting the requirements and the constraints specified.
