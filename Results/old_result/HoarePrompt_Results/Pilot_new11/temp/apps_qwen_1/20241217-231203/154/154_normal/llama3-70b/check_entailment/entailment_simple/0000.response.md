Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the given problem. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of how the program meets the problem description:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads three integers \(n\), \(k\), and \(M\) from the input and a list of \(k\) integers representing the times \(t_j\).
   - The input parsing part matches the problem description's requirement for input.

2. **Sorting the Time List:**
   - The list \(t\) is sorted. Sorting is necessary to ensure that the dynamic programming approach works optimally by considering the shortest subtask times first.

3. **Dynamic Programming Table Initialization:**
   - A 2D list `dp` is initialized with dimensions \((k+1) \times (M+1)\). Each entry `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum number of points Polycarp can earn using the first \(i\) subtasks within \(j\) minutes.

4. **Filling the DP Table:**
   - The nested loops fill the `dp` table by considering each subtask \(i\) and each possible time \(j\). The key idea is to either include the current subtask in the solution or skip it, depending on whether it fits within the remaining time.
   - The transition in the DP table ensures that the maximum points are considered by checking both including and excluding the current subtask.

5. **Calculating the Result:**
   - The final result is calculated by summing up the points from the `dp` table and adding the extra points for fully completing tasks.
   - The summation `sum(dp[i][M] for i in range(k + 1))` calculates the total points earned by considering all subtasks.
   - The additional `sum(1 for i in range(k + 1) if dp[i][M] == i)` accounts for the extra points earned by completing all subtasks of tasks where the `dp[i][M]` value equals \(i\).

Given that the program accurately follows the steps described in the problem statement and the logic is sound, it correctly computes the maximum number of points Polycarp can earn within the given time limit \(M\). Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
