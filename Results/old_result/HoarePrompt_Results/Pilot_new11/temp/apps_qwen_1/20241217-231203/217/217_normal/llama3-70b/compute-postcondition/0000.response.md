The code reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. However, since no input is provided in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact value of `n`. The length of the list `a` remains unchanged, and its elements remain unspecified.

Output State: **n is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies -100 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.**
