The function `func` accepts a list of integers `a` of length `n` (where `1 ≤ n ≤ 100`) and each integer in the list satisfies `-100 ≤ a_i ≤ 100`. After sorting the list in descending order, the function calculates the sum of elements at even indices (`b`) and the sum of elements at odd indices (`c`). Finally, it prints the difference between these two sums (`b - c`). The function does not return any value; instead, it only prints the result of `b - c`.
