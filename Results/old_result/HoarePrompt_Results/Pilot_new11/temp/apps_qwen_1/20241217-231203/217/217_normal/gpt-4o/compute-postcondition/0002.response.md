The code initializes `B` to the sum of all positive integers in the list `a`. Let's assume the input for `a` is a list of integers split by spaces. The value of `n` is not affected by this code, and the list `a` remains unchanged. We need to consider the possible values of `a` to determine the value of `B`.

For example, if `a` is `[1, -2, 3, -4, 5]`, then `B` would be `1 + 3 + 5 = 9`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input from standard input, `a` is a list of integers inputted and split by spaces; B is the sum of all positive integers in the list `a`.**
