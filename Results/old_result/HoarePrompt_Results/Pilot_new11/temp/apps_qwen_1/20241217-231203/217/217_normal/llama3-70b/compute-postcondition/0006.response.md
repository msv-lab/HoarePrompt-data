`b` is assigned the value of `b + a[i]`. Since `i` is even and the initial state of `i` is 0 (an even number), `i` remains 0 after the code execution. However, the value of `a[i]` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of `b` without knowing `a[0]`. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 is unaffected by this code.

Output State: **`i` is 0; `b` is `b + a[0]`; `n` must be greater than 0**
