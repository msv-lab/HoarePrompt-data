The `print(result)` statement outputs the value of `result`, which is already defined as `B - C`. The code does not change any variables except to print the current value of `result`. Therefore, the output state remains the same in terms of variable values, but the value of `result` is printed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input from standard input, `a` is a list of integers inputted and split by spaces; `B` is the sum of all positive integers in the list `a`; `C` is the sum of all negative integers in the list `a`; `result` is `B - C`, and the value of `result` is printed.**
