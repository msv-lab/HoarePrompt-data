The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to determine and return information based on the value of `n`, which is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), representing the number of players participating in the tournament.

However, since no specific output conditions or cases are provided in the prompt, we can only state that the function will use the value of `n` to derive its return value within the specified range.
