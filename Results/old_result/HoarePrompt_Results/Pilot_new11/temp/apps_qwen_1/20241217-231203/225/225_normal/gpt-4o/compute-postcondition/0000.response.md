The code initializes a set `vowels` containing the vowels 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', and 'Y'. The variable `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters and does not exceed 100 characters in length, and it contains only the characters 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', and 'Y'.

After running the code, the value of `s` remains unchanged, and the set `vowels` is initialized with the specified vowels. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, and the length of `s` does not exceed 100; `vowels` is a set containing {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}.**
