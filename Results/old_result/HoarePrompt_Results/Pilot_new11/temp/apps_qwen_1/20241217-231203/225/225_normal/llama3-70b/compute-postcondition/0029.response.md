Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s`, `max_jump` is the maximum value of `i - last_vowel` // 2 + 1 encountered during the loop (with `i - last_vowel` being even), `last_vowel` is the index of the last vowel found in the string, `i` is `n`. If `last_vowel` is not equal to `n - 1`, `max_jump` is updated to the maximum value of `max(max_jump, (n - last_vowel) // 2 + 1)`. If `last_vowel` equals `n - 1`, no change is made to `max_jump`.***
