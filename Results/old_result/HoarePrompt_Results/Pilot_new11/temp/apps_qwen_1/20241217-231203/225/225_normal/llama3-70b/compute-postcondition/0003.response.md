The code initializes the variable `max_jump` to 0. This does not affect the values of `s`, `vowels`, or `n`. The length of the string `s` remains unchanged, and `max_jump` is now 0.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100; `vowels` is 'AEIOUY'; `n` is the length of `s`; `max_jump` is 0**
