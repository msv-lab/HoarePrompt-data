The code assigns the value of `i` (which is 2) to `last_vowel`. The previous value of `last_vowel` is 1 if `s[1]` is a vowel, and remains unchanged if `s[1]` is a consonant. Since `i` is assigned to `last_vowel`, `last_vowel` now holds the value of `i`, which is 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is 2, `max_jump` is either 2 or 3 depending on whether `s[1]` is a consonant or not, `last_vowel` is 2.**
