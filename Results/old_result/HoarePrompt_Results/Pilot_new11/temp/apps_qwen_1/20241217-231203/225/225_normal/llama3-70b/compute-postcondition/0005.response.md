State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s`, `max_jump` is 0, `last_vowel` is -1, `i` is 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop runs based on the value of `n`, which is the length of the string `s`.
2. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 (since `range(n)` includes values from 0 to `n-1`).
3. The variable `i` should start at 0 for the loop to begin its first iteration.
4. Other variables (`vowels`, `max_jump`, `last_vowel`) do not affect the condition under which the loop starts, so they remain as given.

Thus, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to set `i` to 0. All other given states are already sufficient conditions for the loop to start.
