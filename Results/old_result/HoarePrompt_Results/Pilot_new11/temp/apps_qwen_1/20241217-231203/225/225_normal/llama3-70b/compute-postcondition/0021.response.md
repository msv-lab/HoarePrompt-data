The value of `i` is 2, and `max_jump` is either 1 or 2. After executing `max_jump = max(max_jump, i + 1)`, we need to compare the current value of `max_jump` with `i + 1`, which is `2 + 1 = 3`. Since `3` is greater than `1` (or `2`), `max_jump` will be updated to `3`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is 2, `max_jump` is 3, `last_vowel` is 1 if `s[1]` is a vowel, and remains unchanged if `s[1]` is a consonant.**
