Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum jump ability required for the Grasshopper to reach the end of the string, jumping only on vowels. The function `func_1` iterates through the string, tracking the positions of vowels and updating the maximum jump distance accordingly. After completing the iteration, it ensures that the maximum jump distance is updated to include the distance from the last vowel to the end of the string if necessary. This approach handles all potential cases where the string contains vowels and where it does not. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, and there are no obvious edge cases or scenarios where the program fails to meet the problem description.
