Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the minimum jump ability required for the Grasshopper to jump from the beginning of the string to the end, only landing on vowels. The logic in the `func_1` function iterates through the string, tracking the maximum jump length needed between vowels. This approach ensures that the program works correctly for all potential cases, as it considers the distance between each pair of consecutive vowels and updates the maximum jump length accordingly. Since there are no edge cases or inputs that this program fails to handle as described, the program is correct.
