The code snippet initializes a string `vowels` containing the vowels 'AEIOUY'. This does not affect the value of `s`, which remains as the input string. The output state should reflect this.

Output State: **the input is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, with a length not exceeding 100; `s` is the input string; `vowels` is 'AEIOUY'**
