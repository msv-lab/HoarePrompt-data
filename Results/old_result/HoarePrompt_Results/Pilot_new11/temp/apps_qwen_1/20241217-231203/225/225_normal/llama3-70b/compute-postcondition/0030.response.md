The code `print(max_jump)` simply prints the value of `max_jump`. Since the value of `max_jump` was determined in the loop, it does not change after this print statement. The other variables (`s`, `vowels`, `n`, `last_vowel`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s`, `max_jump` is the maximum value of `i - last_vowel` // 2 + 1 encountered during the loop (with `i - last_vowel` being even), `last_vowel` is the index of the last vowel found in the string, `i` is `n`, and `max_jump` is printed.**
