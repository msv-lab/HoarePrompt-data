Let's go through the code step-by-step:

1. The initial state is given as follows:
   - `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100.
   - `vowels` is 'AEIOUY'.
   - `n` is the length of `s`.
   - `max_jump` is the maximum value of `i - last_vowel` // 2 + 1 encountered during the loop (with `i - last_vowel` being even).
   - `last_vowel` is the index of the last vowel found in the string.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `last_vowel` is not equal to `n - 1`.

2. The code snippet updates `max_jump` as follows:
   ```python
   max_jump = max(max_jump, (n - last_vowel) // 2 + 1)
   ```

3. At the start of the code, `i` is equal to `n`. Since `i` is not used in the code snippet and does not get updated, its value remains `n`.

4. The line `max_jump = max(max_jump, (n - last_vowel) // 2 + 1)` updates `max_jump` to be the maximum of its current value and `(n - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`.

5. Given that `last_vowel` is not equal to `n - 1`, the term `(n - last_vowel)` is guaranteed to be a positive integer.

6. The expression `(n - last_vowel) // 2 + 1` calculates a new potential value for `max_jump`. This value depends on the difference between `n` and `last_vowel`.

7. After this assignment, `max_jump` will be the maximum value between its current value and the new value calculated from `(n - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s`, `max_jump` is the maximum value of `max(max_jump, (n - last_vowel) // 2 + 1)` encountered, `last_vowel` is the index of the last vowel found in the string, `i` is `n`, and `last_vowel` is not equal to `n - 1`.**
