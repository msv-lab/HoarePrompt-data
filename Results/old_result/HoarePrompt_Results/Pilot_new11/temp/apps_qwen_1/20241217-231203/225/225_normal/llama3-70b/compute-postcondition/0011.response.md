Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s`, `max_jump` is 1, `last_vowel` is -1 or a vowel, `i` is 0, the current value of `s[i]` is a vowel***

This postcondition summarizes both the if and else parts, ensuring that `max_jump` is set to 1 if `last_vowel` is -1 (i.e., the first character is a vowel), and `last_vowel` is set to the index of the current vowel if the condition `last_vowel == -1` is false.
