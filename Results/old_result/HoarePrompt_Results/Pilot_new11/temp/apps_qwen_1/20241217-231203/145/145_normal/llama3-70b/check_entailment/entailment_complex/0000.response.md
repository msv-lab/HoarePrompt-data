Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` and a string of `n` digits as input. This matches the required input format.
   - The string of digits is converted into a list of integers using `list(map(int, input()))`. This ensures that the input is processed as a list of integers, which is necessary for summing the digits.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if the total sum of the digits in the ticket is even. If the sum is odd, it immediately returns `False`, ensuring that the ticket cannot be split into segments with equal sums.
   - If the sum is even, it calculates the target sum as half of the total sum.
   - The function then iterates through the digits of the ticket, maintaining a running sum (`curr_sum`). Whenever `curr_sum` equals the target sum, it increments the segment count (`segments`) and resets `curr_sum`.
   - After processing all digits, the function returns `True` if there are at least two segments where the sum of digits equals the target sum, otherwise it returns `False`.

3. **Output Handling:**
   - Based on the result of `func_1`, the program prints "YES" if the ticket is lucky and "NO" otherwise. This matches the required output format.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge cases as described:
     - If the sum of the digits is odd, the function returns `False`.
     - If the number of digits is less than 2, the function returns `False` because the condition `segments >= 2` cannot be met.
     - If the ticket contains fewer than 2 segments, the function returns `False`.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description and handles all specified edge cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
