The value of `segment_count` is incremented by 1. Initially, `segment_count` is 2, so after the increment, `segment_count` becomes 3. The states of the other variables (`i`, `current_sum`, and `segment_length`) are not affected.

Output State: **`i` must be less than `n`, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 3, and `segment_length` is 1.**
