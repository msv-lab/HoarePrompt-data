Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the ticket is lucky. Specifically:

1. The code only checks if the total sum of the digits is even and then tries to split the ticket into segments such that the sum of each segment is exactly half of the total sum. However, this approach is incomplete because it does not ensure that the ticket can be divided into multiple non-intersecting segments with equal sums.

2. The code fails to consider cases where the ticket can be split into multiple segments with different sums that are equal to each other but not necessarily half of the total sum. For example, the ticket `350178` can be divided into segments `350`, `17`, and `8` with sums `8`, `8`, and `8` respectively, which are equal but not half of the total sum.

3. The function `func_1` only checks for a single target sum (half of the total sum) and does not explore other possible segmentations that could result in equal sums.

To illustrate, consider the ticket `350178`. The code would fail to recognize this as a lucky ticket because it only checks for segments whose sum is half of the total sum, but it can actually be divided into segments `350`, `17`, and `8` with equal sums `8`.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case and hence is incorrect.
