Postcondition: ***`i` is less than `n`, `current_sum` equals `target_sum`, `segment_count` is 1, and `segment_length` is 1, and `current_sum` is 0.*** 

Explanation: Since the else part is not provided, we assume that if the condition `current_sum == target_sum` is true, then the postcondition will be as described in the if part. There are no alternative conditions to consider, so the overall postcondition is simply the condition that triggers the if statement.
