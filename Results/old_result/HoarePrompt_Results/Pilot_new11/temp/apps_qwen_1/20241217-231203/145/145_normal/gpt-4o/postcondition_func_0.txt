The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` (an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and `ticket` (a string consisting of `n` digits where each digit is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive). It checks if there exists a way to split the `ticket` into segments such that the sum of the digits in each segment is equal, and if more than one such segment can be formed. If such a split is possible, the function returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO'. The function iterates over all possible segment lengths from 1 to `n-1`, calculates the target sum for each segment length, and then checks if the ticket can be split into segments with that sum. If a valid split is found, it returns 'YES'. If no valid split is found after checking all possible segment lengths, it returns 'NO'. Potential edge cases include when `n` is exactly 2, where the function would need to check if the digits in `ticket` are equal. The function also covers the case where the sum of the entire ticket cannot be evenly divided among segments, which would result in a return of 'NO'.
