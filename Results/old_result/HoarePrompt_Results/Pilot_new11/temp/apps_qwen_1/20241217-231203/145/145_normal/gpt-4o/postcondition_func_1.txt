The function `segment_sum` accepts two parameters `start` and `end`, which are non-negative integers such that `0 ≤ start ≤ end < len(ticket)`. The parameter `ticket` is a string consisting of `n` digits where `2 ≤ n ≤ 100` and `0 ≤ int(digit) ≤ 9` for each digit in the string. The function calculates and returns the sum of the digits in the string `ticket` from index `start` to index `end` inclusive. 

The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has returned an integer value representing the sum of the specified range of digits in the `ticket` string. Potential edge cases include when `start` or `end` are at the boundaries of the string, or when `start` equals `end`, in which case only one digit is summed. If `start` is greater than `end`, the function will still execute correctly and return the sum of the specified range, though this is not a typical use case given the precondition `0 ≤ start ≤ end < len(ticket)`.
