Postcondition: ***`i` must be less than `n`, `current_sum` is the sum of the integer value of `ticket[i]` added to the previous value of `current_sum`. If `current_sum` equals `target_sum`, then `current_sum` remains unchanged and the other variables retain their initial values. Otherwise, `current_sum` is increased by the integer value of `ticket[i]` and the other variables remain unchanged.***
