Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `current_sum` is updated by adding `int(ticket[1])` to its current value, `target_sum` is equal to the updated value of `current_sum`, and `segment_count` is 2. If `current_sum` equals `target_sum`, then `segment_count` is incremented to 3.***
