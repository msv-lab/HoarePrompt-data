The code `a6 = y ** z ** x` assigns the value of `y` raised to the power of `z` raised to the power of `x` to `a6`. Given that `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `a4`, and `a5` are initialized with `x` and `y` respectively, the values of `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `a4`, and `a5` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`a1` is `x`, `a2` is `x`, `a3` is `x`, `a4` is `(x`, `a5` is `y`, `a6` is `y ** z ** x**.
