The code `a8 = (y ** z) ** x` updates the value of `a8` based on the values of `x`, `y`, and `z`. However, since `z` is not defined in the initial state, its value is unknown. The initial values of `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `a4`, `a5`, `a6`, and `a7` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `a1` is `x`, `a2` is `x`, `a3` is `x`, `a4` is `(x`, `a5` is `y`, `a6` is `y`, `a7` is `(y`, `a8` is `(y ** z) ** x`.

Output State: **`a1` is `x`, `a2` is `x`, `a3` is `x`, `a4` is `(x`, `a5` is `y`, `a6` is `y`, `a7` is `(y`, `a8` is `(y ** z) ** x`**
