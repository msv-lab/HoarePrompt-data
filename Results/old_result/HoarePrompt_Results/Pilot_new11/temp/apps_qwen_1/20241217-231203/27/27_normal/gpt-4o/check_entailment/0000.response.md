Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to evaluate all twelve possible expressions and determine the maximum value among them. It uses a list of tuples to store each expression and its corresponding string representation, then finds the maximum value along with its index. Finally, it prints the expression string corresponding to the maximum value. Given the problem constraints and the examples provided, the program appears to handle all cases correctly. There are no apparent issues or edge cases that would cause the program to fail according to the problem description.
