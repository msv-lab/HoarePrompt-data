The code `x, y, z = map(int, input().split())` reads three space-separated integers from input and assigns them to `x`, `y`, and `z`. Since the input is not specified, we can only say that `x`, `y`, and `z` are now assigned the values of the three integers entered by the user. The precondition that these values are non-negative integers between 0 and 100 remains valid.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are the integers entered by the user, and they are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100.**
