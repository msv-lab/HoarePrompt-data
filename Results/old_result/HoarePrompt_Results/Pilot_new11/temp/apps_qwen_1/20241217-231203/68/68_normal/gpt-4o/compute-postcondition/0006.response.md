The code snippet `print('-')` does not affect any of the variables. It only prints a hyphen to the console. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is an integer entered by the user (0 <= x <= 100), `y` is an integer entered by the user (0 <= y <= 100), `z` is an integer entered by the user (0 <= z <= 100), `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is `y`, `max_downvotes` is `y + z`, and the current value of `max_upvotes` is less than the current value of `min_downvotes`.**
