The function accepts no parameters and reads three non-negative integers \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) from the user, each within the range of 0 to 100. It then evaluates these integers and prints one of four possible outputs: '+', '-', '0', or '?'. Specifically:
- If \(x > y + z\), it prints '+'.
- If \(x < y\), it prints '-'.
- If \(x == y\) and \(z == 0\), it prints '0'.
- If \(x == y\) and \(z != 0\), it prints '?'.
- In all other cases, no specific output is produced, but the conditions \(0 \leq x, y, z \leq 100\) and \(x \geq y\) or \(x \leq y + z\) are maintained.
