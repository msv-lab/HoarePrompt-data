`min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`. The values of `y` and `z` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `x`, `y`, and `z` are the integers entered by the user, where 0 <= x, y, z <= 100; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are the integers entered by the user, where 0 <= x, y, z <= 100; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`**
