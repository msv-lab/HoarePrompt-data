Postcondition: **`n` is an even and positive integer within the range [2, \(10^9\)], `m` is an even and positive integer within the range [2, \(10^9\)], `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k < n \cdot m\). If `k < n - 1`, then `k` is incremented by 1 and 1 is printed. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k % (n * 2 - 2)`, and the output is determined as follows:
- If \(0 \leq k < n * 2 - 2\), the output consists of two numbers: \(2n - k - 2\) and \(\frac{k - n + 1}{n - 1} + 1\).
- If \(k \geq n * 2 - 2\), the output is 1 and 2.**
