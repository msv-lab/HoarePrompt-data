The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` reads three space-separated integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively. Since the initial state specifies that `n` and `m` are even and positive integers within the range [2, 10^9], and `k` is an integer such that `0 ≤ k < n·m`, the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` will be updated to the values read from the input. The precondition that `n` and `m` are even and positive integers and `k` is an integer within the specified range remains valid.

Output State: **`n` is an even and positive integer within the range [2, 10^9]; `m` is an even and positive integer within the range [2, 10^9]; `k` is an integer such that `0 ≤ k < n·m`**
