The code calculates the number of full rows (`full_rows`) using the formula `k // (m - 1)`. Since `k` is in the range `[0, n * m - (n - 1))`, the value of `full_rows` will be `k` divided by `(m - 1)` using floor division.

Given that `n` is a positive even integer and `m` is a positive integer, the output state will reflect the calculation of `full_rows`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive even integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a value in the range `[0, n * m - (n - 1))`, `full_rows` is `k // (m - 1)`**
