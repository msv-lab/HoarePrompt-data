The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (an even positive integer), `m` (a positive integer), and `k` (an integer such that `0 <= k < n * m`). It processes these parameters to determine and print the values of `row` and `col` based on certain conditions. Specifically:
1. If `k < n - 1`, it prints `k + 1` followed by `1`.
2. If `k >= n - 1`, it calculates `full_rows` as `k // (m - 1)` and `remaining_steps` as `k % (m - 1)`. Then, it determines `row` as `n - full_rows` and `col` as either `2 + remaining_steps` if `full_rows % 2 == 0` or `m - remaining_steps` if `full_rows % 2 != 0`. Finally, it prints `row` and `col`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function does not handle the case where `k == n - 1` explicitly; however, since the logic for `k >= n - 1` is defined, it implicitly covers this case.
- There are no apparent missing functionalities in the given code.
