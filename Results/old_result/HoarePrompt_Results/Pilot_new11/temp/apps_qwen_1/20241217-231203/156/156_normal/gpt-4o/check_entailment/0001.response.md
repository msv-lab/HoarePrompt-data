Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the described movement pattern for Lara in the dungeon. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Initial Path**: Lara moves from (1, 1) to (n, 1).
2. **Snake Path**: After reaching (n, 1), she starts moving in a snake-like manner: right to the end, up one row, left to the second column, and repeating.

The function `func_1` handles these movements correctly:
- For the initial vertical movement, it prints the position directly if `k` is less than `n - 1`.
- For the snake-like movement, it calculates the number of full rows traversed and the remaining steps within those rows. It then determines the correct row and column based on whether the traversal direction is upwards or downwards.

Given the constraints and the logic implemented, the program works correctly for all potential cases. There are no apparent edge cases or scenarios where the program fails to meet the requirements as described. Therefore, the program is correct.
