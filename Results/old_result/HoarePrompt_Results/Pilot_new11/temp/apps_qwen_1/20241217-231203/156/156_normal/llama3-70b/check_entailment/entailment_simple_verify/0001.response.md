Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate because the annotated version confirms that the program does not correctly handle the case where `k == n * 2 - 2`. Specifically, the annotation states that the program prints `(2n - k - 2)` and `((k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1)` when `k < n * 2 - 2`, which would lead to incorrect output for `k == n * 2 - 2`. The correct output for this case should be `(1, 2)`, but the current logic computes the wrong cell. Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description in this specific case.
