Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the program now correctly handles all cases, including the exact case where `k == n * 2 - 2`. The annotations clearly show that the program now properly handles the different ranges of `k` and prints the correct coordinates for each case. Specifically:

- For \(0 \leq k < n - 1\), the output is \((k + 1, 1)\).
- For \(n - 1 \leq k < n * 2 - 2\), the output is \((2n - k - 2, (k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1)\).
- For \(k \geq n * 2 - 2\), the output is \((1, 2)\).

These cases cover all possible values of `k` and ensure the correct output is produced. Therefore, the original assessment of the program being incorrect is no longer applicable, and the program meets the problem description as stated.
