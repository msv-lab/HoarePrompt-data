Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know that `a` is a list containing one element (which is an integer), and `n` is an even number between 2 and 100.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop is defined as `for i in range(n):`. This means the loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.

3. **Iteration Analysis**: Since `n` is an even number, let's assume the current value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration. For example, if `n = 6` (an even number between 2 and 100), then the loop would iterate over `i = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` would be 5.

4. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 6 (if `n` remains 6).

5. **Variable `n`**: The variable `n` itself does not change within the loop based on the given information, so it remains the same.

6. **List `a`**: The list `a` does not change within the loop based on the given information, so it still contains one element.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`a` is a list containing one element, `i` is 6, `n` is an even number between 2 and 100**
