The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning this value to the variable `n`. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is an even integer, the value entered must also be an even integer. The list `cards` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer (after being reassigned as an input integer), `cards` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element represents the number written on a card (1 â‰¤ a_i â‰¤ 100)**
