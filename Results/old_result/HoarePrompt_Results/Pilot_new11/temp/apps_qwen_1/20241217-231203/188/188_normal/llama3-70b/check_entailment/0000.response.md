Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly determine if it's possible for Petya and Vasya to choose numbers in such a way that they can take all \( n \) cards equally. The issue lies in the logic used to check if there are exactly \( \frac{n}{2} \) occurrences of two different numbers.

Hereâ€™s a counterexample that demonstrates the flaw:

Consider the input:
```
4
1
1
2
2
```

According to the problem description, it should output "YES" because both 1 and 2 appear exactly twice, allowing Petya and Vasya to take all cards equally. However, the current implementation will output "NO" because it incorrectly checks if there are exactly \( \frac{n}{2} \) occurrences of two different numbers without considering the distribution.

To fix this, we need to ensure that there are at least two different numbers each appearing exactly \( \frac{n}{2} \) times. The current implementation fails to check this properly. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
