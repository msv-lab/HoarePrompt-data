The function `func` accepts a parameter `cards`, which is a list of integers of length `n`, where `n` is an even integer and each element in the list represents the number written on a card (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100). The function does not return any value directly but rather returns different outputs based on the conditions provided. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a list of integers `cards` and return either an error message if the length of the list is not even or if any element in the list is out of the specified range, or a specific output based on the elements in the list.
