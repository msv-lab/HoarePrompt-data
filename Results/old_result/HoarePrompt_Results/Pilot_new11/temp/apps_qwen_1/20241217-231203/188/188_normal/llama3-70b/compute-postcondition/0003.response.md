`a` is appended with the value of `int(input())`. The initial state of `a` is an empty list, and `n` is an even number between 2 and 100. After executing the code, `a` will contain one additional element which is the integer input. The length of `a` will be 1, and `n` remains unchanged as the code does not modify its value.

Output State: **`a` is a list containing one element, which is an integer input, `n` is an even number between 2 and 100**
