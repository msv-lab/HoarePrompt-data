The value of `c` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `c` was 1, so now `c` is 2. The states of the other variables are not affected by the code. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a non-empty list with exactly `n` elements, `d` is a non-empty dictionary where each key is an element from the list `a` and the value is the count of occurrences of that element in `a`, `c` is 2, `a1` is the value of `i` from the dictionary `d`, `a2` is either the value of `i` where the count of occurrences of `i` in `a` is not equal to `n // 2`, or remains -1, and `i` is the next key from the dictionary `d` after the assignment.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list with exactly `n` elements, `d` is a non-empty dictionary where each key is an element from the list `a` and the value is the count of occurrences of that element in `a`, `c` is 2, `a1` is the value of `i` from the dictionary `d`, `a2` is either the value of `i` where the count of occurrences of `i` in `a` is not equal to `n // 2`, or remains -1, and `i` is the next key from the dictionary `d` after the assignment.**
