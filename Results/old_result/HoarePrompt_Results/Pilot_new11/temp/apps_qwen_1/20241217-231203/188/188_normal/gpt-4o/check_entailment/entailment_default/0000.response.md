Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly determine if Petya and Vasya can choose numbers in such a way that the game is fair. The main issue lies in how the function handles the case where there are multiple unique numbers with frequencies that could potentially make the game fair. Specifically:

1. The function checks if the last two elements in the sorted list of unique numbers have the same frequency and if this frequency is exactly `n // 2`. This is a necessary condition but not sufficient. For the game to be fair, the chosen numbers must allow both players to take exactly `n // 2` cards each, which means the two chosen numbers must collectively cover all `n` cards without overlap.

2. The function does not check if the chosen numbers can collectively cover all `n` cards. For example, consider the input:
   ```
   6
   1
   1
   2
   2
   3
   3
   ```
   Here, the function would output "NO" because it only checks if the frequencies are equal, but it misses the fact that choosing any pair of numbers (1, 2), (1, 3), or (2, 3) would result in a fair game.

To fix this, the function needs to ensure that the chosen numbers collectively cover all `n` cards. One way to do this is to check if there are at least two unique numbers and if their combined counts equal `n`. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    n = int(input())
    cards = [int(input()) for _ in range(n)]
    count = Counter(cards)
    unique_numbers = list(count.keys())
    
    if len(unique_numbers) < 2:
        print('NO')
    else:
        # Check if the sum of counts of any two unique numbers equals n
        for i in range(len(unique_numbers)):
            for j in range(i + 1, len(unique_numbers)):
                if count[unique_numbers[i]] + count[unique_numbers[j]] == n:
                    print('YES')
                    print(unique_numbers[i], unique_numbers[j])
                    return
        print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected function ensures that the chosen numbers collectively cover all `n` cards, thus correctly determining if the game is fair.
