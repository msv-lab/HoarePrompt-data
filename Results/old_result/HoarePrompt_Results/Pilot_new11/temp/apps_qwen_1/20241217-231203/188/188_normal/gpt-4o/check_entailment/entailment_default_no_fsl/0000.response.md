Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the code assumes that there will always be at least two different numbers in the list, and it only checks the last two elements in the sorted unique numbers list to see if they can make the game fair. However, this approach is flawed because:

1. **Single Unique Number**: If all cards have the same number, the code will incorrectly return 'NO' because it checks only the last two elements. Instead, it should return 'NO' in this case since it’s impossible to split the cards fairly.

2. **Multiple Unique Numbers but Not All Frequencies Equal to n//2**: The code only checks if the last two elements have a frequency of `n // 2`. This is not sufficient because the game can be fair even if the frequencies of other unique numbers match `n // 2`.

For example, consider the input:
```
6
1
1
2
2
3
3
```
Here, all unique numbers (1, 2, and 3) have a frequency of 2, which is `n // 2`. Therefore, the game can be fair if Petya and Vasya choose any two of these numbers. However, the current code will return 'NO' because it only checks the last two elements.

To fix this, the code should check all unique numbers and ensure that at least one pair of unique numbers has a frequency of `n // 2`. Here’s a corrected version of the code:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    n = int(input())
    cards = [int(input()) for _ in range(n)]
    count = Counter(cards)
    
    # Check if there is only one unique number
    if len(count) == 1:
        print('NO')
        return
    
    # Check if any unique number has a frequency of n // 2
    for num in count:
        if count[num] == n // 2:
            print('YES')
            print(num, next(iter(set(count.keys()) - {num})))
            return
    
    print('NO')

func()
```

This version ensures that the game can be fair if at least one pair of unique numbers has a frequency of `n // 2`, covering all potential cases.
