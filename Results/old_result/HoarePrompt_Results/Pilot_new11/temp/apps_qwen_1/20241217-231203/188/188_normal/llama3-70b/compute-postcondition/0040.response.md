The code `a2 = i` assigns the value of the variable `i` to `a2`. Since `i` is the next key from the dictionary `d`, and there is no specific value provided for `i`, we cannot determine the exact value of `a2` without knowing the contents of the dictionary `d`. However, we know that `a2` now holds the value of `i`.

Other variables remain unchanged: `a` is a non-empty list with exactly `n` elements, `d` is a non-empty dictionary where each key is an element from the list `a` and the value is the count of occurrences of that element in `a`, `c` is still 1, `a1` remains the value of `i` where the count of occurrences of `i` in `a` is equal to `n // 2`, and `a2` now equals `i`.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list with exactly `n` elements, `d` is a non-empty dictionary where each key is an element from the list `a` and the value is the count of occurrences of that element in `a`, `c` is 1, `a1` is the value of `i` where the count of occurrences of `i` in `a` is equal to `n // 2`, `a2` is the value of `i`, and `i` is the next key from the dictionary `d`**.
