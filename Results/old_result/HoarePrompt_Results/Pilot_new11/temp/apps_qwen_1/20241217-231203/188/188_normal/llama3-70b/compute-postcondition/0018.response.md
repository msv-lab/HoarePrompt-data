The code snippet `d[i] = 1` updates the dictionary `d` by setting the key `i` to the value `1`. Given that `i` is the next element in the list `a` (i.e., `i = k + 1` where `k` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration), the value of `i` will be updated to the next element in the list `a`.

Since `a` is a non-empty list with exactly `n` elements, and `i` starts from `1` and increments by `1` each time, `i` will be the index of the next element in the list `a`. Therefore, `d[i]` will be set to `1`, where `i` is the current index of the element being processed in the list.

The output state will be:
- `a` remains unchanged, as the code does not modify the list.
- `d` is updated with a new key-value pair where the key is the current index `i` and the value is `1`.
- `i` is updated to the next index in the list `a`.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list with exactly `n` elements, `d` is a dictionary with the key-value pair `{i: 1}` where `i` is the current index in the list `a`, and `i` is updated to the next index in the list `a`.**
