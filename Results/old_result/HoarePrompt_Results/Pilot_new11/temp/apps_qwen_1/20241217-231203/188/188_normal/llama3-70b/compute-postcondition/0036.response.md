Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-empty list with exactly `n` elements, `d` is a non-empty dictionary where each key is an element from the list `a` and the value is the count of occurrences of that element in `a`, `c` is 1, `a1` is the value of `i` where the count of occurrences of `i` in `a` is equal to `n // 2`, and `a2` is either the value of `i` where the count of occurrences of `i` in `a` is not equal to `n // 2`, or remains -1.***
