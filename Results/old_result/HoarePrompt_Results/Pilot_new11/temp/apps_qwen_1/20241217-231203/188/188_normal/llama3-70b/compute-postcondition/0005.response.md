The code appends an integer input to the list `a`. Since the input is an integer, let's denote it as `input_int`. The initial state of `a` is a list containing one element. After appending `input_int`, the list `a` will contain two elements.

The value of `i` remains unchanged at 6, and `n` remains an even number between 2 and 100, as no operation was performed on it.

Output State: **`a` is a list containing two elements [original_element, input_int], `i` is 6, `n` is an even number between 2 and 100**
