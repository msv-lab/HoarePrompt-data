Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-empty list with exactly `n` elements, where `n` is an even number between 2 and 100, `d` is a non-empty dictionary where each key is an element from the list `a` and the value is the count of occurrences of that element in `a`, `c` is 1, `a1` is -1, `a2` is -1. For at least one element `i` in the list `a`, the count of occurrences of `i` in `a` is not equal to `n // 2`.***
