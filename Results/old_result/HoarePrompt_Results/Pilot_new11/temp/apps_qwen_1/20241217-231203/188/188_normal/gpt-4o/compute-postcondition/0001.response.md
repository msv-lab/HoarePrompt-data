The code `cards = [int(input()) for _ in range(n)]` creates a new list called `cards` where each element is an integer input from the user. Since `n` is an even integer and each `input()` call will replace the corresponding position in the list `cards`, the values of `n` and the elements of `cards` will be updated based on user inputs.

Given that the initial state is `n` is an even integer and `cards` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element represents the number written on a card (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100), after executing the code, the values of `n` remain unchanged but the list `cards` will contain `n` integers input by the user, each within the range 1 to 100.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer; `cards` is a list of `n` integers, each between 1 and 100 inclusive**
