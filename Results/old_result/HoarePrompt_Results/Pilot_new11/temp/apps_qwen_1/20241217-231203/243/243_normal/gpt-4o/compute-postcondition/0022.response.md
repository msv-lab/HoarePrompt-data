To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition of the `while` loop and the current state of the variables.

The `while` loop condition is:
```
while func_1(right) == m:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Given the current state right before the loop:
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\)
- `low` is 0
- `high` is \(5 \times m + 1\)
- `result` is an empty list
- `mid` is \((5 \times m + 1) // 2\)
- `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`
- `left` is the largest value such that `func_1(left) == m`
- `right` is \((5 \times m + 1) // 2 + 1\)

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `func_1(right) == m` must be true. Given the value of `right` is \((5 \times m + 1) // 2 + 1\), let's check if this condition holds:

1. The function `func_1(right)` returns `m` if `right` satisfies the condition.
2. Since `right` is defined as \((5 \times m + 1) // 2 + 1\), we need to verify if this value of `right` will satisfy the condition `func_1(right) == m`.

If the loop condition `func_1(right) == m` is to hold true, then `right` must be such that `func_1(right)` equals `m`. However, since `right` is calculated based on `m`, and there is no direct indication in the problem statement that `right` might change unless the loop modifies it, the key adjustment required is ensuring that `func_1(right)` indeed equals `m`.

Therefore, no other states need to be adjusted; the critical aspect is ensuring that the function `func_1(right)` returns `m`.

State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `low` is 0, `high` is \(5 \times m + 1\), `result` is an empty list, `mid` is \((5 \times m + 1) // 2\), `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`, `left` is the largest value such that `func_1(left) == m`, `right` is \((5 \times m + 1) // 2 + 1\) and `func_1(right)` must return `m`**
