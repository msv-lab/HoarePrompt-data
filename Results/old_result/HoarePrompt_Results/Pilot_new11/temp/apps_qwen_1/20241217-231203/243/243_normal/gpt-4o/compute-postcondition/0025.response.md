The value of `right` is incremented by 1. Initially, `right` was \((5 \times m + 1) // 2 + 2\). After incrementing `right` by 1, the new value of `right` becomes \((5 \times m + 1) // 2 + 3\).

All other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `low` is 0, `high` is \(5 \times m + 1\), `result` is an empty list, `mid` is \((5 \times m + 1) // 2\), `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`, `left` is the largest value such that `func_1(left) == m`, `right` is \((5 \times m + 1) // 2 + 3\), and `func_1(right)` must return `m`.**
