The code sets `low` to `mid + 1`. The previous value of `mid` is \((5 \times m + 1) // 2\). Since `low` is updated to `mid + 1`, the new value of `low` will be \(((5 \times m + 1) // 2) + 1\). All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `low` is ((5 Ã— m + 1) // 2) + 1, `high` is \(5 \times m + 1\), `result` is an empty list, `mid` is \((5 \times m + 1) // 2\), `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`, and `zeroes` is less than `m`**
