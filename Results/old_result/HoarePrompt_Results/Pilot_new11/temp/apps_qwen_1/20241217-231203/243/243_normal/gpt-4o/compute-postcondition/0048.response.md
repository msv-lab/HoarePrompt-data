To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute at least once, we need to analyze the condition inside the `while` loop and the current state of the variables.

The loop condition is:
```python
while func_1(right) == m:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Here, `right` is defined as `7 * m + 3`. For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `func_1(right) == m` must be true when the loop starts.

Given the current state:
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\)
- `low` is \(((5 \times m + 1) // 2) + 1\)
- `high` is \(5 \times m + 1\)
- `result` is an empty list
- `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1((7 \times m + 2))`
- `mid` is \(7 \times m + 2\)
- `left` is \(7 \times m - k\)
- `right` is \(7 \times m + 3\)

We need to ensure that `func_1(right)` returns `m` when the loop starts. Given that `right` is \(7 \times m + 3\), we need to check the value of `func_1(7 \times m + 3)`.

From the information given:
- `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(7 \times m + 2)`, but this does not directly affect `func_1(7 \times m + 3)`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, the value of `func_1(7 \times m + 3)` must be `m`.

Since `right` is \(7 \times m + 3\), the only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that `func_1(7 \times m + 3)` equals `m`.

Thus, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to include this condition:

State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\) and `func_1(7 \times m + 3)` must be equal to `m`**
