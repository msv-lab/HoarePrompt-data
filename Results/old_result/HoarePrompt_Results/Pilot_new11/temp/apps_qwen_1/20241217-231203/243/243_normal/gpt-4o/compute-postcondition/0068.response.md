Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   The loop condition is `func_1(left) == m`. This means the loop will continue to execute as long as the function `func_1` returns `m` when called with the value of `left`.

2. **Current State After Previous Iteration:**
   - `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
   - `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`.
   - `zeroes` is the result of `func_1(mid)` and must be equal to `m`.
   - `result` is an empty list.
   - `left` is equal to `mid - 1`.

3. **Determine the Next Condition:**
   For the loop to execute one more time, `func_1(left)` must still equal `m`. Given that `left = mid - 1`, we need to ensure that `func_1(mid - 1)` equals `m`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - The current value of `mid` does not directly affect the loop condition, but it is used to calculate `left`.
   - The value of `low` and `high` must be such that the loop can continue. Since `left` is set to `mid - 1`, we need to ensure that `mid - 1` is within the range defined by `low` and `high`.
   - The values of `func_1(left)` and `m` must remain equal for the loop to continue.

Given these points, we need to ensure that:
- `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
- `left` (which is `mid - 1`) must satisfy the condition `func_1(left) == m`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`low` is less than or equal to `high`, `left` (which is `mid - 1`) must satisfy the condition `func_1(left) == m`**.
