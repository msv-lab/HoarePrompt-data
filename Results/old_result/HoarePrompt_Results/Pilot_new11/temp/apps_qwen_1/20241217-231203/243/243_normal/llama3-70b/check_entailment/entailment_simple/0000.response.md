Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, it fails to account for the fact that the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of a number \( n \) is determined by the number of times \( n! \) can be divided by 5. The key issue lies in how the program calculates and processes the number of trailing zeroes.

#### Key Issues:

1. **Incorrect Trailing Zeroes Calculation**:
   - The program uses a simple increment approach to find the smallest \( n \) such that \( n! \) has at least \( m \) trailing zeroes. It increments \( n \) until \( n // 5^{\text{count}} \geq m \). However, this approach is flawed because it doesn't correctly capture the number of trailing zeroes in \( n! \).
   
2. **Incorrect List Generation**:
   - After finding the correct starting point \( n \), the program appends all integers from 1 to \( n \) to the list `ans`. This is incorrect because the problem asks for the number of positive integers \( n \) such that \( n! \) ends with exactly \( m \) zeroes, not the range of \( n \).

#### Correct Approach:

To solve this problem correctly, we need to use the following formula to determine the number of trailing zeroes in \( n! \):

\[ \text{Trailing zeroes} = \left\lfloor \frac{n}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{25} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{125} \right\rfloor + \cdots \]

Given \( m \), we need to find the smallest \( n \) such that the number of trailing zeroes in \( n! \) is exactly \( m \). Once we find such \( n \), we can check if there are other values of \( n \) that also satisfy the condition.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    m = int(input())
    count = 0
    n = 1
    
    # Find the smallest n such that the number of trailing zeroes in n! is at least m
    while True:
        if sum(n // (5 ** i) for i in range(1, 21)) >= m:
            break
        n += 1
    
    # Check if there are multiple n such that the number of trailing zeroes in n! is exactly m
    start = n
    while True:
        if sum(start // (5 ** i) for i in range(1, 21)) == m:
            count += 1
            start += 1
        else:
            break
    
    print(count)
    for i in range(n, n + count):
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()

```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Finding the Smallest \( n \)**:
   - The outer loop finds the smallest \( n \) such that the number of trailing zeroes in \( n! \) is at least \( m \).

2. **Checking for Multiple \( n \)**:
   - The inner loop checks if there are multiple \( n \) such that the number of trailing zeroes in \( n! \) is exactly \( m \).

3. **Printing the Result**:
   - Finally, it prints the count of such \( n \) and the corresponding values of \( n \).

This corrected program ensures that the output matches the problem description accurately.
