To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition of the `while` loop and the current state of the variables.

The `while` loop condition is:
```python
while func_1(left) == m:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\)
- `low = ((5 \times m + 1) // 2) + 1`
- `high = 5 \times m + 1`
- `result` is an empty list
- `zeroes = func_1((7 \times m + 2))`
- `mid = 7 \times m + 2`
- `left = 7 \times m + 1`

The loop will continue as long as `func_1(left) == m`. To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need `func_1(left)` to still equal `m`.

Since `left = 7 \times m + 1`, the loop will execute one more time if `func_1(7 \times m + 1) == m`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `left`, ensuring that `left` is set to \(7 \times m + 1\) in a way that maintains the loop condition.

State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `low` is \(((5 \times m + 1) // 2) + 1\), `high` is \(5 \times m + 1\), `result` is an empty list, `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1((7 \times m + 2))`, `mid` is \((7 \times m + 2)\), `left` is \(7 \times m + 1\)**
