You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Mr. Santa asks all the great programmers of the world to solve a trivial problem. He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.


-----Output-----

First print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.


-----Examples-----
Input
1

Output
5
5 6 7 8 9 
Input
5

Output
0


-----Note-----

The factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.

In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.
Functions with output description for each function:
m = int(input())
result = func_2(m)
if result:
    print(len(result))
    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))
else:
    print(0)

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(n):
    """ Return the number of trailing zeroes in n! """
    count = 0
    power_of_5 = 5
    while n >= power_of_5:
        count += n // power_of_5
        power_of_5 *= 5
    return count
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the count of trailing zeroes in `n!`. It does this by iteratively calculating the sum of `n // (5^k)` for each power of 5 until `n < 5^(k+1)`. The function starts with `power_of_5` set to 5 and increases it by multiplying by 5 in each iteration of the loop. The loop continues as long as `n` is greater than or equal to `power_of_5`. After the loop completes, the function returns the accumulated count. This count represents the total number of factors of 5 in the numbers from 1 to `n`, which directly corresponds to the number of trailing zeroes in `n!`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function correctly handles the case when `n` is 0, as `0! = 1`, which has 0 trailing zeroes. In this case, the function will return 0 immediately without entering the loop.
- The function also correctly handles the case when `n` is 1, as `1! = 1`, which also has 0 trailing zeroes. In this case, the function will return 0 immediately without entering the loop.
- The function correctly handles large values of `n` by iteratively dividing `n` by increasing powers of 5 and summing up the results. There are no missing functionalities related to handling large inputs.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(m):
    """ Find all numbers n such that n! ends with exactly m trailing zeroes """
    (low, high) = (0, 5 * (m + 1))
    result = []
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        zeroes = func_1(mid)
        if zeroes < m:
            low = mid + 1
        elif zeroes > m:
            high = mid - 1
        else:
            result = []
            left = mid
            while func_1(left) == m:
                left -= 1
            right = mid + 1
            while func_1(right) == m:
                right += 1
            result = list(range(left + 1, right))
            break
    return result
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts an integer `m` such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\) and uses a binary search approach to find a range of integers `n` for which `n!` (n factorial) ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes. It initializes `low` and `high` to search within a predefined range and iteratively narrows down the search space. If it finds a value `mid` such that `func_1(mid)` equals `m`, it then expands the search to find the exact range of numbers that satisfy the condition. If `low` exceeds `high` without finding such a range, it returns an empty list. The function ultimately returns either a range of integers satisfying the condition or an empty list if no such range is found.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
