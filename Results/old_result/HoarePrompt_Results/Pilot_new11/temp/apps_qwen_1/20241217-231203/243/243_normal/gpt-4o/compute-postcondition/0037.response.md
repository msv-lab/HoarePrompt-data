The code changes the value of `high` to `mid - 1`. From the initial state, we know that `mid` is equal to \(7 \times m + 2\). Therefore, the new value of `high` is \((7 \times m + 2) - 1\).

Let's summarize the updated values:
- `m` remains the same since no operation was performed on it.
- `low` remains the same because no operation was performed on it.
- `high` is now \((7 \times m + 2) - 1\).
- `result` remains unchanged.
- `zeroes` remains unchanged.
- `mid` remains the same.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `low` is \(((5 \times m + 1) // 2) + 1\), `high` is \((7 \times m + 1\), `result` is either an empty list or a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1((7 \times m + 2))`, `mid` is \((7 \times m + 2)`**
