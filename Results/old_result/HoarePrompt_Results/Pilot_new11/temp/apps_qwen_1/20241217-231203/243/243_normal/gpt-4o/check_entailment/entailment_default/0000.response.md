Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not correctly find the number of positive integers \( n \) such that the factorial of \( n \) ends with exactly \( m \) zeroes. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the number of trailing zeroes in \( n! \), but `func_2` does not properly find the range of \( n \) values that satisfy the condition.

The issue lies in the way `func_2` is designed to find the range of \( n \) values. Specifically, after finding a midpoint `mid` such that `func_1(mid) == m`, it attempts to expand the search to find the exact range. However, the logic for expanding the search is flawed:

- It sets `left` to `mid` and decreases it until `func_1(left) != m`.
- It sets `right` to `mid + 1` and increases it until `func_1(right) != m`.

This approach can miss the exact range of values that satisfy the condition. For instance, if `func_1(mid) == m` and there are multiple values of \( n \) between `left` and `right` that also have exactly \( m \) trailing zeroes, the current implementation will not capture all of them. A more robust approach would involve checking the values around `mid` more systematically.

To illustrate, consider the example where \( m = 5 \):

- `func_1(25) = 6` (which is greater than 5).
- `func_1(24) = 5` (which is exactly 5).

In this case, `func_2` would correctly identify `24` as a value that satisfies the condition. However, if there were another value between `23` and `25` that also has exactly 5 trailing zeroes, `func_2` would not find it. 

Therefore, the code does not guarantee to find all values of \( n \) that satisfy the condition, making it incorrect.
