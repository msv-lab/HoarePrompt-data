The code `result = list(range(left + 1, right))` creates a list of integers starting from `left + 1` up to, but not including, `right`. Given that `func_1(right)` is equal to `m` and `right` is the smallest value such that `func_1(right) == m` and all values between `right - 1` and `right` do not satisfy `func_1(x) == m`, the values of `left` and `right` are fixed.

However, since the values of `left` and `right` are not explicitly defined in the initial state, we can only state that `left` is less than `right` and that `func_1(right) == m`.

The output of `list(range(left + 1, right))` will be a list containing all integers from `left + 1` up to `right - 1`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\)
- `func_1(right)` is equal to `m` and `right` is the smallest value such that `func_1(right) == m` and all values between `right - 1` and `right` do not satisfy `func_1(x) == m`
- `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `func_1(right)` is equal to `m` and `right` is the smallest value such that `func_1(right) == m` and all values between `right - 1` and `right` do not satisfy `func_1(x) == m`; `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`.**
