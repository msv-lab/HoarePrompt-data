The code `right += 1` increments the value of `right` by 1. The initial state is that `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\) and `func_1(right + 1) == m`. After executing `right += 1`, the value of `right` changes to `right + 1`.

Therefore, the updated state is that `m` is still an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\) and `func_1(right + 2) == m` because the function call now uses the new value of `right`.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `func_1(right + 2) == m`**
