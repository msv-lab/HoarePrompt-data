The code initializes `result` as an empty list. This means that the value of `result` changes from being either an empty list or a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1` to specifically an empty list. The values of `m`, `low`, `high`, `zeroes`, and `mid` remain unchanged because they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `low` is \(((5 \times m + 1) // 2) + 1\), `high` is \(5 \times m + 1\), `result` is an empty list, `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1((7 \times m + 2))`, `mid` is \((7 \times m + 2)\)**
