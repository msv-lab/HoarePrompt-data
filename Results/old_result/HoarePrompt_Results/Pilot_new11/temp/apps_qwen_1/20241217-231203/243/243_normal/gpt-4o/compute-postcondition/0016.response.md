Let's analyze the given while loop and the provided state to determine what adjustments are needed for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given Code:
```python
while func_1(left) == m:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Current State:
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\)
- `low` is 0
- `high` is \(5 \times m + 1\)
- `result` is an empty list
- `mid` is \((5 \times m + 1) // 2\)
- `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`
- `zeroes` is less than `m`
- `left` is \((5 \times m + 1) // 2 - 1\)

### Analysis:
The condition inside the while loop is `func_1(left) == m`. For the loop to execute one more time, `func_1(left)` must be equal to `m`.

From the current state, we know:
- `left` is \((5 \times m + 1) // 2 - 1\)
- `func_1(left)` is not specified directly, but we know it is not equal to `m` in the current iteration because the loop condition fails (since `zeroes` is less than `m`).

To make the loop execute one more time, we need to ensure that `func_1(left)` becomes equal to `m`. This can happen if we update the value of `left` or the function `func_1` returns a different value in the next iteration.

However, based on the information provided, no direct state adjustment for `left` or `func_1` can be inferred without knowing how the loop body modifies these values. Therefore, we need to assume that the loop body updates `left` in some way to make `func_1(left)` equal to `m`.

### Conclusion:
Since the loop condition is `func_1(left) == m` and it fails in the current iteration, we need to adjust the state such that `func_1(left)` can eventually become equal to `m` in the next iteration.

### Adjusted State:
- The value of `left` must be updated in the next iteration such that `func_1(left)` becomes equal to `m`.

Given this, the state remains the same as the current state, but with the understanding that `left` will be updated in the loop body to satisfy the loop condition.

**State:**
**`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `low` is 0, `high` is \(5 \times m + 1\), `result` is an empty list, `mid` is \((5 \times m + 1) // 2\), `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`, `zeroes` is less than `m`, and `left` is \((5 \times m + 1) // 2 - 1`**

Note: The key point is that the state should reflect the conditions that allow the loop to proceed, which in this case means ensuring that `func_1(left)` can become equal to `m` in the next iteration.
