The value of `right` is incremented by 1. According to the initial state, `right` was \((5 \times m + 1) // 2 + 1\). After incrementing, the new value of `right` becomes \((5 \times m + 1) // 2 + 2\).

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `low` is 0, `high` is \(5 \times m + 1\), `result` is an empty list, `mid` is \((5 \times m + 1) // 2\), `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`, `left` is the largest value such that `func_1(left) == m`, `right` is \((5 \times m + 1) // 2 + 2\) and `func_1(right)` must return `m`**.
