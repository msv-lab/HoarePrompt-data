`left` is decremented by 1. Initially, `left` was equal to \((5 \times m + 1) // 2\). Since `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `left` is now \((5 \times m + 1) // 2 - 1\).

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `low` is 0, `high` is \(5 \times m + 1\), `result` is an empty list, `mid` is \((5 \times m + 1) // 2\), `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`, and `zeroes` is less than `m`; `left` is \((5 \times m + 1) // 2 - 1**
