The function takes three positive integers \(k_1\), \(k_2\), and \(k_3\) as input, each constrained to be between 1 and 1500. It calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(k_1\) and \(k_2\), then finds the GCD of this result and \(k_3\). If the final GCD is 1, the function prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the result directly.
