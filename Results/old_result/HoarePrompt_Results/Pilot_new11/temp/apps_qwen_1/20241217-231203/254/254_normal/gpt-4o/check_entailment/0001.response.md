Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program checks if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the three time intervals `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` is equal to 1. If the GCD is 1, it prints 'YES', indicating that Mishka can choose moments to switch on the garlands such that each second after switching them on at least one garland will be lit. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

This approach works because if the GCD of the three time intervals is 1, it means that the intervals are coprime, and thus their least common multiple (LCM) is the product of the intervals. This ensures that every second can be covered by at least one of the intervals.

Let's verify this with the given examples:

1. For input `2 2 3`:
   - GCD(2, 2) = 2
   - GCD(2, 3) = 1
   Since the GCD is 1, the output is 'YES'.

2. For input `4 2 3`:
   - GCD(4, 2) = 2
   - GCD(2, 3) = 1
   Since the GCD is not 1, the output is 'NO'.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, ensuring that the GCD check accurately determines whether Mishka can satisfy the condition. Therefore, the program is correct.
