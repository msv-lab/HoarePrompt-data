Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of the three given intervals using a flawed approach. Specifically, the calculation of `lcm` is incorrect due to the formula used. Additionally, the function `func_1` incorrectly returns `0` instead of the computed GCD, leading to further incorrect calculations. These issues result in the program not being able to correctly determine whether Mishka can switch on the garlands such that at least one garland is lit every second after switching them on. The output hints confirm that the GCD function is not working as expected, which further confirms the original assessment.
