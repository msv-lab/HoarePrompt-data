Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code checks if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the three time intervals \(k_1\), \(k_2\), and \(k_3\) is 1. However, this approach is not sufficient to determine if Mishka can switch on the garlands in such a way that each second after switching the garlands on at least one garland will be lit.

Consider the following counterexample:
- Input: \(k_1 = 2\), \(k_2 = 4\), \(k_3 = 6\)

For this input:
- \( \text{gcd}(2, 4) = 2 \)
- \( \text{gcd}(2, 6) = 2 \)
- \( \text{gcd}(2, 4, 6) = 2 \)

The GCD is 2, so the program will print 'NO'. However, it is possible to switch on the garlands correctly. For example, if Mishka switches on the garlands at the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd seconds, the states of the garlands will be:
- First garland: lit at 1, 3, 5, ...
- Second garland: lit at 2, 6, 10, ...
- Third garland: lit at 3, 9, 15, ...

Starting from the 3rd second, at least one garland will be lit each second. Therefore, the program is incorrect for this case.
