The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `k1`, `k2`, and `k3`. Since the exact values of the inputs are not specified, we can only say that they are integers between 1 and 1500. The original values of `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` are replaced by the values read from the input.

Output State: **`k1`, `k2`, and `k3` are integers read from input, each between 1 and 1500**
