Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the program correctly calculates the GCD of the three input integers. If the final GCD is 1, it implies that the three intervals are coprime, meaning that there will always be a second where at least one garland is lit. Otherwise, if the GCD is greater than 1, there will be intervals where no garland is lit. This aligns perfectly with the problem description and the logic implemented in the code. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.
