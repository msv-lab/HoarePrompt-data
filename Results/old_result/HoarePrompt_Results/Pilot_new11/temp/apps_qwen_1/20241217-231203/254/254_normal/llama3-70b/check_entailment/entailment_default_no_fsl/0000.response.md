Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program attempts to solve the problem using the least common multiple (LCM) approach, but it contains a logical error in the `func_1` function. The function should compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm, but it incorrectly returns `0` instead of the computed GCD. 

To properly solve the problem, the LCM of the three time intervals should be calculated correctly. The corrected `func_1` function should return the GCD, and the LCM calculation should be based on the relationship between LCM and GCD:

\[ \text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{|a \times b|}{\text{gcd}(a, b)} \]

However, the current implementation of `func_1` is incorrect, leading to an incorrect LCM calculation and potentially wrong output. For instance, consider the input `4 2 3`. The correct LCM of 4, 2, and 3 is 12, but the program fails to compute this correctly due to the incorrect GCD calculation.

Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function and the main logic:

```python
from math import gcd

(k1, k2, k3) = map(int, input().split())

def lcm(a, b):
    return abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)

lcm_value = lcm(lcm(k1, k2), k3)

if lcm_value > 0:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```

This corrected version ensures that the LCM is computed correctly, and the program will produce the right output for all valid inputs. Therefore, the original program is incorrect due to the logical error in the GCD computation.
