Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if Mishka can switch on the garlands such that each second after switching them on at least one garland will be lit. The program calculates the GCD of the three given time intervals. If the final GCD is 1, it prints 'YES', indicating that it is possible to switch the garlands on to meet the requirement. Otherwise, it prints 'NO', indicating that it is not possible. This logic aligns with the problem description and the provided output hints. The program handles all valid inputs within the given constraints, making the original assessment correct.
