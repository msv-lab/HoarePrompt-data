#State of the program right berfore the function call: a, b, and k_3 are integers such that 1 ≤ k_i ≤ 1500 for i in {1, 2, 3}.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: - Since the loop always terminates with `b` becoming zero, the final values are `a` is 0 and `b` is 0.
    #   - The value of `k_3` remains unchanged and is still within the range \(1 \leq k_3 \leq 1500\).
    #
    #Thus, the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations is:
    return a
    #The program returns 0 since `a` is 0 and `b` is 0 after the loop terminates
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`. It performs the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. Specifically, it repeatedly replaces `a` with `b` and `b` with the remainder of `a` divided by `b` until `b` becomes zero. At this point, the value of `a` is the GCD of the original `a` and `b`. However, the function incorrectly returns `0` instead of the computed GCD. This is a logical error in the function, as the intended behavior should be to return the value of `a` (which holds the GCD), not `0`.
