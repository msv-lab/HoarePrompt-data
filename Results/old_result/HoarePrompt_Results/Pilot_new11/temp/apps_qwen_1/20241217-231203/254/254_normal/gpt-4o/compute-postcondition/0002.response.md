The code `gcd_all = math.gcd(gcd_k1_k2, k3)` calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `gcd_k1_k2` and `k3` and assigns it to the variable `gcd_all`. However, the value of `k3` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of `gcd_all`. The only information we know is that `k1` and `k2` are integers between 1 and 1500, and `gcd_k1_k2` is the GCD of `k1` and `k2`.

Output State: **`k1` is an integer between 1 and 1500, `k2` is an integer between 1 and 1500, `gcd_k1_k2` is the GCD of `k1` and `k2`, `gcd_all` is the GCD of `gcd_k1_k2` and `k3`**
