Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^9\) and \(n \geq 6\); `count` is 2 if the initial condition (`a_{\text{prev}} + 1` equals `rem // 2`) was true and `rem > 0` and `rem % 2 == 0` hold, otherwise `count` remains 1; `a` and `b` are both \(a_{\text{prev}} + 1\); `rem` is \(n - 4(a_{\text{prev}} + 1) - 4\).***
