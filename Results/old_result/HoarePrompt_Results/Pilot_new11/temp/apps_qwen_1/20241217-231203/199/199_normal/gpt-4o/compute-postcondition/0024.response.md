Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^9\) and \(n \geq 6\), `count` is the number of valid `(a, b)` pairs such that \(a \in [1, \frac{n}{4}]\) and \(b = a\) with \(rem = n - 2(a + b)\) being greater than 0 and even, `a` is \(\frac{n}{4}\), `b` is \(\frac{n}{4}\), and `rem` is \(0\).**

### Explanation:
- **Initialization**: Initially, `count` is 0, and the loop runs for `a` in the range from 1 to \(n//4 + 1\).
- **Loop Condition**: For each `a`, `b` is set to `a`, and `rem` is calculated as `n - 2 * (a + b)`. The loop increments `count` if `rem` is greater than 0 and even, and `a` is not equal to `rem // 2`.
- **Termination**: The loop continues until `a` reaches `n//4 + 1`. After all iterations, `a` will be \(n//4\), `b` will also be \(n//4\), and `rem` will be 0 because the loop stops when `a` reaches the upper limit, making `rem` invalid (non-positive).

Since the loop increments `count` based on the conditions, the final value of `count` will be the number of valid `(a, b)` pairs that satisfy the conditions during the loop's execution. When the loop finishes, `a` and `b` will both be \(n//4\) and `rem` will be 0.
