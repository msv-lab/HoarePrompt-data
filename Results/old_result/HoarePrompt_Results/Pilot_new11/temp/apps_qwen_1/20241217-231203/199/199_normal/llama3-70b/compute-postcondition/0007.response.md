The code `ways += 1` increments the value of `ways` by 1. Given that `ways` was initially 0, it will now be 1. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `a` is 1, `ways` is 1, `b` will be the next value in the range starting from 1 up to `(n - 1) // 2`**
