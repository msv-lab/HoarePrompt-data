Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to consider the possibility of cutting the stick in such a way that the resulting parts do not all have different lengths, which is required to ensure that it is impossible to form a square.

For example, consider the input `n = 12`. According to the problem description, we need to find ways to split the stick into four parts that can form a rectangle but not a square. One valid way is `{1, 2, 3, 6}`. However, the current implementation might miss this case because it only checks if `a` is not equal to `rem // 2`, but it does not guarantee that all parts are distinct.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that all four parts are distinct integers. Here is a corrected version:

```python
n = int(input())
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(n):
    if n < 6:
        return 0
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n // 4 + 1):
        for b in range(a + 1, (n - a) // 2 + 1):
            c = n - a - b
            d = n - a - b - c
            if c > 0 and d > 0 and a != b and b != c and c != d:
                count += 1
    return count
```

This corrected version ensures that all four parts are distinct and thus guarantees that a rectangle can be formed but not a square.
