Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved**: The variables involved in the loop are `n`, `a`, `b`, and `ways`.
2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over values of `a` from `1` to `n // 2 + 1`.
3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` is a non-negative integer at least 2.
   - `a` is the last value used in the loop incremented by 1.
   - `b` is the last value used in the loop within the range \([a, (n - a) // 2 + 1)\).
   - `ways` is the count of valid pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a \neq b\) and \(2 \times (a + b) == n\).

Given these points, we need to adjust the states for the next iteration of the loop.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `a` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the new value of `a` will be the current value of `a` plus 1.
   - `b` will be set to the first value within its range for the new value of `a`.
   - `ways` will remain the same unless a valid pair is found during the loop body, but since we are determining the state before entering the loop body, `ways` remains unchanged.

Based on the above analysis, here is the modified state:

- `n` remains the same.
- `a` is incremented by 1.
- `b` starts as the first value within the range \([a, (n - a) // 2 + 1)\).
- `ways` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer at least 2, `a` is the last value used in the loop plus 1, `b` is the first value within the range \([a, (n - a) // 2 + 1)\), and `ways` is the count of valid pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a \neq b\) and \(2 \times (a + b) == n\)**.
