Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - `a` is 1.
   - `ways` is either 0 or 1.
   - If `2 * (a + b) == n` and `a` is not `b`, then `ways` is 1. Otherwise, `ways` remains 0.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for b in range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The loop runs over values of `b` starting from `a` up to `(n - a) // 2`.
   - For each value of `b`, the condition `2 * (a + b) == n` and `a` is not `b` needs to be checked.
   - If this condition is true for any value of `b`, `ways` will be set to 1.
   - If no such `b` is found, `ways` remains 0.

4. **Current Values:**
   - `a` is currently 1.
   - The range for `b` starts from `a` (which is 1) and goes up to `(n - a) // 2`.

5. **Determine the Range for `b`:**
   - The upper limit for `b` is `(n - a) // 2`.
   - Given `a = 1`, the upper limit becomes `(n - 1) // 2`.

6. **Next Value of `b`:**
   - The loop will increment `b` starting from its current value (which we don't know but it is within the range).
   - Let's assume the current value of `b` is `b_current`.
   - The next value of `b` will be `b_current + 1`.

7. **Updated States:**
   - `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `a` remains 1 as it does not change inside the loop.
   - `ways` will remain 0 unless the condition `2 * (a + b) == n` and `a` is not `b` is met for some `b` within the range. Since we are considering the start of the next iteration, we assume `ways` is still 0 if the condition was not met.
   - `b` will be incremented by 1.

8. **Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - `a` is 1.
   - `ways` is 0.
   - `b` will be the next value in the range starting from 1 up to `(n - 1) // 2`.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`n` must be at least 2, `a` is 1, `ways` is 0, `b` will be the next value in the range starting from 1 up to `(n - 1) // 2**.
