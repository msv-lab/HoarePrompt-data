Let's analyze the given information and the for loop step by step.

### Given Information:
- At the end of the previous iteration:
  - `n` is at least 2.
  - `a` is 1.
  - `b` is the next value, which is `b_current + 1` and must be within the range \([1, (n - 1) // 2 + 1)\).
  - If `a != b` and \(2 \times (a + b) == n\), then `ways` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for b in range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is at least 2.
   - `a` is 1.
   - `b` is the next value, which is `b_current + 1` and must be within the range \([1, (n - 1) // 2 + 1)\).
   - `ways` is either increased by 1 or remains unchanged based on the condition.

2. **Range of the Loop:**
   - The loop runs from `a` to \((n - a) // 2 + 1\).

3. **Current Value of `b`:**
   - Since `a` is 1, the loop will run from `1` to \((n - 1) // 2 + 1\).

4. **Condition for Increasing `ways`:**
   - If `a != b` and \(2 \times (a + b) == n\), then `ways` is increased by 1.
   - Given `a = 1`, the condition becomes \(2 \times (1 + b) == n\) or \(2 + 2b == n\).

5. **Next Value of `b`:**
   - The next value of `b` should be `b_current + 1`.
   - This value needs to be within the range \([1, (n - 1) // 2 + 1)\).

6. **State Adjustment:**
   - `n` remains at least 2.
   - `a` remains 1.
   - `b` changes to the next value, which is `b_current + 1` and must be within the specified range.
   - `ways` either increases by 1 or remains unchanged based on the condition.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute one more time, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

- `n` remains at least 2.
- `a` remains 1.
- `b` changes to the next value, which is `b_current + 1` and must be within the range \([1, (n - 1) // 2 + 1)\).
- `ways` either increases by 1 or remains unchanged based on the condition.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is at least 2, `a` is 1, `b` is `b_current + 1` and must be within the range \([1, (n - 1) // 2 + 1)\), and `ways` either increases by 1 or remains unchanged.**
