To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop condition.

### Given Information:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^9\) and \(n \geq 6\).
- `count` is 1 if `a` equals `rem // 2` (where `rem = n - 4a - 4`), otherwise `count` remains 0.
- `a` is `a + 1` at the end of each iteration.
- `b` is `a + 1` at the end of each iteration.
- `rem` is `n - 4a - 4`.

### Loop Condition:
The loop iterates over `a` from 1 to `n // 4 + 1`.

### Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^9\) and \(n \geq 6\).
- `count` is determined based on the current value of `a` and `rem`.
- `a` has been incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `b` is now `a + 1`.
- `rem` is updated to `n - 4a - 4`.

### Next Iteration Analysis:
For the loop to continue, `a` must be less than or equal to `n // 4 + 1`.

Let's denote:
- The value of `a` at the end of the previous iteration as `a_prev`.
- The new value of `a` after incrementing by 1 as `a_new`.

Since `a` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the new value of `a` (`a_new`) is `a_prev + 1`.

For the loop to continue, `a_new` must be less than or equal to `n // 4 + 1`.

### Updated States:
- `n` remains unchanged: \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^9\) and \(n \geq 6\).
- `count` is still determined based on the new value of `a` and `rem`.
- `a` is updated to `a_prev + 1`.
- `b` is updated to `(a_prev + 1) + 1 = a_prev + 2`.
- `rem` is updated to `n - 4(a_prev + 1) - 4`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^9\) and \(n \geq 6\); `count` is 1 if `a_prev + 1` equals `rem // 2` (where `rem = n - 4(a_prev + 1) - 4`), otherwise `count` remains 0; `a` is `a_prev + 1`; `b` is `a_prev + 2`; `rem` is `n - 4(a_prev + 1) - 4`.**
