Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly handles all the cases described in the problem description. Specifically:

1. If \( t \leq k \), the number of standing spectators is \( t \), which is correctly printed.
2. If \( k < t \leq n \), the number of standing spectators is \( k \), which is also correctly printed.
3. If \( t > n \), the number of standing spectators is calculated as \( n + k - t \), which matches the behavior described in the problem description and the output hints. 

The provided output hints confirm that the program behaves as expected for each range of \( t \). Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
