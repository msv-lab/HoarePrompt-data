The code `print(t)` simply prints the value of `t`. Since the value of `t` is printed but not modified, the value of `t` remains unchanged. The other variables `n` and `k` are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer and the value of `t` is printed.**
