The code `print(k)` prints the value of `k`. Since the value of `k` is an input integer, it remains unchanged after the print statement is executed. The other variables (`n` and `t`) are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer, and `k` is printed.**
