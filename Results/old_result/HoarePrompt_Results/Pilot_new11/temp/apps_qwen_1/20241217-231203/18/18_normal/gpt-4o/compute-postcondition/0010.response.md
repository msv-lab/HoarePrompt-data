The function `func` accepts no parameters directly listed in the provided code snippet. However, based on the constraints given, the function presumably works with internal variables or parameters `n`, `k`, and `t` that satisfy the conditions: 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k. 

Given the output cases are not explicitly defined in the provided code snippet, we can infer the function might return a value or perform some operation based on these parameters. Since no specific output cases are provided, we'll structure the answer based on the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts no direct parameters but operates with internal variables n, k, and t satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k, and returns a value based on these variables.**
