Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the logic for determining how many spectators are standing at time `t`. Let's break down the logic:

1. If `t` is less than or equal to `n`, the number of standing spectators is simply `min(t, k)`. This is because up to time `n`, the first `k` spectators stand up sequentially.

2. If `t` is greater than `n`, the program calculates the number of standing spectators by subtracting the remainder of `(t - n)` divided by `k` from `k`. This handles the cyclic nature of the wave after time `n`.

Given the problem description and the provided examples, this logic accurately determines the number of standing spectators for all valid cases. The program works correctly for the examples given and for any other potential case within the constraints.
