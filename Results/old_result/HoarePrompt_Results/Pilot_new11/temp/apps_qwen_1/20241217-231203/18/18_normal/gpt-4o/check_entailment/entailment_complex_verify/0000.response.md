Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the program does not fully handle the case when `t > n`. Specifically, according to the problem description, at time `t = n + 1`, the `(n + 1 - k)`-th spectator sits, and this pattern continues for subsequent times. However, the current implementation only considers two cases: `t <= k` and `t <= n`. For `t > n`, the program incorrectly calculates `n + k - t`, which does not reflect the actual seating pattern.

To illustrate, consider the input `10 5 16`:
- According to the problem description, at `t = 16`, the standing spectators should be from `n - k + 1` to `n`, which is `6` to `10`.
- However, the program would incorrectly compute `n + k - t` as `10 + 5 - 16 = -1`, which is not a valid count of standing spectators.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate because the program does not correctly handle the case when `t > n`.
