Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. According to the problem description, the behavior of the Mexican wave changes at different times:

- From time 0 to time \( k \): Spectators from 1 to \( k \) stand up sequentially.
- From time \( k + 1 \) to time \( n \): Spectators from \( k + 1 \) to \( n \) stand up, and spectators from 1 to \( n - k \) sit down.
- After time \( n \): Spectators continue to sit down sequentially.

The code provided does not accurately reflect this behavior. Specifically, the conditions for printing the number of standing spectators are incorrect:

1. For \( t \leq k \), the number of standing spectators should be \( t \), which is correct.
2. For \( k < t \leq n \), the number of standing spectators should be \( k \), which is incorrect. The correct number of standing spectators would depend on the position relative to the wave cycle.
3. For \( t > n \), the number of standing spectators should be calculated based on the remaining time in the wave cycle, but the current implementation subtracts \( t \) from \( n + k \), which is not accurate.

For example, consider \( n = 10 \), \( k = 5 \), and \( t = 7 \):

- According to the problem description, at \( t = 7 \), spectators 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 are standing, so the number of standing spectators should be 5.
- However, the current code prints \( k = 5 \), which is correct in this specific case but will fail for other cases where the standing spectators are not necessarily all the way up to \( k \).

To fix this, the code needs to correctly calculate the number of standing spectators based on the wave cycle, which involves more complex logic to account for the different phases of the wave.
