Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the scenario when `k` is very large and exceeds the number of pupils in the classroom. Specifically, the program calculates the number of full cycles and remaining questions but does not properly account for the distribution of questions among pupils when `k` is larger than the total number of pupils.

For example, consider the following input:
```
100 100 1000000000000000000 1 1
```
In this case, `n = 100`, `m = 100`, `k = 1000000000000000000`, `x = 1`, and `y = 1`. The total number of pupils is `100 * 100 = 10000`. The program calculates `full_cycle_length` correctly as `19800`, but the number of full cycles (`full_cycles`) and the remaining questions (`remaining_questions`) are extremely large. The program then proceeds to distribute questions in a way that does not accurately reflect the actual pattern of questioning.

Given such a large `k`, the program will incorrectly distribute the questions among pupils, leading to incorrect counts for the maximum, minimum, and Sergei's questions. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
