Postcondition: ***`remaining_questions` must be greater than 0; `m` must be greater than 0; `col` is 0; `sergei_questions` is equal to its initial value plus 1; `max_questions` is equal to its initial value plus 1; `row` equals `col - 3`; `direction` is -1; and `row` equals `col - 3`. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains as described in the if part regardless of the condition.***
