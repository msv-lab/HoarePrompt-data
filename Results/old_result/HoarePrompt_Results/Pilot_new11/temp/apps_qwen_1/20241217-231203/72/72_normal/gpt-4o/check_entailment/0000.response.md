Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the scenario when the remaining questions (`remaining_questions`) are less than the full cycle length but greater than or equal to the half-cycle length. Specifically, the program's logic for updating `max_questions` and `min_questions` during the remaining questions phase is flawed.

Consider the following case:
- Input: `4 2 9 4 2`
- Expected output: `2 1 1`

The program calculates the full cycles and remaining questions correctly, but the logic for updating `max_questions` and `min_questions` during the remaining questions phase is incorrect. The program increments `max_questions` and decrements it without properly accounting for the direction of the polling, which leads to an incorrect result.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issue:
- The full cycle length for 4 rows and 2 columns is `(2 * 4 - 2) * 2 = 12`.
- The full cycles are `9 // 12 = 0` with `9 % 12 = 9` remaining questions.
- During the remaining questions, the program incorrectly updates `max_questions` and `min_questions`.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly handle the remaining questions phase by properly updating `max_questions` and `min_questions` based on the current direction and the remaining questions.

Since the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, the correctness is **False**.
