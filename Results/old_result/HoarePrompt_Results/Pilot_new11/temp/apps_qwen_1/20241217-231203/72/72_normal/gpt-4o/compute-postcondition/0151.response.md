Postcondition: ***`col` is 1, `remaining_questions` must still be greater than 0, `m` must still be greater than 0, `sergei_questions` is equal to its initial value plus 1. 

- If `direction == 1` and the condition `row == x` and `col == y` is true, then `max_questions` is its initial value plus 1 and `row` is -2.
- If the condition `row == x` and `col == y` is false, then `max_questions` is its initial value minus 1 and `row` is 2.
- `direction` remains as 1 in both cases.***
