Postcondition: ***`remaining_questions` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `col` is 2. If `row == x` and `col == y`, then `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1. If `direction == 1`, `max_questions` is the original value plus 1, and `row` is updated according to the if condition: if `row == n`, then `row` is set to 0 and `direction` is set to -1, otherwise `row` is the original value of `row` plus `direction`. Otherwise, `max_questions` is decreased by 1, `row` is increased by 2, and `direction` is 1. The state of `sergei_questions` depends on whether the condition `row == x` and `col == y` is met in the if part.***
