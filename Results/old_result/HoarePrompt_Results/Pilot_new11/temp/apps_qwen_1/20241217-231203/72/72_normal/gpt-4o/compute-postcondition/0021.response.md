According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `col` and `m`. The loop will execute as long as `m` is at least 1 because the `range(m)` function will generate numbers from 0 to `m-1`.

Given that `remaining_questions` must be greater than 0 before the loop starts, we need to ensure that the loop condition is met. The loop will iterate for each value of `col` in the range from 0 to `m-1`, but the minimum value of `m` that allows the loop to execute at least once is 1.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `m` is at least 1 and `col` starts at 0.

State: **`remaining_questions` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `col` is 0**
