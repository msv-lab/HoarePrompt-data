- If \(n = 1\), the `full_cycle_length` calculation is incorrect because it should be simply \(m\). This should be adjusted to handle this case correctly.
- The annotation mentions that `sergei_questions` is updated in the if-else block, but the code logic is incomplete. Specifically, the code snippet inside the else block is missing the closing parenthesis for the ternary operation, which could lead to incorrect results.
- The `full_cycle_length` should be recalculated as \(m\) when \(n = 1\).
- The `sergei_questions` calculation in the else block should be completed to ensure correct logic.
