`direction` is assigned the value `1`. The value of `col` remains `1`, `remaining_questions` remains greater than `0`, `m` remains greater than `0`, `sergei_questions` is equal to its initial value plus `1`, and `row` is either `-2`, `0`, or `2` depending on the value of `direction`, which now is `1`.

Output State: **`col` is 1, `remaining_questions` must still be greater than 0, `m` must still be greater than 0, `sergei_questions` is equal to its initial value plus 1, `max_questions` is its initial value minus 1, `row` is either `-2`, `0`, or `2` depending on the value of `direction`, and `direction` is 1.**
