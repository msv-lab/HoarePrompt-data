The code sets the variable `direction` to `-1`. This changes the value of `direction` from its previous value (which was unchanged in the initial state). The other variables remain in their initial states.

Output State: **`row` is unchanged + `direction`, `col` is increased by 1, `direction` is -1, `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1, `max_questions` is unchanged + 1, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `initial_value` is unchanged**
