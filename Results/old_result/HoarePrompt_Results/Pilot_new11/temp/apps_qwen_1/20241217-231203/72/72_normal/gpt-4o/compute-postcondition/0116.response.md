Postcondition: ***`row` and `col` are integers. `direction` is unchanged. `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1. `max_questions` is unchanged. `x` and `y` are unchanged. `initial_value` is unchanged. If `direction` is 1 and `row` equals `n`, then `row` becomes `row - 2` and `direction` becomes -1. Otherwise, `row` is increased by `direction` or by 3 if `row` equals -1, and `col` is increased by 1.***
