`row` is incremented by `direction`, which is equal to 1. The value of `remaining_questions` and `m` remains unchanged since they are not affected by this line of code. The value of `direction` also remains unchanged as it is only being used in the addition operation.

Output State: **`remaining_questions` must be greater than 1, `m` must be greater than 0, `direction` is equal to 1, `row` is increased by 1**
