The variable `direction` is assigned the value `-1`. This change affects only the `direction` variable, and the values of the other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `remaining_questions` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 0, the current value of `col` is 2, `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1 if `row == x` and `col == y`; otherwise, `sergei_questions` remains unchanged; `max_questions` is the original value plus 1, `row` is the original value of `row` plus `-1`, and `direction` is `-1`.
