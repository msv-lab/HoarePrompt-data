`max_questions` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `max_questions` is not explicitly given, but it is stated that `max_questions` is its initial value plus 1. After the increment, `max_questions` will be its initial value plus 2. The other variables (`col`, `remaining_questions`, `m`, `sergei_questions`, `row`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`col` is 2, `remaining_questions` must still be greater than 0, `m` must still be greater than 0, `sergei_questions` is equal to its initial value plus 1, `max_questions` is its initial value plus 2, `row` must still be either -2 or 2.**
