The value of `row` is increased by 1 initially, and then the code `row -= 2` decreases `row` by 2. Since `row` was increased by 1 previously, its new value is `row = n + 1 - 2`, which simplifies to `row = n - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`remaining_questions` must be greater than 1, `m` must be greater than 0, `direction` is equal to -1, `row` is equal to `n - 1**
