Postcondition: ***`col` is 2, `remaining_questions` must still be greater than 0, `m` must still be greater than 0, `sergei_questions` is equal to its initial value plus 1. Depending on the value of `direction` and `row`, `max_questions` is either its initial value plus 2 or its initial value. `row` can be -3, -1, -2, 0, 2, or 4.***

This postcondition summarizes both the if and else parts, considering all possible outcomes of the if condition and the corresponding updates to the variables.
