Postcondition: ***`row` is increased by `direction`; `sergei_questions` remains unchanged unless `row == x and col == y`, in which case it is `initial_value + 1`; `max_questions` is decreased by 1. If `row == -1`, then `row` is set to `direction + row + 2`. Otherwise, the state remains as per the if part.***
