Postcondition: ***`remaining_questions` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `col` is 0, `sergei_questions` is equal to its initial value plus 1. Depending on the value of `direction`:
- If `direction == 1`, then `max_questions` is equal to its initial value plus 1 and `row` equals `col - 3`.
- If `direction != 1`, then `max_questions` is equal to its initial value minus 1, and `row` is either `-1` or `1`, with `direction` being `1` if `row` is `1`. The value of `col` remains `y`.***
