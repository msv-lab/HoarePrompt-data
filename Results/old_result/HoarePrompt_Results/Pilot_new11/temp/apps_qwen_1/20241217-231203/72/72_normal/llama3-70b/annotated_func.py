#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, k, x, and y are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, and 1 ≤ x ≤ n, 1 ≤ y ≤ m.
def func():
    n, m, k, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    max_asked = (k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)
    min_asked = max(1, max_asked - (n - 1))
    sergei_asked = (k + x - 1) // (2 * n) + ((k + x - 1) % (2 * n) >= n - x + 1)
    print(max_asked, min_asked, sergei_asked)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func()` accepts five integer parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y`. It calculates and prints three values based on these parameters: `max_asked`, `min_asked`, and `sergei_asked`. The calculations involve determining the maximum and minimum number of times a certain action can be performed given the constraints, and calculating the specific action performed by a character named Sergei. The function does not return any value but modifies the output stream by printing the calculated values. Potential edge cases include invalid inputs for `k` (e.g., negative values), which are not handled in the code. Additionally, the code assumes valid ranges for `x` and `y` (1 to `n` and 1 to `m` respectively), but does not explicitly check these conditions.
