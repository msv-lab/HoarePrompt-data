The code assigns the value `-1` to the variable `direction`. This assignment does not affect the values of `remaining_questions`, `m`, `col`, `max_questions`, or `row`. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `direction`.

Output State: **`remaining_questions` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 0, the current value of `col` is 1, `max_questions` is incremented by 1, `row` is increased by `direction`, `direction` is -1**
