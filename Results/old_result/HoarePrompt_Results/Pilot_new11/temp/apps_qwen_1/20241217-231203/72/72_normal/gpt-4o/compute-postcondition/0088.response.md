Postcondition: ***`remaining_questions` must be greater than 1, `m` must be greater than 0. If `direction` is equal to -1 and `row` is equal to `n - 1`, then `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `sergei_questions` remains unchanged, `max_questions` is reduced by 1, and `row` is either 2 (if `row == -1` is true) or increased by `direction` (if `row == -1` is false).***
