Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `remaining_questions` must be greater than 1.
   - `m` must be greater than 0.
   - If `direction` is equal to -1 and `row` is equal to `n - 1`, then `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `sergei_questions` remains unchanged, `max_questions` is reduced by 1, and `row` is either 2 (if `row == -1` is true) or increased by `direction` (if `row == -1` is false).

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for col in range(m):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis of the Loop:**
   - The loop runs for each `col` in the range from 0 to `m-1`.
   - Each iteration of the loop does not directly change `remaining_questions`, `m`, `sergei_questions`, `max_questions`, or `row`. Instead, these variables are updated inside the loop based on certain conditions.

4. **Conditions Inside the Loop:**
   - Since the loop body is omitted, we need to consider the general behavior and how it affects the variables. The key points are:
     - `sergei_questions` might be incremented if `direction` is -1 and `row` is `n - 1`.
     - Otherwise, `max_questions` is reduced by 1, and `row` is updated.

5. **State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will execute again if `remaining_questions` is still greater than 1 and `m` is still greater than 0.
   - The values of `sergei_questions` and `max_questions` will depend on the loop body, but since it's not specified, we assume they remain as they are unless explicitly changed.
   - The value of `row` will be updated according to the condition inside the loop.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should reflect that the loop can continue as long as the conditions on `remaining_questions` and `m` are met.

**State:**
**`remaining_questions` must be greater than 1, `m` must be greater than 0.**

Since the exact changes to `sergei_questions`, `max_questions`, and `row` are not specified in the loop body, we cannot provide specific values for them. Therefore, the focus remains on the conditions that must be true for the loop to continue.
