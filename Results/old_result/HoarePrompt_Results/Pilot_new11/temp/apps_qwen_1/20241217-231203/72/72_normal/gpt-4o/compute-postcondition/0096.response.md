Postcondition: ***`row` is either `x + direction` or `x - 3` depending on the condition `row == n`. If `row == n`, then `row` becomes `x - 3`, `col` remains `y`, `sergei_questions` is set to `initial_value + 1` if `x - 1 == x and y == y` is true, else `sergei_questions` remains unchanged; `max_questions` is increased by 1, and `direction` is `-1`. If the condition `row == n` is false, `sergei_questions` and `max_questions` remain unchanged.***
