`direction` is assigned the value `-1`. The value of `remaining_questions`, `m`, `row`, and `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `remaining_questions` must be greater than 1, `m` must be greater than 0, `direction` is equal to -1, `row` is increased by 1, the current value of `row` equals `n`.

Output State: **`remaining_questions` must be greater than 1, `m` must be greater than 0, `direction` is equal to -1, `row` is increased by 1, the current value of `row` equals `n`**
