`visited[x]` is assigned the value `True`. This means that the `x`th element in the `visited` list is now `True`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting elements from index 1 to index `n` (inclusive) of `data`, `b` is a sublist of `data` starting from the `n+2`th element to the end, `b` will be updated to be a list of integers converted from elements of `data` from index `n+1` to index `2*n+1`, `visited` is a list of `n` elements, with the `x`th element set to `True`, `cycles` is an empty list, `cycle` is an empty list, `x` is the value of `i` and must be within the range `[0, n-1]`**
