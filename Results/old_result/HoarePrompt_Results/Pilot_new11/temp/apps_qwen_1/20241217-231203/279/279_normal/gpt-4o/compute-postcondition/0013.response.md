`cycle.append(x)` adds the value of `x` to the list `cycle`. Since `x` is the value of `i` and must be within the range `[0, n-1]`, the value of `x` is added to the list `cycle`. The states of the other variables are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 0; `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting elements from index 1 to index `n` (inclusive) of `data`; `b` is a sublist of `data` starting from the `n+2`th element to the end; `b` will be updated to be a list of integers converted from elements of `data` from index `n+1` to index `2*n+1`; `visited` is a list of `n` elements, with the `x`th element set to `True`; `cycles` is an empty list; `cycle` is now a list containing the value of `x`; `x` is the value of `i` and must be within the range `[0, n-1]`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting elements from index 1 to index `n` (inclusive) of `data`; `b` is a sublist of `data` starting from the `n+2`th element to the end; `b` will be updated to be a list of integers converted from elements of `data` from index `n+1` to index `2*n+1`; `visited` is a list of `n` elements, with the `x`th element set to `True`; `cycles` is an empty list; `cycle` is now a list containing the value of `x`; `x` is the value of `i` and must be within the range `[0, n-1]`**.
