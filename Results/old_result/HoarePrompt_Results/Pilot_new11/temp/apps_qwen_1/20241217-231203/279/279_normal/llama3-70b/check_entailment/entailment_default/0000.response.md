Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case. Specifically, the code counts the number of positions where `p[i]` is not equal to `i + 1` and the number of positions where `b[i]` is 0. However, this does not guarantee that every skewer will visit each of the 2n placements.

For instance, consider the following input:

```
4
4 3 2 1
0 0 0 0
```

- The permutation `p` is `[4, 3, 2, 1]`.
- The sequence `b` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`.

According to the code, the answer would be 4 because `p[i]` is not equal to `i + 1` for all positions and `b[i]` is 0 for all positions. However, this does not ensure that each skewer will visit each of the 2n placements. In this case, reversing the direction does not help because the permutation itself does not allow for a complete traversal.

A correct solution would involve ensuring that the permutation allows for a cycle that covers all positions and their reversed versions. The current implementation does not account for the need to create such a cycle, making it incorrect for the given problem.
