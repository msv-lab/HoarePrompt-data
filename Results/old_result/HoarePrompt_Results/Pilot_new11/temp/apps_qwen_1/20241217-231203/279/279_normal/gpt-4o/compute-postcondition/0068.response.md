Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `p` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, `visited` is a list of `n` elements where all elements are `True`, `cycles` is a list containing all the cycles found during the loop execution, each cycle is a list of integers representing the sequence of indices `x` followed during the loop execution, `no_reverse_components` is the count of cycles in `cycles` where every element satisfies `b[x] == 0`. The output of the program is `0` if `len(cycles) == 1`, otherwise it is `no_reverse_components` if it is greater than 0, otherwise 1.***
