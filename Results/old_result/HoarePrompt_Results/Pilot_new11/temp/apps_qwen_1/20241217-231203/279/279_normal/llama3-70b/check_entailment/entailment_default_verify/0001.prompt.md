You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Pavel cooks barbecue. There are n skewers, they lay on a brazier in a row, each on one of n positions. Pavel wants each skewer to be cooked some time in every of n positions in two directions: in the one it was directed originally and in the reversed direction.

Pavel has a plan: a permutation p and a sequence b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n}, consisting of zeros and ones. Each second Pavel move skewer on position i to position p_{i}, and if b_{i} equals 1 then he reverses it. So he hope that every skewer will visit every position in both directions.

Unfortunately, not every pair of permutation p and sequence b suits Pavel. What is the minimum total number of elements in the given permutation p and the given sequence b he needs to change so that every skewer will visit each of 2n placements? Note that after changing the permutation should remain a permutation as well.

There is no problem for Pavel, if some skewer visits some of the placements several times before he ends to cook. In other words, a permutation p and a sequence b suit him if there is an integer k (k ≥ 2n), so that after k seconds each skewer visits each of the 2n placements.

It can be shown that some suitable pair of permutation p and sequence b exists for any n.


-----Input-----

The first line contain the integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) — the number of skewers.

The second line contains a sequence of integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n} (1 ≤ p_{i} ≤ n) — the permutation, according to which Pavel wants to move the skewers.

The third line contains a sequence b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n} consisting of zeros and ones, according to which Pavel wants to reverse the skewers.


-----Output-----

Print single integer — the minimum total number of elements in the given permutation p and the given sequence b he needs to change so that every skewer will visit each of 2n placements.


-----Examples-----
Input
4
4 3 2 1
0 1 1 1

Output
2

Input
3
2 3 1
0 0 0

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first example Pavel can change the permutation to 4, 3, 1, 2.

In the second example Pavel can change any element of b to 1.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if p[i] != i + 1:
            ans += 1
        if b[i] == 0:
            ans += 1
    print(ans)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the program assumes that any skewer not already in its correct position or not requiring reversal will need to be changed, which is not necessarily true.

Consider the following case:

Input:
```
3
1 3 2
0 0 0
```

Expected output:
```
1
```

However, the program outputs:
```
3
```

The program increments `ans` for each skewer not in its correct position and each `b[i]` that is 0. This is incorrect because it overcounts the changes needed. In this example, only one change is needed: reversing the second skewer (at index 1). The first and third skewers do not need to be moved, and the first skewer does not need to be reversed since it is already in its correct position initially.

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle all cases and thus is incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `p`, and `b`. 

- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `p` is a permutation of length `n` consisting of integers from 1 to `n`.
- `b` is a sequence of `n` integers consisting only of 0s and 1s.

After executing the function, the final state of the program is:
- The variable `ans` contains the count of positions where either `p[i]` does not equal `i + 1` or `b[i]` equals 0.
- The function prints the value of `ans`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- If `b` contains any 0, the function will increment `ans` for each such position, and the printed value of `ans` will reflect this.
- If all elements in `b` are 1, the function will only increment `ans` for positions where `p[i]` does not equal `i + 1`.
- The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the result. Therefore, the postcondition about returning `False` or `True` based on the content of `b` is incorrect.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
