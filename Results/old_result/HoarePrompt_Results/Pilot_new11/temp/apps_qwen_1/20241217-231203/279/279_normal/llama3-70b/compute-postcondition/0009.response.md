The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Given the initial state, `ans` is initially 1 if there exists at least one index `i` such that `p[i]` is not equal to `i + 1`. The code does not depend on the actual values of `p` or `b`, only modifying `ans`. Therefore, the value of `ans` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `ans` is 2, since `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` from its initial value of 1, and all other variables remain unchanged with their initial conditions.**
