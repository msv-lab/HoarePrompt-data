`temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The original value of `temp_counter` was `n + 1`. After incrementing, `temp_counter` becomes `(n + 1) + 1`, which simplifies to `n + 2`. The states of the other variables (`examples`, `i`, and `files_set`) are not affected.

Output State: **`examples` must have at least one file, `i` is 0, `temp_counter` is `n + 2`, the current value of `examples[0]` is not equal to the string `str(0 + 1)`, and `str(n + 1)` must be in `files_set`.**
