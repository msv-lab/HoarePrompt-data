`temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Initially, `temp_counter` is `n + 2`. Since `n` is at least 2, `temp_counter` is at least 4. After incrementing `temp_counter` by 1, `temp_counter` becomes `n + 3`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`examples` must have at least one file, `i` is 0, `temp_counter` is `n + 3`, the current value of `examples[0]` is not equal to the string `str(0 + 1)`, `n` must be at least 2, and `str(n + 2)` must be in `files_set`**
