`temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `temp_counter` was such that `temp_counter + 1` was less than or equal to `2 * n` and `str(temp_counter + 1)` was in `files_set`. After incrementing, `temp_counter` will now be equal to the previous value plus 1, and the condition `temp_counter + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n` should still hold true, as well as `str(temp_counter + 1)` being in `files_set`.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is equal to its previous value plus 1, `temp_counter + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, and `str(temp_counter + 1)` is in `files_set`**
