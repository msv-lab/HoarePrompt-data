`files` is updated by appending a new tuple `(name, int(type_))` to the list. The variables `n` and `name` and `type_` are used in this operation, and since they are not re-assigned, their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated list `files` and the unchanged variables `n`, `name`, and `type_`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `files` is a list containing tuples `(name, int(type_))` plus one more tuple `(name, int(type_))`, `name` is a string from the input, `type_` is an integer from the input**
