The code `print(line)` prints the value of the variable `line`. Since `line` is the second element of `script` in the initial state, printing `line` does not change its value. Therefore, after executing the code, `line` remains the second element of `script`.

Output State: **`script` is a non-empty iterable that must have at least two elements, `line` is the second element of `script`, and `line` is printed.**
