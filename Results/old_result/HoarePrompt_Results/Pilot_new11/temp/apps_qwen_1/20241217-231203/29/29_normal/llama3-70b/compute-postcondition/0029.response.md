Let's analyze the loop and its effect on the variables step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 100000 inclusive.
- `examples` is a list of strings with at least `n` elements.
- `i` is initially set to `n`.
- `file` is the `n`-th element in `examples`.
- `script` is a list containing the strings `'move {file} {i}'`, `'move {file} {i-1}'`, ..., `'move {file} 2'`, `'move {file} 1'`.

### Loop Code:
```
for i, file in enumerate(regular, start=len(examples) + 1):
    script.append(f'move {file} {i}')
```

### Analysis of the Loop:
- The loop uses `enumerate` with `start=len(examples) + 1`. This means the loop starts iterating from `len(examples) + 1`.
- For each iteration, `i` takes the value of the current index (which is `len(examples) + 1` or higher), and `file` is set to the corresponding element in `regular`.

### Conditions for Loop Execution:
- The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `regular` starting from `len(examples) + 1`.
- If `regular` has fewer elements than `len(examples) + 1`, the loop will not execute at all.

### Determining the Output State After All Iterations:
1. **If the loop does not execute:**
   - `n` is still within the initial bounds (1 to 100000).
   - `examples` remains unchanged.
   - `i` is still `n`.
   - `file` is still the `n`-th element in `examples`.
   - `script` contains the initial list of move commands: `['move {file} {i}', 'move {file} {i-1}', ..., 'move {file} 2', 'move {file} 1']`.

2. **If the loop executes:**
   - The loop continues until there are no more elements in `regular` starting from `len(examples) + 1`.
   - Each iteration appends a new move command to `script` of the form `f'move {file} {i}'`, where `i` starts from `len(examples) + 1` and increments by 1 for each iteration.
   - `i` will take the value of the index in `regular` plus `len(examples) + 1`.
   - `file` will be the corresponding element in `regular`.

### Final Output State:
- If the loop executes completely:
  - `n` is still within the initial bounds (1 to 100000).
  - `examples` remains unchanged.
  - `i` is the last index value from the loop, which is `len(examples) + len(regular)`.
  - `file` is the last element from `regular`.
  - `script` contains all the move commands from the loop.

- If the loop does not execute:
  - `n` is still within the initial bounds (1 to 100000).
  - `examples` remains unchanged.
  - `i` is still `n`.
  - `file` is still the `n`-th element in `examples`.
  - `script` contains the initial list of move commands: `['move {file} {i}', 'move {file} {i-1}', ..., 'move {file} 2', 'move {file} 1']`.

### Final Output State:
**Output State:**
- `n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 100000 inclusive.
- `examples` is a list of strings with at least `n` elements.
- `i` is either `n` (if the loop does not execute) or the last index value from the loop, which is `len(examples) + len(regular)` (if the loop executes).
- `file` is either the `n`-th element in `examples` (if the loop does not execute) or the last element from `regular` (if the loop executes).
- `script` is a list containing all the move commands from the loop, starting from `f'move {file} {i}'` and decrementing `i` until it reaches 1.
