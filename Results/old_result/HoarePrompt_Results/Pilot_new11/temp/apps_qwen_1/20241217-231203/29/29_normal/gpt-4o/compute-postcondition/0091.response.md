`temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` remains `len(examples) + 1`, `temp_counter` was less than `2 * n + 1` and is now incremented by 1, it is still in `files_set`, `examples` is a list where each element is equal to its index, `moves` includes the move operation `f'move {regulars[i]} {target}'`, `len(regulars)` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `target` is `2 * len(examples) + 2`. 

Output State: **`i` is `len(examples) + 1`, `temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 1` and is still less than `2 * n + 1`, `temp_counter` is in `files_set`, `examples` is a list where each element is equal to its index, `moves` includes the move operation `f'move {regulars[i]} {target}'`, `len(regulars)` must be greater than or equal to 1, `target` is `2 * len(examples) + 2`**
