According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop runs `n` times, and at the end of each iteration, `n` is decremented by 1. Therefore, if the loop is to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is `n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 0.

Additionally, `files` is a list containing tuples `(name, int(type_))` and the newly added tuple `(name, int(type_))`. This tuple is already in the list, so it does not affect the loop condition directly.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `files` is a list containing tuples `(name, int(type_))` and the newly added tuple `(name, int(type_))`**
