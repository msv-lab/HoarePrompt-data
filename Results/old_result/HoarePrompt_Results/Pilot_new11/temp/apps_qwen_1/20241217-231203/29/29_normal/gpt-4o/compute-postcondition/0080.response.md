`regulars[i]` is assigned the string representation of `temp_counter`. Since `temp_counter` is equal to `2 * n + len(files_set)`, it will now be a string. The variable `moves` will have a new entry added to it, but the contents of `moves` are not relevant to the updated state of the variables. The precondition that `temp_counter` must have been in `files_set` throughout the iterations remains unchanged.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is equal to '2 * n + len(files_set)', and `temp_counter` must have been in `files_set` throughout the iterations; `regulars[i]` is a string representation of `temp_counter`.**
