Postcondition: ***`i` is 7, `temp_counter` is the smallest value such that `temp_counter > 2 * n` or `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set` + 1, `examples` is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], `moves` includes the move operation `f'move {str(temp_counter + 1)} 18'`, `len(regulars)` must be greater than or equal to 1, `target` is 18. If `regulars[7]` is not equal to `str(target)`, `temp_counter` is updated to the smallest value such that `temp_counter > 2 * n` or `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`. If `regulars[7]` is equal to `str(target)`, no changes are made.***
