To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

### Given Information:
- The loop condition is `while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:`.
- The state at the end of the previous iteration is:
  - `i` is 2,
  - `temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 1` (meaning it has incremented by 1),
  - `moves` contains the string `'move {examples[1]} 2'`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition Breakdown**:
   - The loop continues as long as `temp_counter <= 2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`.

2. **Current State**:
   - Since `temp_counter` has incremented by 1 from the previous iteration, we need to check the updated value of `temp_counter`.
   - Let's assume the value of `temp_counter` at the end of the previous iteration was `k`. After incrementing, `temp_counter` is now `k + 1`.

3. **Loop Condition**:
   - For the loop to continue, both conditions must be true:
     1. `temp_counter <= 2 * n`
     2. `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`

4. **Ensuring the Loop Can Execute Again**:
   - To ensure the loop executes again, `temp_counter` must still satisfy the condition `temp_counter <= 2 * n`.
   - Additionally, `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`.

5. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - Since `temp_counter` has already incremented by 1, the new value of `temp_counter` is `k + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `k + 1` must be less than or equal to `2 * n` and `str(k + 1)` must be in `files_set`.

### Conclusion:
The state at the end of the previous iteration is `temp_counter = k`. After incrementing, `temp_counter` becomes `k + 1`. Therefore, the state must be adjusted to ensure `k + 1` satisfies the loop condition.

- Ensure `k + 1 <= 2 * n`.
- Ensure `str(k + 1)` is in `files_set`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`temp_counter` must be such that `temp_counter + 1 <= 2 * n` and `str(temp_counter + 1)` must be in `files_set`**
