The code splits the input into two parts, `name` and `type_`, and assigns them to the respective variables. This means the value of `n` is reduced by 1 because `n` is now `n - 1`. The list `files` remains unchanged, and the new `name` and `type_` are added to it as a new tuple.

Output State: **`n` is now `n - 1`, `files` is a list containing tuples `(name, int(type_))` and the previously existing tuple, `name` is the first part of the input, `type_` is the second part of the input**
