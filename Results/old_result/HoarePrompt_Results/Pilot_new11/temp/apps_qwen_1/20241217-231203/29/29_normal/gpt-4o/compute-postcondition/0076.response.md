Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Current Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`.

2. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `temp_counter` is in `files_set`.
   - `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n`.
   - `temp_counter` is increased by 1 (implying we are entering the next iteration).

3. **Loop Continuation Condition**:
   - For the loop to continue, two conditions must be met:
     1. `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`.
     2. `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`.

4. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - Since `temp_counter` has already been incremented, the new value of `temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 1`.
   - We need to ensure that the new value of `temp_counter` satisfies both conditions of the loop.

5. **Condition Analysis**:
   - The new `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`.
   - The string representation of the new `temp_counter` (`str(temp_counter + 1)`) must be in `files_set`.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state such that `temp_counter + 1` meets the criteria.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `temp_counter` should be in `files_set`.
- `temp_counter + 1` should be less than or equal to `2 * n`.
- `str(temp_counter + 1)` should be in `files_set`.

State: **`temp_counter` is in `files_set`, `temp_counter + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, and `str(temp_counter + 1)` is in `files_set`**
