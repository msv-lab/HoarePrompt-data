To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop statement.

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer representing the number of files.
- `files` is a list of strings with all files.
- `examples` is a list containing all names of files with type "1".
- `regulars` is a list containing all names of files with type "0".
- `moves` is an empty list.
- `temp_counter` is `n + 1`.

### Loop Statement:
```
for i in range(len(examples)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`**: The loop runs from `0` to `len(examples) - 1`. Therefore, `i` must be within this range for the loop to execute correctly.
2. **Length of `examples`**: The loop will run as long as there are elements in the `examples` list. Hence, `examples` must have at least one element.

### Required Adjustments:
- `temp_counter` is set to `n + 1`, which means `temp_counter` will always be greater than `n`. This is fine and does not affect the loop execution.
- Since the loop iterates over `range(len(examples))`, `examples` must have at least one file for the loop to start executing. Therefore, `len(examples)` should be greater than or equal to 1.
- `i` will start from 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `len(examples) - 1`. Thus, `i` will be 0 in the first iteration.

### Final State Adjustment:
- `examples` must have at least one file.
- `i` must be 0 in the first iteration.
- `temp_counter` is already set to `n + 1` and does not need adjustment.

### Answer:
State: **`examples` must have at least one file, `i` is 0, `temp_counter` is `n + 1`**
