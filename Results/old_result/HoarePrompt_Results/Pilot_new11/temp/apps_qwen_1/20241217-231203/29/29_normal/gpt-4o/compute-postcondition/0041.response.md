To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the conditions of the while loop:

The loop condition is:
```python
while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
```

This means two conditions must be met for the loop to continue:
1. `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`.
2. The string representation of `temp_counter` must be in the `files_set`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `temp_counter` is `(2 * n) + 1`

Let's analyze each condition:

1. **Condition 1: `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`**
   - Currently, `temp_counter` is `(2 * n) + 1`.
   - This is already not satisfied because `(2 * n) + 1` is greater than `2 * n`.

Since the first condition is not met, we don't need to adjust this condition further.

2. **Condition 2: `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`**
   - Since `temp_counter` is `(2 * n) + 1`, `str(temp_counter)` would be `str((2 * n) + 1)`.
   - For the loop to continue, `str((2 * n) + 1)` must be in `files_set`.

Given that the first condition is already not satisfied, we don't need to consider the second condition for the loop to execute one more time because the loop would terminate due to the first condition failing.

Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to proceed.

**Final State:**
State: **`i` is 1, `temp_counter` is `(2 * n) + 1`**
