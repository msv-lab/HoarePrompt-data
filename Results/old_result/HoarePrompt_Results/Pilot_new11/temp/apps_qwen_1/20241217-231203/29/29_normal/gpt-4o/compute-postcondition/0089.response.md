`temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `temp_counter` is at most `2 * n`, so after the increment, `temp_counter` is at most `2 * n + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `len(examples) + 1`, `temp_counter` is at most `2 * n + 1`, `examples` is a list where each element is equal to its index, `moves` includes the move operation `f'move {regulars[i]} {target}'`, `len(regulars)` must be greater than or equal to 1, `target` is `2 * len(examples) + 2`**
