To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the condition of the `while` loop and analyze the current state:

The `while` loop condition is:
```python
while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Current State:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 2`

2. **Loop Condition Analysis:**
   - The loop continues as long as `temp_counter <= 2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`.

3. **First Condition: `temp_counter <= 2 * n`:**
   - Currently, `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 2`.
   - For the loop to continue, `2 * n + 2` should be less than or equal to `2 * n`.
   - This is clearly false since `2 * n + 2` is always greater than `2 * n`.

4. **Second Condition: `str(temp_counter)` in `files_set`:**
   - We need to check if `str(2 * n + 2)` is in `files_set`.
   - Since `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 2`, `str(temp_counter)` is `str(2 * n + 2)`.
   - We don't know if this string is in `files_set` based on the given information.

### Conclusion:
- The first condition `temp_counter <= 2 * n` is already false because `2 * n + 2` is always greater than `2 * n`.
- Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `temp_counter` becomes less than or equal to `2 * n`.

### Adjusted State:
- To make the loop execute at least once, `temp_counter` must be set to a value that satisfies `temp_counter <= 2 * n`.

Since `temp_counter` is currently `2 * n + 2`, we need to reduce it by 2 to satisfy the condition `temp_counter <= 2 * n`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 1, `temp_counter` must be 2 * n**
