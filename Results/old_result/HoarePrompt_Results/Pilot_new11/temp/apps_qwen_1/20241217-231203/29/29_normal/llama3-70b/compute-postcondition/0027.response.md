Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `n` is less than or equal to `len(examples) + 2`
- `file` is the `(n + 1)`-th element in `examples`
- `i` is `n + 1`
- `script` includes the value `f'move {file} {i}'`

### For Loop Statement
```
for (i, file) in enumerate(regular, start=len(examples) + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than the length of `regular`.
2. **Current Values**:
   - `i` is currently `n + 1`
   - `file` is the `(n + 1)`-th element in `examples`
   - `script` is initialized with `f'move {file} {i}'`

### Step-by-Step Adjustment for the Next Iteration
1. **Update `i`**:
   - The `enumerate` function starts from `len(examples) + 1` and increments `i` by 1 for each iteration.
   - Therefore, `i` will be incremented to `n + 2`.

2. **Update `file`**:
   - Since `file` is the `(n + 1)`-th element in `examples`, in the next iteration, it will be the `(n + 2)`-th element in `examples`.

3. **Update `script`**:
   - The `script` will now include the value `f'move {file} {i}'` where `i` is updated to `n + 2`.

### New State
- `n` remains the same since it does not change within the loop.
- `i` becomes `n + 2`.
- `file` becomes the `(n + 2)`-th element in `examples`.
- `script` is updated to `f'move {file} {i}'` with `i` being `n + 2`.

### Final Answer
State: **`n` is less than or equal to `len(examples) + 2`, `i` is `n + 2`, `file` is the `(n + 2)`-th element in `examples`, `script` includes the value `f'move {file} {n + 2}'`**.
