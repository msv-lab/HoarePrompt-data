`regulars` appends the value of `name`, which is "example". This means that the list `regulars` now includes "example". The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `name` is "example", `type_` is "1", `files` is a list of strings with at least one file (reduced by one), `examples` is an empty list or includes "example", `regulars` is an empty list or contains "example" and now also contains "example".
