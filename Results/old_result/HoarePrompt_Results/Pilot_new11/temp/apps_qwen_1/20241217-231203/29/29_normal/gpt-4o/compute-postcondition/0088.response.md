Let's break down the given conditions and the `while` loop to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute at least once.

### Given Information:
- `i` is `len(examples) + 1`
- `temp_counter` is at most `2 * n + len(examples)`
- `examples` is a list where each element is equal to its index
- `moves` includes the move operation `f'move {regulars[i]} {target}'`
- `len(regulars)` must be greater than or equal to 1
- `target` is `2 * len(examples) + 2`

### `while` Loop Condition:
```
while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Condition 1:** `temp_counter <= 2 * n`
   - `temp_counter` is at most `2 * n + len(examples)`.
   - For the loop to execute, `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`.
   - This means `temp_counter` should be at most `2 * n` (since it is at most `2 * n + len(examples)`).

2. **Condition 2:** `str(temp_counter) in files_set`
   - The string representation of `temp_counter` must be in the set `files_set`.

### Current State Before the Loop:
- `i` is `len(examples) + 1`
- `temp_counter` is at most `2 * n + len(examples)`
- `target` is `2 * len(examples) + 2`

### Adjustments Needed:
1. **Adjust `temp_counter`:**
   - Since `temp_counter` must be at most `2 * n` for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `temp_counter` is within this range.
   - Currently, `temp_counter` is at most `2 * n + len(examples)`, so we need to make sure that `temp_counter` is adjusted such that it is at most `2 * n`.

2. **Ensure `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`:**
   - The string representation of `temp_counter` must be in `files_set` for the loop to execute.
   - We do not have any information about the current value of `temp_counter` or the contents of `files_set`, so we cannot directly adjust this without additional information.

### Conclusion:
- The primary adjustment needed is to ensure that `temp_counter` is at most `2 * n`.

Given these points, the adjusted state right before the loop is:

State: **`i` is `len(examples) + 1`, `temp_counter` is at most `2 * n`, `examples` is a list where each element is equal to its index, `moves` includes the move operation `f'move {regulars[i]} {target}'`, `len(regulars)` must be greater than or equal to 1, `target` is `2 * len(examples) + 2`**

If `temp_counter` is already within the required range, no further adjustments are needed. Otherwise, `temp_counter` needs to be adjusted accordingly.
