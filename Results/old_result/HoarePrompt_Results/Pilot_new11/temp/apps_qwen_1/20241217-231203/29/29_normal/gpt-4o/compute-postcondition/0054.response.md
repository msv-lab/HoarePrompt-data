Let's analyze the given loop and the conditions under which it can proceed to the next iteration:

### Given Information:
- **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
  - `i` is 1
  - `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 3`
  - `moves` contains the string 'move {examples[1]} 2'
- **Loop Condition:**
  - The loop continues as long as `temp_counter <= 2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`.

### Current Values:
- `i` is currently 1.
- `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 3`.
- The loop will check if `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and if `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`.

### Next Iteration:
- In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented to 2.
- We need to check if the loop condition will allow the loop to continue.

### Conditions for Loop Execution:
1. **Condition 1:** `temp_counter <= 2 * n`
   - At the start of the next iteration, `temp_counter` will be `2 * n + 3` (unchanged from the previous iteration).
   - Therefore, `2 * n + 3` must be less than or equal to `2 * n` for the loop to continue. This is not possible because `2 * n + 3` is always greater than `2 * n`.

2. **Condition 2:** `str(temp_counter)` in `files_set`
   - We need to ensure that `str(2 * n + 3)` is in `files_set` for the loop to continue.

Since the first condition (`temp_counter <= 2 * n`) cannot be satisfied, the loop will not proceed to the next iteration regardless of the second condition.

### Conclusion:
Given that the loop condition `temp_counter <= 2 * n` cannot be satisfied with `temp_counter = 2 * n + 3`, no adjustments to the state are needed to make the loop execute one more time.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 2, `temp_counter` is 2 * n + 3, and `moves` contains the string 'move {examples[1]} 2'**
