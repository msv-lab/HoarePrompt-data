`temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Given that `temp_counter + 1` was initially within the range `<= 2 * n` and `str(temp_counter + 1)` was in `files_set`, after incrementing `temp_counter`, the new value of `temp_counter` will still satisfy `temp_counter + 1 <= 2 * n` and `str(temp_counter + 1)` will still be in `files_set`.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 2` and still satisfies `temp_counter + 2 <= 2 * n` and `str(temp_counter + 1)` is in `files_set`**
