You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The All-Berland National Olympiad in Informatics has just ended! Now Vladimir wants to upload the contest from the Olympiad as a gym to a popular Codehorses website.

Unfortunately, the archive with Olympiad's data is a mess. For example, the files with tests are named arbitrary without any logic.

Vladimir wants to rename the files with tests so that their names are distinct integers starting from 1 without any gaps, namely, "1", "2", ..., "n', where n is the total number of tests.

Some of the files contain tests from statements (examples), while others contain regular tests. It is possible that there are no examples, and it is possible that all tests are examples. Vladimir wants to rename the files so that the examples are the first several tests, all all the next files contain regular tests only.

The only operation Vladimir can perform is the "move" command. Vladimir wants to write a script file, each of the lines in which is "move file_1 file_2", that means that the file "file_1" is to be renamed to "file_2". If there is a file "file_2" at the moment of this line being run, then this file is to be rewritten. After the line "move file_1 file_2" the file "file_1" doesn't exist, but there is a file "file_2" with content equal to the content of "file_1" before the "move" command.

Help Vladimir to write the script file with the minimum possible number of lines so that after this script is run:  all examples are the first several tests having filenames "1", "2", ..., "e", where e is the total number of examples;  all other files contain regular tests with filenames "e + 1", "e + 2", ..., "n", where n is the total number of all tests. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of files with tests.

n lines follow, each describing a file with test. Each line has a form of "name_i type_i", where "name_i" is the filename, and "type_i" equals "1", if the i-th file contains an example test, and "0" if it contains a regular test. Filenames of each file are strings of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6 characters. The filenames are guaranteed to be distinct.


-----Output-----

In the first line print the minimum number of lines in Vladimir's script file.

After that print the script file, each line should be "move file_1 file_2", where "file_1" is an existing at the moment of this line being run filename, and "file_2" — is a string of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split('\n')
n = int(data[0])
files = data[1:n + 1]
files_set = set((file.split()[0] for file in files))
moves = func_1(n, files)
print(len(moves))
for move in moves:
    print(move)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of files, and files is a list of strings where each string represents a file with its name and type separated by a space, and the type is either "1" for an example test or "0" for a regular test.
def func_1(n, files):
    examples = []
    regulars = []
    for file in files:
        name, type_ = file.split()
        
        if type_ == '1':
            examples.append(name)
        else:
            regulars.append(name)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer representing the number of files, `files` is a list of strings with all files, `examples` is a list containing all names of files with type "1", `regulars` is a list containing all names of files with type "0".
    moves = []
    temp_counter = n + 1
    for i in range(len(examples)):
        if examples[i] != str(i + 1):
            while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
                temp_counter += 1
            moves.append(f'move {examples[i]} {temp_counter}')
            examples[i] = str(temp_counter)
            temp_counter += 1
        
        if examples[i] != str(i + 1):
            moves.append(f'move {examples[i]} {i + 1}')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is equal to `len(examples)`, `temp_counter` is at most `2 * n + len(examples)`, `examples` is a list where each element is equal to its index (i.e., `str(index + 1)`), `moves` is a list containing the move operations required to achieve the correct order.
    for i in range(len(regulars)):
        target = len(examples) + i + 1
        
        if regulars[i] != str(target):
            while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
                temp_counter += 1
            moves.append(f'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}')
            regulars[i] = str(temp_counter)
            temp_counter += 1
        
        if regulars[i] != str(target):
            moves.append(f'move {regulars[i]} {target}')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: 
    return moves
    #The program returns `moves` which is the value it held prior to executing the return statement
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is an integer representing the number of files, and `files`, which is a list of strings where each string represents a file with its name and type separated by a space, and the type is either "1" for an example test or "0" for a regular test. The function processes the `files` list to separate the example tests and regular tests into two lists, `examples` and `regulars`, respectively. It then arranges the example tests such that their names match their indices plus one, and the regular tests are similarly arranged. The function performs the necessary moves to reorder the files into the correct sequence and returns a list of these moves as `moves`. 

After the function executes, the state of the program is as follows:
- `n` remains unchanged and still represents the number of files.
- `files` remains unchanged and still contains the original list of file names and types.
- `examples` is a list where each element's name matches its index plus one.
- `regulars` is a list where each element's name matches its adjusted index plus the length of the `examples` list.
- `moves` is a list of commands detailing the moves required to rearrange the files into the correct order.

The function handles the following edge cases:
- If an example file's name does not match its index plus one, the function finds a temporary position within the range `[n, 2*n]` that is not occupied by another file, moves the example file to this position, and updates its name accordingly.
- If an example file cannot find a suitable temporary position, it is moved directly to its correct position.
- Similarly, for regular files, if their name does not match their adjusted index plus the length of the `examples` list, the function finds a temporary position within the same range and moves the file there, updating its name.
- If a file cannot find a suitable temporary position, it is moved directly to its correct position.

Any missing functionality in the annotations is included in the summary, ensuring that all possible actions and states are accurately represented.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
