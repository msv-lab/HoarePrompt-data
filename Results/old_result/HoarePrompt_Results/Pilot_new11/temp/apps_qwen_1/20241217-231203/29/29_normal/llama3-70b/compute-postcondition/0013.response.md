The code creates a new list `examples` that contains the `name` from each tuple in the `files` list where the `type_` value is 1. The original order of the `files` list is preserved, but now `examples` contains only the names of the files with `type_` equal to 1. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100000 inclusive; `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a string `name` and an integer `type_`, and the list is sorted in descending order based on the `type_` value; `examples` is a list of strings which are the `name` values from the tuples in `files` where the `type_` is 1.**
