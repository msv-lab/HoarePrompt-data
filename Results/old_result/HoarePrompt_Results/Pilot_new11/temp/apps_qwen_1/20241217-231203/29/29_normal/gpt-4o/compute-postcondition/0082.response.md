Postcondition: ***`i` is equal to `len(examples)`, `temp_counter` is at most `2 * n + len(examples)`, `examples` is a list where each element is equal to its index, `moves` is a list containing the move operations required to achieve the correct order, `len(regulars)` must be greater than or equal to 1, `target` is `2 * len(examples) + 1`. If `regulars[i]` is not a string representation of `temp_counter`, then `temp_counter` is 2 * n + len(files_set) + 1 and it must have been in `files_set` throughout the iterations. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
