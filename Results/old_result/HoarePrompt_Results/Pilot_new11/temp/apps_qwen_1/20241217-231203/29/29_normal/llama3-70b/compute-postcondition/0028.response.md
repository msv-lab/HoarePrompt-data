`script` appends a new string `f'move {file} {i}'`. Given that `i` is `n + 2`, the new string will be `f'move {file} {n + 2}'`. The value of `file` remains the same, and the value of `n` also remains unchanged. The state of `total`, `num`, and `x` from the initial state is not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is less than or equal to `len(examples) + 2`, `i` is `n + 2`, `file` is the `(n + 2)`-th element in `examples`, `script` includes the strings `f'move {file} {n + 2}'` and the newly appended string `f'move {file} {i}'`**
