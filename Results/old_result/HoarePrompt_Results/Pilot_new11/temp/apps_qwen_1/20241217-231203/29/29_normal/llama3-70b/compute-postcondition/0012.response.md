The `files` list is sorted in descending order based on the second element of each tuple (i.e., `type_`). The initial state indicates that `n` is an integer between 1 and 100000 inclusive, and `files` is a list of `n` tuples, each containing a string `name` and an integer `type_`. After sorting, the `files` list will have its tuples ordered such that the `type_` values are in descending order.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100000 inclusive; `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a string `name` and an integer `type_`, and the list is sorted in descending order based on the `type_` value.**
