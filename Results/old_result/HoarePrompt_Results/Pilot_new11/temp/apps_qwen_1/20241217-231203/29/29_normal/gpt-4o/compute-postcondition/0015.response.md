The code splits the string `file` using the space character as the delimiter and assigns the resulting first part to `name` and the second part to `type_`. However, the initial state does not specify the value of `file`. For the sake of calculation, let's assume `file` is a string in the form of `"new_name new_type"`.

Given this assumption:
- The original `name` is "example".
- The original `type_` is "1".

If `file` is `"new_name new_type"`, then:
- `name` will be updated to "new_name".
- `type_` will be updated to "new_type".

The lists `files`, `examples`, and `regulars` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the code.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`name` is "new_name", `type_` is "new_type", `files` is a list of strings with at least two files, `examples` is a list containing "example", `regulars` is either an empty list or contains "example".**
