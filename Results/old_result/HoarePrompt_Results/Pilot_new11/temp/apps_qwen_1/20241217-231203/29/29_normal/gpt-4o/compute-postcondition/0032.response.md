`examples[i]` is assigned the value of `str(temp_counter)`. Given that `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 1`, `examples[i]` becomes `str(2 * n + 1)`. The value of `i` remains 0, and the other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 1`, `examples[0]` is `str(2 * n + 1)`, `str(2 * n)` must be in `files_set`, and `moves` contains the string `'move <value_of_examples[0]> 2 * n + 1'`**
