The code `break` does not affect the values of the variables `i`, `j`, `n`, `s`, `golden`, or `s[j]`. It only indicates the exit from the current loop or block of code. Since there is no loop or block being exited here, the variables retain their initial states.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is within the valid range (4 to n-1), `n` must be at least 4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S', `golden` must contain at least one index in the range [4, n-1), and the character `s[j]` is 'S'.**
