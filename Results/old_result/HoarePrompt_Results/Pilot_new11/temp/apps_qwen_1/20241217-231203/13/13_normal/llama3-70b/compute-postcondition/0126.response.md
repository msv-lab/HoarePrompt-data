The code `beauty = 1` sets the variable `beauty` to 1. The value of `beauty` is now explicitly set to 1, regardless of its previous value (which was dependent on the count of consecutive 'G's). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`max_beauty_one_swap` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `beauty`; `i` is 4; `j` is the index of the last 'G' in `s` that is at least 2 positions after 4; `n` is the length of `s`; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S'; `golden` contains all indices of 'G' in `s`; `max_beauty` is the maximum number of consecutive 'G's starting from any position in `s` that is at least 2 positions away from the current position of `i`; `beauty` is 1.**
