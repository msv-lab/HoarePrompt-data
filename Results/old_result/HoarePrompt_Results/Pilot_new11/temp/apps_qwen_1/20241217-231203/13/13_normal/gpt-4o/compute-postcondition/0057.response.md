The code assigns the start and end values of the second segment in `segments` to `prev_start` and `prev_end`, respectively. Given that `i` is 2, the second segment in `segments` is accessed. The values of `prev_start` and `prev_end` are now defined, but the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S'; `segments` is a list containing tuples of the form `(start, end)` representing segments of consecutive 'G's in `trophies`; `i` is 2; `segments` is populated with at least one segment of consecutive 'G's in `trophies`; `len(segments) > 1`; `prev_start` is the start of the second segment in `segments`; `prev_end` is the end of the second segment in `segments`; `curr_start` is the start of the third segment in `segments`; `curr_end` is the end of the third segment in `segments`; and `max_length` is 9; `prev_start` is the start of the second segment in `segments`; `prev_end` is the end of the second segment in `segments`.**
