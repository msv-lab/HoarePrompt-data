The initial state is: `left` is 2, `right` is 2, `s` is a string where `s[0]` is 'S', `s[1]` is not 'G', and `s[2]` is 'G', `max_beauty` is the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`.

The code snippet sets `curr_beauty` to 0.

Since `curr_beauty` was previously undefined and is now explicitly set to 0, the value of `curr_beauty` is updated. No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`left` is 2, `right` is 2, `s` is a string where `s[0]` is 'S', `s[1]` is not 'G', and `s[2]` is 'G', `max_beauty` is the maximum of its current value and 0, `curr_beauty` is 0**
