Let's break down the given information and the requirements for the loop to execute.

1. **Initial States:**
   - `i` is 4.
   - `j` is the index of the last 'G' in `s` that is at least 2 positions after `i`.
   - `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S'.
   - `golden` contains all indices of 'G' in `s`.
   - `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of its current value and the final value of `beauty`.
   - `beauty` is the number of consecutive 'G's found starting from `j` up to but not including `i`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `j` in the range `i + 2` to `n`.

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - For the loop to start, `j` must be within the specified range (`i + 2` to `n`).
   - Since `i` is 4, `j` must be at least 6 (i.e., `i + 2`).

Given these points, we need to adjust the states to ensure that `j` is correctly initialized and falls within the required range.

### Adjusted States:
- `i` is already 4.
- `j` should be set to the index of the last 'G' in `s` that is at least 6 (i.e., `i + 2`).
- `s` should contain at least one 'G' at an index that is at least 6.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is 4, `j` is the index of the last 'G' in `s` that is at least 6, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S', `golden` contains all indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of its current value and the final value of `beauty`, `beauty` is the number of consecutive 'G's found starting from `j` up to but not including `i`**.
