Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, we have:
   - `i` is 4
   - `j` is 1
   - `s` must contain at least one 'G' at an index that satisfies the condition for `j`.
     - If `s[j] == 'G'`, then `beauty` is increased by 1.
     - Otherwise, the range `range(i - 1, -1, -1)` remains valid.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `j` in the range `range(i - 1, -1, -1)`, which means it starts from `i - 1` and goes down to 0 (inclusive).

3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the current value of `j` must satisfy the condition to enter the loop again. Since `i` is 4, the loop will start from `i - 1`, which is 3, and go down to 0.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - The new value of `j` will be the next lower value, which is 0.
   - We need to check if `s[0]` contains 'G' or not to decide if the loop should continue.

Given the conditions:
- If `s[0] == 'G'`, then `beauty` is increased by 1.
- If `s[0] != 'G'`, the loop will stop as the range remains valid and does not change.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
- `i` remains 4.
- `j` changes to 0.
- `s` must still contain at least one 'G' at an index that satisfies the condition for `j`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
**`i` is 4, `j` is 0, `s` must contain at least one 'G' at an index that satisfies the condition for `j`**.

State: **`i` is 4, `j` is 0, `s` must contain at least one 'G' at an index that satisfies the condition for `j`**.
