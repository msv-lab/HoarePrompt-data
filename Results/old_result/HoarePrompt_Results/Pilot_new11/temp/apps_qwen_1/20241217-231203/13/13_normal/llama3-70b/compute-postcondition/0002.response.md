The code creates a list `golden` containing the indices of all characters in the string `s` that are equal to 'G'. The original values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged. The list comprehension iterates over the string `s` using `enumerate`, which provides both the index and the character at each position. For each index `i` where the character `x` is 'G', the index `i` is added to the list `golden`.

Given this, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is the integer input by the user, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices where `s` has the character 'G'**
