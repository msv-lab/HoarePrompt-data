`i` is incremented by 1. Initially, `i` is 4, so after incrementing, `i` becomes 5. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is either `[ (0, i - 1) ]` where `i` is the number of consecutive 'G's starting from index 0, `start` is 2, and `trophies[i + 1]` is not 'G', or an empty list `[]`, `i` is 5, and `trophies[4]` is 'G'**
