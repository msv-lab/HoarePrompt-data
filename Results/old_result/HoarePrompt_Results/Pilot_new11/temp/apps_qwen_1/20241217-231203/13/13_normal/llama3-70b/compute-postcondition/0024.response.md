The code `curr_beauty += 1` increments the value of `curr_beauty` by 1. Since `curr_beauty` is either 1 or remains unchanged, and given that `n` is greater than 0 and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'G' and 'S', `curr_beauty` must initially be 1 because it is described as either 1 or remains unchanged, and it would not remain unchanged unless there was a specific condition which is not mentioned here.

Therefore, after executing `curr_beauty += 1`, `curr_beauty` will become 2. All other variables retain their initial states as specified.

Output State: **`left` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices where `s` has the character 'G', `max_beauty` is the maximum of 0 and the current value of `curr_beauty` (which is now 2), `curr_beauty` is 2, `right` is 1**
