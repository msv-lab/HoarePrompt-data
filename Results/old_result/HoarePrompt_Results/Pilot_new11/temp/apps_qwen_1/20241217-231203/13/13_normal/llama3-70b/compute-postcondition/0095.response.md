The code increments the value of `beauty` by 1. Given the initial conditions, `beauty` was initially set to 1. After executing `beauty += 1`, the new value of `beauty` is 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `j` is 1, `n` is the length of `s`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S', `golden` contains all indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum number of consecutive 'G's starting from any position in `s` that is at least 2 positions away from the current position of `i`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is `max_beauty`, and `beauty` is 2, with the additional condition that `j` is currently pointing to a 'G' in the string `s`.**
