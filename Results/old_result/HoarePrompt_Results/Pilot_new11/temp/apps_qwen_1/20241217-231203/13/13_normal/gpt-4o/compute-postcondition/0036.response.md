`i` is incremented by 1, so its new value is the original value plus 1. The value of `trophies[i]` is 'G', and the condition that `n` must be greater than the new value of `i` remains true. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is the original value of `i` + 1, `trophies[i]` is 'G', and `n` must be greater than `i`.**
