The code assigns the start and end values of the third segment in the `segments` list to `prev_start` and `prev_end` respectively. Since the third segment in the `segments` list is referenced, `prev_start` and `prev_end` now hold the start and end values of this segment. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `segments` is a list containing tuples of the form `(start, end)` representing segments of consecutive 'G's in `trophies`, `segments` is populated with at least one segment of consecutive 'G's in `trophies`, `len(segments) > 1`, `prev_start` is the start of the third segment in `segments`, `prev_end` is the end of the third segment in `segments`, `curr_start` is the start of the fourth segment in `segments`, `curr_end` is the end of the fourth segment in `segments`, and `max_length` is the maximum of 9 and `length_of_current_segment + length_of_previous_segment + 2`.**
