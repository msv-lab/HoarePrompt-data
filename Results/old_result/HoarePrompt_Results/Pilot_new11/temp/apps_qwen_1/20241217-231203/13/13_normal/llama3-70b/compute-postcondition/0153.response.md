The code increments the variable `beauty` by 1. Since `s[j]` is 'G', `beauty` is incremented by 1. The values of `i`, `j`, `s`, `golden`, `max_beauty_one_swap`, and the condition for `beauty` calculation remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 4, `j` is 7, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S', `golden` contains all indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of its current value and the final value of `beauty`, `beauty` is incremented by 1**
