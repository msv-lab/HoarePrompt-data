Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `i` is 3.
   - `j` is at least 6.
   - `n` is the length of `s`.
   - `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S'.
   - `golden` contains all indices of 'G' in `s`.
   - `max_beauty` is the maximum number of consecutive 'G's starting from any position in `s` that is at least 2 positions away from the current position of `i`.
   - `max_beauty_one_swap` is the value of `max_beauty` when the loop started.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop iterates over `j` in the range from `i + 2` to `n`.

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - If `s[j] == 'G'`, then `beauty` is set to 1.
   - Otherwise, the loop or innermost block might break out.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be within the range `i + 2` to `n`.
   - Since `j` is at least 6 at the end of the previous iteration, it must be incremented for the next iteration.
   - The new value of `j` should be `j + 1` (assuming no break occurred).

5. **Other Variables:**
   - `i` remains unchanged.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `s` remains unchanged.
   - `golden` remains unchanged.
   - `max_beauty` remains unchanged unless a higher value is found during the loop.
   - `max_beauty_one_swap` remains unchanged as it is the initial value of `max_beauty`.

Given these considerations, the states to be adjusted for the next iteration of the loop are:

- `j` should be `j + 1` (assuming no break occurred).
- All other variables remain the same.

Since `j` is at least 6, the new value of `j` will be 7 (if it did not break out).

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 3, `j` is at least 7, `n` is the length of `s`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S', `golden` contains all indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum number of consecutive 'G's starting from any position in `s` that is at least 2 positions away from the current position of `i`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the value of `max_beauty` when the loop started.**
