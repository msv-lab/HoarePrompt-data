Postcondition: ***`left` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices where `s` has the character 'G', `max_beauty` is the maximum of 0 and the current value of `curr_beauty`, and `curr_beauty` is either 1 or remains unchanged.***

Explanation:
- If `s[right] == 'G'` is true, then `left` is set to 0, `curr_beauty` is set to 1, and `max_beauty` is updated to the maximum of 0 and the current value of `curr_beauty`.
- If `s[right] == 'G'` is false, then `left` becomes equal to `right`, and if `left < right`, `max_beauty` is updated to the maximum of 0 and 1, and `curr_beauty` is set to 1. Otherwise, `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty` remain unchanged.

This covers all possible outcomes of the if-else block and provides the final state of the program variables after the block executes.
