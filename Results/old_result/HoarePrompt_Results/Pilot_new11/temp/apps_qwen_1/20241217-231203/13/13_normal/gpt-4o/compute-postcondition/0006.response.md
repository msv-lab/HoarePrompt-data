`i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is an empty list `[]`, `i` is 1, `start` is 0, the current value of `trophies[i]` is 'G'**
