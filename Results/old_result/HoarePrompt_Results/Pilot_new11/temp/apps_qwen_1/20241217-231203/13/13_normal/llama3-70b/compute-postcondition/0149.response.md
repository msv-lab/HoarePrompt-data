The `beauty` variable is incremented by 1. Since `beauty` was initially the number of consecutive 'G's found starting from `j` up to but not including `i`, incrementing `beauty` by 1 means that there is now one more consecutive 'G' in that range. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 4, `j` is 6, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S', `golden` contains all indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of its current value and the final value of `beauty`, `beauty` is the original value plus 1.**
