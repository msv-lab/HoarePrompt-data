Postcondition: **`i` is 4, `j` is the index of the last 'G' in `s` that is at least 6, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S', `golden` contains all indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of its current value and the final value of `beauty`, and `beauty` is the number of consecutive 'G's found starting from `j` up to but not including `i`. If `s[j]` is 'G', then `beauty` is `(4 - j) + 1`. If `s[j]` is not 'G', then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
