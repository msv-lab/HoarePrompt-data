Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `j` is at least 7, `n` is the length of `s`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S', `golden` contains all indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum number of consecutive 'G's starting from any position in `s` that is at least 2 positions away from the current position of `i`. If `s[j] == 'G'`, `beauty` is 2. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
