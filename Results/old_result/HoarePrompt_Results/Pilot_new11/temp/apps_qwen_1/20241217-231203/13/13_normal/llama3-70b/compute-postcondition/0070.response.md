`beauty` is incremented by 1. Since `beauty` was 4 if `s[0]` is 'G' and `s[1]` is 'G', 3 if `s[0]` is 'G' and `s[1]` is not 'G', 2 if `s[0]` is not 'G' and `s[1]` is 'G', and 1 if `s[0]` is not 'G' and `s[1]` is not 'G', the new value of `beauty` will be 5 if `s[0]` is 'G' and `s[1]` is 'G', 4 if `s[0]` is 'G' and `s[1]` is not 'G', 3 if `s[0]` is not 'G' and `s[1]` is 'G', and 2 if `s[0]` is not 'G' and `s[1]` is not 'G'. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `n` must be at least 2, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices where `s` has the character 'G', `max_beauty` is the maximum number of consecutive 'G's encountered during the loop, `curr_beauty` is incremented by 1 if `s[0]` is 'G', otherwise it remains the same, `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0, and `beauty` is 5 if `s[0]` is 'G' and `s[1]` is 'G', 4 if `s[0]` is 'G' and `s[1]` is not 'G', 3 if `s[0]` is not 'G' and `s[1]` is 'G', and 2 if `s[0]` is not 'G' and `s[1]` is not 'G'.**
