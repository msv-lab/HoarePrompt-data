The code `break` does not change the values of any variables. It simply breaks out of the nearest loop or match-case statement. Since there is no loop or match-case statement in the given code snippet, the `break` statement does not have any effect on the variables.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `j` is 0, `n` is the length of `s`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S', `golden` contains all indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum number of consecutive 'G's starting from any position in `s` that is at least 2 positions away from the current position of `i`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is `max_beauty`, `beauty` is either 2 (if `s[0]` is 'G') or 1 (if `s[0]` is not 'G'), and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if there was one.**
