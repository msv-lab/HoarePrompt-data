Postcondition: **`i` is 3, `j` is 1, `n` is the length of `s`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S', `golden` contains all indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum number of consecutive 'G's starting from any position in `s` that is at least 2 positions away from the current position of `i`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is `max_beauty`, and `beauty` is either 2 (if `s[j]` is 'G') or 1 (if `s[j]` is not 'G').**
