Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial States**: 
   - `left` is 1
   - `right` is 2
   - `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'G' and 'S'
   - `s[0]` must be 'S'

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop runs as long as `left < right` and `s[left] != 'G'`.

3. **Current Values**:
   - `left` is 1
   - `right` is 2
   - `s[left]` (which is `s[1]`) must be checked, but we don't know its value yet. However, we know that at the start of this iteration, the condition `s[left] != 'G'` was true because the loop ran.

4. **Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions must hold true:
     - `left < right` must be true.
     - `s[left] != 'G'` must be true.

5. **Conditions Analysis**:
   - `left < right` is currently true (`1 < 2`).
   - To keep `s[left] != 'G'` true, `s[left]` must not change from whatever value it had at the start of the iteration to 'G'. 

6. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - We need to ensure that `s[left]` (i.e., `s[1]`) does not become 'G' before the next iteration starts.
   - Since `s` is fixed at the start of the loop, we cannot directly modify `s[1]` to prevent it from becoming 'G'.
   - Instead, we should ensure that the current state does not change in such a way that would violate the condition `s[left] != 'G'`.

7. **Final State**:
   - The values of `left` and `right` do not need adjustment since they are fixed and within the required range.
   - The only thing that needs to be explicitly stated is that `s[left]` must not become 'G'.

Therefore, the final state for the next iteration to proceed is:

State: **`left` is 1, `right` is 2, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'G' and 'S', and `s[0]` must be 'S', and `s[1]` must not be 'G'**.
