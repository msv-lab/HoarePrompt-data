Postcondition: ***`a` must satisfy \((n - a * 1234567) // 123456 \geq 0\); `b` is 0; `c` is equal to \((n - a * 1234567) // 1234\); the equation \((a * 1234567 + c * 1234) = n\). Since the if condition checks whether \(a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234 == n\) and both the if and else parts do not change the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` beyond their initial conditions, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.***
