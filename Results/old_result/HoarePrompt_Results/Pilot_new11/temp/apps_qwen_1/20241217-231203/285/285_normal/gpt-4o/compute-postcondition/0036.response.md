`remaining_after_houses` is updated to the value of `n - a * house_cost`. Given that `house_cost` is 1234567, `remaining_after_houses` was previously unchanged, and the new value of `remaining_after_houses` is now `n - a * 1234567`.

The initial condition for `n` is \( n < ((a + 1) + 1) \times 1234567 \). This does not change with the code execution.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an integer such that \( n < ((a + 1) + 1) \times 1234567 \); `house_cost` is 1234567; `car_cost` is 123456; `computer_cost` is 1234; `remaining_after_houses` is `n - a * 1234567`; `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost` for the new value of `a + 1`.**
