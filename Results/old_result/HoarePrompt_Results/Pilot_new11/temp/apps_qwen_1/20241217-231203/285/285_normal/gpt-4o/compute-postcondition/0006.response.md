`remaining_after_cars` is assigned the value `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`. The initial state specifies that `n` must be at least \( a \times 1234567 \) and `remaining_after_houses` must be non-negative. The code does not affect the values of `n` and `remaining_after_houses`, only introducing `remaining_after_cars` which is calculated from `remaining_after_houses` and `b * car_cost`.

Output State: **`n` must be at least \( a \times 1234567 \), `remaining_after_houses` is non-negative, `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`**
