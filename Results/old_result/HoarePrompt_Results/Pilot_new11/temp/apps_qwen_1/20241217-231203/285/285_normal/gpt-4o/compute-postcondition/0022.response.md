The code subtracts `b * car_cost` from `remaining_after_houses` to assign the result to `remaining_after_cars`. The value of `remaining_after_houses` must be at least 123456, and the value of `car_cost` is 123456. Since `b` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value, but we know that `remaining_after_cars` will be `remaining_after_houses - b * 123456`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \( n \geq (a + 1) \times 1234567 \), `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - b * 123456`**
