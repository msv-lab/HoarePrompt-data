Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \( n < (a + 1) \times 1234567 \); `house_cost` is 1234567; `car_cost` is 123456; `computer_cost` is 1234; `remaining_after_houses` is unchanged; `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - (b_prev + 2) * car_cost`. If `remaining_after_cars` is divisible by `computer_cost`, the program returns 'YES'. Otherwise, the program continues execution without changing the values of the variables.***
