To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the for loop statement.

### Given Information:
- \( n \) is an integer such that \( n \geq (a + 1) \times 1234567 \).
- \( house_cost = 1234567 \).
- \( car_cost = 123456 \).
- \( computer_cost = 1234 \).
- \( remaining_after_houses = (k - a) \times 1234567 \).

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for b in range(remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if the expression inside the `range` function is a non-negative integer.
   - The expression inside the `range` function is `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute, `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1` must be a positive integer.

2. **Condition for Non-Negative Integer**:
   - Since `//` is the floor division operator, `remaining_after_houses // car_cost` will always result in a non-negative integer.
   - Adding 1 to a non-negative integer results in a positive integer.

3. **Ensuring Non-Zero Value**:
   - To ensure the loop executes, `remaining_after_houses` must be greater than or equal to `car_cost`.

4. **Current State of Variables**:
   - \( remaining_after_houses = (k - a) \times 1234567 \).
   - For the loop to execute, \((k - a) \times 1234567\) must be greater than or equal to `car_cost` (123456).

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute, \( remaining_after_houses \) must be at least `car_cost`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure this condition is met.

### Final State:
- \( n \) is an integer such that \( n \geq (a + 1) \times 1234567 \).
- \( house_cost = 1234567 \).
- \( car_cost = 123456 \).
- \( computer_cost = 1234 \).
- \( remaining_after_houses \) must be at least `car_cost` (123456).

Thus, the final state required for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`n` is an integer such that \( n \geq (a + 1) \times 1234567 \), `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `remaining_after_houses` must be at least 123456**.
