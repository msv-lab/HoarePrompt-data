`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`. The input function will take an input from the user and convert it into an integer, which will be stored in `n`. The initial state condition that `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\) remains valid after the execution of the code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\)**
