Output State: **`a` is an integer such that \(0 \leq a \leq n // 1234567 + 1\), `b` is an integer such that \(0 \leq b \leq \left(\frac{n - a \times 1234567}{123456}\right)\), `c` is an integer such that \(0 \leq c \leq \left(\frac{n - a \times 1234567 - b \times 123456}{1234}\right)\), and the equation \(a \times 1234567 + b \times 123456 + c \times 1234 = n\) holds if the loop exits successfully, otherwise `a`, `b`, and `c` are the last calculated values where the loop exhausted all possible combinations without satisfying the equation. The string "YES" is printed if the condition is satisfied, otherwise no string is printed.**
