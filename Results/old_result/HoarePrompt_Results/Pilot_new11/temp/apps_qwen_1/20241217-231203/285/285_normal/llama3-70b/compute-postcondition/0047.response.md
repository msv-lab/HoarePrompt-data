The code `exit()` is used to terminate the program immediately without further execution of any code. Given this, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial states. The `print('YES')` statement is executed before the `exit()` function is called, so it will run, but since the program exits right after, none of the subsequent states are relevant.

Output State: **`a` is \( n // 1234567 + 1 \); `b` is an integer between \( 0 \) and \((n - a \times 1234567) // 123456 \) but incremented by 1; `c` is \((n - a \times 1234567 - b \times 123456) // 1234; print('YES') was executed and the program exited.**
