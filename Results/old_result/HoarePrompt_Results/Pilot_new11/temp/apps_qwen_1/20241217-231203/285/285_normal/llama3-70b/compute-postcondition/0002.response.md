To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the given for loop statement:

```
for b in range((n - a * 1234567) // 123456 + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Range Calculation**: The range for the loop is determined by the expression `(n - a * 1234567) // 123456 + 1`.
   - This means the loop will run if the value of `(n - a * 1234567) // 123456 + 1` is at least 1.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, the value of `(n - a * 1234567) // 123456 + 1` must be greater than 0.
   - This implies that `(n - a * 1234567)` must be positive (since we are performing integer division by 123456).

3. **Initial Values**:
   - The initial values provided are `total` is 0 and no mention of `a` and `n`.

### Adjusted States for Loop Execution:

- **`total`**: Since `total` is not directly involved in the loop condition, its value remains as 0.
- **`a` and `n`**: These are the key variables that determine whether the loop will execute. Specifically, `(n - a * 1234567)` must be positive.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to `a * 1234567` to ensure `(n - a * 1234567)` is positive.
- `a` and `n` should be such that `(n - a * 1234567) // 123456 + 1` is greater than 0.

### Final Answer:
State: **`total` is 0, `a` and `n` must satisfy `(n - a * 1234567) // 123456 + 1 > 0`**
