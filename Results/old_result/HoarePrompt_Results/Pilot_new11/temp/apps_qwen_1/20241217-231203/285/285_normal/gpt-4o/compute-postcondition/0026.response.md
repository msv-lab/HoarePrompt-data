Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is an integer such that \( n < (a + 1) \times 1234567 \)
- `house_cost` is 1234567
- `car_cost` is 123456
- `computer_cost` is 1234
- `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - b * 123456`

### For Loop:
```
for b in range(remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Determine the Range of the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over values of `b` from `0` to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `b` was some value `b_prev`.

2. **Adjust the State:**
   - Since the loop increments `b` by 1 each time it runs, the next value of `b` will be `b_prev + 1`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `b` should still be within the range `0` to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`.

3. **Update the State:**
   - `remaining_after_cars` remains unchanged as it is not directly affected by the loop.
   - `b` will be updated to `b_prev + 1`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `b_prev + 1` must be less than or equal to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`.

### Conclusion:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `b` needs to be incremented by 1.
- Therefore, the new value of `b` will be `b_prev + 1`.

### Final State:
- `n` remains the same since it is not part of the loop's state.
- `house_cost`, `car_cost`, and `computer_cost` remain the same.
- `remaining_after_cars` remains the same.
- `b` is incremented by 1.

**State:**
**`n` is an integer such that \( n < (a + 1) \times 1234567 \), `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - b * 123456`, `b` is \( b_prev + 1 \)**

Since the exact value of `b_prev` is not given, we represent it symbolically as `b_prev + 1`.

So, the final state is:
State: **`n` is an integer such that \( n < (a + 1) \times 1234567 \), `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - b * 123456`, `b` is \( b_prev + 1 \)**
