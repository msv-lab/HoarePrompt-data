Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the program only checks combinations of houses, cars, and computers up to the point where the remaining amount after buying houses and cars can be exactly divided by the cost of a computer. However, the problem allows for the possibility of buying zero units of any item, which means the program should consider all possible non-negative values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.

To fix this, the program should iterate over all possible values of `a`, `b`, and `c` without limiting the range based on `n // house_cost`. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
n = int(input().strip())
result = func_1(n)
print(result)

def func_1(n):
    house_cost = 1234567
    car_cost = 123456
    computer_cost = 1234
    
    # Iterate over all possible values of a, b, and c
    for a in range(n // house_cost + 1):
        for b in range(n // car_cost + 1):
            c = (n - a * house_cost - b * car_cost) / computer_cost
            if c.is_integer() and c >= 0:
                return 'YES'
    
    return 'NO'
```

With this corrected approach, the program will check all possible combinations of `a`, `b`, and `c` and ensure that it covers all potential cases, thus meeting the requirements of the problem description.
