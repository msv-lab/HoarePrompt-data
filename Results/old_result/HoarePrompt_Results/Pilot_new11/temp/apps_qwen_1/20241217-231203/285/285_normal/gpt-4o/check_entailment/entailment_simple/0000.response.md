Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The given annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` from the input, which represents Kolya's initial game-coin score.
   - The input is validated as per the constraints \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\).

2. **Main Logic:**
   - The core of the solution lies in the nested loops that iterate over possible values of `a` (number of houses), `b` (number of cars), and check if the remaining coins can be exactly divided by the cost of a computer (`c`).
   - The loop variables `a` and `b` are constrained by the maximum possible number of houses and cars that can be purchased with `n` coins, ensuring that the program does not enter an infinite loop due to invalid inputs.

3. **Checking Validity:**
   - For each combination of `a` and `b`, the program calculates the remaining coins after purchasing `a` houses and `b` cars.
   - It then checks if the remaining coins can be exactly divided by the cost of a computer using the condition `if remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0`.
   - If such a combination is found, the program immediately returns 'YES', indicating that it is possible to spend all of Kolya's initial n game-coins.

4. **Final Output:**
   - If no valid combination of `a`, `b`, and `c` is found after exhausting all possibilities, the program returns 'NO'.

The program adheres to the problem requirements by:
- Accepting a single integer input.
- Iterating through all possible combinations of buying houses, cars, and computers.
- Checking if it is possible to spend exactly `n` game-coins without any remainder.

Given these points, the program correctly determines whether it is possible for Kolya to have spent all of his initial game-coins on houses, cars, and computers. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
