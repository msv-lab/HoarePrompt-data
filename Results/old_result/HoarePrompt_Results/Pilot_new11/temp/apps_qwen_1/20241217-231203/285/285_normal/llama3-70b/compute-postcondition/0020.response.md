Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables and Their Initial States:**
   - `a` is `a_current + 1`.
   - `b` is 0.
   - `c` is recalculated based on `a` and `b`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   The loop runs for values of `b` starting from 0 up to `(n - a * 1234567) // 123456`.

3. **Determine the Necessary Adjustments:**
   - The loop will execute as long as the condition `(n - a * 1234567) // 123456 + 1` is positive or zero. This means we need to ensure that `(n - a * 1234567) // 123456` is non-negative.
   - Since `b` starts at 0 and increments, the loop will start executing if the expression `(n - a * 1234567) // 123456` is non-negative.

Given these points, we need to adjust the following states:
- Ensure `a` is such that the expression `(n - a * 1234567) // 123456` is non-negative.
- Ensure `b` starts at 0 and will increment in the loop.

**Final State Adjustment:**

State: **`a` must be such that (n - a * 1234567) // 123456 is non-negative, `b` is 0**
