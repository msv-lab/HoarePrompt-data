The code `exit()` is used to terminate the program immediately. Since no further operations are performed after this statement, all the values of the variables remain unchanged. The only thing that happens is that the program exits, which means no return value is given.

Output State: **`a` is \( n // 1234567 + 1 \); `b` is an integer between 0 and \((n - (n // 1234567 + 1) \times 1234567) // 123456\), inclusive; `c` is the same as its initial value \((n - (n // 1234567 + 1) \times 1234567 - b \times 123456) // 1234\); the condition `(a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234 == n)` holds; the program exits.**
