Functionality: **The function reads three non-negative integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) (where \(1 \leq a, b, c \leq 1000\)) from the user. It then calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be obtained under the conditions that the number of lemons cannot exceed \(a\), half of \(b\), or one-fourth of \(c\). Based on this maximum number of lemons, it computes the total number of fruits (lemons, twice the number of lemons, and four times the number of lemons) and prints the result. If any of the inputs are outside the specified range, the function will still execute but will raise a `ValueError`.**

Edge Cases:
- If any of the inputs \(a\), \(b\), or \(c\) are negative or greater than 1000, the function will raise a `ValueError` and terminate.
- If \(b\) or \(c\) are zero, the maximum number of lemons will be determined solely by \(a\).

Missing Functionality:
- The code does not handle the case where the user might input non-integer values. This could lead to unexpected behavior or a `ValueError`. However, since the input is converted to integers using `int(input())`, this specific edge case is already handled within the code.
