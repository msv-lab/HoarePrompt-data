The code assigns the value of `int(input())` to `a`. The values of `b` and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated values are:

- `a` is now the integer input from the user.
- `b` and `c` remain as their initial non-negative integers within the range 1 to 1000.

Output State: **`a` is an integer input from the user, `b` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, `c` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000.**
