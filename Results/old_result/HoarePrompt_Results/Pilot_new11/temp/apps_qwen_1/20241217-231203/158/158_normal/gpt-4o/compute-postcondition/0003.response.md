The code assigns the value of the minimum among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4` to `max_lemons`. This means `max_lemons` will take the smallest value among these three expressions. The other variables (`a`, `b`, and `c`) remain unchanged.

To illustrate, let's assume specific values for `a`, `b`, and `c`:

- Suppose `a = 10`, `b = 8`, and `c = 12`.
- Then `b // 2` would be `8 // 2 = 4`.
- And `c // 4` would be `12 // 4 = 3`.

So, `max_lemons` would be `min(10, 4, 3)`, which is `3`.

Output State: **`a` is 10, `b` is 8, `c` is 12, `max_lemons` is 3**
