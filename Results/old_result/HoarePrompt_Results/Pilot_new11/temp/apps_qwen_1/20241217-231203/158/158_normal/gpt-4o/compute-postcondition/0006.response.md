The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to return a value based on the relationships between three non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, where 1 <= a, b, c <= 1000.

However, since no specific logic or return conditions are provided in the problem statement, we can only describe the parameter constraints and the expected range for the variables.

Functionality: **The function returns a value based on the relationships between three non-negative integers a, b, and c, where 1 <= a, b, c <= 1000.**
