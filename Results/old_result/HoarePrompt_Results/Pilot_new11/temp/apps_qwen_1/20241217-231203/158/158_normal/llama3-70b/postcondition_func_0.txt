The function reads three non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the user, each constrained between 1 and 1000. It then calculates the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. This minimum value is referred to as `min_lemon`. The function then prints the sum of `min_lemon`, `min_lemon * 2`, and `min_lemon * 4`. The function does not return a value, but instead outputs the calculated sum. There are no explicit return statements in the provided code, but the behavior can be inferred from the print statement.
