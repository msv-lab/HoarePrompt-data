`target_sofa` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Given that `i` is `d-1`, `target_sofa` becomes `(d-1) + 1`, which simplifies to `d`. The values of `sofas`, `d`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sofas` is a non-empty list of tuples, each tuple containing four integers (x1, y1, x2, y2) representing the coordinates of sofas, `d` is a positive integer, `i` is `d-1`, and `target_sofa` is `d`.**
