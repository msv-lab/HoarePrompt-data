Postcondition: **`sofas` is a non-empty list of tuples, each tuple containing the coordinates of a sofa, and `left` is 1, `right` is 0, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0. There exists a sofa in `sofas` such that its x-coordinate is less than the x-coordinate of `s` and its y-coordinate is equal to the y-coordinate of `s`.**
