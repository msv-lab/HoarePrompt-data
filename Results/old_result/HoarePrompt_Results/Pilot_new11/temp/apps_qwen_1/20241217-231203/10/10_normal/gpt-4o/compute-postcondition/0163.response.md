The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the nearest loop or switch statement. Since there is no loop or switch statement in the given code snippet, the `break` statement will simply exit the current context, which is not specified here but typically implies exiting a loop or a function. Given the initial state, the values of `sofas`, `d`, `i`, and `target_sofa` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sofas` is a non-empty list of tuples, each tuple containing four integers (x1, y1, x2, y2) representing the coordinates of sofas, `d` is a positive integer, `i` is `d-1`, and `target_sofa` is `d`.**
