According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `d`. The loop runs `d` times. At the end of the last iteration, `sofas` contains one element, which is a tuple `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`, `x1` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer, `x2` is an input integer, `y2` is an input integer, and `d` is a positive integer within its specified range.

For the loop to execute one more time, `d` must be at least 2 because it has already executed once. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `d` should be reduced by 1 (since one iteration has already completed), making it `d - 1`.

State: **`sofas` is [(x1, y1, x2, y2)], `x1` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer, `x2` is an input integer, `y2` is an input integer, `d` is a positive integer within its specified range and is equal to `d - 1`**
