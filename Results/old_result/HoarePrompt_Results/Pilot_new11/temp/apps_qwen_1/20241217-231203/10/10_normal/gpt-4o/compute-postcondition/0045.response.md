The code `bottom_count[i] += 1` increments the value of `bottom_count[i]` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is that `bottom_count[i]` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`j` is 1; `d` is greater than 0; `sofas` is a list of tuples; `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are assigned the values from `sofas[1]`; `top_count[i]` remains unchanged; `bottom_count[i]` is increased by 1; `left_count[i]` remains unchanged.**
