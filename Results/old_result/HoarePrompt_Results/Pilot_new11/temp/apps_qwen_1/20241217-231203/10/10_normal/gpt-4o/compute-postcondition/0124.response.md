Postcondition: ***`j` is 0, `d` is greater than 0, `sofas` is a non-empty list of tuples, `i` is 0, `right_count[0]` is incremented by 1 if `x1 < x1_j` and `x2 < x1_j` and `y1 < y1_j` and `y2 < y1_j` are satisfied; otherwise, the values of `x1`, `x2`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` remain as they were initially, and either `x1 > x2_j` and `x2 > x2_j` is satisfied, in which case `left_count[0]` is incremented by 1, or no changes occur to `left_count[0]`; `bottom_count[0]` is incremented by 1, and `top_count[0]` is incremented by 1. If `y1 > y2_j` and `y2 > y2_j` are satisfied, then `right_count[0]` is incremented by 1, otherwise, no changes are made to `right_count[0]`, `left_count[0]`, `bottom_count[0]`, and `top_count[0]` remains as they were.***
