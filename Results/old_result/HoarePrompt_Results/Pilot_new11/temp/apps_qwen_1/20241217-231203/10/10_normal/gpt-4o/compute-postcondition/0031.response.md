Postcondition: ***`j` is 0, `d` is greater than 0, `sofas` is a list of tuples, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are assigned the values from `sofas[0]`. If `(y1 < y1_j and y2 < y1_j)` is true, then both `right_count[i]` and `left_count[i]` are incremented by 1. Otherwise, the values of `right_count[i]` and `left_count[i]` remain unchanged.***
