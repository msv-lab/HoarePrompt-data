Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `sofas` is a non-empty list of tuples, each tuple containing the coordinates of a sofa.
   - `s` is the next tuple in the list.
   - `left` is increased by 1 if the x-coordinate of the first sofa in `sofas` is less than the x-coordinate of `s` and their y-coordinates are equal, otherwise `left` remains unchanged.
   - `right` is always increased by 1.
   - `top` is increased by 1.
   - `bottom` is increased by 1.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over each tuple `s` in the list `sofas`.

3. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - We need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration based on the current state at the end of the previous iteration.

4. **Key Variables to Consider:**
   - `s`: The tuple representing the current sofa in the list.
   - `left`: Increased based on a specific condition.
   - `right`, `top`, `bottom`: Always increased by 1.

5. **Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `sofas` is a non-empty list and we are iterating through it, there will always be a next tuple `s` unless all elements have been exhausted.
   - `right`, `top`, and `bottom` will always be increased by 1 in each iteration, regardless of the value of `s`.
   - `left` will only change if the specific condition is met, but it will reset to its new value for the next iteration.

6. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `sofas`: The list `sofas` remains the same, but the current element `s` moves to the next tuple in the list.
   - `right`, `top`, `bottom`: These variables are incremented by 1, so they remain as they were plus 1.
   - `left`: It may or may not change based on the previous condition, but for the next iteration, it will be reset to its updated value.

7. **State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `sofas`: Remains the same non-empty list.
   - `s`: Moves to the next tuple in the list.
   - `right`, `top`, `bottom`: Each is incremented by 1 from the previous values.
   - `left`: The exact value depends on the previous tuple `s` and the first sofa in `sofas`, but it will be the updated value for the next iteration.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`sofas` is a non-empty list of tuples, each tuple containing the coordinates of a sofa; `s` is the next tuple in the list; `right` is increased by 1, `top` is increased by 1, `bottom` is increased by 1; `left` is the updated value based on the previous tuple `s` and the first sofa in `sofas`.**

Note: Since `left`'s exact value depends on the previous iteration, it cannot be explicitly stated without knowing the exact previous values, but it will be the updated value for the next iteration.
