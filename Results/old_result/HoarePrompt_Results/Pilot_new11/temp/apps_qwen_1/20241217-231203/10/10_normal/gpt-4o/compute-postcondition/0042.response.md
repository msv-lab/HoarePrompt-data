Postcondition: ***`j` is 1; `d` is greater than 0; `sofas` is a list of tuples; `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are assigned the values from `sofas[1]`; `top_count[i]` remains unchanged; `bottom_count[i]` remains unchanged; if `x1 < x1_j` and `x2 < x1_j`, then `right_count[1]` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `left_count[i]` remains unchanged.***
