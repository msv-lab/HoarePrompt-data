Postcondition: ***`sofas` is a non-empty list of tuples, each tuple containing the coordinates of a sofa; `s` is the next tuple in the list; `left` is increased by 1 if the x-coordinate of the first sofa in `sofas` is less than the x-coordinate of `s` and their y-coordinates are equal, otherwise `left` remains unchanged. Additionally, `right` is increased by 1 regardless of the condition check.***
