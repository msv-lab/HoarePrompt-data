The code reads four integers from the input and assigns them to `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` respectively. Since `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are already defined in the initial state as input integers, the new values of these variables are the ones inputted. The value of `d` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`sofas` is [(input integer, input integer, input integer, input integer)], `x1` is input integer, `y1` is input integer, `x2` is input integer, `y2` is input integer, `d` is a positive integer within its specified range and is equal to `d - 1`**
