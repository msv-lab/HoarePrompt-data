Postcondition: ***`sofas` is a non-empty list of tuples, each tuple containing the coordinates of a sofa; `s` is the next tuple in the list; if the x-coordinate of the first sofa in `sofas` is less than the x-coordinate of `s` and their y-coordinates are equal, then `left` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the value of `left` remains unchanged.***
