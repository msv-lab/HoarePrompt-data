The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. It does not affect the values of any variables directly. Therefore, the values of `j`, `d`, `sofas`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j`, `top_count[i]`, `bottom_count[i]`, and `left_count[i]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is 2, `d` is greater than 0, `sofas` is a list of tuples, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are assigned the values from `sofas[2]`, `top_count[i]` is increased by 1, `bottom_count[i]` is increased by 1 if `y1 < y1_j` and `y2 < y1_j`, and `left_count[i]` remains unchanged**
