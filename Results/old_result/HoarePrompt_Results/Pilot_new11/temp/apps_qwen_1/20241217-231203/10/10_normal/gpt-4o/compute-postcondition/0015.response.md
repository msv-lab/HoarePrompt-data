The code initializes `right_count` as a list of `d` zeros. This does not affect the values of `sofas`, `d`, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b`, or `left_count`. Therefore, the only change is the initialization of `right_count`.

Output State: **`sofas` is a list of tuples, each tuple containing four integers (x1, y1, x2, y2) representing the coordinates of sofas; `d` is a positive integer within its specified range; `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are the values from the input split and converted to integers; `left_count` is a list of `d` zeros; `right_count` is a list of `d` zeros.**
