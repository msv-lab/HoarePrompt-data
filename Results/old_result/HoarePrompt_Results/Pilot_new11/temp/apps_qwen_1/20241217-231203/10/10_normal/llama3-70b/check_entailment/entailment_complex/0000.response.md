Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The annotated program accurately implements the logic required to solve the given problem. Here's a breakdown of why the program follows the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads the input values `d`, `n`, `m`, the coordinates of each sofa, and the counts `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b`.
   - The constraints and expected input types are respected, ensuring the input handling is correct.

2. **Sofa Representation**:
   - Each sofa is represented by a tuple of coordinates, and a list of these tuples is stored in `sofas`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the counts of sofas to the left (`left`), right (`right`), top (`top`), and bottom (`bottom`) of a given `sofa`.
   - It iterates over the `sofas` list, excluding the `sofa` itself, to ensure no self-comparison.
   - The logic correctly increments the respective counters based on the relative positions of the sofas.
   - The function returns these counts, which are then used to check against the given `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b`.

4. **Main Logic**:
   - The main loop iterates through each sofa in the `sofas` list.
   - For each sofa, it calls `func_1` to get the counts.
   - It checks if the returned counts match the required `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b`.
   - If a match is found, it prints the index of the sofa (adjusted to be 1-based) and breaks out of the loop.
   - If no match is found, it prints `-1`.

Given that the program accurately implements the described logic and handles all aspects of the problem description without any omissions or errors, the program is correct. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
