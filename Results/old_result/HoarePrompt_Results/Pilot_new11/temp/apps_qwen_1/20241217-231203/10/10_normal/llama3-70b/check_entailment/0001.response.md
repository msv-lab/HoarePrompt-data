Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic for counting the number of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of a given sofa. Specifically, the program only checks if the x-coordinates and y-coordinates match exactly to count left/right and top/bottom conditions, respectively. However, the problem description states that a sofa A is standing to the left of sofa B if there exist two such cells a and b that \(x_a < x_b\), and similarly for other conditions. This means that the program should check if any part of the sofa A is to the left, right, top, or bottom of any part of sofa B, not just if the exact coordinates match.

For example, consider the following input:

```
2
3 3
1 1 1 2
2 2 2 3
1 1 0 1
```

In this case:
- The first sofa (1 1 1 2) should have 0 sofas to its left, 1 sofa to its right, 1 sofa above it, and 0 sofas below it.
- The second sofa (2 2 2 3) should have 1 sofa to its left, 0 sofas to its right, 0 sofas above it, and 1 sofa below it.

However, the program will incorrectly count the number of sofas for both conditions because it only checks for exact coordinate matches. Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.
