The code `left_count[i] += 1` increments the value of `left_count[i]` by 1. Given the initial state:

- `j` is 2
- `d` is greater than 0
- `sofas` is a list of tuples
- `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are assigned the values from `sofas[2]`
- `top_count[i]` is increased by 1
- `bottom_count[i]` is increased by 1 if `y1 < y1_j` and `y2 < y1_j`
- `left_count[i]` remains unchanged
- `right_count[i]` is increased by 1 if `x1 < x1_j` and `x2 < x1_j`

After executing `left_count[i] += 1`, the value of `left_count[i]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`j` is 2, `d` is greater than 0, `sofas` is a list of tuples, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are assigned the values from `sofas[2]`, `top_count[i]` is increased by 1, `bottom_count[i]` is increased by 1 if `y1 < y1_j` and `y2 < y1_j`, `left_count[i]` is increased by 1, and `right_count[i]` is increased by 1 if `x1 < x1_j` and `x2 < x1_j`.**
