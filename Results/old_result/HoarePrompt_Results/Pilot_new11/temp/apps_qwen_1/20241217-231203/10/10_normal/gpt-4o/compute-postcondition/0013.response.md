`cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are assigned the values from the input, which are split and converted to integers. The number of sofas and their coordinates remain unchanged, and the value of `d` is not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`sofas` is a list of tuples, each tuple containing four integers (x1, y1, x2, y2) representing the coordinates of sofas; `d` is a positive integer within its specified range; `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are the values from the input split and converted to integers.**
