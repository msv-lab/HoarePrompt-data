The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables; it only exits the current loop or conditional block. Since no loop or conditional block is specified in the code snippet, the variables remain unchanged. The output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`sofas` is a non-empty list of tuples, each tuple containing four integers (x1, y1, x2, y2) representing the coordinates of sofas, `d` is a positive integer, `i` is in the range `0` to `d-1`, `left_count[i]` is equal to `cnt_l`, `right_count[i]` is equal to `cnt_r`, `top_count[i]` is equal to `cnt_t`, `bottom_count[i]` is equal to `cnt_b`, `target_sofa` is `i + 1`**
