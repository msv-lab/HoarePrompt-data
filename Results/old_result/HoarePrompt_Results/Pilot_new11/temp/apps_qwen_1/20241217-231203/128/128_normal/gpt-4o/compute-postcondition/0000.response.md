The code initializes an empty list named `regular_sales`. No other variables are affected, and the precondition remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `f` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ f ≤ n; `days` is a list of n tuples, where each tuple contains two non-negative integers k_i and l_i such that 0 ≤ k_i, l_i ≤ 10^9; `regular_sales` is an empty list.**
