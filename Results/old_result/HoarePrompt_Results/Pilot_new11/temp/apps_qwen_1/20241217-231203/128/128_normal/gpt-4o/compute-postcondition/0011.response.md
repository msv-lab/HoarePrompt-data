Output State: **`days` is a list of 0 tuples, `regular_sales` is a list containing the minimum of `k` and `l` for each iteration, `potential_sales_increase` is a list containing `min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l)` for each iteration.**

Explanation:
1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `f` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq f \leq n\).
   - `days` is a list of \(n\) tuples, where each tuple contains two non-negative integers \(k_i\) and \(l_i\) such that \(0 \leq k_i, l_i \leq 10^9\).
   - `regular_sales` is an empty list.
   - `potential_sales_increase` is an empty list.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each tuple \((k, l)\) in the `days` list.
   - For each tuple, `regular_sales.append(min(k, l))` appends the minimum of `k` and `l` to `regular_sales`.
   - `potential_sales_increase.append(min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l))` appends the difference between `min(2 * k, l)` and `min(k, l)` to `potential_sales_increase`.

3. **After Loop Executes \(n\) Times**:
   - After all \(n\) iterations, `days` will be reduced to a list of 0 tuples because the loop processes each tuple once and removes it from consideration.
   - `regular_sales` will contain the minimum of `k` and `l` for each of the \(n\) tuples processed.
   - `potential_sales_increase` will contain the difference `min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l)` for each of the \(n\) tuples processed.

4. **Final State**:
   - Since the loop processes all \(n\) tuples, `days` becomes an empty list.
   - `regular_sales` will be a list of length \(n\) containing the minimum of `k` and `l` for each tuple.
   - `potential_sales_increase` will be a list of length \(n\) containing the difference `min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l)` for each tuple.

Thus, the final output state is:
- `days` is a list of 0 tuples.
- `regular_sales` is a list containing the minimum of `k` and `l` for each iteration.
- `potential_sales_increase` is a list containing `min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l)` for each iteration.
