Postcondition: **`days` is a list of tuples sorted in descending order based on the difference between the second element and the first element of each tuple, `f` is an integer such that \(0 \leq f \leq n\), `sold` is updated by adding the appropriate value (either `min(days[k+1][0] * 2, days[k+1][1])` if `i < f` or the minimum value of `days[i][0]` and `days[i][1]` if `i \geq f`), `i` is \(k + 1\), and `n` is greater than 0.**
