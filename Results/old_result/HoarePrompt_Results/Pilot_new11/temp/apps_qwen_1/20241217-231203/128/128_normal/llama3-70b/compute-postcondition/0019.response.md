Postcondition: ***`days` is a list of tuples sorted in descending order based on the difference between the second element and the first element of each tuple, `f` is an integer such that `0 ≤ f ≤ n`, `sold` is the sum of `sold + min(days[i][0] * 2, days[i][1])` if `i < f`, otherwise `sold + min(days[i][0], days[i][1])`, `i` is incremented, and `n` is greater than 0.***
