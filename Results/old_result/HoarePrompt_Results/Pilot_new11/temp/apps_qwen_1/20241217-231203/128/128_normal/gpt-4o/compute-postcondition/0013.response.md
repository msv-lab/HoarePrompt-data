The `potential_sales_increase` list is sorted in descending order. This means the values in the list will be rearranged based on their magnitude, with the largest value first. The `days`, `regular_sales`, and `total_sales` lists remain unchanged.

Let's denote the initial state of `potential_sales_increase` as a list of values `[p1, p2, ..., pn]` where each `pi` is equal to `min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l)` for each iteration.

After sorting in reverse order, the new state of `potential_sales_increase` will be `[max(p1, p2, ..., pn), second_max(p1, p2, ..., pn), ..., min(p1, p2, ..., pn)]`.

Output State: **`days` is a list of 0 tuples, `regular_sales` is a list containing the minimum of `k` and `l` for each iteration, `potential_sales_increase` is a list containing the sorted values in descending order of `min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l)` for each iteration, `total_sales` is the sum of `regular_sales`.**
