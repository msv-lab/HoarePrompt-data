According to the code, the loop will iterate over each tuple `(k, l)` in the `days` list. For the loop to execute, the `days` list must contain at least one tuple. Let's break down the necessary adjustments:

1. **`days` List**: The `days` list must contain at least one tuple. This ensures there is at least one iteration of the loop.
2. **Initial Values of `k` and `l`**: The loop assigns the values of `k` and `l` from the tuple in the `days` list. Therefore, `k` and `l` must be initialized within the context of the loop's first iteration.

Given the initial states:
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- `f` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq f \leq n\)
- `days` is a list of \(n\) tuples, where each tuple contains two non-negative integers \(k_i\) and \(l_i\) such that \(0 \leq k_i, l_i \leq 10^9\)
- `regular_sales` is an empty list
- `potential_sales_increase` is an empty list

We need to ensure that the `days` list contains at least one tuple for the loop to execute. Since the list is guaranteed to have at least \(n\) tuples and \(n \geq 1\), we can safely conclude that the list contains at least one tuple.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that the `days` list must contain at least one tuple.

State: **`days` is a list of \(n\) tuples, where \(n \geq 1\)**
