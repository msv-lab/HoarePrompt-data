Postcondition: ***`days` is a list of tuples sorted in descending order based on the difference between the second element and the first element of each tuple. `f` is an integer such that \(0 \leq f \leq n\). If `i < f`, `sold` is increased by `min_value`. Otherwise, `sold` is updated to `sold + min(days[k+2][0], days[k+2][1])`. `i` is \(k + 2\), and `n` is greater than 0.***
