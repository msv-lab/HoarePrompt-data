The line `potential_sales_increase = []` creates an empty list named `potential_sales_increase`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `f`, `days`, or `regular_sales`. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the `potential_sales_increase` list.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `f` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ f ≤ n; `days` is a list of n tuples, where each tuple contains two non-negative integers k_i and l_i such that 0 ≤ k_i, l_i ≤ 10^9; `regular_sales` is an empty list; `potential_sales_increase` is an empty list.**
