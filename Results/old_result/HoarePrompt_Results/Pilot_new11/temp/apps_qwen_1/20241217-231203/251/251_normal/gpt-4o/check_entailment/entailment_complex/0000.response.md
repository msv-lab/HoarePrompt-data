Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

1. **Input Handling**: The code correctly reads the input as described in the problem statement. It reads `n` (the number of cakes) and then reads pairs of integers representing the radius and height of each cake. This part of the code aligns perfectly with the problem description.

2. **Volume Calculation**: The function `func_1` correctly calculates the volume of each cake using the formula \( \pi \times r_i \times r_i \times h_i \). This is consistent with the problem statement which requires calculating the volume of each cake.

3. **Dynamic Programming Implementation**: The function `func_1` implements dynamic programming to find the maximum volume of the special cake that can be made by stacking cakes according to the given constraints. Specifically, a cake with a larger volume can only be placed on top of a cake with a smaller volume. This part of the implementation is correct and follows the problem description.

4. **Constraints Handling**: The problem description specifies that a cake with a larger volume can only be placed on a cake with a smaller volume, and the code correctly enforces this constraint through the dynamic programming approach. The code checks if the volume of cake `i` is strictly greater than the volume of cake `j` before adding it to the dynamic programming array.

5. **Output**: The final output is correctly printed with the required precision (six decimal places). The code does not handle invalid inputs directly, but the problem statement assumes valid input, so this is not a concern for correctness under the given assumptions.

Since the code handles all aspects of the problem statement correctly and follows all the specified constraints, the program is correct for every potential case.
