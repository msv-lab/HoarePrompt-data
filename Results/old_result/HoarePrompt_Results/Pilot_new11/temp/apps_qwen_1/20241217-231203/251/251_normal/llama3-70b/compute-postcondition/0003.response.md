`r, h` are assigned the values from the input split into integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The values of `n` and `cakes` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 0, `cakes` is an empty list, `r` is an input integer, `h` is an input integer.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `cakes` is an empty list, `r` is an input integer, `h` is an input integer**
