Functionality: **The function `func_2` reads input from the standard input, processes it to extract the number of cakes and their respective radii and heights, and then calls another function `func_1` with these values. It finally prints the result returned by `func_1`, formatted to six decimal places. The input consists of the integer `n` followed by `2n` integers representing the radii and heights of the cakes. If `n` is outside the range 1 to 100,000, the function will still read and process the input, but this case is not handled within the function itself. Additionally, if the radii or heights of the cakes are outside the range 1 to 10,000, no specific handling is provided for such cases.**

**Edge cases and missing functionality:**
- If `n` is less than 1 or greater than 100,000, the function will still proceed with processing the input, which might lead to unexpected behavior or errors if not properly managed outside the function.
- If the radii or heights of the cakes are outside the range 1 to 10,000, no specific handling is provided for such cases. The function will simply process these values, which could potentially lead to incorrect calculations.
