State: **`i` is `n`, `dp[i]` is `volumes[i]`, `n` remains the same, `j` is 0**

### Explanation:
- The loop `for j in range(i):` will iterate from `0` to `i-1`.
- For the loop to execute, `i` must be at least 1 because `range(i)` generates values from `0` to `i-1`. If `i` is 0 or less, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.
- Since `i` is initially set to `n`, we need to ensure that `n` (and therefore `i`) is at least 1 for the loop to execute.
- No other state needs adjustment as the loop's execution only depends on `i`.

Therefore, the initial state should include the condition that `n` must be greater than 0 to ensure the loop can execute.
