Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly implement the dynamic programming solution to find the maximum possible total volume of the special cake. The `func_1` function calculates the maximum volume that can be achieved by considering each cake and checking if it can be placed on top of any previous cake with a smaller volume. The `func_2` function reads the input and calls `func_1` to compute the result.

Given the problem constraints and the examples provided, the implementation seems to handle all cases correctly. Hereâ€™s a brief verification:

1. **Volume Calculation**: The volume calculation for each cake using the formula \( V = \pi r^2 h \) is correct.
2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The dynamic programming approach ensures that the cake with the largest volume is placed on top of the cake with the next largest volume, and so on, which is in line with the problem requirements.
3. **Input Parsing**: The input parsing logic in `func_2` correctly extracts the radius and height for each cake.

Since the program correctly follows the problem description and handles all potential cases as per the examples, the correctness is **True**.
