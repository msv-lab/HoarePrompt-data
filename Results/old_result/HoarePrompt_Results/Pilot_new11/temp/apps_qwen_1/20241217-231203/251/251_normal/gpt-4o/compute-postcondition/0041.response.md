Output State: **`i` is `n`, `j` is `0`, `dp` is a list of length `n` where each element `dp[i]` is the maximum value of `volumes[i]` plus the maximum sum of subproblems from indices `0` to `i-2`, `n` remains the same, and `volumes` is a list of volumes calculated as \(\pi \times r_i \times r_i \times h_i\) for each cake \((r_i, h_i)\) in `cakes`.**
