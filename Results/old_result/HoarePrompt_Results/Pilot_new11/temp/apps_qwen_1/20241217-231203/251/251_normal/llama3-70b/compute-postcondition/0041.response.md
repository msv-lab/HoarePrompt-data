Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State
- `dp[i]` is the maximum value among all `dp[j] + cakes[i][0]` where `j < i` and `cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]`, otherwise `dp[i]` remains `cakes[i][0]`.

### End of Previous Iteration
- We know the state at the end of the previous iteration, which is `dp[i-1]` (since `i` starts from 1).

### Loop Condition
- The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `n-1`.

### Current Iteration
- For the current iteration, we are processing `dp[i]` based on the condition given.

### Adjusting States
1. **Value of `i`**: Since we are processing `dp[i]`, the value of `i` will be `i` (the current iteration index).
2. **Condition for Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. After the current iteration, `i` will be incremented to `i + 1`.
3. **Value of `dp[i]`**: The value of `dp[i]` will depend on the previous values of `dp[j]` for all `j < i` such that `cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]`.

### Updated State
- After the current iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
- The value of `dp[i]` will be calculated based on the conditions given.

### Final State
Given the initial state and the loop increment, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will be `i + 1`.
- The value of `dp[i]` will be recalculated based on the conditions provided.

### Example Answer
State: **`dp[i]` is the maximum value among all `dp[j] + cakes[i][0]` where `j < i` and `cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]`, otherwise `dp[i]` remains `cakes[i][0]`, `i` is `i + 1`**.

To make it more specific:
- If the current value of `i` is `k`, then after the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.

Therefore, the final state would be:
State: **`dp[i]` is the maximum value among all `dp[j] + cakes[i][0]` where `j < i` and `cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]`, otherwise `dp[i]` remains `cakes[i][0]`, `i` is `i + 1`**.

If we assume `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration:
State: **`dp[k+1]` is the maximum value among all `dp[j] + cakes[k+1][0]` where `j < k+1` and `cakes[k+1][1] < cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[k+1][2] < cakes[j][2]`, otherwise `dp[k+1]` remains `cakes[k+1][0]`, `i` is `k + 1`**.
