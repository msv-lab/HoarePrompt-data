To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop iterates. The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `i-1`.

The key points to consider are:
1. The condition for updating `dp[i]`: `cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]`.
2. If this condition is met, `dp[i]` is updated to `max(cakes[i][0], dp[j] + cakes[i][0])`.

At the end of the previous iteration, let's denote the following:
- `dp[i]` is an integer.
- There is a specific `i` value.
- For some `j` in the range `[0, i-1]`, if `cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]`, then `dp[i]` was updated.

For the next iteration of the loop, `j` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, the new `j` will be `i - 1`.

Now, let's adjust the states:

- Since `j` will now be `i - 1`, the condition for updating `dp[i]` will be checked with `j = i - 1`.
- If `cakes[i][1] < cakes[i-1][1]` and `cakes[i][2] < cakes[i-1][2]`, then `dp[i]` will be updated to `max(cakes[i][0], dp[i-1] + cakes[i][0])`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these changes:

State: **`dp[i]` is an integer, cakes[i][1] < cakes[i-1][1] and cakes[i][2] < cakes[i-1][2], and dp[i] is set to max(cakes[i][0], dp[i-1] + cakes[i][0]) otherwise no change is made to dp[i]**
