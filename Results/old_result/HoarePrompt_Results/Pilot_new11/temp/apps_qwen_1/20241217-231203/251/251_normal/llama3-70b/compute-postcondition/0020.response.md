Postcondition: ***`i` is at least 1, `cakes` is a list of tuples sorted in descending order by volume, `dp` is a list of `n` elements each initialized to `0.0`, `dp[0]` is equal to `cakes[0][0]`, `dp[1]` is `cakes[1][0]`, and `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + cakes[i][0]` where `(cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1] and cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2])` holds true.***
