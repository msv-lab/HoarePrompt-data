`b` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input()` will accept an input and `int()` will convert it to an integer. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it was already an integer input, and the value of `a` also remains unchanged as it was an integer input. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer input, `a` is an integer input, `b` is an integer input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input, `a` is an integer input, `b` is an integer input**
