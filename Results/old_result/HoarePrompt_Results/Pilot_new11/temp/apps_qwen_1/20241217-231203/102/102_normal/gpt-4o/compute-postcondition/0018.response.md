The code `print('YES')` does not change any variable values; it only prints a string. The condition `(n - (x_prev + 1) * a) % b != 0` remains unchanged, and the value of `y` is defined as `(n - x * a) // b`. Since no new value is assigned to `y` or any other variable, the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `x`, and `x_prev` remain as they were in the initial state. The Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to `a`, and `a` and `b` are integers; the condition `(n - (x_prev + 1) * a) % b != 0` remains unchanged; `y` is `(n - x * a) // b`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to `a`, and `a` and `b` are integers; the condition `(n - (x_prev + 1) * a) % b != 0` remains unchanged; `y` is `(n - x * a) // b`**
