The code `print('YES')` simply prints the string 'YES' to the console and does not affect any variable values. The initial conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input that is greater than or equal to `a`, `a` is an integer input, `b` is an integer input, `x` is an integer input, `y` is equal to `(n - x * a) // b`, and `(n - (x_prev + 1) * a) % b` is not equal to 0.**
