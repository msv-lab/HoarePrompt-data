Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here’s why:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to check if it is possible to find non-negative integers \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(x \cdot a + y \cdot b = n\), where \(n\) is the amount of money Vasya has, \(a\) is the cost of one bottle of Ber-Cola, and \(b\) is the cost of one Bars bar.

2. **Algorithm Logic**:
   - The program iterates through all possible values of \(x\) from \(0\) to \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{a} \right\rfloor\).
   - For each value of \(x\), it checks if \((n - x \cdot a)\) is divisible by \(b\). This is equivalent to checking if there exists a non-negative integer \(y\) such that \(y \cdot b = n - x \cdot a\).
   - If such a \(y\) is found, it means Vasya can indeed buy \(x\) bottles of Ber-Cola and \(y\) Bars bars to spend exactly \(n\) burles. The program then prints "YES" followed by the values of \(x\) and \(y\).
   - If no such \(x\) and \(y\) are found after iterating through all possibilities, the program prints "NO".

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the cases where \(x\) might be zero, meaning Vasya doesn’t need to buy any Ber-Cola.
   - It also ensures that \(x\) and \(y\) are non-negative integers.

4. **Input Handling**:
   - The program assumes valid input (i.e., \(1 \leq n, a, b \leq 10^7\)) and does not need to handle invalid inputs explicitly because the problem statement specifies valid ranges.

Since the program correctly implements the logic and handles all required cases as specified in the problem description, the correctness of the program is **True**.
