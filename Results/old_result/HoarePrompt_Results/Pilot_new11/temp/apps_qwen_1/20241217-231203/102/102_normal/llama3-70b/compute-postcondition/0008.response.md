The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately without changing any variables or their values. Therefore, all the variables retain their previous states.

Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the input integer, `b` is an integer equal to the new input integer, `n` is a non-negative input integer, `x` is unchanged, `y` is the value of `(n - x * a) // b`, and the condition `x * a + y * b == n` is satisfied; `x` and `y` are printed.**
