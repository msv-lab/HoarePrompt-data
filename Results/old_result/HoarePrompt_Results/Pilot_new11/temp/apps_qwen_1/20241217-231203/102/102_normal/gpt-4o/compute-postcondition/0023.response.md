The code snippet `print('NO')` simply prints the string 'NO'. This does not affect the values of `n`, `a`, or `b`. The loop described in the initial state does not execute because the print statement is executed immediately.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to `a`, `a` and `b` are integers, and the value printed is 'NO'**
