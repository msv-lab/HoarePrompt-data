The code `print(x, y)` prints the values of `x` and `y`. According to the initial state, `x` is an integer input, and `y` is calculated as `(n - x * a) // b`. No other variables are affected by this code. Therefore, the output of the print statement will be the values of `x` and `y`, but the variables `n`, `a`, `b`, and `x` retain their initial values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input that is greater than or equal to `a`, `a` is an integer input, `b` is an integer input, `x` is an integer input, `y` is equal to `(n - x * a) // b`, `x` and `y` are printed.**
