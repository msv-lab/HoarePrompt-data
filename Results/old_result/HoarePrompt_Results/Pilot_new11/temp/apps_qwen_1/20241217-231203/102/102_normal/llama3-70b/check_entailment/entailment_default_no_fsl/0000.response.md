Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails when the equation \(x \cdot a + y \cdot b = n\) has no solution. The code iterates over possible values of \(x\) from 0 to \(\frac{n}{a}\) and checks if there exists a corresponding \(y\) such that the equation holds. However, this approach does not guarantee finding a solution if one exists, especially when \(a\) and \(b\) are not coprime.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following input:

```
15
4
8
```

The correct answer should be "NO" because there are no non-negative integers \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(4x + 8y = 15\). However, the provided code will iterate through possible values of \(x\) and check for \(y\), but it will not correctly identify that no solution exists. As a result, the code will either exit early if it finds a valid \(x\) and \(y\) (which does not exist in this case) or will incorrectly indicate a solution if it reaches the end of the loop without finding one.

A more robust solution would involve checking if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\) divides \(n\). If it does, then a solution exists. If it does not, then no solution exists.

Here is an example of how to correctly solve this problem:

```python
import math

def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    
    # Check if GCD(a, b) divides n
    if math.gcd(a, b) > 1 and n % math.gcd(a, b) != 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        
        # Solve for x and y using extended Euclidean algorithm
        def extended_gcd(a, b):
            if a == 0:
                return (b, 0, 1)
            gcd, x1, y1 = extended_gcd(b % a, a)
            x = y1 - (b // a) * x1
            y = x1
            return gcd, x, y
        
        gcd, x, y = extended_gcd(a, b)
        
        # Scale x and y to match n
        x *= n // gcd
        y *= n // gcd
        
        print(x, y)

func()
```

This code correctly handles all potential cases by ensuring that a solution exists if and only if the GCD of \(a\) and \(b\) divides \(n\).
