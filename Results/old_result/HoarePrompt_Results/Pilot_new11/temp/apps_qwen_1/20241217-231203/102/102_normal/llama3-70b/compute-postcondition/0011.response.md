`y` is assigned the value `(n - x * a) // b`. From the initial state, we know that `x` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, which means `x` is now `x + 1`. The value of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, we can substitute the updated `x` into the equation for `y`.

Given:
- `x` is incremented by 1, so `x` is now `x + 1`.
- `y` is calculated as `(n - (x + 1) * a) // b`.

So, the new value of `y` is `(n - (x + 1) * a) // b`.

Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the input integer, `b` is an integer equal to the new input integer, `n` is a non-negative input integer, `x` is `x + 1`, `y` is `(n - (x + 1) * a) // b`**
