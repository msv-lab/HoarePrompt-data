Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Initial States:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:
     - `a`, `b`, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers.
     - If `x * a + y * b == n`, then `x` is incremented by 1, `y` is updated to `(n - (x + 1) * a) // b`, and 'YES' is printed to the console. Otherwise, no additional changes occur to the variables.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `x` from `0` to `n // a`.

3. **Determine the State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - We need to determine what the state should be at the start of the next iteration of the loop.
   - If the condition `x * a + y * b == n` is not met, `x` remains the same and `y` remains unchanged. However, if the condition is met, `x` is incremented by 1, and `y` is updated.

4. **Check the Previous Iteration Result:**
   - Since we don't know the exact value of `x` and `y` from the previous iteration, we need to consider both possibilities:
     - If the condition was not met: `x` remains the same, and `y` remains unchanged.
     - If the condition was met: `x` is incremented by 1, and `y` is updated.

5. **Formulate the New State:**
   - Let's assume the condition was not met in the previous iteration (since we don't have specific values, this is the most general case to consider).
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
     - `x` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
     - `y` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
     - `n` remains the same.
     - `x` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration.
     - `y` will be updated based on the new value of `x`.

6. **Update the State:**
   - Since `x` is incremented by 1 in the next iteration, let's denote the current value of `x` as `x_current`.
   - The new value of `x` will be `x_current + 1`.
   - `y` will be updated to `(n - (x_current + 1) * a) // b`.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

**State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `x` is `x_current + 1`, `y` is `(n - (x_current + 1) * a) // b`**.
