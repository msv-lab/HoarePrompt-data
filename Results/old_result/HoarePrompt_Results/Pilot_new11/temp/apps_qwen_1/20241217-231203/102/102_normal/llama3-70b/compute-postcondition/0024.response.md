The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `a`, and `b`. All three parameters are integers such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10 000 000. 

- Case_1: If no specific condition related to `n`, `a`, and `b` is mentioned, we assume the function might return a default value or handle the inputs in a general way without additional constraints.
- Case_2: If `n`, `a`, and `b` meet certain conditions, the function returns a specific value based on those conditions.

Since no specific conditions or return values are provided beyond the parameter constraints, we can summarize the functionality as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `a`, and `b`, all of which are integers within the range 1 to 10 000 000, and returns a value based on unspecified conditions.**
