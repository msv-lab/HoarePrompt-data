The code prints the values of `x` and `y`. Given the initial conditions, `x` is an integer, and `y` is defined as `(n - x * a) // b`, which evaluates to an integer because `(n - x * a) % b` is 0. Printing `x` and `y` does not change their values or introduce new ones; it only outputs them. Therefore, the values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to `a`, `a` is an integer input, `b` is an integer input, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer equal to `(n - x * a) // b`, and printed text is 'YES', `x` is printed, `y` is printed**
