The code `print('YES')` does not affect any of the variables. It simply prints 'YES' to the console. The output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the input integer, `b` is an integer equal to the new input integer, `n` is a non-negative input integer, `x` is `x + 1`, `y` is `(n - (x + 1) * a) // b`, and 'YES' is printed to the console.**
