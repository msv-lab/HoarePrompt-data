Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables and Their Initial States:**
   - `a`: An integer equal to the input integer.
   - `b`: An integer equal to the new input integer.
   - `n`: An input integer.

2. **Understand the For Loop Condition:**
   - The for loop iterates over `range(n // a + 1)`.
   - This means the loop will run from `x = 0` to `x = (n // a)`, inclusive.

3. **Determine the Necessary Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
   - For the loop to execute, the expression `n // a + 1` must evaluate to a positive integer.
   - This implies that `n // a` must be non-negative and greater than or equal to 0.

4. **Consider the Value of `n // a`:**
   - If `n // a` is 0, the loop will only run once (for `x = 0`).
   - If `n // a` is greater than 0, the loop will run multiple times.

5. **Adjust the States:**
   - We need to ensure that `n // a` evaluates to a non-negative integer.
   - This requires that `n` should be non-negative (since division by zero is undefined and negative values might cause unexpected behavior).

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states such that `n` is non-negative and `a` is a valid divisor of `n`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`a` is an integer equal to the input integer, `b` is an integer equal to the new input integer, `n` is a non-negative input integer**
