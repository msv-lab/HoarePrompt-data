`y` is assigned the value of `(n - x * a) // b`. The value of `n` is a non-negative input integer, `a` is an integer equal to the input integer, and `b` is an integer equal to the new input integer. The value of `x` remains unchanged, and the value of `y` is the result of the expression `(n - x * a) // b`.

Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the input integer, `b` is an integer equal to the new input integer, `n` is a non-negative input integer, `x` is unchanged, `y` is the value of `(n - x * a) // b`**
