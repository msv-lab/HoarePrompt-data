Output State: **`queue` contains all possible reachable states from the initial state `start` that have not been visited, `visited` contains all previously visited states, `directions` remains as `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`, `empty_row` is the row index of the empty space in the current state, `empty_col` is the column index of the empty space in the current state, `empty_pos` remains as `empty_row * 2 + empty_col`, `current` is the leftmost element of `queue` before each iteration, `new_row` and `new_col` are the new positions of the empty space based on the direction `(dr, dc)`, `new_pos` is the position index of the new state, `new_state` is a list of the current state with the empty space moved to the new position, `new_state_str` is the string representation of `new_state`, and if a new state is not in `visited`, it is added to both `visited` and `queue`. If a new state is already in `visited`, it is not added again.**
