The code `x2 = i` updates the value of `x2` to be the current value of `i`. The value of `i` is `i + 1` from the initial state. Therefore, `x2` will be `i + 1`.

The other variables (`puzzle1`, `puzzle2`, `x1`) remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`puzzle1` is a string consisting of 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X', `puzzle2` is a string consisting of 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X', `i` is `i + 1`, `x1` is `i + 1` if `puzzle2[i + 1]` is 'X', otherwise `x1` is `i`, `x2` is `i + 1`**
