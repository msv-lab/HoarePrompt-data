The code creates a set named `visited` and adds the `start` string to it. This means that the `start` configuration of the 2x2 sliding puzzle is now marked as visited.

Output State: **`start` is a string representing the initial configuration of a 2x2 sliding puzzle, `queue` is a deque containing `start`, `visited` is a set containing `start`.**
