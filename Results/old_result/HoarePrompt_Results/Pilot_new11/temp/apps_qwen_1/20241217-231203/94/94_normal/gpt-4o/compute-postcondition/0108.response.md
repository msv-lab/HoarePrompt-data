The code `new_state_str = ''.join(new_state)` joins the elements of the list `new_state` into a single string. The elements of `new_state` remain unchanged, but they are now combined into a string. 

Since the elements of `new_state` are already defined and no new values are assigned to `new_row`, `new_col`, `new_pos`, or `new_state`, these variables retain their previous states. Therefore, the only change is that `new_state` is now a string representation of its elements.

Output State: **`new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `new_state` is a list containing the same elements as `current` with the elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped, and `new_state_str` is a string formed by joining the elements of `new_state`.**
