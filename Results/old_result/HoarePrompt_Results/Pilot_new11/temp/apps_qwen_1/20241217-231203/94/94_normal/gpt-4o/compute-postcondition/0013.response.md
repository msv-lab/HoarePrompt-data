The code `new_state_str = ''.join(new_state)` concatenates the elements of the `new_state` list into a single string. Since `new_state` is a list equal to `current` with the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped, the resulting string `new_state_str` will be a string representation of this modified list.

The other variables (`queue`, `directions`, `new_row`, `new_col`, `new_pos`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`queue` is not empty, `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `new_state` is a list equal to `current` with the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped, `new_state_str` is a string representation of `new_state`.**
