Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not meet the problem description. The program uses `func_1` to extract a substring from the input puzzles, which is not relevant to the problem of checking if the puzzles can reach the same configuration. The `func_2` function correctly generates all reachable states from a given initial state but does not compare these states between Bessie's and Elsie's puzzles. Therefore, the program cannot accurately determine if the two puzzles can reach the same configuration. The annotated version confirms this by showing that `func_2` is applied separately to both puzzles without comparing the results, thus failing to solve the problem as required.
