Postcondition: ***`directions` contains at least one element, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`. If `0 <= new_row < 2 and 0 <= new_col < 2` holds true, then `new_pos` is either 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, `new_state` is a list copy of `current` but with the elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped, `new_state_str` is a string representation of the concatenated characters of the `new_state` list. If `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, `queue` remains unchanged. If `new_state_str` is in `visited`, `queue` now contains `new_state_str`. If the condition `0 <= new_row < 2 and 0 <= new_col < 2` does not hold, no changes occur in `new_pos`, `new_state`, `new_state_str`, `queue`, `visited`.***
