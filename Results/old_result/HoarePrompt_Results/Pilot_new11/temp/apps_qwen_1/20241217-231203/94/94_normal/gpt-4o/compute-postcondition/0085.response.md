The code `new_state = list(current)` creates a new list called `new_state` that is a copy of the `current` list. The variables `directions`, `new_row`, `new_col`, and `new_pos` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except that `new_state` is now a list that is a copy of `current`.

Output State: **`directions` is a non-empty list, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `new_row * 2 + new_col`, `new_state` is a list that is a copy of `current`.**
