The code removes the leftmost element from the deque `queue` and assigns it to the variable `current`. The previous value of `current` is taken from the leftmost position in `queue`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`start` is a string representing the initial configuration of a 2x2 sliding puzzle, `queue` is a deque containing the elements after removing the leftmost element, `visited` is a set containing `start`, `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is the leftmost element of `queue` before removal.**
