Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not implement the sliding puzzle logic correctly. The function `func_1` simply swaps the positions of the empty cells ('X') in both puzzles and then checks if the remaining characters are the same in any order. This approach fails to simulate the actual moves (slides) that can be made in the puzzle, which are necessary to determine if the puzzles can reach the same configuration. The output hints confirm that the function only checks if the remaining characters are the same, without considering the sequence of valid moves. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
