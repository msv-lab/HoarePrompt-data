The code `new_row, new_col = empty_row + dr, empty_col + dc` updates the values of `new_row` and `new_col`. According to the initial state, `new_row` was originally `empty_row + dr` and `new_col` was originally `empty_col + dc`. Now, these assignments directly compute the new values for `new_row` and `new_col` using the same expressions.

Output State: **`directions` contains at least one element, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`**
