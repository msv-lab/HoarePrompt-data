The code appends `new_state_str` to the `queue`. This means that the string representation of `new_state` is added to the queue. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `new_state` is a list created from `current` with the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped; `new_state_str` is a string created by joining all elements in `new_state`; `visited` now includes `new_state_str`; `queue` now includes `new_state_str`.**
