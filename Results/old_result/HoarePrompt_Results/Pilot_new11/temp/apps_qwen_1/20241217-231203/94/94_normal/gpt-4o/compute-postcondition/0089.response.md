The code adds the string representation of `new_state` to the set `visited`. This means that the string representation of `new_state` is now included in the set `visited`.

- The values of `directions`, `new_row`, `new_col`, `new_pos`, `new_state`, and `new_state_str` remain unchanged.
- The set `visited` now includes `new_state_str`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`directions` is a non-empty list, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `new_state` is a list where the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` are swapped, `new_state_str` is a string representation of the list `new_state`, and `new_state_str` is in `visited`. `visited` now includes `new_state_str`.**
