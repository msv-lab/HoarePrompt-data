`new_row` and `new_col` are assigned the values `empty_row + dr` and `empty_col + dc`, respectively. The variables `empty_row` and `empty_col` are part of the initial state, and `dr` and `dc` represent changes in row and column, respectively. The `directions` list remains unchanged.

Output State: **`directions` must contain at least one element, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`**
