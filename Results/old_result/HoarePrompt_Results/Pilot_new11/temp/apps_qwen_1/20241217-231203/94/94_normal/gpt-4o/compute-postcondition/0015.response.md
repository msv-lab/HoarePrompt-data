The code `visited.add(new_state_str)` adds the string representation of `new_state` to the set `visited`. This means that the `new_state_str` is now included in the set `visited`.

Other variables are not affected, so the output state is:
- `queue` is not empty
- `directions` is `[(−1, 0), (1, 0), (0, −1), (0, 1)]`
- `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`
- `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`
- `new_pos` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3
- `new_state` is a list equal to `current` with the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped
- `new_state_str` is a string representation of `new_state`
- `new_state_str` is now in `visited`

Output State: **`queue` is not empty, `directions` is `[(−1, 0), (1, 0), (0, −1), (0, 1)]`, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `new_state` is a list equal to `current` with the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped, `new_state_str` is a string representation of `new_state` and `new_state_str` is in `visited`**
