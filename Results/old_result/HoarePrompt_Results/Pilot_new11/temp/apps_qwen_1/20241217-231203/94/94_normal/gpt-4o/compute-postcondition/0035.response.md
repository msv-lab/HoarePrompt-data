The code adds the `new_state_str` to the set `visited`. This operation does not change the values of the other variables. The set `visited` now contains the string representation of `new_state`, but the values of `new_row`, `new_col`, `new_pos`, `new_state`, and `new_state_str` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `new_state` is a list created from `current` with the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped; `new_state_str` is a string created by joining all elements in `new_state`; `visited` now includes `new_state_str`.**
