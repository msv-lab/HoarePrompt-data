The code `empty_row, empty_col = divmod(empty_pos, 2)` calculates the quotient (`empty_row`) and remainder (`empty_col`) when `empty_pos` is divided by 2. Since `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, and `current` was the leftmost element that was removed from `queue`, the value of `empty_pos` is a specific index. The `divmod` function will return a tuple where the first element is the quotient and the second element is the remainder.

Let's assume `empty_pos` is a specific value, for example, let's say `empty_pos` is 3 (since indices start from 0, this would mean the 'X' is in the 4th position).

- If `empty_pos` is 3, then `divmod(3, 2)` will return `(1, 1)`. This means `empty_row` is 1 and `empty_col` is 1.
- The other variables (`queue`, `current`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`queue` is not empty except for its leftmost element which is no longer in the queue; `current` is equal to the leftmost element that was removed from `queue`; `empty_row` is 1; `empty_col` is 1.**
