Postcondition: ***`directions` contains at least one element, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `current` is now `new_state`, `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` are swapped, `new_state_str` is a string representing the joined elements of `new_state`, and `new_state_str` is added to `visited`. If `new_state_str` is already in `visited`, no changes occur.***
