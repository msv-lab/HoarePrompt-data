The code adds `new_state_str` to the set `visited`. This means that `new_state_str` is now a member of the `visited` set, and no other changes are made to the variables. The precondition remains intact, meaning the values of `new_row`, `new_col`, `new_pos`, `new_state`, and `new_state_str` are preserved.

Output State: **`new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `new_state` is a list containing the same elements as `current` with the elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped, `new_state_str` is a string formed by joining the elements of `new_state`, and `new_state_str` is added to the set `visited`.**
