The code assigns the value of `i` to `x1`. Given that `i` is between 0 and 3 inclusive and the value of `puzzle1[i]` is 'X', the value of `x1` will be the same as the value of `i`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`puzzle1` is a string consisting of 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X', `puzzle2` is a string consisting of 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X', `i` is between 0 and 3 inclusive, `x1` is equal to `i`, and `puzzle1[i]` is 'X'.**
