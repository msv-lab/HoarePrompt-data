The code `new_pos = new_row * 2 + new_col` calculates a new position `new_pos` based on the values of `new_row` and `new_col`. Given the precondition that `0 <= new_row < 2` and `0 <= new_col < 2`, `new_row` can be 0 or 1, and `new_col` can be 0 or 1. This means `new_pos` will be calculated as follows:

- If `new_row` is 0 and `new_col` is 0, then `new_pos` is `0 * 2 + 0 = 0`.
- If `new_row` is 0 and `new_col` is 1, then `new_pos` is `0 * 2 + 1 = 1`.
- If `new_row` is 1 and `new_col` is 0, then `new_pos` is `1 * 2 + 0 = 2`.
- If `new_row` is 1 and `new_col` is 1, then `new_pos` is `1 * 2 + 1 = 3`.

Since the code only updates `new_pos` and does not affect any other variables, the output state is:
Output State: **`queue` must not be empty, `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3.**
