You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Bessie the cow and her best friend Elsie each received a sliding puzzle on Pi Day. Their puzzles consist of a 2 × 2 grid and three tiles labeled 'A', 'B', and 'C'. The three tiles sit on top of the grid, leaving one grid cell empty. To make a move, Bessie or Elsie can slide a tile adjacent to the empty cell into the empty cell as shown below: $\rightarrow$ 

In order to determine if they are truly Best Friends For Life (BFFLs), Bessie and Elsie would like to know if there exists a sequence of moves that takes their puzzles to the same configuration (moves can be performed in both puzzles). Two puzzles are considered to be in the same configuration if each tile is on top of the same grid cell in both puzzles. Since the tiles are labeled with letters, rotations and reflections are not allowed.


-----Input-----

The first two lines of the input consist of a 2 × 2 grid describing the initial configuration of Bessie's puzzle. The next two lines contain a 2 × 2 grid describing the initial configuration of Elsie's puzzle. The positions of the tiles are labeled 'A', 'B', and 'C', while the empty cell is labeled 'X'. It's guaranteed that both puzzles contain exactly one tile with each letter and exactly one empty position.


-----Output-----

Output "YES"(without quotes) if the puzzles can reach the same configuration (and Bessie and Elsie are truly BFFLs). Otherwise, print "NO" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
AB
XC
XB
AC

Output
YES

Input
AB
XC
AC
BX

Output
NO



-----Note-----

The solution to the first sample is described by the image. All Bessie needs to do is slide her 'A' tile down.

In the second sample, the two puzzles can never be in the same configuration. Perhaps Bessie and Elsie are not meant to be friends after all...
Program:
```
from collections import deque
#Function 1:
def func_1(puzzle):
    return puzzle[0] + puzzle[1]

#Function 2:
def func_2(start):
    queue = deque([start])
    visited = set([start])
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while queue:
        current = queue.popleft()
        empty_pos = current.index('X')
        (empty_row, empty_col) = divmod(empty_pos, 2)
        for (dr, dc) in directions:
            (new_row, new_col) = (empty_row + dr, empty_col + dc)
            if 0 <= new_row < 2 and 0 <= new_col < 2:
                new_pos = new_row * 2 + new_col
                new_state = list(current)
                (new_state[empty_pos], new_state[new_pos]) = (new_state[new_pos], new_state[empty_pos])
                new_state_str = ''.join(new_state)
                if new_state_str not in visited:
                    visited.add(new_state_str)
                    queue.append(new_state_str)
    return visited


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, the `func_1` function is unnecessary and does not contribute to solving the problem. More importantly, the `func_2` function does not check if the configurations of Bessie's and Elsie's puzzles can reach the same state. Instead, it only generates all possible states from a given starting configuration and returns them.

To verify the correctness, let's consider the following example:

### Example:
- **Bessie's Initial Puzzle:**
  ```
  AB
  XC
  ```
- **Elsie's Initial Puzzle:**
  ```
  CB
  AX
  ```

For this example, we need to check if Bessie's and Elsie's puzzles can be in the same configuration. The program should output "YES" because the configurations can be matched by swapping the positions of 'A' and 'C'.

However, the current implementation of `func_2` only checks if Bessie's puzzle can reach various states but does not compare the states of Bessie's and Elsie's puzzles. Therefore, the program cannot correctly determine if the two puzzles can reach the same configuration.

To fix this, we need to modify the program to compare the configurations generated by `func_2` for both Bessie's and Elsie's puzzles. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import deque

# Function to generate all possible puzzle states
def generate_states(puzzle):
    queue = deque([puzzle])
    visited = set([puzzle])
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while queue:
        current = queue.popleft()
        empty_pos = current.index('X')
        (empty_row, empty_col) = divmod(empty_pos, 2)
        for (dr, dc) in directions:
            (new_row, new_col) = (empty_row + dr, empty_col + dc)
            if 0 <= new_row < 2 and 0 <= new_col < 2:
                new_pos = new_row * 2 + new_col
                new_state = list(current)
                (new_state[empty_pos], new_state[new_pos]) = (new_state[new_pos], new_state[empty_pos])
                new_state_str = ''.join(new_state)
                if new_state_str not in visited:
                    visited.add(new_state_str)
                    queue.append(new_state_str)
    return visited

# Read input
bessie_puzzle = [input().strip() for _ in range(2)]
elsie_puzzle = [input().strip() for _ in range(2)]

# Generate all possible states for both puzzles
bessie_states = generate_states(func_1(bessie_puzzle))
elsie_states = generate_states(func_1(elsie_puzzle))

# Check if there is any common state between the two sets of states
if any(state in elsie_states for state in bessie_states):
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")
```

With this corrected version, the program will properly check if the configurations of Bessie's and Elsie's puzzles can reach the same state, thereby correctly determining if they are truly BFFLs.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts a string `start` representing the initial configuration of a 2x2 sliding puzzle, where 'A', 'B', and 'C' are the labels of the tiles and 'X' is the empty cell. It uses a breadth-first search algorithm to explore all possible moves from the initial state, ensuring that each unique reachable state is visited exactly once. The function returns a set containing all unique reachable states from the initial state `start`.

The function starts by initializing a queue with the initial state and a set to track visited states. It then iterates through each state in the queue, determining the position of the empty cell ('X') and exploring all possible moves within the 2x2 grid boundaries. For each valid move, it generates a new state, adds it to the visited set, and appends it to the queue if it hasn't been visited before. The loop continues until all reachable states have been explored.

Potential edge cases include:
- If the initial state `start` is already in the visited set, the function will not explore any further states.
- If the initial state is not a valid 2x2 sliding puzzle configuration (e.g., not containing exactly one 'X'), the function will either raise an error or behave unpredictably.
- The function assumes that the initial state is a string of length 4, representing a 2x2 grid. Any deviation from this format will result in incorrect behavior or errors.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
