The code appends `new_state_str` to the `queue`. This means that the string representation of `new_state` is added to the `queue`.

- The `queue` now includes `new_state_str`.
- The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`directions` contains at least one element, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `current` is now `new_state`, `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` are swapped, `new_state_str` is a string representing the joined elements of `new_state`, `visited` now contains `new_state_str`, `queue` contains `new_state_str`.**
