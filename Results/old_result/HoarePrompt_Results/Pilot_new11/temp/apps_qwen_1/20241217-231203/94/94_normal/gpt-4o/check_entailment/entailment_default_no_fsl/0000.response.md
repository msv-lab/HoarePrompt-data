Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the sliding puzzle logic required by the problem description. Specifically, the `func_1` function only returns the first two characters of the input string, which is not a valid representation of a 2x2 grid configuration. This means that the subsequent logic in `func_2` is operating on invalid data, leading to incorrect results.

For example, consider the following input:
```
AB
XC
XB
AC
```

- `func_1(bessie_puzzle)` returns `'AB'`.
- `func_1(elsie_puzzle)` returns `'XB'`.

These results are not meaningful configurations of the 2x2 grid and do not reflect the actual state of the tiles. Therefore, the sets `bessie_reachable` and `elsie_reachable` will not contain the correct reachable states, leading to incorrect conclusions about whether the puzzles can be made to match.

To fix this, `func_1` should properly concatenate the two rows of the 2x2 grid to form a valid string representation. For example, it should return `'ABXC'` for the first puzzle and `'XBAC'` for the second puzzle.
