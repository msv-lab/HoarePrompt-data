The code `new_state_str = ''.join(new_state)` joins all elements of the list `new_state` into a single string, where each element is separated by an empty string (which is the default behavior). This operation does not change the values of the elements in `new_state` but creates a new string `new_state_str` that represents the joined elements of `new_state`.

The variables `directions`, `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `dr`, `dc`, `new_row`, `new_col`, `new_pos`, `current`, `new_state`, and `empty_pos` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`directions` contains at least one element, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `current` is now `new_state`, `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` are swapped, `new_state_str` is a string representing the joined elements of `new_state`.**
