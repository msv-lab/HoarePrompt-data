Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer between 1 and 30), `L` (a positive integer up to \(10^9\)), and `costs` (a list of `n` positive integers representing the cost of bottles). It computes the minimum cost to buy a certain number of bottles such that the total quantity is exactly `L`. The function initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` and updates it based on the given costs and a modified version of `costs`. It then iterates backward through `dp` to determine the minimum cost by considering the maximum possible quantities that can be bought without exceeding `L`. The function returns the minimum cost found.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- If `L` is 0, the function should immediately return 0 because no bottles need to be bought.
- If `costs` contains a zero or negative value, the function currently assumes these are positive integers within the specified range. However, the function does not handle invalid inputs like non-integer values or values outside the specified range explicitly. It is assumed that the input is valid unless otherwise specified.

This summary covers the core functionality of the function, including its input parameters, the computation process, and the final output. It also highlights potential edge cases and assumptions about input validity.
