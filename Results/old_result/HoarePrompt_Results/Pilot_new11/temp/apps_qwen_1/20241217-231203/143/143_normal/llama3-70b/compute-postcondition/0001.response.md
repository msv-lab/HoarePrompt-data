The code reads `n` integers from input and converts them into a list of integers using the `map` function and then converts it to a list. This affects the variable `costs`, which is now a list containing `n` integers. The original values of `n` and `L` remain unchanged, and `c` remains the same list of integers.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `c` is a list of `n` integers where each `c_i` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of `n` integers read from input**
