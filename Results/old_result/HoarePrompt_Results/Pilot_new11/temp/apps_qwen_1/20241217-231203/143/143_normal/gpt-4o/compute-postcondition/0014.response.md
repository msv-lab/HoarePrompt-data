Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be at least 2
   - `dp[0]` is the minimum of the original `dp[0]` and `c[0]`
   - `dp[1]` is the minimum of the original `dp[1]` and `c[1]`
   - `dp[2]` is the minimum of the original `dp[2]` and `dp[1] * 2`

2. **For Loop Condition:**
   The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = 30`.

3. **Current Iteration:**
   At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be 3.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3.
   - `n` must still be at least 2 (unchanged).
   - The values of `dp[0]`, `dp[1]`, and `dp[2]` remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration because the loop body is omitted in this example.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be at least 2, `dp[0]` is the minimum of the original `dp[0]` and `c[0]`, `dp[1]` is the minimum of the original `dp[1]` and `c[1]`, `dp[2]` is the minimum of the original `dp[2]` and `dp[1] * 2***
