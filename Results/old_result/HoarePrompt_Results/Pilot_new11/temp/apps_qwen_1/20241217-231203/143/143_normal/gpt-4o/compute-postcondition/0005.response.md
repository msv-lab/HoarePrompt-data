Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**: 
   - `i` is 0
   - `dp[0]` is `c[0]`
   - `n` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 30`

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over `range(n)`, meaning it will iterate from `0` to `n-1`.

3. **Current Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - This means the loop has just started or has completed its first iteration.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented from `0` to `1`.
   - Therefore, `i` should now be `1`.

5. **State Adjustment**:
   - Since the loop condition is `i < n`, the value of `n` does not change.
   - `dp[0]` remains unchanged as no new values have been computed yet in this iteration.

Thus, the updated states at the start of the next iteration of the loop are:
- `i` is 1
- `dp[0]` remains `c[0]`
- `n` remains the same (a positive integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 30`)

So, the final state is:
**`i` is 1; `dp[0]` is `c[0]`; `n` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 30`**
