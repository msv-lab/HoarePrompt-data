Postcondition: ***`i` is 28, `dp[28]` is the minimum of the original `dp[28]` and `c[28]`, `current_cost` is either `2 * dp[28]` or `dp[28]` depending on the condition in the if part, `L` is adjusted as follows: if `L_initial >= 2^28`, then `L` is `L_initial - 2 * (2^28)`, otherwise `L` is 0; `answer` is the minimum of the current `answer` and `current_cost + dp[28]` if `L > 0`. If the condition `L >= 1 << i` is true, `L` is further adjusted to `L_initial - 2 * (2^28)` and `answer` is updated accordingly. Otherwise, no change is made to `L` and `answer` remains as per the if part.***
