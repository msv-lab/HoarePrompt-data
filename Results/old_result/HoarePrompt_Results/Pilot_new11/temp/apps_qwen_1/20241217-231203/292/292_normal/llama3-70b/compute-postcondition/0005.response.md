The code increments the value of `years` by 1. The initial state shows that `a` is 3 times its original value (between 3 and 30 inclusive), `b` is 2 times its original value (between 2 and 20 inclusive), and `years` is 0. After executing `years += 1`, the value of `years` is updated to 1. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.

Output State: **`a` is 3 times its original value (between 3 and 30 inclusive), `b` is 2 times its original value (between 2 and 20 inclusive), and `years` is 1**
