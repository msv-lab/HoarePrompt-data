The function `func` does not accept any parameters as indicated by the function definition `def func()`. The functionality of the function is not specified in the given information, but based on the parameter constraints, it deals with two positive integers `a` and `b` such that \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10\).

Given the lack of specific output details, we can only state the parameter constraints and the fact that the function does not take any additional parameters beyond those implied.
