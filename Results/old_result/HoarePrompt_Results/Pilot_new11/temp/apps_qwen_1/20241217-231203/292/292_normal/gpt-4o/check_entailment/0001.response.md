Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iteratively triples Limak's weight and doubles Bob's weight until Limak's weight becomes strictly larger than Bob's weight. The program counts the number of years required to achieve this condition.

Given the constraints (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10), the program will always find a point where Limak's weight surpasses Bob's weight, as Limak's weight grows exponentially faster (tripled each year) compared to Bob's (doubled each year).

Let's verify this by considering the examples provided:

1. For input `4 7`:
   - Year 1: Limak = 4 * 3 = 12, Bob = 7 * 2 = 14 (Limak < Bob)
   - Year 2: Limak = 12 * 3 = 36, Bob = 14 * 2 = 28 (Limak > Bob)

2. For input `4 9`:
   - Year 1: Limak = 4 * 3 = 12, Bob = 9 * 2 = 18 (Limak < Bob)
   - Year 2: Limak = 12 * 3 = 36, Bob = 18 * 2 = 36 (Limak = Bob)
   - Year 3: Limak = 36 * 3 = 108, Bob = 36 * 2 = 72 (Limak > Bob)

3. For input `1 1`:
   - Year 1: Limak = 1 * 3 = 3, Bob = 1 * 2 = 2 (Limak > Bob)

Since the program handles these cases correctly and the exponential growth ensures that Limak's weight will eventually surpass Bob's weight, the program is correct.
