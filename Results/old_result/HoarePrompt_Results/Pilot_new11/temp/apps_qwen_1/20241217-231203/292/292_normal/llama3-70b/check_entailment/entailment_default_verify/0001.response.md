Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of years it takes for Limak to become strictly larger than Bob. The output hints confirm that the program iterates until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's weight, and the number of iterations (years) is printed. The program handles all given test cases and potential cases within the constraints (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10). Since the output hints align with the expected behavior and the original assessment, there is no reason to change the original assessment.
