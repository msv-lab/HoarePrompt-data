Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic to determine after how many full years Limak will become strictly larger than Bob. The function reads two integers \(a\) and \(b\) from the input, representing the current weights of Limak and Bob respectively. It then enters a loop where Limak's weight is tripled and Bob's weight is doubled each year. The loop continues until Limak's weight becomes strictly greater than Bob's weight, and the number of years required is counted and printed.

Given the constraints \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10\), the code handles all potential cases as described. The output hints confirm that the function correctly simulates the yearly weight changes and stops when Limak's weight exceeds Bob's weight. Since the code works for all valid inputs within the specified range and adheres to the problem description, the program is correct.
