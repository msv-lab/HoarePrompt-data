Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `a` is 3, 6, 9, or 10.
   - `b` is 6.
   - `years` is 1.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition is `a <= b`.

3. **Determine the Current Value of `a`:**
   - Since `a` can be 3, 6, 9, or 10, we need to consider each case separately to see if the loop can execute again.

4. **Case Analysis:**
   - If `a` is 3, the condition `a <= b` (3 <= 6) is true, so the loop can execute again.
   - If `a` is 6, the condition `a <= b` (6 <= 6) is true, so the loop can execute again.
   - If `a` is 9, the condition `a <= b` (9 <= 6) is false, so the loop cannot execute again.
   - If `a` is 10, the condition `a <= b` (10 <= 6) is false, so the loop cannot execute again.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `a` must be either 3 or 6.
   - The values of `b` and `years` do not change within the loop and are already set to 6 and 1 respectively.

6. **Modified Program State:**
   - `a` must be either 3 or 6.
   - `b` remains 6.
   - `years` remains 1.

Therefore, the modified program state for the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `a` is 3 or 6, `b` is 6, `years` is 1**
