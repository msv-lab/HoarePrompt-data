`b` is multiplied by 2. Since `b` was originally between 2 and 20 inclusive, multiplying it by 2 will make it between 4 and 40 inclusive. The value of `a` remains unchanged and is still 9 times its original value (between 9 and 90 inclusive).

Output State: **`a` is between 9 and 90 inclusive; `b` is between 4 and 40 inclusive**
