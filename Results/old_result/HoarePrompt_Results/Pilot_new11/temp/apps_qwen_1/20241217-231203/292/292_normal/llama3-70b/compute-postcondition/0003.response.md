The code `a *= 3` multiplies the value of `a` by 3. Given the initial conditions, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10 inclusive, and `b` is also an integer between 1 and 10 inclusive, with the constraint \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10\). The value of `b` remains unchanged, and `years` is initially 0.

After executing the code, the value of `a` will be tripled, while `b` and `years` remain the same.

Output State: **`a` is 3 times its original value (between 3 and 30 inclusive), `b` is an integer between 1 and 10 inclusive, and `years` is 0**
