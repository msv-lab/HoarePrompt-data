You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The Fair Nut likes kvass very much. On his birthday parents presented him $n$ kegs of kvass. There are $v_i$ liters of kvass in the $i$-th keg. Each keg has a lever. You can pour your glass by exactly $1$ liter pulling this lever. The Fair Nut likes this drink very much, so he wants to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass. But he wants to do it, so kvass level in the least keg is as much as possible.

Help him find out how much kvass can be in the least keg or define it's not possible to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $s$ ($1 \le n \le 10^3$, $1 \le s \le 10^{12}$) — the number of kegs and glass volume.

The second line contains $n$ integers $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n$ ($1 \le v_i \le 10^9$) — the volume of $i$-th keg.


-----Output-----

If the Fair Nut cannot pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass, print $-1$. Otherwise, print a single integer — how much kvass in the least keg can be.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3
4 3 5

Output
3

Input
3 4
5 3 4

Output
2

Input
3 7
1 2 3

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example, the answer is $3$, the Fair Nut can take $1$ liter from the first keg and $2$ liters from the third keg. There are $3$ liters of kvass in each keg.

In the second example, the answer is $2$, the Fair Nut can take $3$ liters from the first keg and $1$ liter from the second keg.

In the third example, the Fair Nut can't pour his cup by $7$ liters, so the answer is $-1$.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, s) = map(int, input().split())
    v = list(map(int, input().split()))
    v.sort()
    (low, high) = (0, min(v))
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high + 1) // 2
        total = sum((min(mid, x) for x in v))
        if total < s:
            low = mid
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    if sum((min(low, x) for x in v)) != s:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(low)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the required amount of kvass `s` is greater than the total amount of kvass available across all kegs. In such a scenario, the program will incorrectly calculate the minimum amount of kvass in the least keg without checking if it's feasible to obtain `s` liters of kvass.

For example, consider the following input:

Input
```
3 10
4 3 5
```

The total amount of kvass is `4 + 3 + 5 = 12`, which is less than `s = 10`. Therefore, it is impossible to get 10 liters of kvass. However, the program will still output a value for the minimum amount of kvass in the least keg, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `-1`.

To fix this, the program should check if the total amount of kvass is at least `s` before attempting to distribute it among the kegs.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3, s is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 10^12, and v is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^9 for all i.
def func():
    n, s = map(int, input().split())
    v = list(map(int, input().split()))
    v.sort()
    low, high = 0, min(v)
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high + 1) // 2
        
        total = sum(min(mid, x) for x in v)
        
        if total < s:
            low = mid
        else:
            high = mid - 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `v` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, `low` is the final value determined by the loop, `high` is 0, `mid` is the last calculated value of \((\text{high} + 1) // 2\), `total` is the sum of \(\min(\text{mid}, x)\) for each \( x \) in `v`. If the loop terminates with `low` being less than `high`, `low` and `high` represent the range such that no value within this range satisfies the condition `total >= s`. If `low` equals `high`, `low` is the value where `total` is closest to but still less than `s`, and `high` is 0.
    if (sum(min(low, x) for x in v) != s) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        print(low)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `v` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, `low` is the final value determined by the loop, `high` is 0, `mid` is the last calculated value of \((\text{high} + 1) // 2\), `total` is the sum of \(\min(\text{mid}, x)\) for each \( x \) in `v`. If the sum of \(\min(low, x)\) for each \( x \) in `v` is not equal to `s`, the output is `-1`; otherwise, `low` is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `s`, and `v`. 
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3.
- `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 10^12.
- `v` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^9 for all i.

The function aims to find the smallest integer `x` such that the sum of the minimum of `x` and each element in the sorted list `v` is at least `s`. If no such `x` exists, it returns `-1`.

The steps it follows are:
1. It first reads `n`, `s`, and `v` from standard input.
2. It sorts the list `v` in ascending order.
3. It uses binary search to find the smallest `x` satisfying the condition.
4. After the binary search loop, it checks if the sum of the minimum values calculated with `low` meets the requirement. If not, it prints `-1`; otherwise, it prints `low`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- If the input `n` or `s` are out of their specified ranges, the function will raise an error due to incorrect input handling.
- The function assumes that the input list `v` is valid and contains only positive integers. If invalid inputs are provided, the function may produce incorrect results.
- The function does not explicitly handle the case where the initial values of `low` and `high` might not cover the possible range of solutions. However, since `low` starts at 0 and `high` at the minimum value in `v`, it should work correctly in practice.
- The function does not provide any feedback or handle invalid input types other than integers.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
