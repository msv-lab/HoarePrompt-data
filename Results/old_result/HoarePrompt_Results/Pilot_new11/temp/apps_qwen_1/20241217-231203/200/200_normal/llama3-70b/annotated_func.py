#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3, s is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 10^12, and v is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^9 for all i.
def func():
    n, s = map(int, input().split())
    v = list(map(int, input().split()))
    v.sort()
    low, high = 0, min(v)
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high + 1) // 2
        
        total = sum(min(mid, x) for x in v)
        
        if total < s:
            low = mid
        else:
            high = mid - 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `v` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, `low` is the final value determined by the loop, `high` is 0, `mid` is the last calculated value of \((\text{high} + 1) // 2\), `total` is the sum of \(\min(\text{mid}, x)\) for each \( x \) in `v`. If the loop terminates with `low` being less than `high`, `low` and `high` represent the range such that no value within this range satisfies the condition `total >= s`. If `low` equals `high`, `low` is the value where `total` is closest to but still less than `s`, and `high` is 0.
    if (sum(min(low, x) for x in v) != s) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        print(low)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `v` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, `low` is the final value determined by the loop, `high` is 0, `mid` is the last calculated value of \((\text{high} + 1) // 2\), `total` is the sum of \(\min(\text{mid}, x)\) for each \( x \) in `v`. If the sum of \(\min(low, x)\) for each \( x \) in `v` is not equal to `s`, the output is `-1`; otherwise, `low` is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `s`, and `v`. 
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3.
- `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 10^12.
- `v` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^9 for all i.

The function aims to find the smallest integer `x` such that the sum of the minimum of `x` and each element in the sorted list `v` is at least `s`. If no such `x` exists, it returns `-1`.

The steps it follows are:
1. It first reads `n`, `s`, and `v` from standard input.
2. It sorts the list `v` in ascending order.
3. It uses binary search to find the smallest `x` satisfying the condition.
4. After the binary search loop, it checks if the sum of the minimum values calculated with `low` meets the requirement. If not, it prints `-1`; otherwise, it prints `low`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- If the input `n` or `s` are out of their specified ranges, the function will raise an error due to incorrect input handling.
- The function assumes that the input list `v` is valid and contains only positive integers. If invalid inputs are provided, the function may produce incorrect results.
- The function does not explicitly handle the case where the initial values of `low` and `high` might not cover the possible range of solutions. However, since `low` starts at 0 and `high` at the minimum value in `v`, it should work correctly in practice.
- The function does not provide any feedback or handle invalid input types other than integers.
