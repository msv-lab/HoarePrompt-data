Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program accurately implements the logic required to solve the given problem. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program follows the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads two integers `n` and `s` followed by a list of `n` integers representing the volumes of kvass in each keg. This matches the input format specified in the problem description.

2. **Sorting the List**:
   - The list `v` is sorted in ascending order. This step ensures that we can use binary search effectively to find the minimum amount of kvass in the least keg.

3. **Binary Search Implementation**:
   - The program uses a binary search approach to determine the smallest amount of kvass (`low`) that can be poured into the glass without violating the condition that the least keg has the maximum possible amount of kvass.
   - The loop iterates until `low` equals `high`. The midpoint `mid` is calculated using `(low + high + 1) // 2`.
   - For each iteration, the program calculates the total amount of kvass that can be poured using `min(mid, x)` for each keg `x` in `v`.
   - If the total is less than `s`, `low` is updated to `mid`. Otherwise, `high` is updated to `mid - 1`.

4. **Output Determination**:
   - After the loop, the program checks if the total amount of kvass calculated with `low` is exactly `s`.
   - If not, it prints `-1`, indicating that it is not possible to pour `s` liters of kvass.
   - If the total is exactly `s`, it prints `low`, which represents the minimum amount of kvass in the least keg.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases where the total amount of kvass is not sufficient to meet the requirement (`s`).

6. **Functionality**:
   - The program correctly identifies the minimum amount of kvass in the least keg and handles cases where it is not possible to pour `s` liters of kvass.

Given these points, the program accurately follows the problem description and handles all potential cases as required. Therefore, the program is correct.
