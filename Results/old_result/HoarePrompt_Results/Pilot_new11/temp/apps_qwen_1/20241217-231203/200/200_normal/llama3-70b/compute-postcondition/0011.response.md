Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `v` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, `low` is either 0 or (high + 1) // 2, `high` is either greater than 0 or `mid - 1`, `mid` is (high + 1) // 2, `total` is the sum of min(mid, x) for each x in `v`. If `total` is less than `s`, `low` remains as (high + 1) // 2. Otherwise, `low` is set to 0 and `high` is set to `mid - 1`.***
