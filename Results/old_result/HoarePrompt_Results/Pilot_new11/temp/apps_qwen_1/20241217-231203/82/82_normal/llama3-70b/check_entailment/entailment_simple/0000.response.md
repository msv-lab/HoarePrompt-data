Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here's why:

1. **Problem Requirement**: The task requires finding the smallest non-negative integer \( k \) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) is minimized. The program, however, uses a brute-force approach to iterate through all possible values of \( k \) starting from 0 until it finds a \( k \) where the LCM does not decrease further.

2. **Incorrect Brute-Force Approach**: The brute-force method implemented in the while loop does not guarantee finding the minimum LCM efficiently. It checks each value of \( k \) incrementally until it finds a non-decreasing LCM, which is not necessarily the smallest possible LCM. For large inputs, this approach can be very inefficient and may not terminate within reasonable time.

3. **Optimal Solution**: The optimal solution involves understanding the properties of the LCM. Specifically, if \( d \) is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \( a \) and \( b \), then the minimum LCM of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) occurs when \( k \) is chosen such that \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) are both multiples of \( d \). This happens when \( k = 0 \) if \( a \) and \( b \) are already multiples of their GCD, or when \( k = d - (a \mod d) = d - (b \mod d) \).

4. **Simplified Optimal Solution**: A more efficient approach would be to calculate the GCD of \( a \) and \( b \) using `func_1`, and then compute \( k \) based on the modulo operations as described above. The current implementation does not capture this logic and simply iterates through all possible \( k \) values.

### Corrected Implementation (Conceptual):

Hereâ€™s how the problem can be solved efficiently:
```python
import math

def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

(a, b) = map(int, input().split())

d = gcd(a, b)
k = d - (a % d) if a % d != 0 else 0
print(k)
```

This corrected version directly computes the optimal \( k \) without the need for a brute-force search, ensuring correctness and efficiency.
