Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:
   - `decimal_value` is equal to `digit`.
   - The list `digits` must have at least one element.

2. **Loop Structure**: The for loop iterates over each element in the list `digits`.

3. **Current Iteration**: After the previous iteration, the loop has processed one element from `digits`. This means that `decimal_value` was updated to the current element in the list during the last iteration.

4. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more element left in the list `digits`.

5. **State Adjustment**: Since we are considering the state before starting the next iteration, we need to adjust the state such that `decimal_value` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration (since the value of `decimal_value` changes with each iteration but not before the loop starts), and the list `digits` must still have at least one element left to process.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`decimal_value` is the same as the digit that was processed in the previous iteration, `digits` must have at least two elements**. 

To be more specific, if `digit` was the value of `decimal_value` at the end of the previous iteration, then:

State: **`decimal_value` is the value of `digit` from the previous iteration, `digits` must have at least two elements**.
