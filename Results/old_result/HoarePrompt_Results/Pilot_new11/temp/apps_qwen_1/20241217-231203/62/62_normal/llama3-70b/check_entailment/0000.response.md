Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the comparison of the numbers in their respective bases. The `func_1` function converts the numbers from their respective bases to base 10, but the comparison is done directly on these base 10 values. However, the problem requires comparing the numbers in their original bases, not after converting them to base 10.

For example, consider the following input:

Input:
```
2 2
1 1
2 3
2 1
```

Output:
```
=
```

But the correct output should be `<` because `11_2` (which is 3 in base 10) is less than `21_3` (which is 7 in base 10).

Since the program does not handle the comparison in the original bases, it fails for this and potentially other inputs, making the program incorrect.
