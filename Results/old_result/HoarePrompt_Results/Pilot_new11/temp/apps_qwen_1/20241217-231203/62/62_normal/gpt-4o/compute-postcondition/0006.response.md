The code `decimal_value = decimal_value * base + digit` updates the value of `decimal_value` by multiplying it by `base` and adding `digit`. Since `decimal_value` is defined as `decimal_value * base + digit` in the initial state, this operation is essentially updating `decimal_value` to its next state in the calculation process.

Given the initial state: `decimal_value` is `decimal_value * base + digit`, and `digits` must have at least one element remaining, the operation `decimal_value = decimal_value * base + digit` simply updates the value of `decimal_value` according to the given formula. The value of `digits` remains unchanged because no operation affects it.

Therefore, the updated state of `decimal_value` is `decimal_value * base + digit` (which is the same as the initial definition), and `digits` still has at least one element remaining.

Output State: **`decimal_value` is `decimal_value * base + digit`; `digits` must have at least one element remaining**
