Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to convert numbers from their respective bases to decimal and then compare them. The function `func_1` correctly converts a number from a given base to its decimal equivalent. The main part of the program reads the inputs, converts the numbers, and compares them as required. Since the program handles all described cases correctly and the logic is sound, it meets the requirements for every potential case.
