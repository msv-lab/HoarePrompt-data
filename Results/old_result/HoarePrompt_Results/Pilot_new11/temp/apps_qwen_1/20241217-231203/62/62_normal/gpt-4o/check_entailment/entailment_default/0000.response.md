Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic to compare two numbers represented in different bases. It converts both numbers to their decimal representation using the `func_1` function and then compares the resulting decimal values. The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement:

1. It reads the number of digits and the base for both numbers.
2. It reads the digits of both numbers.
3. It converts both numbers to their decimal form using the `func_1` function.
4. It compares the decimal values and prints the appropriate character ('<', '>', or '=').

The `func_1` function correctly converts a number from a given base to its decimal representation by iterating through the digits and calculating the value accordingly. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases that the code is not handling based on the problem description and the examples provided. Thus, the code is correct for every potential case.
