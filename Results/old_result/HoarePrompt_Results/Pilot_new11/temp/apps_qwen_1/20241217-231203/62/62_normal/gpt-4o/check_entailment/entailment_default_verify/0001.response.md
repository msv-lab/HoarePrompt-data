Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the program correctly converts numbers from their respective bases to decimal and then compares them. The function `func_1` accurately performs the conversion, and the main part of the program handles the comparison as required. The output hints confirm that the function `func_1` correctly converts the number from the given base to decimal and leaves the `digits` list empty upon completion. There are no logical errors or missing functionalities in the provided code. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is accurate.
