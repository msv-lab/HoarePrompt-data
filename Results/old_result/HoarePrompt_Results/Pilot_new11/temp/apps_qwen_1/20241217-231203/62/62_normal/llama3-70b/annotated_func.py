#State of the program right berfore the function call: digits is a list of integers representing the digits of a number in a given base, and base is an integer representing the base of the number system (2 ≤ base ≤ 40).
def func_1(digits, base):
    result = 0
    for digit in digits:
        result = result * base + digit
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `digits` is a non-empty list of integers, `base` is an integer between 2 and 40 inclusive, `result` is the integer represented by the list `digits` in the given base `base`.
    return result
    #The program returns the integer represented by the list 'digits' in the given base 'base'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `digits` and an integer `base`, and converts the list `digits` into an integer in the specified base `base`. The function iterates through each digit in the list, multiplying the current result by the base and adding the digit to form the final integer. The function returns this integer. The function handles the case where `base` is between 2 and 40 inclusive. If the `digits` list is empty, the function will not execute the loop and will return 0, as no valid conversion can be performed. There are no other potential edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code.
