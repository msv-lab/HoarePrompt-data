Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly compare the two numbers in their respective bases. Instead, it converts both numbers to decimal and then compares them. However, the problem description requires comparing the numbers directly in their given bases without converting them to decimal. This approach will fail for large numbers where the conversion to decimal would exceed the limits of standard integer types.

For example, consider the following inputs:
- \( X \) in base 3: 2 1 2 (which is \( 2 \times 3^2 + 1 \times 3^1 + 2 \times 3^0 = 20 + 3 + 2 = 25 \) in decimal)
- \( Y \) in base 8: 3 4 (which is \( 3 \times 8^1 + 4 \times 8^0 = 24 + 4 = 28 \) in decimal)

Using the provided code, both numbers would be converted to decimal (25 and 28 respectively) and compared, which would correctly yield `<`. However, the problem requires a direct comparison in their respective bases, which the current implementation does not handle.

To correctly implement the comparison, you would need to write a function that compares the numbers digit by digit in their respective bases, stopping as soon as one number has a larger digit in a given place. This would ensure the correct result for all possible inputs.
