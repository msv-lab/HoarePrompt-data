Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `digits` and an integer `base`, and converts the number represented by `digits` in the specified `base` into its decimal form. After processing, the `digits` list is left empty. The function returns the decimal representation of the number. Potential edge cases include the possibility that the `digits` list could be empty, in which case the function would still correctly return 0. There is no missing functionality in the provided code; it accurately converts the number from the given base to decimal and leaves the `digits` list empty upon completion.**
