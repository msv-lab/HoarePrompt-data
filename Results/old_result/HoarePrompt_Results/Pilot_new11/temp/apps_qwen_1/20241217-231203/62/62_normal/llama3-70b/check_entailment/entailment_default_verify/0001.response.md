Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program correctly reads the input, converts the numbers from their respective bases to decimal using the `func_1` function, and then compares the decimal values. The function `func_1` correctly handles the conversion of a list of digits to an integer in the specified base, even when the list is empty, returning 0 in such cases. The program logic matches the problem description, and there are no issues or edge cases mentioned in the output hints that would suggest the program is incorrect. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being True is maintained.
