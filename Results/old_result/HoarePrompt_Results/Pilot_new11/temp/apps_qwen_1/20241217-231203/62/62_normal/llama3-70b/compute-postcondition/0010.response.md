Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `digits` and an integer `base`, and converts the list `digits` into an integer in the specified base `base`. The function iterates through each digit in the list, multiplying the current result by the base and adding the digit to form the final integer. The function returns this integer. The function handles the case where `base` is between 2 and 40 inclusive. If the `digits` list is empty, the function will not execute the loop and will return 0, as no valid conversion can be performed. There are no other potential edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code.**
