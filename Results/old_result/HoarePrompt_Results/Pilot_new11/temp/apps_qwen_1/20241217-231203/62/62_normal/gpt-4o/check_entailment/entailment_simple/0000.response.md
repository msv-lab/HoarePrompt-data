Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of how it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the number of digits `n` and the base `base_x` for the first number `X` using `map(int, input().split())`.
   - It then reads the digits of `X` into a list `digits_x` using another call to `map(int, input().split())`.
   - Similarly, it reads the number of digits `m` and the base `base_y` for the second number `Y`, and the digits of `Y` into a list `digits_y`.

2. **Conversion to Decimal**:
   - The function `func_1` converts a list of digits from a specified base to its decimal representation. The function iterates through the digits, multiplying the current `decimal_value` by the base and adding the current digit, effectively converting the number from the given base to decimal.
   - After defining `func_1`, the program uses this function to convert both `X` and `Y` to their respective decimal values (`decimal_x` and `decimal_y`).

3. **Comparison and Output**:
   - The program compares the decimal values of `X` and `Y`. Depending on the comparison result, it prints the appropriate character ('<' for X < Y, '>' for X > Y, '=' for X = Y).

Given the steps outlined above, the program correctly adheres to the problem description by:
- Reading the inputs in the specified format.
- Converting the numbers from their given bases to decimal form.
- Comparing the decimal values and outputting the correct character as per the comparison result.

Since the program performs all these steps as required by the problem description, it is correct.
