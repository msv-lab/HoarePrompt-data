The code `left = right = j` sets both `left` and `right` to the value of `j`. Given that `j` is `m-1`, `left` and `right` are now both set to `m-1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-1`, `top` is `n-1`, `bottom` is `n-1`, `left` and `right` are both `m-1`, and `m` must be greater than 0. The current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w'.**
