Output State: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-1`, if there is at least one 'w' pixel in the screen, then `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are set to the minimum and maximum row and column indices of 'w' pixels respectively. If there is no 'w' pixel, then `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` remain as their original values (i.e., `top` and `bottom` as `None` and `left` and `right` as `m-1`).**
