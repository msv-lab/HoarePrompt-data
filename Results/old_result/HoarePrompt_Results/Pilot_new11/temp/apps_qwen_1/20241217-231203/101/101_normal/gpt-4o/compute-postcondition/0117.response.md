Postcondition: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is `n-1`, and `j` is `m-1`. If `top` is initially `None`, `i` remains `n-1`, `j` remains `m-1`, and `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` retain their original values (`top` is `n-1`, `bottom` is `n-1`, `left` and `right` are both `m-1`). Otherwise, `top` retains its original value, `bottom` is set to `n-1`, `left` and `right` are updated to the minimum and maximum row and column indices of 'w' pixels if there is at least one 'w' pixel, and `i` remains unchanged unless `j > right`, in which case `i` remains unchanged as well.**
