Postcondition: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-1`. If `top` is None initially, then `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are all set to `n-1` and `m-1`. Otherwise, if `j` is greater than `right`, then `right` is updated to `j`; `top` is not None, and `bottom` and `left` remain unchanged.**
