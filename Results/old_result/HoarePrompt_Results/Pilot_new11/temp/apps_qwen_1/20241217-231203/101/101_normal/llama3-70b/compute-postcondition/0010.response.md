According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `white_pixels`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `white_pixels` is not an empty list. At the end of the last iteration, `white_pixels` is not an empty list, `min_x` is the minimum of its current value and `x`, `min_y` is the minimum of its current value and `y`, `max_x` is the maximum of its current value and `x`, `max_y` is the maximum of its current value and `y`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `white_pixels` must still contain at least one element. Since we are iterating over `white_pixels`, it means there is at least one (x, y) pair left in the list.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `white_pixels` must not be an empty list.
- `min_x` remains the minimum of its current value and `x`.
- `min_y` remains the minimum of its current value and `y`.
- `max_x` remains the maximum of its current value and `x`.
- `max_y` remains the maximum of its current value and `y`.

State: **`white_pixels` is not an empty list, `min_x` is the minimum of its current value and `x`, `min_y` is the minimum of its current value and `y`, `max_x` is the maximum of its current value and `x`, `max_y` is the maximum of its current value and `y`**
