`left` is assigned the value of `j`. The value of `j` replaces the value of `left`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, if `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `top` remains unchanged, otherwise `top` and `bottom` are both set to `i`; `j` is replaced by `left`, and `right` remains unchanged.**
