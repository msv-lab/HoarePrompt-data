Postcondition: ***`i` is an integer, `j` is an integer, and `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are integers. If `i` is equal to `top`, `bottom`, `left`, or `right`, or if `j` is equal to `left` or `right`, then the value of `result[i][j]` is changed to `'+'`. Otherwise, if `result[i][j]` is `'.'`, no change is made to the program state.***
