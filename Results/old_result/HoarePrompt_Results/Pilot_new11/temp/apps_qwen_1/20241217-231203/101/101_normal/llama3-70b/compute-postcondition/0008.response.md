The code updates the variables `min_x` and `min_y`. The new values of `min_x` and `min_y` are set to the minimum of their current values and the values of `x` and `y` respectively. However, since the initial values of `min_x` and `min_y` are not specified, we denote them as the current values they had before this line of code.

Output State: **`white_pixels` is not an empty list, `min_x` is the minimum of its current value and `x`, `min_y` is the minimum of its current value and `y`**
