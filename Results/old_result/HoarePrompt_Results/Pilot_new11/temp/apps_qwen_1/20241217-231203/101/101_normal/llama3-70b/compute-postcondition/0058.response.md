Postcondition: ***`i` is `n`, `n` is the same as before, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, and `j` is either `min_y + 1` or `max_y + 1`. If `pixels[i][j] == '.'`, then `pixels[i][j]` is set to `'+'`. If `pixels[i][j] == 'w'`, then `pixels[i][j]` is set to `'w'`. Otherwise, `pixels[i][j]` is set to `'.'`.***
