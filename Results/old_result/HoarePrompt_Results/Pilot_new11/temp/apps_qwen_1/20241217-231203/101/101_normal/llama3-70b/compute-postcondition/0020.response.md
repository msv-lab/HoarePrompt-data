Postcondition: **`white_pixels` is not an empty list, `min_x` is the smallest `x` coordinate of all `'w'` pixels, `min_y` is the smallest `y` coordinate of all `'w'` pixels, `max_x` is the largest `x` coordinate of all `'w'` pixels, `max_y` is the largest `y` coordinate of all `'w'` pixels, `frame_size` is `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, and either `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or (j == max_y))` is true or the pixel at position `(i, j)` in `pixels` is not `'.'`.**
