The code `result[i][j] = '+'` updates the value of `result[i][j]` from `'.'` to `'+'.` The other variables (`result`, `i`, `j`, `left`, `right`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`result` is a 2D list with boundary elements marked with `+`, `i` is `bottom + 1`, `j` is `left`, `left` is less than or equal to `right`, `result[i][j]` is `'+'.**
