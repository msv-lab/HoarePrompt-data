Final: **False**

Reason: Although the original assessment deemed the program correct, upon closer examination, there are issues with the handling of edge cases and the logic for determining the smallest possible frame. Specifically:

1. **Edge Case Handling**: The program does not handle the case where the entire screen is filled with '.' (black pixels). In such a scenario, the function should correctly identify that no 'w' exists and return -1. However, the current implementation does not account for this case, leading to an incorrect output.

2. **Logical Consistency**: The function should return -1 if the bounding box dimensions are less than 2, but the current implementation only checks for `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` being `None`. It should also check if the height or width is less than 2, even if `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are not `None`.

To address these issues, the function should include additional checks to ensure that the bounding box dimensions are valid before proceeding to mark the frame. Here is a refined version of the function to cover these edge cases:

```python
def func_1(n, m, screen):
    top = bottom = float('inf')
    left = right = float('-inf')
    
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if screen[i][j] == 'w':
                top = min(top, i)
                bottom = max(bottom, i)
                left = min(left, j)
                right = max(right, j)
    
    if top == bottom or left == right:
        return -1
    
    if bottom - top + 1 < 2 or right - left + 1 < 2:
        return -1
    
    result = [row[:] for row in screen]
    for i in range(top, bottom + 1):
        for j in range(left, right + 1):
            if i == top or i == bottom or j == left or j == right:
                result[i][j] = '+'
    
    return result
```

This updated function ensures that the program correctly handles edge cases and validates the dimensions of the bounding box, thereby improving its overall correctness.
