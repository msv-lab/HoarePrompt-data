The code assigns `'.'` to the element in the `pixels` list at index `i` and column `j`. Since `i` is `n` and `j` is either `min_y + 1` or `max_y + 1`, these assignments will update the `pixels` list at those specific positions. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be the same as before, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `min_y + 1` or `max_y + 1`, `pixels[i][j]` is `'.'`**
