The function reads a grid of pixels from standard input, where each line contains exactly `m` characters representing either a period (black pixel) or the letter 'w' (white pixel). It calculates the bounding box of the white pixels and checks if the bounding box can fit within the original grid dimensions. If the bounding box exceeds the grid dimensions, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it pads the grid with '+' characters along the edges defined by the bounding box and prints the modified grid. The function handles cases where the grid might be too small to contain the bounding box by printing `-1`.
