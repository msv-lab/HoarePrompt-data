The code `pixels[i][j] = '+'` assigns the value `'+'` to the element in the `pixels` list at the index specified by `i` and `j`. Given the initial state:

- `i` is `n`
- `n` is the same as before (though its specific value is not given)
- `m` is greater than or equal to 1
- `j` is either `min_y + 2` or `max_y + 2`

After executing the code, the value of `pixels[i][j]` is now `'+'`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `m`, and `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is the same as before, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is either `min_y + 2` or `max_y + 2`, and `pixels[i][j]` is `'+'`.**
