Output State: **`result` is a 2D list where the elements at the boundaries (i.e., rows `top` and `bottom` and columns `left` and `right`) are marked with `+`, and `i` is `bottom + 1`. If `i` equals `top`, `bottom`, `left`, or `j` equals `right`, and `result[i][j]` is `'.'`, then `result[i][j]` is set to `'+'. No changes occur if `result[i][j]` is not `'.'` or if `j` is not within the range `[left, right]` or if none of the conditions in the if statement are met.**
