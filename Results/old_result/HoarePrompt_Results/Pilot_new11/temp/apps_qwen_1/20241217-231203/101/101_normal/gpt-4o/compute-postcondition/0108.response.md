The code sets `bottom` to the value of `i`. Given the initial conditions, `i` is `n-1`. Therefore, `bottom` is now `n-1`.

The states of the other variables (`top`, `screen`, `j`, `left`, `right`, `m`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-1`, `top` retains its original value, `bottom` is `n-1`, `left` and `right` are set to the minimum and maximum row and column indices of 'w' pixels if there is at least one 'w' pixel, otherwise `top` and `bottom` are `None` and `left` and `right` are `m-1`, and `m` must be greater than 0. The current value of `i` is greater than `bottom`.**
