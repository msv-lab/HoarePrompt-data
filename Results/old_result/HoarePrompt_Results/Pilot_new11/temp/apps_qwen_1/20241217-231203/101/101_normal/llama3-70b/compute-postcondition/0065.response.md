Let's analyze the given loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Loop Analysis
The loop iterates over `j` in the range `0` to `m-1` (inclusive). For each iteration, the following conditions are checked:
1. If `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y) and pixels[i][j] == '.'`, then `pixels[i][j]` is set to `'+'.`
2. If `pixels[i][j] == 'w'`, the loop continues to the next iteration without any change.
3. Otherwise, `pixels[i][j]` is set to `'.'`.

### Initial Conditions
- `i` is initially `n`.
- `n` must be the same as before.
- `m` must be greater than or equal to 1.

### Iteration Observations
- After the first iteration (`j=0`), `j` is either `min_y` or `max_y`. If `pixels[i][j]` is `'.'`, it becomes `'+'`. If `pixels[i][j]` is `'w'`, no change occurs.
- After the second iteration (`j=1`), `j` is either `min_y+1` or `max_y+1`. If `pixels[i][j]` is `'.'`, it becomes `'+'`. If `pixels[i][j]` is `'w'`, no change occurs.
- This pattern continues until `j` reaches `m-1`.

### Final State Determination
Since the loop iterates from `j=0` to `j=m-1`, and for each `j` within this range, the condition checks if `j` is `min_y` or `max_y`, we need to consider the entire range of `j` values.

#### Case 1: `j` is within the range `[0, m-1]`
- For `j` in the range `[0, m-1]`:
  - If `pixels[i][j] == '.'`, it will be set to `'+'`.
  - If `pixels[i][j] == 'w'`, it will remain `'w'`.
  - If `pixels[i][j] != '.'` and `pixels[i][j] != 'w'`, it will be set to `'.'`.

#### Case 2: `j` is outside the range `[0, m-1]`
- If `j` is not in the range `[0, m-1]`, the condition will not be met, and `pixels[i][j]` will remain unchanged.

Given that the loop runs from `j=0` to `j=m-1`, the only cells that will be modified are those where `j` is in the range `[0, m-1]`. Therefore, the cells `pixels[i][j]` where `j` is in the range `[0, m-1]` will be set according to the conditions described above.

### Output State
- `i` remains `n`.
- `n` is the same as before.
- `m` is greater than or equal to 1.
- For `j` in the range `[0, m-1]`, if `pixels[i][j] == '.'`, it will be set to `'+'`. If `pixels[i][j] == 'w'`, it remains `'w'`. Otherwise, it remains `'.'`.
- For `j` outside the range `[0, m-1]`, `pixels[i][j]` remains unchanged.

### Final Output State
Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is the same as before, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, and for `j` in the range `[0, m-1]`: if `pixels[i][j] == '.'`, it will be set to `'+'`; if `pixels[i][j] == 'w'`, it remains `'w'`; otherwise, it remains `'.'`. For `j` outside the range `[0, m-1]`, `pixels[i][j]` remains unchanged.**
