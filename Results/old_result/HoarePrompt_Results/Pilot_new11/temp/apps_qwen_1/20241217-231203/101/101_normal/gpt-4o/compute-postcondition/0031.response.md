The code `right = j` assigns the value of `j` to `right`. The initial conditions for the variables are:

- `screen` is a 2D list of characters
- `i` is the same
- `j` is `j + 1`
- `top` is `i` if `i < top`, otherwise `top` remains unchanged
- `bottom` is now `i`
- `left` is `j` if `j < left`, otherwise `left` remains unchanged
- `right` is the same if `screen[i][j+1]` is 'w' and `j+1 > right`, otherwise `right` remains unchanged

Since the code only changes the value of `right` to `j`, the updated values are:

- `right` is now `j`
- All other variables remain unchanged as per their initial conditions.

Output State: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is the same, `j` is `j + 1`, `top` is `i` if `i < top`, otherwise `top` remains unchanged, `bottom` is now `i`, `left` is `j` if `j < left`, otherwise `left` remains unchanged, `right` is `j`.**
