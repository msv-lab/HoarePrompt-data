According to the given for loop, the loop variable `j` ranges from 0 to `m-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states hold:

- `j` is 0
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `n` is the same as before
- `m` is greater than or equal to 1
- The pixel at position `pixels[i][j]` is either '+' or 'w'
- If `i` is equal to `min_x` or `i` is equal to `max_x` or `j` is equal to `min_y` or `j` is equal to `max_y` and `pixels[i][j]` is '+', the condition remains unchanged.
- Otherwise, if `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', the condition remains unchanged as well.

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` will become 1. The other variables and conditions remain the same unless explicitly stated otherwise within the loop body. However, since no specific changes are mentioned for these variables within the loop, we assume they stay as they are.

Let's summarize the updated states:

- `j` becomes 1
- `i` remains `n - 1`
- `n` remains the same
- `m` remains greater than or equal to 1
- The pixel at position `pixels[i][j]` is either '+' or 'w' (this remains unchanged)
- The conditions related to boundaries and pixels remain unchanged unless modified within the loop body.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`j` is 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the same as before, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, the pixel at position `pixels[i][j]` is either '+' or 'w'.**
