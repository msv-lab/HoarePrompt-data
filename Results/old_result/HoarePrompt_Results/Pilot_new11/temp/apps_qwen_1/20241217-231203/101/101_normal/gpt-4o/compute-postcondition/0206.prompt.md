You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2000, and screen is a list of n strings, each string contains exactly m characters. The characters in the strings are either '.' (representing black pixels) or 'w' (representing white pixels), and at least one 'w' exists in the screen.
def func_1(n, m, screen):
    top = bottom = left = right = None
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if screen[i][j] == 'w':
                if top is None:
                    top = bottom = i
                    left = right = j
                else:
                    if i < top:
                        top = i
                    if i > bottom:
                        bottom = i
                    if j < left:
                        left = j
                    if j > right:
                        right = j
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `screen` is a 2D list of characters, `top` is the minimum row index where there is a 'w' pixel, `bottom` is the maximum row index where there is a 'w' pixel, `left` is the minimum column index where there is a 'w' pixel, `right` is the maximum column index where there is a 'w' pixel.
    if (top is None or bottom is None or left is None or right is None) :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `screen` is a 2D list of characters, `top` is the minimum row index where there is a 'w' pixel, `bottom` is the maximum row index where there is a 'w' pixel, `left` is the minimum column index where there is a 'w' pixel, `right` is the maximum column index where there is a 'w' pixel. All of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are not None.
    frame_height = bottom - top + 1
    frame_width = right - left + 1
    if (frame_height < 2 or frame_width < 2) :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `screen` is a 2D list of characters, `top` is the minimum row index where there is a 'w' pixel, `bottom` is the maximum row index where there is a 'w' pixel, `left` is the minimum column index where there is a 'w' pixel, `right` is the maximum column index where there is a 'w' pixel, `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1`, `frame_width` is `right - left + 1`. The height of the frame (`frame_height`) is at least 2, and the width of the frame (`frame_width`) is at least 2
    result = [list(row) for row in screen]
    for i in range(top, bottom + 1):
        for j in range(left, right + 1):
            if i == top or i == bottom or j == left or j == right:
                if result[i][j] == '.':
                    result[i][j] = '+'
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `result` is a 2D list where all elements at the boundaries (i.e., rows `top` and `bottom` and columns `left` and `right`) are marked with `+`, while all other elements remain unchanged.
    return result
    #`The program returns the 2D list 'result' where all elements at the boundaries (i.e., rows 'top' and 'bottom' and columns 'left' and 'right') are marked with '+'`
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `screen`. 
#
#- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2000.
#- `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each containing exactly `m` characters. These characters are either '.' (representing black pixels) or 'w' (representing white pixels), and at least one 'w' exists in the `screen`.
#
#The function has two cases:
#- Case_1: The program returns -1.
#- Case_2: The program returns -1.
#- Case_3: The program returns the 2D list 'result' where all elements at the boundaries (i.e., rows 'top' and 'bottom' and columns 'left' and 'right') are marked with '+'.
#
#Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept parameters `n`, `m`, and `screen`, and depending on certain conditions, return either -1 or a 2D list 'result' with specific boundary elements marked as '+'.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns -1

Case_2: The program returns -1

Case_3: `The program returns the 2D list 'result' where all elements at the boundaries (i.e., rows 'top' and 'bottom' and columns 'left' and 'right') are marked with '+'`


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
