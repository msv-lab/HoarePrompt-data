The code `right = j` assigns the value of `j` to `right`. According to the initial state, the value of `j` is either set to `left` if `j` is less than `left`, or `j` remains unchanged if `j` is greater than or equal to `left`. The values of `i`, `left`, and `right` are unchanged except for the new value of `right`.

- If `j` is less than `left`, then `j` is set to `left`, and now `right` also equals `left`.
- If `j` is greater than or equal to `left`, then `j` remains unchanged, and `right` now equals `j`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`screen` is a 2D list of characters, if `j` is less than `left`, then `j` is set to `left`, and `right` equals `left`; otherwise, `j` remains unchanged, and `right` equals `j`. The values of `i`, `left`, and `right` are as described.**
