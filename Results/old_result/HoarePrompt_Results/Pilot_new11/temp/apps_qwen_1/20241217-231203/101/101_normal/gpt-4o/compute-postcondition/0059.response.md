Postcondition: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters. `top` is not None. If `i` is less than `top`, then `top` is updated to `i`. Otherwise, the values of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged, and the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w'. The current value of `i` is greater than `bottom`.**
