Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The initial state at the end of the previous iteration is given as:
   - `white_pixels` is not an empty list.
   - `min_x` is the minimum value between `min_x` and `x`.
   - `min_y` is the minimum value between `min_y` and `y`.
   - `max_x` is the maximum value between `max_x` and `x`.
   - `max_y` is the maximum value between `max_y` and `y`.

2. **Loop Structure**: The loop iterates over each tuple `(x, y)` in the `white_pixels` list.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more element in the `white_pixels` list.

4. **State Adjustments**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over elements in `white_pixels`, and we know that `white_pixels` is not empty, it means there is at least one element left to process.
   - The loop variable `(x, y)` will be the next element in `white_pixels`.
   - `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` will be updated based on the current `(x, y)` but these updates are not relevant to determining if the loop can execute again.

5. **New State**: The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is ensuring that there is at least one more element in `white_pixels`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`white_pixels` is not an empty list**.

Since the other variables (`min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`) are updated within the loop, they don't need to be explicitly mentioned in the new state unless their values change significantly or are relevant to the continuation of the loop, which isn't the case here.
