The code assigns the value of `j` to `left`. Initially, `j` is `m-1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the updated value of `left` is `m-1`.

Output State: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-1`, `top` retains its original value, `bottom` is `n-1`, `left` is `m-1`, `right` is `m-1`.**
