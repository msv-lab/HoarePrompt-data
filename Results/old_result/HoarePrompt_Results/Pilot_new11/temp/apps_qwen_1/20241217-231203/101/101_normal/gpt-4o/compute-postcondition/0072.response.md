The code sets `left` and `right` to the same value, which is `j`. This means `right` is assigned the value of `j`, and `left` is also assigned the value of `j`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`top` is `n-1`, `bottom` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-2`, `right` is `j`, `screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is `n-1`, `left` is `j**.
