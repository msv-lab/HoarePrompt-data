The code snippet updates the values of `min_x` and `min_y`. Initially, `min_x` and `min_y` must be defined and initialized, and they are compared with `x` and `y`, respectively, to find the minimum values. Since the exact initial values of `min_x`, `min_y`, `x`, and `y` are not specified, we can denote the updated values of `min_x` and `min_y` in terms of these variables.

Given the initial state:
- `white_pixels` must not be an empty list (not affected by this code snippet).
- `min_x` and `min_y` are defined and initialized to some values.

After running the code:
- `min_x` is updated to the minimum value between its current value (`min_x`) and `x`.
- `min_y` is updated to the minimum value between its current value (`min_y`) and `y`.

Output State: **`white_pixels` must not be an empty list; `min_x` is the minimum value between `min_x` and `x`; `min_y` is the minimum value between `min_y` and `y`.**
