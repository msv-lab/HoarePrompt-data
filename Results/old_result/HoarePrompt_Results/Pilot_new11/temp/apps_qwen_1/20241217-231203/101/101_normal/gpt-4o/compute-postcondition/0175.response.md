`result[i][j]` is assigned the value `'+'.` This means the cell in the `result` matrix at position `[i][j]` changes from `'.'` to `'+'.` The values of the other variables (`i`, `j`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is an integer, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are integers; the value of `result[i][j]` is '+'.**
