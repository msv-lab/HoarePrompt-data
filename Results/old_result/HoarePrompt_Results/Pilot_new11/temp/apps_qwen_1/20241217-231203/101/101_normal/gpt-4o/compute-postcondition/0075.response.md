`bottom` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `i` is `n-1`. The values of the other variables (`screen`, `j`, `right`, `top`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-2`, `right` is either `m-1` or `m-2` depending on the condition, `top` is `n-1`, `bottom` is `n-1`.
