Postcondition: ***`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-2`. If `screen[i][j]` is `'w'`, then `right` is `m-2`. Otherwise, the variables `i`, `j`, `right`, and `top` retain their original values from the precondition, with `right` being `m-2` if `top` is `None` and `right` remains unchanged otherwise.***
