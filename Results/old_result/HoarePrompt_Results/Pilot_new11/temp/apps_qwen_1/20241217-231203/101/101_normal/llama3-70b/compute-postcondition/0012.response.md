The code updates `max_x` and `max_y` to be the maximum values between their current values and the new values `x` and `y`, respectively. Given the initial conditions:

- `white_pixels` is not an empty list,
- `min_x` is the minimum of `min_x` and `x`,
- `min_y` is the minimum of `min_y` and `y`,
- `max_x` is the maximum of its current value and `x`,
- `max_y` is the maximum of its current value and `y`.

After executing the code:

- `max_x` is updated to be the maximum of its current value (`max_x`) and `x`.
- `max_y` is updated to be the maximum of its current value (`max_y`) and `y`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`white_pixels` is not an empty list, `min_x` is the minimum of `min_x` and `x`, `min_y` is the minimum of `min_y` and `y`, `max_x` is the maximum of its current value and `x`, `max_y` is the maximum of its current value and `y`.**
