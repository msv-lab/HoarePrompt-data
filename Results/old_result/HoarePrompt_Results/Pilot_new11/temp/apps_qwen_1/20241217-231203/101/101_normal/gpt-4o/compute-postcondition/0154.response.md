The code creates a new list called `result` that contains the same rows as the `screen` 2D list. The variables `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `frame_height`, and `frame_width` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `top` is the minimum row index where there is a 'w' pixel, `bottom` is the maximum row index where there is a 'w' pixel, `left` is the minimum column index where there is a 'w' pixel, `right` is the maximum column index where there is a 'w' pixel, `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1`, `frame_width` is `right - left + 1`, `result` is a list containing the same rows as `screen`.**
