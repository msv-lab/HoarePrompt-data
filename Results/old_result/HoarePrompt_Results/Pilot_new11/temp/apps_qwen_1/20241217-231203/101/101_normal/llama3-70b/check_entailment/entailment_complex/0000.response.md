Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the input dimensions \( n \) and \( m \).
   - It then constructs the grid of pixels, ensuring that each pixel is either a period (black) or 'w' (white).

2. **Bounding Box Calculation:**
   - The program identifies the coordinates of all white pixels and computes the bounding box (`min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`).
   - This step ensures that the smallest rectangle containing all white pixels is identified.

3. **Frame Size Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the size of the smallest frame that can enclose all white pixels using the bounding box.
   - If the calculated frame size exceeds the grid dimensions, it prints `-1`.

4. **Frame Placement:**
   - The program correctly places the frame on the grid by setting the boundary pixels to '+'.
   - All other pixels remain unchanged, either as they were originally or updated to 'w'.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the modified grid with the smallest enclosing frame of white pixels.

Given the problem description and the assumptions about valid input, the annotated program adheres to the specified requirements in all cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
