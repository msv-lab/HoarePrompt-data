Let's analyze the given scenario step by step.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `result` is a 2D list with boundary elements marked with `+`.
  - `i` is `bottom + 1`.
  - `j` is `left + 1`.
  - `left` is less than or equal to `right`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(left, right + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `i = bottom + 1`
   - `j = left + 1`
   - `left <= right`

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `left` to `right + 1`.
   - At the end of each iteration, `j` is incremented by 1.

3. **End of Previous Iteration:**
   - Assume that the loop has just completed its iteration for the current value of `j`.
   - Therefore, `j` would have been incremented from `left + 1` to `left + 2`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be within the range `[left, right + 1]`.
   - After the previous iteration, `j` is `left + 2`.

5. **Adjusting the State:**
   - To allow the loop to execute again, `j` must be within the range `[left, right + 1]`.
   - This means `left + 2` should be less than or equal to `right + 1`, which implies `left + 2 <= right + 1` simplifies to `left < right`.

### Conclusion:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be `left + 2` and `left` must be less than `right`.

### Updated State:
- `i` remains `bottom + 1`.
- `j` is now `left + 2`.
- `left` must be less than `right`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`result` is a 2D list with boundary elements marked with `+`, `i` is `bottom + 1`, `j` is `left + 2`, and `left` must be less than `right`.**
