According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop iterates over the range from `min_y + 1` or `max_y + 1` to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`, `n` is the same as before, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, and `j` is either `min_y + 1` or `max_y + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to the next value within the range.

Given that `j` was either `min_y + 1` or `max_y + 1`, the next value for `j` would be `min_y + 2` or `max_y + 2`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `j` is set to the next value within the range, while `i` remains `n`, `n` remains the same as before, and `m` remains greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is the same as before, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, and `j` is either `min_y + 2` or `max_y + 2`.**
