The code initializes a list called `pixels` which contains `n` lines, where each line is a list of characters from the input buffer. Each line corresponds to one of the `n` lines of `m` characters each.

The impact of the code is that the variable `n` and `m` remain unchanged, but a new list `pixels` is created and populated with input. The length of `pixels` is `n`, and each element in `pixels` is a list of `m` characters.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, the input buffer contains n lines of m characters each, `pixels` is a list of n lists, where each sublist contains m characters.**
