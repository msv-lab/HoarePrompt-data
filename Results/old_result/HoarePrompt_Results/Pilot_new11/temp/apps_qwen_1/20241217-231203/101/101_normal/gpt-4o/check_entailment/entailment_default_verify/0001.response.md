Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided code does not correctly handle all edge cases as described in the problem description and output hints. Specifically, the function does not correctly return -1 when the entire screen is filled with '.' and does not handle the case where the smallest possible frame is 1x1. The output hints suggest that the function should return -1 in these scenarios, but the current implementation does not cover these cases properly. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being False is maintained.
