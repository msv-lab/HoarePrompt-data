Postcondition: `white_pixels` is not an empty list, `min_x` is the smallest `x` coordinate of all `'w'` pixels, `min_y` is the smallest `y` coordinate of all `'w'` pixels, `max_x` is the largest `x` coordinate of all `'w'` pixels, `max_y` is the largest `y` coordinate of all `'w'` pixels, `frame_size` is `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`. Additionally, the frame size is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`.
