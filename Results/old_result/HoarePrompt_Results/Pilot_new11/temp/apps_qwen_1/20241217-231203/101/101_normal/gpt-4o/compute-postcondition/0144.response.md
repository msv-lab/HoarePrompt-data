Output State: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-1`, `top` and `bottom` are either `None` or the same value (if `top` is `None` initially, `top` and `bottom` will be `None`), and `left` and `right` are the minimum and maximum column indices of 'w' pixels found in the last iteration of the loop.**

Explanation:
- Initially, `i` is `n-1` and `j` is `m-1`. The loop iterates over each column `j` from `0` to `m-1`.
- The conditions inside the loop update `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` based on the position of 'w' pixels.
- After the loop finishes executing, `top` and `bottom` will either be `None` (if no 'w' pixels are found) or the same value (the row index of the 'w' pixel found).
- `left` and `right` will hold the minimum and maximum column indices of 'w' pixels found during the loop's execution. If no 'w' pixels are found, `left` and `right` will remain `m-1`.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the final state of the variables is as described above.
