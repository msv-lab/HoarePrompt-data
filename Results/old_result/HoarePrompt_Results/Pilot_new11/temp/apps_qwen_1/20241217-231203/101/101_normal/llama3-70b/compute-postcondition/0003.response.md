The initial state is:
- `n` is the first integer input
- `m` is the second integer input
- The input buffer contains `n` lines of `m` characters each
- `pixels` is a list of `n` lists, where each sublist contains `m` characters
- `white_pixels` is a list of tuples representing the coordinates (i, j) of all `'w'` pixels in the `pixels` grid
- `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are initialized to `float('inf')`, `float('inf')`, `float('-inf')`, `float('-inf')` respectively

The code initializes four variables:
- `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are set to the initial values provided.

Since these variables are just being initialized to specific values, the output state does not change the values of the other variables but only updates these four variables.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, the input buffer contains `n` lines of `m` characters each, `pixels` is a list of `n` lists, where each sublist contains `m` characters, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples representing the coordinates (i, j) of all `'w'` pixels in the `pixels` grid, `min_x` is `float('inf')`, `min_y` is `float('inf')`, `max_x` is `float('-inf')`, `max_y` is `float('-inf')**.
