`top` is assigned the value of `i`. The initial value of `i` is `n-1`, so `top` is now `n-1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `0`, `top` is `n-1`, `bottom` is `n-1`, `left` is `m-1`, `right` is `m-1`.

Output State: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `0`, `top` is `n-1`, `bottom` is `n-1`, `left` is `m-1`, `right` is `m-1`**
