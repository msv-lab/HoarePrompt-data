The code snippet `print(''.join(row))` does not affect the values of the variables `pixels`, `i`, or `m`. It simply prints the content of the row specified by the current value of `i`. Since `i` is 0, the code is printing the first row of the `pixels` list.

Output State: **`pixels` must be a non-empty list with at least two rows, `i` is 0, `m` is the same as before, and the first row of `pixels` is printed.**
