Postcondition: ***`i` is an integer, `j` is an integer, and `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are integers. If `i` equals `top`, `bottom`, or `left`, or `j` equals `right`, and `result[i][j]` was '.', then `result[i][j]` is set to '+'. No changes occur if `result[i][j]` is not '.' or if `j` is not within the range `[left, right]`.***
