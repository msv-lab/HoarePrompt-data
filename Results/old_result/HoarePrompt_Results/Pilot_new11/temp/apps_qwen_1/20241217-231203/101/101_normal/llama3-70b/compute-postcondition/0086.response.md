The code assigns the value `'.'` to the element in the `pixels` list at the index specified by `i` and `j`. Since `i` is `n - 1` and `j` is 2, the value of `pixels[n-1][2]` is now `'.'`. The states of the other variables (`j`, `i`, `n`, and `m`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is 2, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the same as before, `m` must be greater than or equal to 2; pixels[n-1][2] is '.'**
