Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the key issues:

1. **Frame Calculation**: The program calculates the bounding box (top, bottom, left, right) correctly but does not ensure that this frame is the smallest possible one. The program checks if the calculated frame is at least 2x2 and returns -1 if it is not, but it does not check for smaller valid frames that might exist.

2. **Frame Marking**: The program marks the boundary pixels of the calculated bounding box with '+', but it does not ensure that these are indeed the smallest valid frame. For example, consider the following input:
   ```
   5 5
   .....
   ..w..
   .....
   ..w..
   .....
   ```
   The program would mark the entire 3x3 area around the two white pixels, which is not the smallest valid frame. The correct answer would be to mark only the 2x2 frame around the two white pixels.

3. **Output Format**: The program does not handle the case where no valid frame exists. According to the problem description, if no valid frame exists, the program should print -1. However, the current implementation returns a partially processed screen which does not meet the requirement.

To correct the program, you need to implement a more thorough check to find the smallest valid frame. Hereâ€™s an improved version:

```python
(n, m) = map(int, input().split())
screen = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]

def func_1(n, m, screen):
    top = bottom = float('inf')
    left = right = float('inf')

    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if screen[i][j] == 'w':
                top = min(top, i)
                bottom = max(bottom, i)
                left = min(left, j)
                right = max(right, j)

    if top == bottom or left == right:
        return -1

    # Find the smallest valid frame
    for i in range(top, bottom + 1):
        for j in range(left, right + 1):
            if screen[i][j] == '.':
                if i == top or i == bottom or j == left or j == right:
                    continue
                return -1

    # Mark the frame
    result = [list(row) for row in screen]
    for i in range(top, bottom + 1):
        for j in range(left, right + 1):
            if i == top or i == bottom or j == left or j == right:
                result[i][j] = '+'

    return result

result = func_1(n, m, screen)
if result == -1:
    print(-1)
else:
    for row in result:
        print(''.join(row))
```

This version ensures that the smallest valid frame is found and marked correctly, and handles the case where no valid frame exists.
