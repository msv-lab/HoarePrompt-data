The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `screen`. 

- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2000.
- `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each containing exactly `m` characters. These characters are either '.' (representing black pixels) or 'w' (representing white pixels), and at least one 'w' exists in the `screen`.

The function has two cases:
- Case_1: The program returns -1.
- Case_2: The program returns -1.
- Case_3: The program returns the 2D list 'result' where all elements at the boundaries (i.e., rows 'top' and 'bottom' and columns 'left' and 'right') are marked with '+'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept parameters `n`, `m`, and `screen`, and depending on certain conditions, return either -1 or a 2D list 'result' with specific boundary elements marked as '+'.
