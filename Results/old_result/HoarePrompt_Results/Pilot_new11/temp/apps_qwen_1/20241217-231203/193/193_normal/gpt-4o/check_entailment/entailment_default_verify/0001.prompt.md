You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Memory is now interested in the de-evolution of objects, specifically triangles. He starts with an equilateral triangle of side length x, and he wishes to perform operations to obtain an equilateral triangle of side length y.

In a single second, he can modify the length of a single side of the current triangle such that it remains a non-degenerate triangle (triangle of positive area). At any moment of time, the length of each side should be integer.

What is the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y?


-----Input-----

The first and only line contains two integers x and y (3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100 000) — the starting and ending equilateral triangle side lengths respectively.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y if he starts with the equilateral triangle of side length x.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 3

Output
4

Input
8 5

Output
3

Input
22 4

Output
6



-----Note-----

In the first sample test, Memory starts with an equilateral triangle of side length 6 and wants one of side length 3. Denote a triangle with sides a, b, and c as (a, b, c). Then, Memory can do $(6,6,6) \rightarrow(6,6,3) \rightarrow(6,4,3) \rightarrow(3,4,3) \rightarrow(3,3,3)$.

In the second sample test, Memory can do $(8,8,8) \rightarrow(8,8,5) \rightarrow(8,5,5) \rightarrow(5,5,5)$.

In the third sample test, Memory can do: $(22,22,22) \rightarrow(7,22,22) \rightarrow(7,22,16) \rightarrow(7,10,16) \rightarrow(7,10,4) \rightarrow$

$(7,4,4) \rightarrow(4,4,4)$.
Program:
```
def func():
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    print((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of seconds required to evolve from an equilateral triangle of side length `x` to an equilateral triangle of side length `y`. The formula `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2` is incorrect for this problem.

To understand why, consider the following:

1. The program calculates `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2`, which simplifies to `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2`. This formula incorrectly assumes that we can always reduce the side length by half in each step, which is not true because the side length must remain an integer and satisfy the triangle inequality (the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side).

2. Let's test the program with the example provided in the problem statement: `6 3`.
   - According to the problem, the correct sequence is: $(6,6,6) \rightarrow(6,6,3) \rightarrow(6,4,3) \rightarrow(3,4,3) \rightarrow(3,3,3)$.
   - The program outputs `4`, but the correct answer is `4` as per the example, so this specific case works correctly.

3. However, let's test another example to see if the program consistently works correctly:
   - For `8 5`: The correct sequence is: $(8,8,8) \rightarrow(8,8,5) \rightarrow(8,5,5) \rightarrow(5,5,5)$.
   - The program outputs `3`, which is correct.

4. Now, let's test a more complex example:
   - For `10 4`: The correct sequence could be: $(10,10,10) \rightarrow(10,10,6) \rightarrow(10,6,6) \rightarrow(4,6,6) \rightarrow(4,4,4)$.
   - The program would output `3`, but the correct answer is `3`.

5. Finally, let's test a failing case:
   - For `12 5`: The correct sequence could be: $(12,12,12) \rightarrow(12,12,7) \rightarrow(12,7,7) \rightarrow(5,7,7) \rightarrow(5,5,5)$.
   - The program would output `3`, but the correct answer is `4`.

Given these tests, while some examples seem to work, the general approach of reducing the side length by half in each step does not always hold true due to the constraints of the triangle inequality. Therefore, the program does not correctly handle all cases, making it incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads two integers \(x\) and \(y\) from standard input, where \(3 \leq y < x \leq 100,000\). It then calculates and prints the integer division of \((x - y)\) by 2 plus the remainder of \((x - y)\) divided by 2. This results in the function outputting the smallest integer greater than or equal to \(\frac{x - y}{2}\). There are no explicit return values; the function only prints the result. Potential edge cases include the minimum and maximum values for \(x\) and \(y\) as specified. If \(x\) and \(y\) do not meet the specified constraints, the function will raise a ValueError when attempting to split the input.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
