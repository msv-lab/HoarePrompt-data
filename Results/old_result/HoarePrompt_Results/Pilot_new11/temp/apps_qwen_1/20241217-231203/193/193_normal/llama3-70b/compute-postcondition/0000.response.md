The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts those parts into integers, assigning them to `x` and `y`. Given the initial state where `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, the input will update the values of `x` and `y` accordingly.

Since the input is not specified in this example, let's denote the input as `a b` where `3 ≤ b < a ≤ 100,000`. After the code executes, `x` will be assigned the value of `a` and `y` will be assigned the value of `b`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`x` is `a`, `y` is `b`, 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000**
