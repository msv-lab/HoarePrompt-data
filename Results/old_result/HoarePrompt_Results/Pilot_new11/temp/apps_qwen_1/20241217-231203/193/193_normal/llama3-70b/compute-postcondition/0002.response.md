The function `func` does not accept any parameters as indicated by the empty parameter list. Based on the provided constraints, the function must work within the specified range for variables `x` and `y`, but these variables are not passed as arguments to the function.

Given the constraints: `x` and `y` are integers such that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100 000`.

Since no specific output cases are provided, we cannot determine the exact return value without additional information. However, based on the problem statement, we can infer that the function might calculate or return some value related to `x` and `y` within the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters, works with internal variables `x` and `y` where `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100 000`, and returns a value based on these variables.**
