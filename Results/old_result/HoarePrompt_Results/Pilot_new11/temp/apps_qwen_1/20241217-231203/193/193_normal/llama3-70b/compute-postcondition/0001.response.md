The code `print(abs(x - y))` calculates the absolute difference between `x` and `y` and prints it. Given the initial state where `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, the value of `abs(x - y)` is `x - y` because `x` is greater than `y`. Since `x` and `y` retain their initial values, the output of `print(abs(x - y))` is `x - y`.

Output State: **`x` is `a`, `y` is `b`, 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000; print output is `x - y`**
