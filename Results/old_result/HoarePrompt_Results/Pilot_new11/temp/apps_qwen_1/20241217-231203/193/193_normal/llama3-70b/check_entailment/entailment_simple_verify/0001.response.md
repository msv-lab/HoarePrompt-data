Final: **False**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the program simply calculates the absolute difference between `x` and `y` without considering the constraints of forming a valid non-degenerate triangle during the transformation process. The provided examples in the problem description and the annotated version clearly show that the program fails to account for the necessary steps required to maintain the triangle inequality during the transformation process. For instance, the transformation from (6, 6, 6) to (3, 3, 3) requires four steps as detailed in the problem note, but the program incorrectly outputs `3` instead of `4`. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
