Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. According to the problem, Memory needs to transform an equilateral triangle of side length \(x\) into an equilateral triangle of side length \(y\) by modifying the length of a single side at a time while ensuring the triangle remains non-degenerate (i.e., the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side). However, the program simply calculates and prints the absolute difference between \(x\) and \(y\).

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to simulate the process of reducing the side lengths from \(x\) to \(y\) step-by-step, ensuring at each step that the triangle remains non-degenerate. The absolute difference between \(x\) and \(y\) does not represent the minimum number of steps required to achieve the transformation because:

1. It does not account for the constraints of forming a valid triangle at each step.
2. It does not ensure that the side lengths remain integers throughout the transformation.

Therefore, the program fails to correctly implement the logic required to find the minimum number of seconds needed to transform the triangle from side length \(x\) to \(y\).
