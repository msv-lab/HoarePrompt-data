The function reads two integers `x` and `y` from standard input, where `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`. It then calculates the absolute difference between `x` and `y` and prints this value. The function does not return any value but modifies the output stream by printing the result. There are no parameters passed to the function.
