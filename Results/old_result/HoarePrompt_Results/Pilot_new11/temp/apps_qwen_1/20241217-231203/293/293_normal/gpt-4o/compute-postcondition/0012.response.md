The code `current_node = 2 * current_node + 2` updates the value of `current_node`. Initially, `current_node` is 0. After applying the operation, the new value of `current_node` is `2 * 0 + 2`, which equals 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`h` is an integer between 1 and 50; `n` is an integer between 1 and \(2^h\); `total_leaves` is \(2^h\); `visited_count` is 1; `path` is a non-empty binary string representing `n - 1` (padded to length `h` with leading zeros); `current_level` is 0; `current_node` is 2; `direction` is not '0'**
