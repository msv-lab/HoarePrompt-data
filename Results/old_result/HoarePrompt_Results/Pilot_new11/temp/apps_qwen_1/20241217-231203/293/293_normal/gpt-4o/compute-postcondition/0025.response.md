The code `print(visited_count)` simply prints the value of the variable `visited_count`. This does not change the value of any variable; it only outputs the current value of `visited_count`, which is `h`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`h` is an integer between 1 and 50; `n` is an integer between 1 and \(2^h\); `total_leaves` is \(2^h\); `visited_count` is `h`; `path` is the empty string; `current_node` is \(2^{h-1}\); `current_level` is `h-1`; visited count printed is `h`.**
