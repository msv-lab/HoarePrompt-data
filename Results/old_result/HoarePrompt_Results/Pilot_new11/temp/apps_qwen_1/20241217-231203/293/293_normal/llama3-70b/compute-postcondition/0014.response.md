Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `h` is an integer input from the user.
   - `n` is calculated as `h // 4` and is greater than 1.
   - `ans` has been updated according to the initial condition.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues while `n > 1`.

3. **Determining Next State:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be greater than 1.
   - Since `n` was greater than 1 at the end of the previous iteration, we need to ensure that `n` remains greater than 1 for the next iteration.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure it remains greater than 1 for the next iteration.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `n` must remain greater than 1.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`h` is an integer input from the user, `n` is `h // 4` and must remain greater than 1, `ans` has been updated according to the initial condition.**
