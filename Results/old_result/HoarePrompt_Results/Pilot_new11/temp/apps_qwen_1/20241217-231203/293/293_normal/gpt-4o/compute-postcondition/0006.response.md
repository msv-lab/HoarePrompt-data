`current_node` is assigned the value `0`. The value of `h` remains an integer between 1 and 50, the value of `n` remains an integer between 1 and \(2^h\), `total_leaves` remains \(2^h\), `visited_count` remains `0`, `path` remains the binary representation of `n - 1` (without the '0b' prefix) padded to length `h` with leading zeros, and `current_level` remains `0`.

Output State: **`h` is an integer between 1 and 50; `n` is an integer between 1 and \(2^h\); `total_leaves` is \(2^h\); `visited_count` is 0; `path` is the binary representation of `n - 1` (without the '0b' prefix) padded to length `h` with leading zeros; `current_level` is 0; `current_node` is 0.**
