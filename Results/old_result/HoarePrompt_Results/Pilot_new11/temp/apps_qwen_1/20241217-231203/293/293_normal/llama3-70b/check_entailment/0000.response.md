Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The given program does not correctly simulate the game algorithm described in the problem. Specifically, the program assumes that the node indices follow a linear sequence, whereas the actual structure is a binary tree. For instance, consider the input `h = 2` and `n = 3`. According to the problem description, the tree would look like this:

```
      1
     / \
    2   3
   / \ / \
  4  5 6  7
```

Following the algorithm, Amr would start at node 1, move to node 3 (right child), then to node 6 (right child of node 3). However, the program calculates the number of visited nodes incorrectly by treating the node indices as a linear sequence rather than a tree structure. This leads to an incorrect count of visited nodes. Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description for certain inputs.
