Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed to minimize the deviation of the image from vertical. Hereâ€™s a detailed reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input angle `x` and ensures it falls within the range of 0 to 360 degrees by using `x % 360`. This handles both positive and negative angles appropriately.

2. **Deviation Calculation**:
   - For `x = 0`, no turns are needed, so the output is `0`.
   - For other values, `(x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4` calculates the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns required. This formula ensures that the result is always between 0 and 3, which corresponds to 0, 1, 2, or 3 turns respectively.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `x = 60`, the program calculates `(60 + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4 = 159 // 90 % 4 = 1`, which is correct.
   - When `x = -60` (which is equivalent to 300 degrees after adjusting modulo 360), the program calculates `(300 + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4 = 389 // 90 % 4 = 3`, which is also correct.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns for any input angle. Therefore, the program is correct.
