Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code appears to correctly determine the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns required to minimize the deviation from vertical for a given camera rotation angle. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Normalization**: The code normalizes the input angle `x` to a value between 0 and 360 degrees using `normalized_angle = x % 360`. This handles both positive and negative angles correctly.
   
2. **Calculation of Turns**: The code calculates the number of 90-degree turns needed to reach an angle closest to 0 degrees. Specifically, it computes `(360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4`, which effectively finds the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns required.

   - For example, if the normalized angle is 300 degrees, `(360 - 300) // 90 % 4` results in 2 turns (since 60 degrees is the smallest deviation).
   - If the normalized angle is 150 degrees, `(360 - 150) // 90 % 4` results in 3 turns (since 210 degrees is the smallest deviation).

This logic ensures that the deviation from vertical is minimized, and the number of 90-degree clockwise turns is minimized as well. Given the constraints and the examples provided, the code correctly implements the requirement.
