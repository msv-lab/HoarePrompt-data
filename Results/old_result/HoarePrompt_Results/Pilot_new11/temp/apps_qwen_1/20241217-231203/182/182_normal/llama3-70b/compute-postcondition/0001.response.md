The code `x = x % 360` takes the modulo 360 of `x`. This operation results in `x` being updated to the remainder when `x` is divided by 360. Since the initial value of `x` is an integer within the range \(-10^{18} \leq x \leq 10^{18}\), the resulting value of `x` will be in the range \(-359 \leq x < 360\). The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`x` is an integer in the range -359 â‰¤ x < 360**
