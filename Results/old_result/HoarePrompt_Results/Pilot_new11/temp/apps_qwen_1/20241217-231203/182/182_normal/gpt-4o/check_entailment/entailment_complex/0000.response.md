Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `x` from the user, which represents the camera's rotation angle. The input is handled correctly, as the problem description specifies that `x` will be an integer within the range \([-10^{18}, 10^{18}]\).

2. **Normalization**: The program normalizes the angle using `normalized_angle = x % 360`. This ensures that the angle is brought into the range \([0, 360)\) degrees, regardless of whether `x` is positive or negative. This normalization step is crucial for calculating the correct number of 90-degree turns needed.

3. **Calculating Turns**: The program then calculates the number of 90-degree clockwise turns required to align the image with the vertical using the formula `turns = (360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4`. This formula correctly determines the minimum number of 90-degree turns needed by:
   - Finding the difference between 360 degrees and the normalized angle (`360 - normalized_angle`).
   - Dividing this difference by 90 to find how many full 90-degree turns are needed (`// 90`).
   - Taking the result modulo 4 to ensure the result is within the range of 0 to 3 (`% 4`).

4. **Output**: The program prints the calculated number of turns, which is the desired output according to the problem statement.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed to align the image with the vertical, as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
