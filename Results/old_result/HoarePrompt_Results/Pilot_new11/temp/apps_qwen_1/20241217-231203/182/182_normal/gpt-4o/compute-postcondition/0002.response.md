The code calculates the number of turns needed to reach a normalized angle by turning in increments of 90 degrees, starting from `normalized_angle`. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step calculation:

1. `normalized_angle` is already calculated as `x % 360`.
2. The code then calculates `turns` as `(360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4`.

Let's break this down further:

- `360 - normalized_angle` gives the remaining degrees to complete a full circle starting from `normalized_angle`.
- This result is then divided by 90 using integer division (`//`), which gives the number of 90-degree turns needed to reach 360 degrees.
- Finally, the result is taken modulo 4 to ensure it is within the range of 0 to 3.

The output state will depend on the value of `normalized_angle` modulo 360. Let's consider a few cases:

- If `normalized_angle` is 0, then `turns` is `(360 - 0) // 90 % 4 = 4 // 90 % 4 = 0`.
- If `normalized_angle` is 90, then `turns` is `(360 - 90) // 90 % 4 = 270 // 90 % 4 = 3`.
- If `normalized_angle` is 180, then `turns` is `(360 - 180) // 90 % 4 = 180 // 90 % 4 = 2`.
- If `normalized_angle` is 270, then `turns` is `(360 - 270) // 90 % 4 = 90 // 90 % 4 = 1`.

Since `normalized_angle` is `x % 360`, it can take any value from 0 to 359. The `turns` value will cycle through 0, 1, 2, and 3 based on the value of `normalized_angle`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`x` is replaced by its value modulo 360; `normalized_angle` is `x % 360`; `turns` is a value in the range 0 to 3 depending on the value of `normalized_angle`.**
