Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to find the number of good pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(\text{gcd}(a, b) = x\) and \(\text{lcm}(a, b) = y\) within the range \([l, r]\). Here's why:

1. **Edge Case Handling**: The program checks if \(y \% x == 0\). If not, it returns 0, which is correct because \(y\) must be divisible by \(x\) for \((a, b)\) to be a valid pair.
2. **Factorization**: The program calculates \(z = y // x\) and then iterates through factors of \(z\) to find possible values of \(a\) and \(b\).
3. **Validation**: For each factor pair \((i, z // i)\), it checks if both \(a = i * x\) and \(b = z // i * x\) fall within the specified range \([l, r]\) and if they meet the gcd and lcm conditions.
4. **Counting Pairs**: It correctly counts pairs \((a, b)\) and \((b, a)\) separately if \(a \neq b\), and counts \((a, a)\) only once if \(a = b\).

Given the problem description and the provided examples, the program handles all necessary cases correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
