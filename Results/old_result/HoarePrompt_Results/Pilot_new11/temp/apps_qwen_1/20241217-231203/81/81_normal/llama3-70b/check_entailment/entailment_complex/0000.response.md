Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle the case where \( \text{GCD}(a, b) \neq x \) or \( \text{LCM}(a, b) \neq y \) correctly. Specifically, the code only checks if \( \text{GCD}(a, b) = x \) and \( \text{LCM}(a, b) = y \) for pairs where \( a \geq b \). However, the problem description requires checking all pairs \( (a, b) \) such that \( l \leq a, b \leq r \), including pairs where \( a < b \).

For example, consider the input \( l = 1 \), \( r = 2 \), \( x = 1 \), \( y = 2 \). The correct output should be 2, because the pairs (1, 2) and (2, 1) are good pairs. However, the current code only checks pairs where \( a \geq b \), so it would miss the pair (2, 1) and only count (1, 2), resulting in an incorrect output of 1.

To fix this, the inner loop should run from \( l \) to \( r \) and check both \( (a, b) \) and \( (b, a) \) to ensure all possible pairs are considered.
