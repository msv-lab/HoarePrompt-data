Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the functions `func_1` and `func_2`. Specifically:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` does not handle the case where either `a` or `b` is zero. In the given problem, both `l` and `r` are positive integers, but the function does not account for the case where `a` or `b` could be zero within the range `[l, r]`.
   - For example, if `l = 0` and `r = 1`, and `x = 1` and `y = 1`, the function will fail because it does not handle the case where `a` or `b` is zero.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` is correctly implemented to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) using the formula \( \text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\text{GCD}(a, b)} \).
   - However, the main issue lies in the implementation of `func_1`. Since `func_1` is not robust and fails in certain cases, `func_2` may also produce incorrect results if `func_1` does not return the correct GCD.

To summarize, the code fails to handle the case where `a` or `b` is zero, which is a potential input scenario even though the problem specifies `1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^9`. Therefore, the code is incorrect for every potential case.
