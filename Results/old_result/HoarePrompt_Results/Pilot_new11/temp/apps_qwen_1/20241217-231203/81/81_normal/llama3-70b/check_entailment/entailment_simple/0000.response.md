Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the given problem. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of why it adheres to the problem description:

1. **Problem Description Understanding**:
   - The task is to find the number of good pairs (a, b) such that GCD(a, b) = x and LCM(a, b) = y, with the constraint that \( l \leq a, b \leq r \).
   - A good pair (a, b) is defined as one where the GCD is x and the LCM is y.

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The program takes input values \( l, r, x, y \) using `map(int, input().split())`.
   - It initializes a counter `count` to zero.
   - It iterates over all possible pairs (a, b) within the range [l, r] using nested loops.
   - For each pair (a, b), it checks if GCD(a, b) equals x and LCM(a, b) equals y using `func_1` and `func_2`.
   - If both conditions are met, it increments the counter `count`.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `count`.

3. **Function Definitions**:
   - `func_1(a, b)` calculates the GCD of a and b using the Euclidean algorithm and returns it.
   - `func_2(a, b)` calculates the LCM of a and b using the formula \( \text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\text{GCD}(a, b)} \) and returns it.

4. **Validation**:
   - The program ensures that all pairs (a, b) within the specified range [l, r] are checked.
   - It correctly uses the provided functions to compute the GCD and LCM.
   - It counts and outputs the number of pairs that satisfy the given conditions.

Since the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement, it meets all the requirements and constraints specified. Therefore, the program is correct.
