Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to find good pairs of integers (a, b) such that GCD(a, b) = x and LCM(a, b) = y within the given range [l, r]. Specifically:

1. The code uses a brute-force approach by iterating through all possible pairs (a, b) in the range [l, r], which is inefficient and does not guarantee finding all good pairs.
2. The code does not handle the case where the LCM of the pair (a, b) is calculated and checked properly. The function `func_2` correctly calculates the LCM, but the code logic to check if the LCM equals y is flawed.
3. The code assumes that for each pair (a, b), if the GCD is x and the LCM is y, then (a, b) is a good pair. However, this is not sufficient to guarantee that the product of a and b divided by their GCD equals y. Additionally, the code does not ensure that the range constraints are respected.

To illustrate a case where the program does not work correctly, consider the input:
```
1 2 1 2
```
The expected output is 2, as the pairs (1, 2) and (2, 1) are good pairs. However, the provided code will not correctly identify these pairs due to the inefficiency and improper checking logic.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case and is hence incorrect.
