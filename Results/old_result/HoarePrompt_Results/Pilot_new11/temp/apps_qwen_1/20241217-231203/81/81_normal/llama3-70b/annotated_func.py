#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers such that \(1 \leq \text{func\_1}(a, b) = \text{GCD}(a, b) \leq 10^9\).
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is the GCD of the original `a` and `b`, `b` is 0
    return a
    #The program returns `a` that is the GCD of the original `a` and `b`, and `b` is 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b`. It computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. After the loop, `a` contains the GCD of the original `a` and `b`, and `b` is set to 0. This function does not handle the case where either `a` or `b` is zero; in such cases, the loop will terminate immediately, and `a` will be returned as the non-zero value. If both `a` and `b` are zero, the function will not enter the loop and will return 0, setting `b` to 0.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that \(1 \leq l \leq a, b \leq r\) and the greatest common divisor of a and b is x, and their least common multiple is y. Additionally, the function assumes that func_1(a, b) returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b.
def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b // func_1(a, b)
    #`The program returns the least common multiple (LCM) of a and b, which is y`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two positive integer parameters `a` and `b`, and returns their least common multiple (LCM). It achieves this by first calling `func_1(a, b)` to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. Then, it calculates the LCM using the formula \( \text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\text{GCD}(a, b)} \). The function assumes that `a` and `b` are positive integers within specified bounds and that `func_1(a, b)` correctly computes the GCD. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned, but the function relies on the assumption that `a` and `b` are valid positive integers and that `func_1` returns the correct GCD value. After executing, the function will have computed the LCM of `a` and `b` and returned this value.
