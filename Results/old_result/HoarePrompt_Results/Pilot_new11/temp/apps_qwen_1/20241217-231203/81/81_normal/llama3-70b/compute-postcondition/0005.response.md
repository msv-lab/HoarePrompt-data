The code `a, b = b, a % b` updates the values of `a` and `b`. Initially, `a` is the original value of `b` and `b` is `a % b`. After the code runs, `a` takes the value of `b`, and `b` takes the value of `a % b`. The GCD condition remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is `b`, `b` is `a % b`, and the GCD of the updated `a` (which was the original `b`) and the updated `b` (which was `a % b`) remains `d`.**
