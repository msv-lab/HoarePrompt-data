Output State: **`i` is an index less than `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `marks` is a non-empty list, `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `False`, and `additional_marks` is a list that contains all unique elements such that `i + j <= l` and `i + j` is not in `marks`.** 

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element `j` in `additional_marks`.
- For each `j`, it checks if `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and whether `i + j` is not already in `marks`.
- If both conditions are met, `i + j` is appended to `additional_marks`.
- Since the loop continues until there are no more elements in `additional_marks` to check, all valid `i + j` values that satisfy the conditions will be added to `additional_marks`.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `additional_marks` is empty), then `additional_marks` remains an empty list, and the other variables (`i`, `n`, `marks`, `need_x`, `need_y`) retain their original values.
