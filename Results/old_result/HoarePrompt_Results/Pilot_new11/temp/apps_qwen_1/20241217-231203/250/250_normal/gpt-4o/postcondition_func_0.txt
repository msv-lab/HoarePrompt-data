The function processes a strictly increasing sequence of integers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) where \(0 = a_1 < a_2 < \ldots < a_n = l\), along with four positive integers \(n\), \(l\), \(x\), and \(y\). It checks if there exists any element in the sequence such that adding or subtracting \(x\) or \(y\) results in another element in the sequence. If both \(x\) and \(y\) can be found in this manner, it prints `0`. Otherwise, it performs additional operations to derive a new set of elements based on the conditions involving \(x\) and \(y\), and prints `1` followed by one of these new elements. If no such elements can be derived, it prints the count of missing elements (`1` or `2`) and their values.
