Postcondition: ***`marks` is a list with at least one element, `x_found` is False, and none of (`mark + x + y` or `mark + x - y` or `mark - x + y`) are in `marks_set`. If `mark - x + y` or `mark - x - y` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` contains the element `mark - x`. Otherwise, the conditions regarding the presence of certain expressions in `marks_set` remain unchanged.***
