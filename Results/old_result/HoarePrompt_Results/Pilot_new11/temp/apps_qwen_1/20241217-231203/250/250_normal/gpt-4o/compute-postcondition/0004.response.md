The code `y_found = False` simply assigns the value `False` to the variable `y_found`. This does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `marks_set` is a set containing unique elements from the original `marks` list, `x_found` is False, `y_found` is False**
