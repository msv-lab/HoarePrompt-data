`new_marks` adds the value `mark - y`. Since the initial state mentions that `(mark - y + x in marks_set or mark - y - x in marks_set)` is satisfied, the addition of `mark - y` to `new_marks` does not violate any conditions. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`marks` is a list with at least one element, `y_found` is `False`, `new_marks` contains `mark - y` (in addition to any existing elements), and the condition `(mark - y + x in marks_set or mark - y - x in marks_set)` is still satisfied.**
