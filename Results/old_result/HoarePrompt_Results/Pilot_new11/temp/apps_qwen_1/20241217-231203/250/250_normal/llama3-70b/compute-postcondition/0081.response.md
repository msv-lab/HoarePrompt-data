To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the conditions and requirements step-by-step:

1. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop `for j in additional_marks:` will execute as long as `additional_marks` is non-empty. Therefore, the key variable here is `additional_marks`.

2. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is the next element in the `marks` list.
   - `n` must be greater than 0 (though this doesn't directly affect the loop execution since it's about `additional_marks`).
   - `marks` is a non-empty list.
   - `need_x` is `False`.
   - `need_y` is `False`.
   - `additional_marks` is a list that contains all unique elements such that `i + j <= l` and `i + j` is not in `marks`.

3. **Ensuring Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute, `additional_marks` must contain at least one element. This ensures there is something to iterate over.

4. **Relevant States to Adjust**:
   - Since the loop depends on `additional_marks`, we need to ensure `additional_marks` is non-empty.

Given these points, the required adjustment is to ensure `additional_marks` contains at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is the next element in the `marks` list, `n` must be greater than 0, `marks` is a non-empty list, `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `False`, and `additional_marks` must contain at least one element**.
