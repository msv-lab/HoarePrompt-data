Postcondition: ***`marks` is a list with at least one element. If `mark + x + y`, `mark + x - y`, or `mark - x + y` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` contains `mark + x`. If `mark - x + y` or `mark - x - y` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` contains the element `mark - x`. Otherwise, `new_marks` remains unchanged and no elements other than those specified are added to it.***
