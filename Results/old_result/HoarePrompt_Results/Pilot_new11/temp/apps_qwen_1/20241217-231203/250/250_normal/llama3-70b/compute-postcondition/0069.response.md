According to the given for loop, the loop will iterate over the `additional_marks` list. For the loop to execute, the `additional_marks` list must contain at least one element.

Let's break down the required states:

1. The variable `j` must be the first element of the `additional_marks` list.
2. The loop will continue as long as there are more elements in `additional_marks`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is an index less than `n`
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `marks` is a non-empty list
- `need_x` is `False`
- `need_y` is `False`

The only relevant variable for determining if the loop can execute is the `additional_marks` list. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `additional_marks` contains at least one element.

State: **`i` is an index less than `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `marks` is a non-empty list, `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `False`, `additional_marks` must have at least 1 element**
