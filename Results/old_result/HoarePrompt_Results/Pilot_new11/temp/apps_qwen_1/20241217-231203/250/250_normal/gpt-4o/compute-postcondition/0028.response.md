Postcondition: ***`marks` is a list that must contain at least one element, `n` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y_found` is `True`, and `x_found` is `True`. If the condition `x_found and y_found` is true, then the function continues with the subsequent code in the if block. Since there is no else part, the function does nothing additional if the condition is false.***
