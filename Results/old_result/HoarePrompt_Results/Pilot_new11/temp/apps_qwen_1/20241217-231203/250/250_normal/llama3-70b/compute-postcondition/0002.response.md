`need_x` and `need_y` are assigned the boolean value `False`. The values of `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, and `marks` are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 2 and \(10^5\), `l` is between 2 and \(10^9\), `x` is less than `y` and both are between 1 and `l`, `marks` is a set of integers from the input, `x` is less than `y`, `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `need_x` is `False`, and `need_y` is `False`.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and \(10^5\), `l` is between 2 and \(10^9\), `x` is less than `y` and both are between 1 and `l`, `marks` is a set of integers from the input, `x` is less than `y`, `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `need_x` is `False`, and `need_y` is `False`.**
