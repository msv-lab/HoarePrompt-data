Functionality: **The function accepts four integers `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` through user input, where `n` is the number of elements in a sequence, `l` is the last element of the sequence, and `x` and `y` are two integers within the range of the sequence such that `1 ≤ x < y ≤ l`. It then reads a sequence of `n` integers from user input, stored in a set called `marks`. The function checks if there exist pairs `(i, j)` such that `j >= i` and `marks[j] - marks[i] == x` or `marks[j] - marks[i] == y`. If no such pairs exist for `x` or `y`, the missing value is added to a list called `additional_marks`. The function then iterates over each element in `marks` and adds to `additional_marks` any values `i + j` that are within the range `[0, l]` and not already present in `marks`. Finally, the function prints the length of `additional_marks` and the elements of `additional_marks` separated by spaces. Potential edge cases include when `x` or `y` are not present in any pair, and the function correctly handles these by adding them to `additional_marks`. The function also ensures that all elements in `additional_marks` are unique.**

Note: The initial annotations might have been misleading, but the actual code logic is followed closely in the description.
