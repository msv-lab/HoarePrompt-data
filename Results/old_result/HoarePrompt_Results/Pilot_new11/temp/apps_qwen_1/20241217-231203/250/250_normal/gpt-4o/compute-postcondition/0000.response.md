The code `n, l, x, y = map(int, input().split())` reads four integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y`. Since the initial state specifies that these variables are positive integers with specific ranges, the values of `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` will be updated to the integers read from the input. The constraints ensure that the values of `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` remain within their specified ranges.

Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are positive integers where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`; they are updated to the values read from the input.**
