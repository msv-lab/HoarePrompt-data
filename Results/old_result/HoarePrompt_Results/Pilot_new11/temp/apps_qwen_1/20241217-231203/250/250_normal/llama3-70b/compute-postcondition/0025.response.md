`need_x` is reassigned to `True`. The value of `need_y` remains unchanged, and the condition involving `marks[j]` and `marks[i]` also remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is a valid index less than `n`, `need_x` is `True`, `need_y` is `True`, and the difference between `marks[j]` and `marks[i]` equals `x`.

Output State: **`i` is a valid index less than `n`, `need_x` is `True`, `need_y` is `True`, and the difference between `marks[j]` and `marks[i]` equals `x`**
