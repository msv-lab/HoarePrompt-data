`x_found` is assigned the value `True`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `marks` is a list that must contain at least one element, `n` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `marks_set` is a set containing unique elements from the original `marks` list, `x_found` is `True`, `y_found` is `False`.
