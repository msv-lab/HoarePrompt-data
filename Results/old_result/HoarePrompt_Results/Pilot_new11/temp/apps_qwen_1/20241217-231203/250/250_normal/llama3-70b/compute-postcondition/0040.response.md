Output State: **`i` is a valid index less than `n`, `need_x` is `True`, `need_y` is `True`. If `marks[j] - marks[i] == y` for any `j` in the range `[i, n-1]`, `need_y` will be `True`. Similarly, if `marks[k] - marks[i] == x` for any `k` in the range `[j+1, n-1]` where `k > j`, `need_x` will be `True`. Otherwise, `need_x` and `need_y` remain `True`.**
