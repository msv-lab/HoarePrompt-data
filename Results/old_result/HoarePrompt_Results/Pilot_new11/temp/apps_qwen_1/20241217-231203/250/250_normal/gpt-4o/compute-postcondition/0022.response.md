According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `marks`. For the loop to execute again, `marks` must contain at least one element.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `marks` is a list that must contain at least one element.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `l` is a positive integer.
- `x` is a positive integer.
- `y_found` is `True`.
- `x_found` is `True`.

Since `x_found` and `y_found` are both `True`, the function would break out of the loop. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `x_found` and `y_found` must not both be `True`.

So, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `y_found` should be `False`.
- `x_found` should be `False`.

The modified state is:
State: **`marks` is a list that must contain at least one element, `n` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y_found` is `False`, and `x_found` is `False`**.
