Postcondition: ***`i` is an index less than `n`, and `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `x`. `need_x` is set to True. If the condition `marks[j] - marks[i] == y` holds true, then `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `y` and `need_x` remains True. There is no else part in the code, so no additional changes occur if the condition does not hold.***
