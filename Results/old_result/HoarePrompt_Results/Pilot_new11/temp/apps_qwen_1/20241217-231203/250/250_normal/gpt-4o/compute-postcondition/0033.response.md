The code initializes an empty set named `new_marks`. This operation does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`marks` is a list that may contain any number of elements (including zero), `n` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `marks_set` is a set containing unique elements from the original `marks` list, `x_found` is `True`, `y_found` is `True`, `new_marks` is an empty set**
