Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Finding Missing Marks**:
   - The program tries to find pairs of marks `(mark, mark + x)` or `(mark, mark - x)` and similarly for `y`. However, it does not fully address the requirement to find the minimum number of additional marks needed to measure both `x` and `y`.

2. **Output Format Mismatch**:
   - The program outputs a single number representing the count of additional marks needed, and then outputs the marks themselves. However, it does not ensure that the marks are added in a way that minimizes the total number of new marks required. Additionally, it does not handle cases where multiple sets of marks could achieve the same result.

3. **Incomplete Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The program fails to handle all edge cases where additional marks might be necessary. For instance, it does not check all possible combinations of adding `x` and `y` to existing marks to find the minimum number of new marks needed.

4. **Incorrect Logic for Determining if `x` and `y` Can Be Measured**:
   - The logic inside the `for` loop to determine if `x` and `y` can be measured using existing marks or newly added marks is incomplete. It does not account for all possible scenarios where adding one or more marks would allow measuring `x` and `y`.

### Example Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
3 250 185 230
0 185 250
```

- **Expected Output**: 
  ```
  1
  230
  ```

- **Actual Output**:
  ```
  0
  ```

The program incorrectly concludes that no additional marks are needed because it only checks for direct sums or differences, and misses the fact that adding `230` would allow measuring `230`.

To fix this, the program needs to systematically check all possible ways to add marks to cover both `x` and `y` with the minimum number of additional marks.
