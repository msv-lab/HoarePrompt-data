To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to consider the conditions under which the `for` loop can run. The loop iterates over each element in the `marks` list. For the loop to execute, the `marks` list must contain at least one element.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Check if `marks` contains at least one element**: Since the loop iterates over each element in `marks`, if `marks` is empty, the loop will not execute. Therefore, we need to ensure that `marks` has at least one element.

2. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `marks_set`, `x_found`, `y_found`, and `new_marks`) do not affect whether the loop can execute. Their values are irrelevant to the loop condition.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that `marks` contains at least one element.

**State:**
- `marks` is a list that must contain at least one element.

So, the final answer is:

State: **`marks` is a list that must contain at least one element**
