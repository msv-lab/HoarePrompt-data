Postcondition: ***`marks` is a list that must contain at least one element, `n` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `marks_set` is a set containing unique elements from the original `marks` list, `x_found` is `True`, and `y_found` is `True`.***

Explanation: Since the if condition `(x_found and y_found)` evaluates to `True`, both `x_found` and `y_found` must be `True` for the code to enter this if block. Therefore, the postcondition includes these updated values while retaining all other conditions from the precondition.
