The code adds `mark + y` to `new_marks`. Given the initial state, `marks` has at least one less element than before, `y_found` is `False`, and `new_marks` may or may not contain elements based on the conditions mentioned. Since no conditions are checked in this particular line of code, the only change is that `mark + y` is added to `new_marks`.

Output State: **`marks` has at least one less element than before, `y_found` is `False`, `new_marks` contains `mark + y`**
