`new_marks` is a set (assuming `add` is used on a set), and the code adds `mark - y` to this set. The initial state of `marks` and `marks_set` is not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the only change is in `new_marks`.

Output State: **`marks` is a list with at least two less elements than before; `new_marks` contains the element `mark - y`; if `mark + x + y`, `mark + x - y`, or `mark - x + y` is found in `marks_set`, then `marks` will contain the element `mark + x`. Otherwise, `marks` will contain the element `mark - x`.**
