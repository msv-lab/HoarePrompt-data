The code snippet `additional_marks.append(i + j)` appends the sum of `i` and `j` to the list `additional_marks`. However, the initial values of `i` and `j` are not specified in the initial state. We know that `additional_marks` is a list, and `i` and `j` are variables that are added together and appended to this list.

Since the initial values of `i` and `j` are not provided, we can only express the change in terms of `i` and `j`.

Output State: **`additional_marks` is a list containing the elements from its original state plus `(i + j)`, `i` is an unspecified value, `j` is an unspecified value**
