Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is an index less than `n` and equal to `i + 1`. This condition seems contradictory because `i` cannot be less than `n` and equal to `i + 1` simultaneously unless `i` is `n-1` and `n` is 1. However, this condition is not practically feasible since `i` would have to be `-1`, which is not a valid index.
   - `need_x` and `need_y` are both `True` if there exists any `j` such that `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `y` and another `k` (where `k > j`) such that `marks[k] - marks[i]` equals `x`. Otherwise, `need_x` and `need_y` are both `False`.

2. **For Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs for each `j` from `i` to `n-1`.

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be a valid index less than `n`. The condition `i` being less than `n` and `i` being equal to `i + 1` is not practical, so we assume `i` is a valid index less than `n`.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - To ensure the loop can execute, `i` must be a valid index less than `n`.
   - `need_x` and `need_y` should be `True` because they depend on the existence of certain conditions within the loop.

Given these points, the adjusted states are:

- `i` must be a valid index less than `n`.
- `need_x` and `need_y` must be `True` because the conditions for them being `True` must exist within the loop for it to run.

State: **`i` is a valid index less than `n`, `need_x` is True, `need_y` is True**
