`result` is a list that initially contains the value `x`. The code appends `y` to this list. Since `y_found` is `False`, the code proceeds to append `y` to `result`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated value of `result` is `[x, y]`.

Output State: **`marks` is a list that may contain any number of elements, `y_found` is `False`, `new_marks` is an empty set, `marks_set` is the set of unique elements from the original `marks` list, `x_found` is `False`, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, and `result` is a list containing the values `[x, y]`.**
