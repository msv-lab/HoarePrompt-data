`additional_marks` appends the value of `y` to itself. Since `additional_marks` was initially a list containing only `x`, after appending `y`, the list will contain both `x` and `y`. The states of the other variables (`i`, `need_x`, `need_y`) are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is an index less than `n`; `need_x` is `False`; `need_y` is `False`; `additional_marks` is a list containing `x` and `y`.**
