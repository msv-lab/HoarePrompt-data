Postcondition: ***`marks` is a list with at least one less element than before, `y_found` is `False`. If `mark + x + y` or `mark + y + x` or `mark + y - x` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` contains the value `mark + y`. If `mark - x + y` or `mark - x - y` or `mark - y + x` or `mark - y - x` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` contains the value `mark - x`. If none of these conditions are met, then `marks` has at least one less element and `y_found` remains `False`.***
