Postcondition: ***`i` is an index less than `n`, and `marks[j+1] - marks[i]` equals either `x` or `y`. If `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `y`, then `need_x` is `True` and `need_y` is `True`. If `marks[j] - marks[i]` does not equal `y`, the condition of `need_x` remains as per the precondition, and `need_y` is `True`.***
