`additional_marks.append(i + j)` appends the value of `i + j` to the list `additional_marks`. The value of `i` is less than `n`, and `j` is an element that can be processed, meaning `i + j <= l` and `i + j` is not already in `marks`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is an index less than `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `marks` is a non-empty list, `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `False`, and `additional_marks` is a list with at least 1 element plus the new element `i + j`.**
