State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 0, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2.

Now, let's think step by step:

1. The loop condition is `for i in range(n)`.
2. This means the loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i < n`.
3. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
4. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.
5. Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than 2 (because if `n` were 2 or less, `i` would already reach or exceed `n`).

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will be `i = 3`.
- `n` must remain greater than 2 to allow the loop to continue.

State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 2**
