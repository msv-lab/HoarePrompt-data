Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The program does not correctly identify the longest non-palindrome substring. While the function `func_1` correctly checks if a string is a palindrome, the main logic of the program only checks a few specific substrings (the entire string, the substring starting from the second character, and the substring ending at the second last character) and prints the length of the longest among them if they are not palindromes. However, this approach does not guarantee finding the longest non-palindrome substring in all cases.

For instance, as illustrated in the example with the input `mamad`, the program fails to identify the longest non-palindrome substring correctly. The program checks the entire string and two shorter substrings, missing the actual longest non-palindrome substring `mad` which has a length of 3. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, and the original assessment remains correct.
