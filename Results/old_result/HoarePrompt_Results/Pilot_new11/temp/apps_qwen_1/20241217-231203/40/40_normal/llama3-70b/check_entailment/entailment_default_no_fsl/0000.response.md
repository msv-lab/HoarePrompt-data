Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates through all possible substrings of the input string `s` and checks if they are palindromes. If a substring is not a palindrome, it updates the maximum length of such a substring. Finally, it prints the maximum length found, or 0 if no such substring exists.

The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem description:
- It considers all possible substrings of the input string.
- It correctly identifies whether a substring is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse.
- It keeps track of the longest non-palindromic substring length.
- It handles the case where all substrings are palindromes by returning 0.

Since the code meets the requirements for all potential cases, the output is correct.
