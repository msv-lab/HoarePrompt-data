Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `i` is 4, `n` is greater than or equal to 5, `j` is 6, `substr` is `s[4] + s[5]`, `substr` is not equal to its reverse, and `max_len` is 2. This holds true because if `substr` is not equal to its reverse, `max_len` is set to 2. There is no else part, so the values remain as they are when entering the if statement.***
