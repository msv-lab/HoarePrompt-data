The code prints `max_len` if `max_len` is greater than 0, otherwise it prints 0. This operation does not change the values of `max_len`, `i`, `j`, or `s`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`max_len` is the maximum length of any substring in `s` that is not a palindrome, `i` is the final value of `i` after the loop completes, `j` is the final value of `j` after the loop completes, and `s` is the original string.**
