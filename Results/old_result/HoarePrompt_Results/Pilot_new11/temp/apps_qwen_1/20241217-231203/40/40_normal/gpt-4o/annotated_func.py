#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters.
def func_1(s):
    return s == s[::-1]
    #The program returns True if the string `s` is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward), otherwise returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and checks if it is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward. The function returns `True` if the string is a palindrome, otherwise it returns `False`. The function correctly handles the case where the string is empty, which is not explicitly mentioned in the initial annotations but is implied by the palindrome definition. However, the function does not handle the case where the string contains spaces or other non-lowercase English letters, although these are not specified in the initial description and thus are not included in the functionality. The function also correctly checks the entire length of the string for palindromicity.
