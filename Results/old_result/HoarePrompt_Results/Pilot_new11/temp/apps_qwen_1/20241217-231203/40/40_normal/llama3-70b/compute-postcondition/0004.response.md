To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given code and the initial state:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `max_len` is 0.

2. **Loop Analysis**:
   - The loop iterates over the range from `i + 1` to `n + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute, the range must be valid, meaning the start of the range (`i + 1`) should be less than or equal to the end of the range (`n + 1`).

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - Since `n` is greater than 0, the end of the range (`n + 1`) is positive.
   - To ensure the loop starts (i.e., the start of the range is within the valid range), `i` must be less than `n`.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state such that the loop can start and execute correctly.

**Step-by-Step Adjustments**:
- Ensure `i` is a valid starting point for the loop. Specifically, `i` must be less than `n`.

**Final State**:
- `s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `max_len` is 0.
- `i` must be less than `n`.

Therefore, the state after adjustment is:

**State: **`s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50, `n` must be greater than 0, `max_len` is 0, `i` must be less than `n`**.
