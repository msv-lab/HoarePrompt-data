Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 3, `n` is the final value of `n` after the loop completes, `j` is the final value of `j` after the loop completes, and `max_len` is the maximum length of any substring that is not equal to its reverse within the range `[i, n]`.** 

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the range from `i+1` to `n`. Given that the initial state requires `n` to be greater than 2 and the loop starts with `i` being 3, the loop will run at least once.
- For each iteration, a substring `substr` is formed from `s[i:j]` where `i` is fixed at 3 and `j` increases until `n`.
- The condition checks if `substr` is not equal to its reverse. If this condition is true, `max_len` is updated to the maximum length found so far.
- Since the loop continues until `j` reaches `n`, the final values of `j` and `n` will be the last `j` and `n` used in the loop.
- After the loop completes, `total` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop, and `i` remains 3 as it is not modified within the loop.
- `max_len` will hold the maximum length of any substring that meets the condition (not equal to its reverse) found during the loop execution.

If the loop does not execute due to `n` being less than 4 initially, then:
- `total` is 0.
- `i` is 3.
- `n` is the original value of `n` (which is less than 4).
- `j` does not exist since the loop does not run.
- `max_len` remains 0 (no valid substrings found).

However, based on the problem statement, we assume `n` is at least 4, ensuring the loop runs at least once.
