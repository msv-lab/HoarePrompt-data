Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program accepts a non-empty string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length at most 50, as specified in the problem description.

2. **Substrings Generation and Check**: The program uses nested loops to generate all possible substrings of the input string `s`. It then checks if each substring is a palindrome by comparing the substring with its reverse (`substr != substr[::-1]`). If a substring is not a palindrome, it updates the `max_len` variable to keep track of the longest non-palindromic substring found so far.

3. **Output**: After iterating through all possible substrings, the program prints the length of the longest non-palindromic substring found. If no such substring exists (i.e., all substrings are palindromes), it prints `0`, which is the correct behavior according to the problem description.

4. **Logic Flow**: The program ensures that it only considers valid substrings (i.e., those starting at index `i` and ending at index `j` within the bounds of the string). The loop variables `i` and `j` are correctly used to generate these substrings, ensuring that the logic covers all cases as required.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the logic to find the longest non-palindromic substring, thus meeting the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
