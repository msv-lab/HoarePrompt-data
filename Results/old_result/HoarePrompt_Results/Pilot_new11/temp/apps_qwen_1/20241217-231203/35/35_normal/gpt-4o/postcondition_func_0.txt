The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `a`, and `b`, which are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 100\) and \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\). It performs a binary search to find the smallest value `x` for which the function `can_distribute(x)` returns `True`. After the loop, `low` equals `high` and both represent the smallest value for which `can_distribute(mid)` returns `True`. The function returns `low - 1`.

The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns `low - 1`, where `low` and `high` are equal and represent the smallest value for which `can_distribute(mid)` returns `True`. If no such value exists, `low - 1` will be 0.

Potential edge cases:
- If `n`, `a`, and `b` are such that `can_distribute(mid)` never returns `True`, the function will still execute the loop but will eventually set `low` to `min(a, b) + 1`. In this case, `low - 1` will be 0.

Missing functionality:
- The code assumes that `can_distribute(mid)` is defined and works correctly within the given constraints. If `can_distribute(mid)` is not implemented or does not work as expected, the function behavior could be incorrect.
