Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the condition `a - x + (b - x) >= x` is not sufficient to ensure that the distribution of cake pieces meets the requirement that "No plate contains pieces of both cakes." 

Consider the following example:

- Input: `5 2 3`
- Expected output: `1`

The code correctly outputs `1`, which is the maximum possible value for `x` that satisfies the given constraints.

However, consider another case:

- Input: `6 2 3`
- Expected output: `1`

The code also outputs `1`, which seems correct at first glance. But let's analyze it further. If `x = 1`, then the distribution would be:
- First cake: 2 pieces, 2 plates.
- Second cake: 3 pieces, 3 plates.

This means we have 2 plates with pieces from the first cake and 3 plates with pieces from the second cake, totaling 5 plates. The remaining plate (the 6th plate) cannot be used because it would violate the condition that "Each plate contains at least one piece of cake" and "No plate contains pieces of both cakes."

A correct approach would involve distributing the pieces such that each plate gets either pieces from the first cake or pieces from the second cake, and ensuring that the minimum number of pieces per plate is maximized. The current implementation does not fully address this requirement.

To fix this, the code should distribute the pieces in a way that each plate gets either all pieces from the first cake or all pieces from the second cake, ensuring that the minimum number of pieces per plate is maximized. This would involve more complex logic to ensure that the distribution is valid for all cases.
