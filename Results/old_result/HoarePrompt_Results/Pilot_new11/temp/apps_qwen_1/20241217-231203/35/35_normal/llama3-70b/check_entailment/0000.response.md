Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the total number of pieces is less than the number of plates. Specifically, if \(a + b < n\), the program does not account for this scenario and will incorrectly compute the minimum number of pieces per plate. For example, consider the input:

```
3 1 1
```

Here, \(n = 3\), \(a = 1\), and \(b = 1\). According to the problem description, it is impossible to distribute the cakes such that each plate gets at least one piece of cake. However, the program will incorrectly output `1` because it does not handle the case where the total number of pieces is less than the number of plates.
