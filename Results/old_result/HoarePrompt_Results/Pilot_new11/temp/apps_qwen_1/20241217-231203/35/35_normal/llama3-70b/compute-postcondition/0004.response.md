The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or the innermost enclosing block that is a loop or a conditional block. In this case, since there are no loops or conditionals that the `break` statement is directly inside, the only impact is that the execution is terminated immediately after this statement. None of the variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, `x`) are modified by this statement.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `a` is the second integer input, `b` is the third integer input, `x` is the minimum of `n`, `a`, and `b`. The condition is met where `a` is greater than or equal to `x`, `b` is greater than or equal to `x`, and the sum of `(a - x)` and `(b - x)` is greater than or equal to `x`.**
