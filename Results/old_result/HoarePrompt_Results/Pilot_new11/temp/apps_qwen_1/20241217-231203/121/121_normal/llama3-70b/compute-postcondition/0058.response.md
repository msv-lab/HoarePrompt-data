`res` is assigned the value of `res` plus `nc`. Since `nc` is 'A', `res` is updated by adding 'A' to its current value. However, since `res` is not defined before this operation, we assume it is initialized to an empty string. Therefore, after executing `res += nc`, `res` becomes 'A'. The state of `nc` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`nc` is 'A', `res` is 'A'**
