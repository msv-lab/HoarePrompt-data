Postcondition: **`nc` is one of 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T'. If `c` is '?', then `res` is a string composed of the characters added during each iteration where `count[nc]` was greater than 0, and `count[nc]` is decremented by 1 whenever `nc` matches a character in 'ACGT' and `count[nc]` is greater than 0. If `c` is not a '?', then `res` is `c`.**
