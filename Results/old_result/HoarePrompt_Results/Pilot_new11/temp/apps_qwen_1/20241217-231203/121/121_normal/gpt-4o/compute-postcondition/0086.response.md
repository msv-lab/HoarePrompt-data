Postcondition: ***`counts` is a non-empty iterable. The count of `next_char` in `counts` is increased by 1, and `next_char` is added to `result[i]`. This happens if and only if the count of `next_char` in `counts` is less than `target_count`. If the count of `next_char` is not less than `target_count`, the state remains unchanged.***
