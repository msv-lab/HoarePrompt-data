The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables; it only exits the loop or the most internal block it is in. In this case, it would exit the loop or block it is inside, but it does not affect the values of `counts` or `result`.

Output State: **`counts` is a dictionary where `char` exists and its count is increased by 1; `result` is a dictionary with `i` mapped to `char`.**
