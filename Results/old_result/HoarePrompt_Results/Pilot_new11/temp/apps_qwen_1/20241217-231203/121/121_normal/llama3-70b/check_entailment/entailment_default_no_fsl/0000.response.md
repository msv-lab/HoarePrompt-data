Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle cases where it is impossible to decode the genome such that each nucleotide ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') appears exactly `n // 4` times. Specifically, the code does not check if the sum of the counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' plus the number of '?' characters is divisible by 4. If this condition is not met, it is impossible to decode the genome correctly, and the program should print '==='.

For example, consider the following input:
```
Input:
8
AG?C??CT
```
The code will count the nucleotides and adjust the counts, but it will fail to recognize that it is impossible to distribute the nucleotides evenly. The corrected code should include a check for this condition:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    count = {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}
    for c in s:
        if c != '?':
            count[c] += 1
    avg = n // 4
    total = sum(count.values()) + s.count('?')
    if total % 4 != 0:
        print('===')
        return
    
    for c in 'ACGT':
        count[c] = avg - count[c]
    
    res = ''
    for c in s:
        if c == '?':
            for nc in 'ACGT':
                if count[nc] > 0:
                    res += nc
                    count[nc] -= 1
                    break
        else:
            res += c
    
    if any(count.values()):
        print('===')
    else:
        print(res)
```

This ensures that the program handles all cases correctly by checking the feasibility of the decoding before attempting to construct the result.
