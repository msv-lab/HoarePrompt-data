Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where there are more than one type of nucleotide with a count greater than the target count. For example, consider the input:

```
8
AACCGTT?
```

In this case, if we replace the last `?` with `G`, we will have three `A`s, three `C`s, three `G`s, and one `T`. This violates the requirement that each nucleotide type should appear an equal number of times. However, the current implementation does not check for this condition. Therefore, the program will output an incorrect genome in this case, making it incorrect overall.
