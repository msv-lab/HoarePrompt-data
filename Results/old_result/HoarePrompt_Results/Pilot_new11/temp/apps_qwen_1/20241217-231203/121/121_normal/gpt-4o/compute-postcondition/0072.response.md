Postcondition: **`counts` is a dictionary where `char` exists, and `counts[char]` is increased by 1 if `counts[char]` was less than `target_count`. Another key in `counts` has a value less than `target_count`, `result` is a dictionary with `i` mapped to `char`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
