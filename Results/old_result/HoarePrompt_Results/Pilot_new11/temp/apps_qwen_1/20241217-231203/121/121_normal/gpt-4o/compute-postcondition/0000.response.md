The code `input = sys.stdin.read` does not directly assign a value to any variable. Instead, it reassigns the global `input` function to `sys.stdin.read`. This means that when `input()` is called later in the program, it will now read the entire input from stdin as a single string instead of reading one line at a time. However, since the code snippet does not contain any calls to `input()`, no values are actually read from stdin.

Given the initial state:
- The input is read from stdin and the output is printed to stdout.
- The input consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer `n` (4 ≤ n ≤ 255) representing the length of the genome, and the second line contains a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?' representing the coded genome.

After executing the provided code snippet, the global `input` function is now `sys.stdin.read`, but no actual values are read or manipulated. The precondition remains unchanged.

Output State: **The input is read from stdin and the output is printed to stdout. The input consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer `n` (4 ≤ n ≤ 255) representing the length of the genome, and the second line contains a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?' representing the coded genome. The global `input` function is now `sys.stdin.read`.**
