The code `n = int(data[0])` assigns the integer value of `data[0]` to `n`. Since `data[0]` is the string representation of `n`, this assignment converts the string to an integer.

- The initial state had `n` as a string representing an integer between 4 and 255.
- After executing the code, `n` will now be an integer with the same value as the original string in `data[0]`.
- The string `s` and the list `data` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of the string from `data[0]`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', `data` is a list containing two elements, the first element is the string representation of the new integer `n` and the second element is `s`.**
