The code `counts[char] += 1` increments the count of `char` in the `counts` dictionary by 1. Since `counts` is a dictionary and `char` exists in it, the value associated with `char` in `counts` will be incremented by 1. The other variables and their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`counts` is a dictionary where `char` exists and its count is increased by 1; `result` is a dictionary with `i` mapped to `char`.**
