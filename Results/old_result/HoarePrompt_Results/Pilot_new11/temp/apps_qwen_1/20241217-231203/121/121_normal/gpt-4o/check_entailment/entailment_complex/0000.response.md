Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program accurately follows the problem description for every potential case. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads the input from `stdin` as described. It reads an integer `n` followed by a string `s`.

2. **Divisibility Check**: The program checks if `n` is divisible by 4. If not, it prints '===' and returns, which aligns with the problem description indicating that if `n` is not divisible by 4, it is impossible to have an equal number of each type of nucleotide, thus printing '==='.

3. **Counting Nucleotides**: The program counts the occurrences of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' in the string `s` and stores these counts in the dictionary `counts`. This step ensures that the program can verify whether the replacement is feasible.

4. **Feasibility Check**: The program checks if the count of each nucleotide in `s` is less than or equal to `target_count` (which is `n // 4`). If any count exceeds `target_count`, it prints '===' and returns. This ensures that the problem constraints are met.

5. **Replacement Logic**: If the counts are feasible, the program iterates over the string `s` and replaces each '?' with one of 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T' such that each type of nucleotide ends up with exactly `target_count` occurrences. This is done by incrementing the count of the chosen nucleotide and moving to the next character until all '?' are replaced.

6. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the modified string and returns, which is consistent with the problem description.

Given that the program handles all the necessary steps and constraints as outlined in the problem description, it can be concluded that the program is correct.
