`target_count` is assigned the value of `n // 4`. Since `n` is divisible by 4, the division operation results in an integer value. The states of the other variables (`n`, `s`, and `data`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of the string from `data[0]`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', `data` is a list containing two elements, the first element is the string representation of the new integer `n` and the second element is `s`, `target_count` is `n // 4`**
