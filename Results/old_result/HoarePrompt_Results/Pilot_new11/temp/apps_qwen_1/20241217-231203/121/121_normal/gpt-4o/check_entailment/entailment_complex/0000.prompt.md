You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The process of mammoth's genome decoding in Berland comes to its end!

One of the few remaining tasks is to restore unrecognized nucleotides in a found chain s. Each nucleotide is coded with a capital letter of English alphabet: 'A', 'C', 'G' or 'T'. Unrecognized nucleotides are coded by a question mark '?'. Thus, s is a string consisting of letters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and characters '?'.

It is known that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types in the decoded genome of mammoth in Berland should be equal.

Your task is to decode the genome and replace each unrecognized nucleotide with one of the four types so that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types becomes equal.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the integer n (4 ≤ n ≤ 255) — the length of the genome.

The second line contains the string s of length n — the coded genome. It consists of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and '?'.


-----Output-----

If it is possible to decode the genome, print it. If there are multiple answer, print any of them. If it is not possible, print three equals signs in a row: "===" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
8
AG?C??CT

Output
AGACGTCT

Input
4
AGCT

Output
AGCT

Input
6
????G?

Output
===

Input
4
AA??

Output
===



-----Note-----

In the first example you can replace the first question mark with the letter 'A', the second question mark with the letter 'G', the third question mark with the letter 'T', then each nucleotide in the genome would be presented twice.

In the second example the genome is already decoded correctly and each nucleotide is exactly once in it.

In the third and the fourth examples it is impossible to decode the genom.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no input parameters. The input is read from stdin and the output is printed to stdout. The input consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (4 ≤ n ≤ 255) representing the length of the genome, and the second line contains a string s of length n consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?' representing the coded genome.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    s = data[1]
    if (n % 4 != 0) :
        print('===')
        return
        #The program returns None
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is the integer value of the string from `data[0]`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', `data` is a list containing two elements, the first element is the string representation of the new integer `n` and the second element is `s`. `n` is divisible by 4
    target_count = n // 4
    counts = {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}
    for char in s:
        if char in counts:
            counts[char] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is the integer value of the string from `data[0]`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', `data` is a list containing two elements, the first element is the string representation of the new integer `n` and the second element is `s`, `target_count` is `n // 4`, and `counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' where the value of each key is the count of occurrences of that character in the string `s`.
    for char in counts:
        if counts[char] > target_count:
            print('===')
            return
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is the integer value of the string from `data[0]`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', `data` is a list containing two elements, the first element is the string representation of the new integer `n` and the second element is `s`, `target_count` is `n // 4`, `counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' where the value of each key is the count of occurrences of that character in the string `s`, and for every key `char` in `counts`, the count of `char` is less than or equal to `target_count`.
    result = list(s)
    for i in range(n):
        if result[i] == '?':
            for char in counts:
                if counts[char] < target_count:
                    result[i] = char
                    counts[char] += 1
                    break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is `n`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', `data` is a list containing the string representation of the new integer `n` and the string `s`, `target_count` is `n // 4`, `counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' where the value of each key is exactly `target_count`, and `result` is a list of characters from the string `s` where each element is either the character 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' (if its count in `s` was less than `target_count`) or remains `'?'` (if its count in `s` was `target_count` or more).
    print(''.join(result))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` and a string `s` from standard input. It checks if `n` is divisible by 4. If not, it prints '===' and returns `None`. Otherwise, it counts the occurrences of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' in `s`. It then replaces all '?' in `s` with one of 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T' such that each character 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' appears exactly `n/4` times. If it's impossible to achieve this due to insufficient counts, it prints '===' and returns `None`. After processing, it prints the modified string `s` and returns `None`. Potential edge cases include inputs where `n` is not divisible by 4, or the counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' in `s` do not allow achieving the required distribution.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
