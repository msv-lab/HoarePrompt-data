The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and returns the minimum value of \(2 \times (a + b)\) for all integers `a` in the range \(1 \leq a \leq \text{int}(\sqrt{n}) + 1\). For each `a`, `b` is calculated as \((n + a - 1) // a\). The function iterates over all possible values of `a` in the given range and updates `min_segments_needed` to the smallest value of \(2 \times (a + b)\) found during the iteration. The function handles the case where `n` is exactly a perfect square, ensuring that `a` can reach \(\text{int}(\sqrt{n}) + 1\).
