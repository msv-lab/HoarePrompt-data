Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided annotated program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, the problem requires determining the minimum number of segments that Sofia will have to draw with a ruler without a guide in order to draw \( n \) squares. However, the current implementation of `func_1` does not achieve this.

Here's why the program is incorrect:

1. **Problem Understanding**: 
   - Sofia needs to draw \( n \) squares, each with a side length of 1.
   - To draw a square, Sofia needs to draw 4 segments.
   - Initially, she might need to draw some segments with a ruler (without a guide), but subsequent segments can use previously drawn segments as guides.
   - The goal is to minimize the number of segments drawn with a ruler initially.

2. **Current Implementation**:
   - The program attempts to find the minimum number of segments needed using a formula involving \( a \) and \( b \).
   - It iterates over possible values of \( a \) and calculates \( b \) using \( (n + a - 1) // a \).
   - The formula \( 2 \times (a + b) \) is used to calculate the number of segments, but this does not directly reflect the minimum number of segments that need to be drawn with a ruler initially.

3. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The formula \( 2 \times (a + b) \) is not derived from the problem constraints.
   - The approach of iterating over \( a \) and calculating \( b \) does not ensure that the minimum number of segments drawn with a ruler is found.
   - The logic for minimizing the number of segments drawn with a ruler is not correctly implemented.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Consider the optimal strategy for minimizing the initial segments drawn with a ruler.
- Realize that the number of segments drawn with a ruler is minimized when the squares are arranged in a way that maximizes the reuse of previously drawn segments.

A more accurate solution would involve understanding that the minimum number of segments drawn with a ruler is \( 2n - 2 \), which can be derived from the fact that each new square added after the first one shares at least one side with a previously drawn segment.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
