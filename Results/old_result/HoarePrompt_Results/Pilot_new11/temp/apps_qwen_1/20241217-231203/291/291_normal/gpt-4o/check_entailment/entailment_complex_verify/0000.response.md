Final: **False**

Reasoning:
Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` attempts to find the minimum number of segments needed to draw \( n \) squares by iterating over possible values of \( a \) and calculating \( b \) as \((n + a - 1) // a\). The formula \( 2 \times (a + b) \) is intended to represent the total number of segments needed, but it does not correctly capture the minimum number of segments that must be drawn with a ruler.

For example, when \( n = 4 \):
- The function considers \( a = 1 \) and \( b = 4 \), leading to \( 2 \times (1 + 4) = 10 \) segments.
- The function considers \( a = 2 \) and \( b = 2 \), leading to \( 2 \times (2 + 2) = 8 \) segments.
- The function considers \( a = 4 \) and \( b = 1 \), leading to \( 2 \times (4 + 1) = 10 \) segments.
- The minimum value found is 8, which is still incorrect.

The correct approach involves drawing the maximum number of squares horizontally first and then vertically, minimizing the number of segments drawn with a ruler. The current implementation does not correctly account for this optimal strategy, hence the original assessment is accurate.
