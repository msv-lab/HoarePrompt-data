`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\), the new value of `n` will still satisfy this condition. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\)**
