Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem. According to the problem description, we need to find pairs of shovels such that the sum of their costs ends with the maximum possible number of nines. The code, however, incorrectly calculates the number of such pairs.

The key issue lies in the logic used to determine the number of pairs. Specifically, the code counts the number of trailing 9s in \( n \) and then calculates \( (n + 1) \times \text{count of trailing 9s} \). This calculation is incorrect for determining the number of pairs whose total cost ends with the maximum possible number of nines.

For example, consider \( n = 50 \). The correct pairs would be (49, 50), resulting in a sum of 99, which has two nines. The code, however, would incorrectly calculate \( (50 + 1) \times 0 = 51 \), which is not the correct number of pairs.

A correct approach would involve finding the closest lower and higher numbers to \( n \) that form a pair whose sum ends with the maximum number of nines. This requires a more complex algorithm, not just counting trailing 9s.

Thus, the provided code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
