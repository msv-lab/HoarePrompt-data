The code `print(pairs)` simply prints the value of the variable `pairs` without changing its value. The variables `n`, `max_9s`, and `pairs` retain their previous values. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `n` with all trailing 9s removed, `max_9s` is the count of trailing 9s that were removed from the original value of `n`, and `pairs` is `(n + 1) * max_9s`.**
