`ans` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The values of `n`, `i`, and the condition `(i + (n - i)) % 10 ** (len(str(i + (n - i))) - 1) == 0` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `ans` is 1, `i` is 1, and `(i + (n - i)) % 10 ** (len(str(i + (n - i))) - 1) == 0`**
