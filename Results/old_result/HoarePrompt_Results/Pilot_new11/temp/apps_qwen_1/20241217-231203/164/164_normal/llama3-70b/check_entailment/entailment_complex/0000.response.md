Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads two integers `n` and `k` followed by a string `s`.
   - The constraints on `n` and `k` are checked and enforced within the valid ranges.

2. **Identifying Starting and Target Positions**:
   - The program iterates through the string `s` to find the positions of 'G' (grasshopper) and 'T' (target insect).
   - If either 'G' or 'T' is not found, the program immediately prints 'NO'.

3. **Checking Feasibility of Jumps**:
   - The program checks if the distance between 'G' and 'T' (`abs(t - g)`) is divisible by `k`.
   - If not, it prints 'NO'.
   - If the distance is divisible by `k`, the program then checks if there are no obstacles (`#`) blocking the path by verifying that each intermediate position `(g + i * k) % n` is not an obstacle for every step `i` from 0 to `abs(t - g) // k`.

4. **Edge Cases and Circular Array Handling**:
   - The use of modular arithmetic (`(g + i * k) % n`) ensures that the jumps wrap around the array, correctly handling the circular nature of the problem.

5. **Output**:
   - Based on the above checks, the program prints 'YES' if the grasshopper can reach the insect and 'NO' otherwise.

Given these points, the program correctly follows the problem description for all valid inputs, and hence it is correct.
