The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to variables `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that the input consists of two integers `n` and `k` with specific ranges, and a string of length `n` containing certain characters. However, the code only processes the first two inputs and ignores the string. After executing this line, the string remains unchanged, and the values of `n` and `k` are set to the integers read from the input.

Output State: **the input string is unchanged, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input**
