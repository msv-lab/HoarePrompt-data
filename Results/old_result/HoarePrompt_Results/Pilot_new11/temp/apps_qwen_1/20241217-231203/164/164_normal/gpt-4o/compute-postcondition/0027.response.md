Postcondition: ***`reachable` is `True`, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is 1, `line` is a string containing at least one 'G' and one 'T', `G_pos` is the index of the first 'G' in `line`, and `T_pos` is the index of the first 'T' in `line`. If `pos` equals `T_pos`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
