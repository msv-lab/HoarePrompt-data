`line` is assigned the value of the next input from the user, which is a string. The initial values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: the input string is unchanged, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `line` is the input string from the user.

Output State: **the input string is unchanged, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `line` is the input string from the user**
