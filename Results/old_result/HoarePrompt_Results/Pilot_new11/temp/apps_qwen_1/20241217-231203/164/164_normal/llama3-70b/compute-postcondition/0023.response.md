The code `print('NO')` simply prints the string 'NO' to the console. This does not change the values of any variables. The conditions and values of the variables before the print statement remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string input by the user, 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` - 1, `g` is the index of the first occurrence of 'G' in the string `s` (or -1 if 'G' does not appear), `t` is the index of the first occurrence of 'T' in the string `s` (or -1 if 'T' does not appear), `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, and either 'G' and 'T' do not appear in the string `s` or one of 'G' and 'T' does not appear in the string `s`. The program prints 'NO' to the console.**
