Postcondition: ***`reachable` is `True`, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is 1, `line` is a string containing at least one 'G' and one 'T', `G_pos` is the index of the first 'G' in `line`, `T_pos` is the index of the first 'T' in `line`, and `pos` is `T_pos + 1`. If `line[pos]` is '#', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
