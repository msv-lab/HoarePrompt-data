Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program adheres to the problem requirements:

1. **Input Parsing**: 
   - The program correctly reads the values of `n` and `k` using `input().split()`.
   - It then reads the string `s` which represents the line of cells.

2. **Identifying Start and Target Positions**:
   - The program iterates through the string `s` to find the indices of 'G' and 'T'.
   - If either 'G' or 'T' is not found, it prints 'NO' immediately, which is consistent with the problem statement.

3. **Checking Feasibility of Jumps**:
   - The program checks if the absolute difference between the indices of 'G' and 'T' (`abs(t - g)`) is divisible by `k`. This ensures that the grasshopper can potentially make a series of jumps to reach the target.
   - It also checks that each cell the grasshopper would land on during its jumps is not an obstacle ('#'). This is done by iterating from `0` to `abs(t - g) // k` and verifying that the character at index `(g + i * k) % n` is not '#'.

4. **Output**:
   - If both conditions are met, the program prints 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Why it meets the problem description:
- **Boundary Conditions**: The program handles cases where 'G' or 'T' is not present, which is explicitly stated in the problem description.
- **Jump Length Validation**: The program correctly checks if the distance between 'G' and 'T' is a multiple of `k`, ensuring that the grasshopper can make the necessary jumps.
- **Obstacle Avoidance**: The program ensures that no obstacles are encountered during the journey from 'G' to 'T'.

Thus, the program is correct as it strictly follows the problem description for all possible inputs.
