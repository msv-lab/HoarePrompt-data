Postcondition: ***`s` is a string input by the user, 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` - 1, `g` is 0 if `s[1]` is 'G', otherwise `g` is -1; if `s[i]` is 'T', then `t` is 1, otherwise `t` remains as it was initially (which is -1 if `s[1]` is not 'T', and 0 if `s[1]` is 'G'). `i` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 0.***
