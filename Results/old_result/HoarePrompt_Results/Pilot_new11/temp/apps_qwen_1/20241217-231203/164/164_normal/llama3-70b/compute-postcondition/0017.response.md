The code `g = i` assigns the current value of `i` to `g`. According to the initial state, `i` is 2. Therefore, `g` is assigned the value 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string input by the user, 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` - 1, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, and `g` is 2.**
