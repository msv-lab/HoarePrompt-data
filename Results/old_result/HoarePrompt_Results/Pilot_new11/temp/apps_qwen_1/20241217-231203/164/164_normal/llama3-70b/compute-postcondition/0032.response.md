Functionality: **The function accepts two integers `n` and `k`, and a string `s`. It determines whether a grasshopper, starting at the position marked by 'G' in the string `s`, can jump to the position marked by 'T' using exactly `k` moves, where each move covers `k` positions in a circular manner around the string `s`. If the conditions are met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function handles cases where 'G' or 'T' does not appear in the string, and ensures that no obstacles ('#') block the path during the jumps.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- If 'G' or 'T' does not appear in the string `s`, the function correctly prints 'NO'.
- The function checks if the distance between 'G' and 'T' is divisible by `k` and ensures that no obstacles are encountered along the path. However, it does not explicitly check if the grasshopper can actually make `k` moves without hitting an obstacle, which is implicitly handled by the condition `all(s[(g + i * k) % n] != '#' for i in range(abs(t - g) // k + 1))`.

This summary covers the main functionality and includes the edge cases and missing logic identified in the code.
