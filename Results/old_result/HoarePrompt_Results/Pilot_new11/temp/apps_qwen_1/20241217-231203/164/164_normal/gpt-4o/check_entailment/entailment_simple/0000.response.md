Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The annotated program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Specifically, the program checks if the grasshopper can reach the insect by moving in increments of `k` cells, but it does not ensure that the grasshopper can jump over obstacles correctly. Here are the key issues:

1. **Jump Direction Check**: The program only checks if the grasshopper can jump forward in increments of `k` cells. However, the problem description states that the grasshopper can jump both to the left and to the right. Therefore, the program should check both directions.

2. **Handling Both Directions**: The program only considers the direction from `G_pos` to `T_pos`. To properly solve the problem, the program needs to consider all possible positions the grasshopper can reach by jumping in both directions.

Here is an improved version of the function that addresses these issues:

```python
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    line = input()
    G_pos = line.index('G')
    T_pos = line.index('T')
    
    # Handle the case where G_pos is greater than T_pos
    if G_pos > T_pos:
        G_pos, T_pos = T_pos, G_pos
    
    reachable = False
    
    # Check both directions
    for pos in range(G_pos, min(n, G_pos + k*(T_pos - G_pos + 1)), k):
        if line[pos] == '#':
            break
        if pos == T_pos:
            reachable = True
            break
    
    for pos in range(G_pos, max(-1, G_pos - k*(G_pos - T_pos + 1)), -k):
        if line[pos] == '#':
            break
        if pos == T_pos:
            reachable = True
            break
    
    if reachable:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')

```

### Explanation of the Improved Program:
1. **Direction Handling**: The program now checks both directions separately:
   - The first loop checks if the grasshopper can reach the insect from `G_pos` to `T_pos`.
   - The second loop checks if the grasshopper can reach the insect from `G_pos` to `T_pos` in the opposite direction.
   
2. **Boundary Conditions**: The loops use appropriate boundary conditions to avoid out-of-range errors.

By ensuring the program checks both directions and handles all possible positions, the improved version adheres more closely to the problem description.
