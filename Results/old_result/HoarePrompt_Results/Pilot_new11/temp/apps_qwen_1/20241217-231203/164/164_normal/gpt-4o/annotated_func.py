#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two integers n and k where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1, and a string of length n containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T' indicating empty cells, obstacles, the grasshopper's starting position, and the insect's position respectively. It is guaranteed that 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once in the string.
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    line = input()
    G_pos = line.index('G')
    T_pos = line.index('T')
    if (G_pos > T_pos) :
        G_pos, T_pos = T_pos, G_pos
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `line` is the input string from the user. If `G_pos` is greater than `T_pos`, then `G_pos` is updated to the index of the first 'G' in `line`, and `T_pos` is updated to the index of the first 'T' in `line`. Otherwise, `G_pos` and `T_pos` retain their original values.
    reachable = False
    for pos in range(G_pos, T_pos + 1, k):
        if line[pos] == '#':
            break
        
        if pos == T_pos:
            reachable = True
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `reachable` is `True` if the loop executes at least once, otherwise `False`; `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `line` is the input string containing at least one 'G' and one 'T', `G_pos` is the index of the first 'G' in `line`, `T_pos` is the index of the first 'T' in `line`, and `pos` is the last value it reached before breaking out of the loop (or retains its original value if the loop does not execute).
    if reachable :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `reachable` is a boolean indicating whether the loop executed at least once; `n` is the first integer input; `k` is the second integer input; `line` is a string containing at least one 'G' and one 'T'; `G_pos` is the index of the first 'G' in `line`; `T_pos` is the index of the first 'T' in `line`; `pos` is the last value it reached before breaking out of the loop (or retains its original value if the loop does not execute); if the loop executed (`reachable` is `True`), the program prints 'YES'; otherwise, the output is 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers `n` and `k`, and a string of length `n` containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T'. It checks if a grasshopper, starting at the position indicated by 'G', can reach the position indicated by 'T' by jumping `k` positions at a time without hitting any obstacles ('#'). If the grasshopper can reach 'T', the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function handles the case where 'G' is initially positioned after 'T' by swapping their positions. The function also correctly identifies when the grasshopper hits an obstacle or reaches the target position, and it properly updates the `reachable` variable accordingly. Potential edge cases include invalid inputs such as 'G' or 'T' not being present in the string, or 'G' being equal to 'T', which would result in the grasshopper already being at the target position.
