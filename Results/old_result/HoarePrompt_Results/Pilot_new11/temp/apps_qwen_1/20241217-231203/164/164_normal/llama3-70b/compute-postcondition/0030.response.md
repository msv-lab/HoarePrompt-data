Postcondition: ***`s` is a string input by the user, 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` - 1, `g` is the index of the first occurrence of 'G' in the string `s` (or -1 if 'G' does not appear), `t` is the index of the first occurrence of 'T' in the string `s` (or -1 if 'T' does not appear), `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0. If either 'G' and 'T' do not appear in the string `s` or one of 'G' and 'T' does not appear in the string `s`, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, if `abs(t - g)` is divisible by `k` and for every integer `j` from 0 to `abs(t - g) // k`, the character at index `(g + j * k) % n` in `s` is not '#', then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
