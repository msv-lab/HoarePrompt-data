Postcondition: **`reachable` is `True` indicating the loop executed at least once; `n` is the first integer input; `k` is the second integer input; `line` is a string containing at least one 'G' and one 'T'; `G_pos` is the index of the first 'G' in `line`; `T_pos` is the index of the first 'T' in `line`; `pos` is the last value it reached before breaking out of the loop (or retains its original value if the loop does not execute)**
