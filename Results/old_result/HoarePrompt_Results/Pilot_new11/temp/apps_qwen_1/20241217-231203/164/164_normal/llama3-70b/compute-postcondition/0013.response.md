`t` is assigned the value of `i`. The previous value of `i` is 1, so `t` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string input by the user, 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` - 1, `g` is 0 if `s[1]` is 'G', otherwise `g` is -1; `t` is 1, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 0.
