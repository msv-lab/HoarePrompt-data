The function accepts two integers `n` and `k`, and a string `s`. It determines whether a grasshopper, starting at the position marked by 'G' in the string `s`, can jump to the position marked by 'T' using exactly `k` moves, where each move covers `k` positions in a circular manner around the string `s`. If the conditions are met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function handles cases where 'G' or 'T' does not appear in the string, and ensures that no obstacles ('#') block the path during the jumps.
