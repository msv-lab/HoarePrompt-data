#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1. The second line is a string of length n consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where 'G' represents the grasshopper's starting position, 'T' represents the target insect, and '#' represents an obstacle. It is guaranteed that both 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once in the string.

If `abs(t - g)` is divisible by `k` and for every integer `j` from 0 to `abs(t - g) // k`, the character at index `(g + j * k) % n` in `s` is not '#', then 'YES' is printed.

Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers `n` and `k`, and a string `s`. It determines whether a grasshopper, starting at the position marked by 'G' in the string `s`, can jump to the position marked by 'T' using exactly `k` moves, where each move covers `k` positions in a circular manner around the string `s`. If the conditions are met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function handles cases where 'G' or 'T' does not appear in the string, and ensures that no obstacles ('#') block the path during the jumps.
