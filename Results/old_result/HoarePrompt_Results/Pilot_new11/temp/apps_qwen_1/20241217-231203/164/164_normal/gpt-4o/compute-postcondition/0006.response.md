Postcondition: ***`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `line` is the input string from the user. If `G_pos` is greater than `T_pos`, then `G_pos` is updated to the index of the first 'G' in `line`, and `T_pos` is updated to the index of the first 'T' in `line`. Otherwise, `G_pos` and `T_pos` retain their original values.***
