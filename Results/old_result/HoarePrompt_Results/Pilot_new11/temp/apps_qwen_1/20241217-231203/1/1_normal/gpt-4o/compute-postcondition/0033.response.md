The code snippet `print(-1)` simply prints the value `-1` to the console. This operation does not affect any of the variables `s`, `n`, `ind`, `bind`, or `i`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`s` is the input string, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of the character `[` in `s`, or remains `-1` if no such character is found; `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of `]` in `s`, or remains `-1` if no such character is found; `i` is `-1`; the console displays `-1`.**
