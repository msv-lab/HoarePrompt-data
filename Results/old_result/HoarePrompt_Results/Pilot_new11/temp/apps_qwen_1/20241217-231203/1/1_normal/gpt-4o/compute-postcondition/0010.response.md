The code `break` does not affect the values of the variables `s`, `n`, `ind`, and `i`. It simply breaks out of the current loop or nested structure it is inside. Since there is no loop or nested structure mentioned in the initial state, the `break` statement here implies breaking out of an implied context (like a loop or conditional statement) but does not change the values of the variables.

Output State: **`s` is the input string, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `ind` is `i + 1`, `i` is incremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
