The code `ind = i` assigns the value of the index `i` to the variable `ind`. Given the initial state, the current character at index `i` of `s` is `[`, and `ind` is initially set to `-1`. After executing the line `ind = i`, the value of `ind` changes to the value of `i`.

Output State: **`s` is the input string, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `ind` is `i`, the current character at index `i` of `s` is `['**.
