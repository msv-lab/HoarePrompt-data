`start_colon` is assigned the value of `i`, which is `-1`. The other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is the input string, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of the character `[` in `s`, `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of `]` in `s`, `i` is `-1`, `ind` is not `-1` and less than `bind`, `start_colon` is `-1`.

Output State: **`s` is the input string, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of the character `[` in `s`, `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of `]` in `s`, `i` is `-1`, `ind` is not `-1` and less than `bind`, `start_colon` is `-1**.
