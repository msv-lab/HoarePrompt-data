The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to process a string `s` which consists of lowercase Latin letters and characters '[', ']', ':', and '|', with a length between 1 and 500,000 inclusive.

However, since the problem does not specify what the function should return based on the input string, we can only state the accepted parameter and its constraints.
