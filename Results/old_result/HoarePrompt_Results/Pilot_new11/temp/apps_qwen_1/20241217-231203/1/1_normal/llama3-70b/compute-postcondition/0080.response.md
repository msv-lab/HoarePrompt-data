Functionality: **The function processes a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, characters `[`, `]`, `:`, and `|`, with a length between 1 and 500000 inclusive. It searches for the first occurrence of `['` and the last occurrence of `']'` that follow it, and if such occurrences are found, it calculates the number of `|` characters in the substring between them (excluding the delimiters). If no valid pair of `['` and `']'` is found, or if the substring between them is empty or starts with `]`, the function prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the count of `|` characters plus 4. The function does not modify the input string `s`.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If no `['` is found, `ind` remains `-1`.
- If no `']'` is found, `bind` remains `-1`.
- If `['` is found but no corresponding `']'` is found, or if the substring between them is empty or starts with `]`, the function prints `-1`.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The annotations suggest that the function should check for the presence of both `['` and `']'`, but the code does not handle the case where only one of these characters is found without the other, which leads to incorrect behavior as described above.
