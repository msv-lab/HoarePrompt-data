`f` is assigned the value `True`. The value of `n`, `ind`, `bind`, and the current value of `s[i]` (which is `']'`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `f` is True, `ind` is the index of the first `':'` character after the first `['` if such a `['` exists; otherwise, `ind` is -1, `bind` is -1, the current value of `s[i]` is `']'`**
