`ind` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `i` is unchanged from the initial state. The other variables (`n`, `s[i+1]`, `f`) retain their values from the initial state.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `s[i+1]` will be checked, `f` retains its value from the previous iteration, `ind` is equal to `i`.**
