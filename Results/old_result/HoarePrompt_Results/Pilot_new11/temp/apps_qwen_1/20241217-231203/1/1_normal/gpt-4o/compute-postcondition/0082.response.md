Postcondition: ***`s` is the input string, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of the character `[` in `s`, `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of `]` in `s`, the range `[bind - (bind - ind), ind]` must contain valid indices, `end_colon` is the index of the last `:` encountered within the range `[ind + 1, bind]` or `-1` if no `:` is found, `start_colon` is the index of the first `:` encountered within the range `[ind + 1, end_colon]` or `-1` if no `:` is found, if `(start_colon == -1 or end_colon == -1 or start_colon >= end_colon)` is true, `-1` is printed to the console. Otherwise, `start_colon` is not equal to `-1`, `end_colon` is not equal to `-1`, `start_colon` is less than `end_colon`, `pipe_count` is the number of `|` characters in the substring of `s` from `start_colon + 1` to `end_colon - 1`, and `4 + pipe_count` is printed.***
