According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are known:
- `s` is the input string.
- `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0.
- `ind` is either `i + 1` if `s[i]` is `[`, otherwise `ind` remains `-1`.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, we need to adjust `i` to `i + 1`.

Let's denote the new value of `i` as `i_new`, which is `i + 1`.

Therefore, the new state for the start of the next iteration is:
- `s` remains the same (the input string).
- `n` remains the same (the length of `s` and must still be greater than 0).
- `ind` will be `i_new + 1` if `s[i_new]` is `[`, otherwise `ind` remains `-1`.
- `i` is now `i_new`, which is `i + 1`.

State: **`s` is the input string, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `ind` is either `i + 2` if `s[i + 1]` is `[`, otherwise `ind` remains `-1`, and `i` is `i + 1`**
