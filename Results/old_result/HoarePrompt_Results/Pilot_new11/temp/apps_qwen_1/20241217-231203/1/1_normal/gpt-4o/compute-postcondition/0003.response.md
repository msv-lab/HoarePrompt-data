According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `n`, and `s`. The loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0 because the `range(n)` function generates numbers from 0 to `n-1`.

Before the loop starts:
- `s` is the input string.
- `n` is the length of `s`.
- `ind` is -1.

For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0 because the range function will not generate any values if `n` is 0 or less.

The state should be adjusted to reflect these requirements:
State: **`s` is the input string, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `ind` is -1**
