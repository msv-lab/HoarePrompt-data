The code `break` is used to exit a loop or the most nested block it is inside. Since no loop or nested block is specified, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`s` is the input string, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of the character `[` in `s`, `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of `]` in `s`, `i` is 0, `ind` is not -1 and less than `bind`, `start_colon` is 0**
