The code `ind = i` assigns the value of `i` to `ind`. The values of `n`, `s[i+1]`, `f`, and `ind` are updated based on the assignment.

- `n` remains unchanged because the code does not affect it.
- `s[i+1]` is not directly affected by this line of code, so its state remains the same as before.
- `f` is not affected by this line of code, so its state remains the same as before the end of the previous iteration.
- `ind` is now assigned the value of `i`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 0; `s[i+1]` is checked; `f` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration; `ind` is set to `i`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `s[i+1]` is checked; `f` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration; `ind` is set to `i`.**
