Postcondition: ***`n` is the length of the input string `s`, `f` is `True`, `ind` is the index of the first `':'` character after the first `['` if such a `['` exists; otherwise, `ind` is `-1`, and `bind` is the last index `i` where `s[i]` is `':'` and `f` is `True`. If `(ind == -1 or bind == -1)`, the function does nothing. If `ind` is greater than or equal to `bind`, the console prints `-1`. Otherwise, `ans` is `4` plus the number of `|` characters in the substring `s[ind+1:bind]`, and `ans` is printed.***
