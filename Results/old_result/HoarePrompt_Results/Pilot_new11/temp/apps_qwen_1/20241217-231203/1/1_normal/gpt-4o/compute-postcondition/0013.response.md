The code `ind = i` assigns the value of `i` to `ind`. The value of `i` was updated from `i + 1` in the initial state. Therefore, `i` is now `i + 1`, and `ind` is set to this new value of `i`.

Output State: **`s` is the input string, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `ind` is `i + 1`, and `i` is `i + 1`**
