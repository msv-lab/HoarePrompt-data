Postcondition: ***`s` is the input string, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of the character `[` in `s`, `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of `]` in `s`, `i` is -1, `ind` is not -1 and less than `bind`, and if `s[i]` equals `':'`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[i]` does not equal `':'`, no change is made to the variables.***
