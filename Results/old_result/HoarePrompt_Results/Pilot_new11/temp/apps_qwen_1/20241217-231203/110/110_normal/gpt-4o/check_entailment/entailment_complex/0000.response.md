Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the case where the number of fishes `k` exceeds the total number of cells in the pond. Specifically, the problem description states that `1 ≤ k ≤ min(n * m, 10^5)`, meaning `k` can be as large as `n * m`. However, the code only considers placing `k` fishes in the pond without checking if `k` exceeds the total number of cells. 

When `k > n * m`, the code will attempt to place more fishes than available cells, which is not allowed according to the problem constraints. This can lead to incorrect behavior and potentially out-of-bound errors, violating the problem description.

To fix this, the code should include a check to ensure `k` does not exceed `n * m` before proceeding with the calculation. Here is an example of how this check can be added:

```python
if k > n * m:
    return 0.0  # or raise an exception, depending on the expected behavior
```

This check ensures that the code adheres to the problem constraints and avoids invalid operations.
