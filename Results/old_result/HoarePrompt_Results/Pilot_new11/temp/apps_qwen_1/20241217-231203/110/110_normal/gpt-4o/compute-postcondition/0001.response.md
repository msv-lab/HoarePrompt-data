The function `coverage` accepts four parameters: `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m`. `x` and `y` are non-negative integers representing the coordinates of a cell in the pond where a fish is placed. `n` and `m` are the dimensions of the pond, with 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5. `r` is the size of the scoop-net, with 1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m).

The return value of the function is the product of two expressions:
- The first expression is (min(x + 1, n - r + 1) - max(x - r + 2, 0))
- The second expression is (min(y + 1, m - r + 1) - max(y - r + 2, 0))

Therefore, the functionality of the function `coverage` is to accept the coordinates `x` and `y`, and the dimensions `n` and `m` of the pond, and return the product of the two given expressions.
