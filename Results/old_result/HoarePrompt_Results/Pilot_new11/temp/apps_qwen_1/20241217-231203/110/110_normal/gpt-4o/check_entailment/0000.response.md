Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Specifically, the `coverage` function calculates the number of cells that would be covered by placing the scoop-net at position `(x, y)`, but it does not account for the fact that the scoop-net should not overlap with itself. This means that the `coverage` function can overestimate the number of cells that would be covered, leading to an incorrect expected value.

For example, consider the following scenario:

- Input: `n = 3`, `m = 3`, `r = 2`, `k = 3`
- The program suggests placing the fishes in cells `(2, 1)`, `(2, 2)`, and `(2, 3)`.

However, when the scoop-net is placed at position `(2, 1)`, it will cover the cells `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(2, 1)`, `(2, 2)`, `(3, 1)`, and `(3, 2)`. This results in more than two fishes being caught, which is not consistent with the optimal solution.

To correctly solve the problem, the `coverage` function needs to ensure that the scoop-net does not overlap with itself, and the placement of fishes should maximize the expected value of caught fishes. The current implementation does not achieve this, making the program incorrect.
