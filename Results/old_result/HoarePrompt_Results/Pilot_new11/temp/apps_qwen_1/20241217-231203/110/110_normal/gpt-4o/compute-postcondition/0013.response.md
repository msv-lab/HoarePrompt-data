`heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))` pushes a new tuple into the heap. Given the initial conditions, `x` is 1 and `y` is 1. Therefore, the new tuple added to the heap is `(-coverage(1, 1), 1, 1)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`y` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer, `r` must be an integer within the range 1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m), `k` must be an integer within the range 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n * m, 10^5), `heap` contains tuples (-coverage(i, j), i, j) for all i in range(n) and j in range(m) and the new tuple (-coverage(1, 1), 1, 1), `x` is 1**
