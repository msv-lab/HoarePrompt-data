Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not solve the problem as described. The code calculates the minimum of \(k\) and the product of \((n - r + 1)\) and \((m - r + 1)\), and then divides this minimum value by \((n - r + 1) \times (m - r + 1)\). This calculation does not maximize the expected number of caught fishes.

To maximize the expected number of caught fishes, we need to place the fishes in such a way that the scoop-net, when placed randomly, has a higher chance of catching as many fishes as possible. The optimal strategy is to place the fishes in a grid-like pattern across the pond to maximize the overlap with the scoop-net for different positions.

For example, consider the first test case:
- Input: `3 3 2 3`
- The expected number of caught fishes should be `2.0000000000` if we place the fishes optimally.

However, the given code simply calculates a fraction which does not reflect the optimal placement of fishes. Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case and thus is incorrect.
