`total_coverage` is decremented by `cov`. The value of `cov` is the first element popped from the heap, but its specific value is not provided. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `total_coverage` is 0 minus the value of `cov`; `k` is a positive integer; `_` is 0; `cov` is the first element popped from the heap; `x` is the second element popped from the heap; `y` is the third element popped from the heap.

Output State: **`total_coverage` is 0 - `cov`; `k` is a positive integer; `_` is 0; `cov` is the first element popped from the heap; `x` is the second element popped from the heap; `y` is the third element popped from the heap.**
