The code `cov, x, y = heapq.heappop(heap)` pops the smallest element from the heap and assigns it to `cov`, the next smallest element to `x`, and the third smallest element to `y`. The initial state provides the following information:

- `total_coverage` is `0 - x - cov`
- `_` is `0`
- `cov` is the smallest element from the heap
- `x` is the second smallest element from the heap
- `y` is the third smallest element from the heap

After popping the smallest element, the values of `cov`, `x`, and `y` change to the values of the smallest, second smallest, and third smallest elements from the heap, respectively. The values of `total_coverage` and `_` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total_coverage` is `0 - x - cov`, `_` is `0`, `cov` is the new smallest element from the heap, `x` is the new second smallest element from the heap, `y` is the new third smallest element from the heap**
