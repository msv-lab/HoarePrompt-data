The function `coverage` calculates the number of cells in a pond that can be covered by a scoop-net of size `r` when placed at coordinates `(x, y)`. Given the dimensions of the pond `n` and `m`, the function returns the product of the number of cells that can be covered horizontally and vertically from the point `(x, y)` considering the scoop-net's size `r`. The function handles edge cases where the scoop-net might extend beyond the boundaries of the pond. Specifically, it computes the effective range of the scoop-net in both the x and y directions, taking into account the boundaries defined by `n` and `m`, and then multiplies these ranges together to determine the total number of cells that can be covered.
