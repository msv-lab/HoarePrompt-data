The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `n` and `f_max_n`. 
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6.
- `f_max_n` is an integer representing the maximum value of f(p) for permutations of length n.

The function returns `dp[f_max_n]`, which is the cumulative sum of all integers from 1 to `f_max_n` modulo 10.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept two integers `n` and `f_max_n`, and return the cumulative sum of all integers from 1 to `f_max_n` modulo 10.
