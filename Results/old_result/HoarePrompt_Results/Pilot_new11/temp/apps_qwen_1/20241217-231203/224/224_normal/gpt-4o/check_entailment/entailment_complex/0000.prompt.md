You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Let's define a function $f(p)$ on a permutation $p$ as follows. Let $g_i$ be the greatest common divisor (GCD) of elements $p_1$, $p_2$, ..., $p_i$ (in other words, it is the GCD of the prefix of length $i$). Then $f(p)$ is the number of distinct elements among $g_1$, $g_2$, ..., $g_n$.

Let $f_{max}(n)$ be the maximum value of $f(p)$ among all permutations $p$ of integers $1$, $2$, ..., $n$.

Given an integers $n$, count the number of permutations $p$ of integers $1$, $2$, ..., $n$, such that $f(p)$ is equal to $f_{max}(n)$. Since the answer may be large, print the remainder of its division by $1000\,000\,007 = 10^9 + 7$.


-----Input-----

The only line contains the integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^6$) — the length of the permutations.


-----Output-----

The only line should contain your answer modulo $10^9+7$.


-----Examples-----

-----Note-----

Consider the second example: these are the permutations of length $3$:  $[1,2,3]$, $f(p)=1$.  $[1,3,2]$, $f(p)=1$.  $[2,1,3]$, $f(p)=2$.  $[2,3,1]$, $f(p)=2$.  $[3,1,2]$, $f(p)=2$.  $[3,2,1]$, $f(p)=2$. 

The maximum value $f_{max}(3) = 2$, and there are $4$ permutations $p$ such that $f(p)=2$.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
n = int(input())
if n == 2:
    result = 1
else:
    result = func_1(n - 1, MOD)
print(result)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, and mod is an integer representing 10^9 + 7.
def func_1(n, mod):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result = result * i % mod
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `result` is the factorial of `n` modulo \(10^9 + 7\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\), `mod` is \(10^9 + 7\), `i` is `n + 1` if the loop executed at least once.
    return result
    #The program returns the factorial of n modulo \(10^9 + 7\)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` (an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\)) and `mod` (an integer representing \(10^9 + 7\)). It calculates the factorial of `n` and returns the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The function iterates from 2 to `n`, multiplying each number to the `result` variable and taking modulo `mod` at each step to prevent overflow. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns the factorial of `n` modulo \(10^9 + 7\). Potential edge cases include when `n` is exactly 2 or 10^6, as these will still be within the defined range. There is no missing functionality noted based on the provided code and annotations.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
