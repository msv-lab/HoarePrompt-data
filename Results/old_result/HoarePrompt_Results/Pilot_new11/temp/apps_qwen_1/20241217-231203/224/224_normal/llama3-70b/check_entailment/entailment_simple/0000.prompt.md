You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Let's define a function $f(p)$ on a permutation $p$ as follows. Let $g_i$ be the greatest common divisor (GCD) of elements $p_1$, $p_2$, ..., $p_i$ (in other words, it is the GCD of the prefix of length $i$). Then $f(p)$ is the number of distinct elements among $g_1$, $g_2$, ..., $g_n$.

Let $f_{max}(n)$ be the maximum value of $f(p)$ among all permutations $p$ of integers $1$, $2$, ..., $n$.

Given an integers $n$, count the number of permutations $p$ of integers $1$, $2$, ..., $n$, such that $f(p)$ is equal to $f_{max}(n)$. Since the answer may be large, print the remainder of its division by $1000\,000\,007 = 10^9 + 7$.


-----Input-----

The only line contains the integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^6$) — the length of the permutations.


-----Output-----

The only line should contain your answer modulo $10^9+7$.


-----Examples-----

-----Note-----

Consider the second example: these are the permutations of length $3$:  $[1,2,3]$, $f(p)=1$.  $[1,3,2]$, $f(p)=1$.  $[2,1,3]$, $f(p)=2$.  $[2,3,1]$, $f(p)=2$.  $[3,1,2]$, $f(p)=2$.  $[3,2,1]$, $f(p)=2$. 

The maximum value $f_{max}(3) = 2$, and there are $4$ permutations $p$ such that $f(p)=2$.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
n = int(input())
f_max_n = func_2(n)
print(func_3(n, f_max_n))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers, where a >= b > 0.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables `a` and `b`.
    #
    #### Step-by-Step Analysis:
    #
    ##### Initial State:
    #- `a` and `b` are non-negative integers where \( a \geq b > 0 \).
    #
    ##### First Iteration:
    #- Loop condition: `b != 0`
    #- Update: `a, b = b, a % b`
    #- After first iteration:
    #  - `a` becomes the original value of `b`
    #  - `b` becomes `a % b` which is 0 because `a` is now `b` and `b` was originally less than `a`
    #
    ##### Second Iteration:
    #- For the second iteration, the condition `b` must still be non-zero, but since `b` became 0 after the first iteration, this iteration does not occur.
    #- Therefore, the loop terminates after the first iteration.
    #
    #### Output State After the Loop Executes Some Number of Times:
    #
    #Given the loop behavior, we can generalize the output state as follows:
    #
    #- The loop will execute exactly once when `b` is non-zero.
    #- After one iteration, `a` will be the original value of `b`, and `b` will be 0.
    #
    #Since the loop condition is `b`, and it will only execute if `b` is non-zero, the final state will always be that `b` is 0.
    #
    #### General Output State:
    #- `a` will be the original value of `b`.
    #- `b` will be 0.
    #
    #Thus, the output state of the loop is:
    #
    #**Output State: `a` is the original value of `b`, `b` is 0.**
    return a
    #a is the original value of `b`, and `b` is 0

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6.
def func_2(n):
    res = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        res = max(res, func_1(res, i))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `res` is the maximum value obtained by applying `func_1` iteratively from `func_1(0, 1)` up to `func_1(...(func_1(0, 1)...), n)`, `i` is `n`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\)
    return res
    #The program returns res which is the maximum value obtained by applying func_1 iteratively from func_1(0, 1) up to func_1(...(func_1(0, 1)...), n), where i = n and n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, and f_max_n is an integer representing the maximum value of f(p) for permutations of length n.
def func_3(n, f_max_n):
    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
    dp = [0] * (f_max_n + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(f_max_n, 0, -1):
            dp[j] += dp[j - 1]
            dp[j] %= MOD
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is within the range 2 to \(10^6\), `f_max_n` is a positive integer, `MOD` is 10, `dp[0]` is 1, for all `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` is the cumulative sum of all integers from 1 to `j` modulo 10, `i` is `n`, `j` is `f_max_n`.
    return dp[f_max_n]
    #`The program returns dp[f_max_n]`, which is the cumulative sum of all integers from 1 to f_max_n modulo 10


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
