`result` is updated to the value of `result * i % mod`. Given the initial state where `result` is 1, `i` is 2, and `mod` is an integer representing \(10^9 + 7\), the new value of `result` is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{result} = 1 \times 2 \mod (10^9 + 7) = 2 \mod (10^9 + 7) = 2 \]

The other variables (`n`, `i`, and `mod`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`result` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, `mod` is an integer representing 10^9 + 7, `i` is 2**
