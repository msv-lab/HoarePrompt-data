The code snippet `dp[j] += dp[j - 1]` increments `dp[j]` by `dp[j - 1]`. Given the initial state, `dp[j]` is already set to `j % 10` for all `j` from 1 to `f_max_n - 1`. Therefore, for each `j` in this range, `dp[j]` will be updated to `dp[j] + dp[j - 1]`.

Let's break down the changes:
- For `j = 1`, `dp[1]` was initially `1 % 10 = 1`. After the operation, `dp[1]` becomes `1 + dp[0] = 1 + 1 = 2`.
- For `j = 2`, `dp[2]` was initially `2 % 10 = 2`. After the operation, `dp[2]` becomes `2 + dp[1] = 2 + 2 = 4`.
- This pattern continues up to `j = f_max_n - 1`.

Therefore, after the code executes, `dp[j]` for `j` from 1 to `f_max_n - 1` will be updated to `dp[j - 1] + (j - 1) % 10`.

The Output State is:
**`n` is within the range 2 to \(10^6\), `f_max_n` is a positive integer, `MOD` is 10, `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[j]` is `dp[j - 1] + (j - 1) % 10` for all `j` from 1 to `f_max_n - 1`**.
