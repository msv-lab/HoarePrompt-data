Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is within the range 2 to \(10^6\).
   - `f_max_n` is a positive integer and greater than or equal to 1.
   - `MOD` is 10.
   - `dp[0]` is 1.
   - For all `j` from 2 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` is the last digit of the cumulative sum of all integers from 1 to `j` plus the last digit of the cumulative sum of all integers from 1 to `j-1`, and each `dp[j]` is updated to be the sum of the previous `dp[j - 1]` and the initial value of `dp[j]`, all `dp[j]` values are taken modulo 10.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(1, n + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The loop variable `i` starts at 1 and goes up to `n`.
   - The loop body is omitted, but we need to consider how the loop changes the state.

4. **State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop starts at `i = 1` and increments by 1, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `2`.
   - All other variables (`n`, `f_max_n`, `MOD`, `dp`) remain unchanged because the loop does not modify them directly.

5. **Updated State:**
   - `n` remains within the range 2 to \(10^6\).
   - `f_max_n` remains a positive integer and greater than or equal to 1.
   - `MOD` remains 10.
   - `dp[0]` remains 1.
   - `dp[j]` for all `j` from 2 to `f_max_n` remains as calculated in the previous iterations (unchanged).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`n` is within the range 2 to \(10^6\); `f_max_n` is a positive integer and greater than or equal to 1; `MOD` is 10; `dp[0]` is 1; for all `j` from 2 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` is the last digit of the cumulative sum of all integers from 1 to `j` plus the last digit of the cumulative sum of all integers from 1 to `j-1`, and each `dp[j]` is updated to be the sum of the previous `dp[j - 1]` and the initial value of `dp[j]`, all `dp[j]` values are taken modulo 10; `i` is 2.**
