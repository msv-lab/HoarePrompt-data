According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from `f_max_n` to 1 in reverse order. At the end of the last iteration, we know the following:

- `n` is within the range 2 to \(10^6\)
- `f_max_n` is a positive integer greater than 0
- `MOD` is 10
- `dp[0]` is 1
- For all `j` from 2 to `f_max_n - 1`, `dp[j]` is the last digit of the cumulative sum of all integers from 1 to `j`
- `i` is 2
- `j` is `f_max_n - 2`
- `dp[j]` is incremented by `dp[j - 1]` and then taken modulo 10

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be decremented by 1 from its current value (`f_max_n - 2`). Therefore, `j` becomes `f_max_n - 3`.

Since the loop is decrementing `j` and will continue as long as `j` is greater than or equal to 0, no other state needs to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is within the range 2 to \(10^6\), `f_max_n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `MOD` is 10, `dp[0]` is 1, for all `j` from 2 to `f_max_n - 1`, `dp[j]` is the last digit of the cumulative sum of all integers from 1 to `j`, `i` is 2, `j` is `f_max_n - 3`, `dp[j]` is incremented by `dp[j - 1] and then taken modulo 10**
