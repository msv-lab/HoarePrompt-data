Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The problem requires calculating the number of permutations of integers \(1, 2, \ldots, n\) such that the function \(f(p)\) (which counts the number of distinct GCD values of the prefixes of the permutation) equals \(f_{max}(n)\), and printing this count modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

The program only handles the case when \(n = 2\) and sets the result to 1. For any \(n > 2\), it calls `func_1(n - 1, MOD)` which simply calculates the factorial of \(n-1\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This does not address the requirement of counting permutations based on the defined function \(f(p)\).

For example, consider \(n = 3\):
- The correct answer should be 4, as there are 4 permutations where \(f(p) = 2\): \([2, 1, 3]\), \([2, 3, 1]\), \([3, 2, 1]\), \([3, 1, 2]\).
- However, the program will output 2, since \(2! = 2\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\) is 2.

This clearly shows that the program does not meet the problem's requirements for \(n > 2\), making it incorrect.
