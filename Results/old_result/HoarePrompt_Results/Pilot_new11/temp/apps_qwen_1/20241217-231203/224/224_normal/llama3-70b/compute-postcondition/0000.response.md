The code `MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7` assigns the value of `10 ** 9 + 7` to the variable `MOD`. This does not affect the values of `n` or `f_max_n`. Therefore, the only changes are in the assignment to `MOD`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, `f_max_n` is an integer representing the maximum value of f(p) for permutations of length n, `MOD` is 10 ** 9 + 7.**
