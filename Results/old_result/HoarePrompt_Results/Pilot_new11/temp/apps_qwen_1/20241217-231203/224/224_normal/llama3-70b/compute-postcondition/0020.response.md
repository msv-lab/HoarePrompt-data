The code snippet `dp[j] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[j]` to be the remainder when `dp[j]` is divided by `MOD`. Given that `MOD` is 10, this means that `dp[j]` will now be the last digit of its original value.

From the initial state:
- `n` is within the range 2 to \(10^6\)
- `f_max_n` is a positive integer and greater than or equal to 1
- `MOD` is 10
- `dp[0]` is 1
- For all `j` from 2 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` is \((\text{sum}(j) + \text{sum}(j - 1) + dp[j - 1]) \% 10\)

Since the operation is applied to each `dp[j]` in the specified range, each `dp[j]` will now hold its last digit after performing the modulo operation.

Output State: **`n` is within the range 2 to \(10^6\); `f_max_n` is a positive integer and greater than or equal to 1; `MOD` is 10; `dp[0]` is 1; for all `j` from 2 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` is the last digit of \((\text{sum}(j) + \text{sum}(j - 1) + dp[j - 1])\).**
