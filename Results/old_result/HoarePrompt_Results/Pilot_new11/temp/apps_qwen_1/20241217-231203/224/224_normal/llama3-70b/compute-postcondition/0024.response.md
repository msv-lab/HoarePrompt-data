Output State: **`n` is within the range 2 to \(10^6\); `f_max_n` is a positive integer and greater than or equal to 1; `MOD` is 10; `dp[0]` is 1; for all `j` from 2 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` is the last digit of the cumulative sum of all integers from 1 to `j` plus the last digit of the cumulative sum of all integers from 1 to `j-1`, and each `dp[j]` is updated to be the sum of the previous `dp[j - 1]` and the initial value of `dp[j]`, all `dp[j]` values are taken modulo 10.**

### Explanation:
- **Initialization**: The initial state sets up the conditions for the variables `n`, `f_max_n`, `MOD`, `dp[0]`, and the initial values of `dp[j]` for `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`.
- **Loop Operation**: The loop runs in reverse order from `f_max_n` to 1. In each iteration, `dp[j]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[j - 1]` to itself and taking the result modulo 10.
- **Final State**: After the loop completes, `dp[j]` for all `j` from 2 to `f_max_n` will hold the last digit of the cumulative sum of all integers from 1 to `j` plus the last digit of the cumulative sum of all integers from 1 to `j-1`, and all these values are taken modulo 10.

This final state ensures that all `dp[j]` values reflect the cumulative sum operation and the modulo operation applied in each iteration of the loop.
