Output State: **`n` is within the range 2 to \(10^6\), `f_max_n` is a positive integer, `MOD` is 10, `dp[0]` is 1, for all `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` is the cumulative sum of all integers from 1 to `j` modulo 10.** 

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `dp` is initialized such that `dp[0] = 1` and all other elements are 0.
   - `f_max_n` is a positive integer, and `MOD` is 10.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs in reverse order from `f_max_n` down to 1.
   - For each iteration, `dp[j]` is updated by adding `dp[j - 1]` to it and taking the result modulo 10.

3. **Effect of Loop Iterations:**
   - After the first iteration (`j = f_max_n`), `dp[f_max_n]` becomes `f_max_n % 10`.
   - After the second iteration (`j = f_max_n - 1`), `dp[f_max_n - 1]` becomes `(dp[f_max_n - 1] + (f_max_n - 1) % 10) % 10`.
   - This continues until the last iteration where `dp[1]` is updated to include the sum of all previous `dp[j]` values modulo 10.

4. **Final State:**
   - By the end of the loop, each `dp[j]` (for `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`) will contain the cumulative sum of all integers from 1 to `j` modulo 10.
   - The `dp[0]` remains 1 as it is not updated by the loop.

This cumulative sum effect ensures that each `dp[j]` contains the sum of all integers from 1 to `j` modulo 10 after all iterations of the loop.
