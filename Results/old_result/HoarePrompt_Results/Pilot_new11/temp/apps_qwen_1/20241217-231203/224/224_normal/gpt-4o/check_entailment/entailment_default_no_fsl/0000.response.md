Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the problem description. The function `func_1` calculates the factorial of `n` modulo \(10^9 + 7\), which is not related to the problem's requirements. According to the problem description, we need to count the number of permutations \(p\) of integers \(1, 2, ..., n\) such that \(f(p)\) equals \(f_{max}(n)\). The function `func_1` does not address this requirement at all.

For example, when \(n = 3\), the maximum value of \(f(p)\) is 2. We need to count the number of permutations where \(f(p) = 2\), which are \([2, 1, 3]\), \([2, 3, 1]\), \([3, 1, 2]\), and \([3, 2, 1]\). The code incorrectly returns 6 instead of 4, as it calculates the factorial of \(n-1\) (which is 2 for \(n=3\)).

Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
