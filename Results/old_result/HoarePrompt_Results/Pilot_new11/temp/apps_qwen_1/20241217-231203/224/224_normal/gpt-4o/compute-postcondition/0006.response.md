The code updates the value of `result` by multiplying it with `i` (which is 4) and then taking the modulo with `mod`. Given the initial state where `result` is 6, `i` is 4, and `mod` is \(10^9 + 7\), the new value of `result` will be:

\[ \text{result} = (6 \times 4) \mod (10^9 + 7) = 24 \mod (10^9 + 7) = 24 \]

All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`result` is 24, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\), `mod` is \(10^9 + 7\), `i` is 4**
