Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate because the provided program does not implement the logic required to solve the problem. The function `func_1` calculates the factorial of \( n-1 \) modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \), which is unrelated to the task of counting permutations where \( f(p) \) equals \( f_{max}(n) \). The output hints confirm that the function correctly calculates the factorial modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \), but this calculation does not align with the problem requirements. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description and is incorrect.
