Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly implement the problem description. According to the problem description, the function `func_2` should calculate `f_max(n)`, which is the maximum value of `f(p)` for any permutation `p` of integers `1` to `n`. The function `func_3` should count the number of permutations `p` of integers `1` to `n` such that `f(p)` equals `f_max(n)`.

However, the current implementation of `func_3` does not correctly calculate the number of such permutations. The logic in `func_3` uses dynamic programming to accumulate sums, but it does not properly account for the structure of the problem. Specifically, it does not correctly handle the combinatorial aspect of counting permutations that achieve the maximum `f(p)` value.

For example, consider `n = 6`. The maximum value of `f(p)` is 3, as demonstrated by the permutation `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` or any permutation that maintains the GCD property up to the third element. The correct number of such permutations is 120, but the given code does not produce this result.

The key issue is that `func_3` does not correctly implement the combinatorial logic needed to count the permutations. It simply accumulates sums without properly considering the structure of the problem, leading to an incorrect result.
