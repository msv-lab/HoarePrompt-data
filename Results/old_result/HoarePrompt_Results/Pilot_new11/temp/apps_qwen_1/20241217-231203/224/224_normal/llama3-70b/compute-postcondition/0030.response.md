The code snippet `dp[j] += dp[j - 1]` increments `dp[j]` by `dp[j - 1]`. Given that `j` is `f_max_n - 2`, the value of `dp[j]` will be updated to the sum of `dp[j]` and `dp[j - 1]`.

Since `dp[0]` is initially 1, and for all `j` from 2 to `f_max_n - 1`, `dp[j]` is the last digit of the cumulative sum of all integers from 1 to `j`, the values of `dp[j]` and `dp[j - 1]` are already calculated and stored.

The specific values of `dp[j]` and `dp[j - 1]` depend on their previous state, which follows the pattern described. However, the exact numerical values are not specified, but we know the relationship between them. After the operation, `dp[j]` will hold the new value which is the sum of `dp[j]` and `dp[j - 1]`.

Given the initial conditions, the output state is:

- `n` is within the range 2 to \(10^6\)
- `f_max_n` is a positive integer greater than 0
- `MOD` is 10
- `dp[0]` is 1
- For all `j` from 2 to `f_max_n - 1`, `dp[j]` is the last digit of the cumulative sum of all integers from 1 to `j`
- `i` is 2
- `j` is `f_max_n - 2`
- `dp[j]` is incremented by `dp[j - 1]`

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`n` is within the range 2 to \(10^6\), `f_max_n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `MOD` is 10, `dp[0]` is 1, for all `j` from 2 to `f_max_n - 1`, `dp[j]` is the last digit of the cumulative sum of all integers from 1 to `j`, `i` is 2, `j` is `f_max_n - 2`, `dp[j]` is incremented by `dp[j - 1]`.**
