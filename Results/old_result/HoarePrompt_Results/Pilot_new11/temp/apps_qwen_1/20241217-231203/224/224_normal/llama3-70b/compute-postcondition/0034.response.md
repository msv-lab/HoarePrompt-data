The code snippet updates the value of `dp[j]` by taking it modulo `MOD`. Given that `dp[j]` is the last digit of the cumulative sum of all integers from 1 to `j-1`, and `dp[j - 1]` is the last digit of the cumulative sum of all integers from 1 to `j-2`, the operation `dp[j] %= MOD` essentially computes the last digit of the cumulative sum up to `j` by adding the last digit of the cumulative sum up to `j-1` and taking modulo 10.

Let's break this down step by step:

1. Initially, `dp[j]` is the last digit of the cumulative sum of all integers from 1 to `j-1`.
2. The operation `dp[j] %= MOD` updates `dp[j]` to be the last digit of `dp[j] + dp[j - 1]`.

Since `dp[j]` was already updated in the line before the given code (`dp[j] += dp[j - 1]`), this line just ensures that `dp[j]` is now correctly the last digit of the cumulative sum up to `j`.

Given the initial state and the operation, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is within the range 2 to \(10^6\), `f_max_n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `MOD` is 10, `dp[0]` is 1, for all `j` from 2 to `f_max_n - 1`, `dp[j]` is the last digit of the cumulative sum of all integers from 1 to `j`, `i` is 2, `j` is `f_max_n - 3`, `dp[j]` is the last digit of `dp[j] + dp[j - 1]` (modulo 10).**
