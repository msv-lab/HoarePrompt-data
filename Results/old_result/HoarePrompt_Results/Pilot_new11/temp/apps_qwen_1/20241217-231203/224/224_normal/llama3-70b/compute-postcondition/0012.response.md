The code snippet `dp[j] %= MOD` updates each `dp[j]` (for each `j` from 1 to `f_max_n - 1`) to its value modulo `MOD`, which is 10. This means each `dp[j]` will now be the remainder when `dp[j]` is divided by 10.

Given the initial conditions:
- `dp[0]` is 1.
- For each `j` from 1 to `f_max_n - 1`, `dp[j]` is updated to reflect the sum of the previous `dp[j - 1]` and `(j - 1) % 10`.

Let's consider the first few values to illustrate the pattern:
- Initially, `dp[1]` is `dp[0] + (0 % 10) = 1 + 0 = 1`.
- Then, `dp[2]` is `dp[1] + (1 % 10) = 1 + 1 = 2`.
- Continuing this pattern, `dp[3]` would be `dp[2] + (2 % 10) = 2 + 2 = 4`.

Since `dp[j] %= MOD` ensures that `dp[j]` is always between 0 and 9 (inclusive), any carry over from addition is handled by taking the modulus 10.

Therefore, the output state after executing the code is:
- `dp[0]` remains 1.
- Each `dp[j]` for `j` from 1 to `f_max_n - 1` is the value of `dp[j]` taken modulo 10.

Output State: **`dp[0]` is 1; for each `j` from 1 to `f_max_n - 1`, `dp[j]` is the value of `dp[j]` taken modulo 10**.
