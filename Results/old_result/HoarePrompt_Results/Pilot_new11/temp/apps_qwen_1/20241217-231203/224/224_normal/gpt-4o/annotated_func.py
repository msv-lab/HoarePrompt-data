#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, and mod is an integer representing 10^9 + 7.
def func_1(n, mod):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result = result * i % mod
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `result` is the factorial of `n` modulo \(10^9 + 7\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\), `mod` is \(10^9 + 7\), `i` is `n + 1` if the loop executed at least once.
    return result
    #The program returns the factorial of n modulo \(10^9 + 7\)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` (an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\)) and `mod` (an integer representing \(10^9 + 7\)). It calculates the factorial of `n` and returns the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The function iterates from 2 to `n`, multiplying each number to the `result` variable and taking modulo `mod` at each step to prevent overflow. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns the factorial of `n` modulo \(10^9 + 7\). Potential edge cases include when `n` is exactly 2 or 10^6, as these will still be within the defined range. There is no missing functionality noted based on the provided code and annotations.
