Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the required functionality. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` do not correctly compute the desired result. Specifically:

- `func_1` computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers, which is correct but not used for the main problem.
- `func_2` attempts to compute `f_max(n)` but does so incorrectly. It iterates through numbers from 1 to `n` and updates the result with the GCD of the current result and each number. However, this does not correctly compute the maximum number of distinct GCD values for any permutation of the array.
- `func_3` uses dynamic programming to count permutations but relies on the incorrect computation of `f_max(n)` from `func_2`.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to compute `f_max(n)` accurately and then use combinatorial methods to count permutations that achieve this maximum value. The current implementation does not meet these requirements.
