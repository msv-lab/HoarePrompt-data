You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Let's define a function $f(p)$ on a permutation $p$ as follows. Let $g_i$ be the greatest common divisor (GCD) of elements $p_1$, $p_2$, ..., $p_i$ (in other words, it is the GCD of the prefix of length $i$). Then $f(p)$ is the number of distinct elements among $g_1$, $g_2$, ..., $g_n$.

Let $f_{max}(n)$ be the maximum value of $f(p)$ among all permutations $p$ of integers $1$, $2$, ..., $n$.

Given an integers $n$, count the number of permutations $p$ of integers $1$, $2$, ..., $n$, such that $f(p)$ is equal to $f_{max}(n)$. Since the answer may be large, print the remainder of its division by $1000\,000\,007 = 10^9 + 7$.


-----Input-----

The only line contains the integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^6$) — the length of the permutations.


-----Output-----

The only line should contain your answer modulo $10^9+7$.

-----Note-----

Consider the second example: these are the permutations of length $3$:  $[1,2,3]$, $f(p)=1$.  $[1,3,2]$, $f(p)=1$.  $[2,1,3]$, $f(p)=2$.  $[2,3,1]$, $f(p)=2$.  $[3,1,2]$, $f(p)=2$.  $[3,2,1]$, $f(p)=2$. 

The maximum value $f_{max}(3) = 2$, and there are $4$ permutations $p$ such that $f(p)=2$.
Functions with output description for each function:
n = int(input())
f_max_n = func_2(n)
print(func_3(n, f_max_n))

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `a` and `b`, where `a` is greater than or equal to `b` and `b` is a positive integer. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. Specifically, it repeatedly replaces `a` with `b` and `b` with `a % b` until `b` becomes zero. At the end, `a` holds the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`, and `b` is set to zero. The function returns the value of `a`, which is the GCD of the original inputs.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(n):
    res = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        res = max(res, func_1(res, i))
    return res
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts an integer `n` where \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\) and returns the maximum value obtained by iteratively applying `func_1` starting from `func_1(0, 1)` up to `func_1(...(func_1(0, 1)...), n)`. After the function concludes, the program state includes `res` containing the maximum value calculated through these iterations, `i` set to `n`, and `n` remaining unchanged within its specified range. This process involves initializing `res` to 0 and then updating it within a loop that runs from 1 to `n`, where each iteration updates `res` with the result of `func_1(res, i)` if `func_1(res, i)` is greater than the current `res`.

The function handles the edge case where `n` is at its minimum value (2) by ensuring the loop still runs correctly. There are no explicitly mentioned missing functionalities based on the provided code, but it assumes `func_1` is defined and behaves as expected for the given inputs.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3(n, f_max_n):
    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
    dp = [0] * (f_max_n + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(f_max_n, 0, -1):
            dp[j] += dp[j - 1]
            dp[j] %= MOD
    return dp[f_max_n]
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `n` and `f_max_n`. `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, and `f_max_n` is an integer representing the maximum value of `f(p)` for permutations of length `n`. The function calculates and returns `dp[f_max_n]`, which is the cumulative sum of all integers from 1 to `f_max_n` modulo 10. 

After the function executes, the following state will be achieved:
- `dp` is an array of length `f_max_n + 1` initialized to 0, with `dp[0]` set to 1.
- For all `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` is the cumulative sum of all integers from 1 to `j` modulo 10.
- The function returns `dp[f_max_n]`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function assumes `n` is within the range 2 to \(10^6\) and `f_max_n` is a positive integer. If `f_max_n` is 0, the function will still initialize `dp[0]` to 1, but `dp[j]` for all `j > 0` will remain 0 since the loop will not execute. Thus, `dp[f_max_n]` would be 0 in this case.
- The function correctly handles the modulo operation to prevent overflow, ensuring the result is within the range 0 to 9.
- The function iterates over `j` in reverse order (from `f_max_n` to 1) in the inner loop, which is necessary to correctly compute the cumulative sums.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
