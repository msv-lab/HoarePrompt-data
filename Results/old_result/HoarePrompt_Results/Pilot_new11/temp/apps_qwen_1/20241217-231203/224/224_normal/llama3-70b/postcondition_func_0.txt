The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `a` and `b`, where `a` is greater than or equal to `b` and `b` is a positive integer. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. Specifically, it repeatedly replaces `a` with `b` and `b` with `a % b` until `b` becomes zero. At the end, `a` holds the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`, and `b` is set to zero. The function returns the value of `a`, which is the GCD of the original inputs.
