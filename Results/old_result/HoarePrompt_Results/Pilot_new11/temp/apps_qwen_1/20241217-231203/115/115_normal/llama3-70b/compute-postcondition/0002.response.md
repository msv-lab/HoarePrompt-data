The code initializes an empty list named `ops`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, or the matrix `A`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `m` is the second input integer, and `A` is the n Ã— m matrix where each element is either 0 or 1; `ops` is an empty list.**
