The code appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `ops`. However, since the initial state does not include the definition of `ops` and the values of `i` are not provided, we can only say that `ops` is a list (possibly empty) that now includes this new tuple. The values of `m` and `j` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` must be greater than 1; `j` is 0; `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 1; `j` is 0; `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`**
