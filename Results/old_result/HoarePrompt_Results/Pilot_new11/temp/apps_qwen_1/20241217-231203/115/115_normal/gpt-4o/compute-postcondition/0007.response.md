Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is at least 1. There exists a cell `A[i][j]` in a 2D array `A` such that the current value of `A[i][j]` is 1, the current value of `A[i][j + 1]` is 1, the current value of `A[i + 1][j]` is 1, and the current value of `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1. As a result, `B[i][j] = B[i][j + 1] = B[i + 1][j] = B[i + 1][j + 1] = 1`, and `operations` is a list containing the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1).`***
