The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. However, in this scenario, there is no loop present in the given code snippet, so the `continue` statement does not have any effect on the variables. The values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 1, `j` is 0, the elements `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all equal to 1.**
