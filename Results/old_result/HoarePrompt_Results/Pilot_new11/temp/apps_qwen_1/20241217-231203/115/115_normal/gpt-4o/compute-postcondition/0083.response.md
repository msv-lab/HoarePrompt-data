Output State: **`m` is a positive integer, `j` is `m-1`. If for any `j` in the range of `m`, `A[i][j]` is not equal to `B[i][j]`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, the function returns 0.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initial Conditions and Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = m-1`.
   - For each iteration, it checks if `A[i][j]` is not equal to `B[i][j]`.
   - If any such pair `(A[i][j], B[i][j])` is found to be unequal, the function immediately returns `-1`.

2. **Final State Analysis**:
   - If the loop completes all its iterations (i.e., `j` goes from `0` to `m-1`) without finding any unequal pairs, the function returns `0`.
   - This implies that for all `j` in the range `0` to `m-1`, the condition `A[i][j] == B[i][j]` holds true.

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop must execute at least once for `m > 0`.
   - After executing `m` times, `j` will be `m-1`.

4. **No Return Before Completion**:
   - If the function does not return `-1` during the loop, it means all elements in the corresponding row of matrices `A` and `B` match, leading to a final return value of `0`.

Thus, the final state indicates whether there was any mismatch between the corresponding elements of `A[i][j]` and `B[i][j]` for all `j` in the range `0` to `m-1`.
