Postcondition: **`A` is a 2D list of integers, `B` is a 2D list of integers. If `A[i][j] == 1` and `A[i][j + 1] == 1` and `A[i + 1][j] == 1` and `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1`, then `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` are 1, and `operations` is a list containing a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` appended to it. Otherwise, the state of `B` remains unchanged.**
