According to the code, the loop depends on the variable `j`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `m - 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `m` must be greater than 1.
- The 2D list `A` has specific elements that are all equal to 1.
- `ops` is either a list containing the elements \((i+1, j+1)\) and \((i+1, j+1)\) or an empty list based on certain conditions.
- `j` is \(m - 1\).

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it \(m - 1 + 1 = m - 0 = m - 1\). However, since the loop runs until `j < m - 1`, we need to ensure that `j` is less than `m - 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `m` must still be greater than 1.
- The 2D list `A` remains unchanged with the specified elements.
- `ops` remains the same as per the previous iteration's conditions.
- `j` must now be \(m - 2\).

State: **`m` must be greater than 1; the 2D list `A` has the elements \(A[i][j]\), \(A[i+1][j]\), \(A[i][j+1]\), and \(A[i+1][j+1]\) all equal to 1; `ops` is a list containing the elements \((i+1, j+1)\) and \((i+1, j+1)\) or an empty list; `j` is \(m - 2\)**.
