The code snippet prints the length of the `operations` list. Since the length of the `operations` list does not change during the execution of the provided code, the only impact is the print statement which outputs the length of `operations`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 2 and 50, `m` is a positive integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, `B` is a 2D list of size `n` by `m` where each element is 0, `operations` is a list of tuples, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-1`, and the value of `print(len(operations))` is executed.**
