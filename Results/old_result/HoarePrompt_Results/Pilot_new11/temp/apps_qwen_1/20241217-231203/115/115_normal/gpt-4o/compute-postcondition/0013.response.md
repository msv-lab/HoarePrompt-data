The code initializes four elements in a 2D array `B` at indices `[i][j]`, `[i][j + 1]`, `[i + 1][j]`, and `[i + 1][j + 1]` to the value `1`. The initial state is that `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `m` is at least 1, `i` is an index in the 2D array, and `j` is `0`.

After executing the code, the specified elements of the 2D array `B` are set to `1`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `i` remain unchanged, and `j` is updated to `1` since it was incremented.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `m` is at least 1, `i` is an index in the 2D array, `j` is 1, and the elements `B[i][0]`, `B[i][1]`, `B[i + 1][0]`, and `B[i + 1][1]` are set to 1.**
