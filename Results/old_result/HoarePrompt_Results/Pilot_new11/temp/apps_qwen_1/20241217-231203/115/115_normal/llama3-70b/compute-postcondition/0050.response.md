The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or change the state of the program. The variables `m` and `j` retain their initial values.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 1, `j` is 1**
