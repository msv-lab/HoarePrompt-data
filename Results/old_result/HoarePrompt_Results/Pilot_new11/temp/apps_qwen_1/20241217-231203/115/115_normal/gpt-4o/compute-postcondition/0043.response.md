The code assigns the value 1 to four elements in the 2D list `B`. The specific indices used are `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]`. The variable `j` is updated to `previous_j + 1`.

The initial state is:
- `A` is a 2D list of integers
- `B` is a 2D list of integers
- `j` is `previous_j + 1`

After executing the code, the following changes occur:
- `B[i][j]` is set to 1
- `B[i][j + 1]` is set to 1
- `B[i + 1][j]` is set to 1
- `B[i + 1][j + 1]` is set to 1
- `j` is updated to `previous_j + 1`

The output state is:
Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers, `B` is a 2D list of integers where B[i][j], B[i][j + 1], B[i + 1][j], and B[i + 1][j + 1] are 1, and j is previous_j + 1**.
