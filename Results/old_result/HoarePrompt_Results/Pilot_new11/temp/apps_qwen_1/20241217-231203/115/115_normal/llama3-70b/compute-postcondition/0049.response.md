Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know that `m` must be greater than 1, and `j` is 0. The conditions `A[i][j] == 1`, `A[i + 1][j] == 1`, `A[i][j + 1] == 1`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1` are preserved if they were true.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `j` in the range from 0 to `m - 2`. This means `j` will be incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, and the loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `m - 1`.

3. **Current Values**: At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 (since the loop just started).

4. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 1 (since the loop will check `j < m - 1`).

5. **State Adjustment**: Since `j` will be incremented to 1, and `m` must remain greater than 1 (as it is a condition that does not change within the loop), we need to adjust the state accordingly.

**Final State**:
- `m` must still be greater than 1.
- `j` will be 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:
State: **`m` must be greater than 1, `j` is 1**.
