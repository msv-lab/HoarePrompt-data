Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
   - `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 50.
   - `m` is a positive integer between 2 and 50.
   - `A` is a 2D list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1.
   - `B` is a 2D list of size `n` by `m` where each element is 0.
   - `operations` is a list of tuples.
   - `i` is in the range [0, `n-1`].
   - `m` must be at least 1.
   - If `A[i][j] != B[i][j]`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, the function continues without returning a value.

2. **Loop Context**: The for loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `m-1`.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `m`.

4. **Adjusting States for Next Iteration**:
   - `i` remains unchanged since it does not depend on the loop variable `j`.
   - `m` remains unchanged since it is an upper bound and does not change within the loop.
   - `A` and `B` lists remain unchanged unless modified inside the loop, but there's no indication of such modifications.
   - `operations` remains unchanged.
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `m`.

Given that `j` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `m`.

Since `j` is the loop variable and it will increment by 1 in each iteration, the condition for the next iteration is `j < m`. Therefore, `j` will be incremented to `j + 1` and must still be less than `m`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` remains in the range [0, `n-1`].
- `m` remains a positive integer between 2 and 50.
- `A` and `B` remain unchanged.
- `operations` remains unchanged.
- `j` is now `j + 1` and must be less than `m`.

However, since `m` itself doesn't change and `j` is just incremented, we only need to ensure that `j + 1 < m` for the loop to continue.

State: **`n` is a positive integer between 2 and 50, `m` is a positive integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, `B` is a 2D list of size `n` by `m` where each element is 0, `operations` is a list of tuples, `i` is in the range [0, `n-1`], `j` is less than `m`, and `m` must be at least 1**.
