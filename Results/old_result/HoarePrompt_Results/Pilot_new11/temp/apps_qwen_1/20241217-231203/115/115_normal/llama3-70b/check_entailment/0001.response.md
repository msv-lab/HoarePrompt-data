Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to ensure that the operations it performs will transform matrix \( B \) into matrix \( A \) for certain configurations of \( A \).

Consider the following input:

```
3 3
1 0 1
0 0 0
1 0 1
```

The program should output a sequence of operations that transforms \( B \) into \( A \), but it does not handle this case correctly. Hereâ€™s why:

- The program checks if all four elements in a \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrix are 1 before skipping an operation. However, it does not account for scenarios where only some elements are 1, which means the program might miss necessary operations.
- The program simply appends operations whenever it finds a 1 in any of the four positions of a \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrix without ensuring that the final state of \( B \) matches \( A \) perfectly.

In the given example, the program would append operations for the first and third columns but fail to correctly transform the middle column. This results in an incorrect transformation and hence the program is incorrect for this input.
