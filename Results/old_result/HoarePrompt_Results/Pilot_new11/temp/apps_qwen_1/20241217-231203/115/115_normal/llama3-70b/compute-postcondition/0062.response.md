The code snippet prints `-1`. This operation does not affect any variable values or the initial conditions of the variables. Therefore, the only change is the output of `-1`.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 1, `ops` is a list containing all valid tuples `(i+1, j+1)` for which at least one of the conditions `A[i][j] == 1`, `A[i + 1][j] == 1`, `A[i][j + 1] == 1`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1` is true, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-1`, and the length of `ops` is greater than 2500, and the output is `-1`**.
