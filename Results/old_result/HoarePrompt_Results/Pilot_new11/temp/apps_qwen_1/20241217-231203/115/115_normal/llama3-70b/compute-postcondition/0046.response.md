Postcondition: **`m` must be greater than 1, `j` is 0. If the conditions `A[i][j] == 1`, `A[i + 1][j] == 1`, `A[i][j + 1] == 1`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1` are met, then these conditions are preserved. Otherwise, no changes are made to `m` and `j`. The current value of the condition is either `A[i][j] == 1` or `A[i + 1][j] == 1` or `A[i][j + 1] == 1` or `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1`.**
