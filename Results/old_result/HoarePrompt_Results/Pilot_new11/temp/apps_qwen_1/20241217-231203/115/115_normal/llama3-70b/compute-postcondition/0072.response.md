Postcondition: ***`m` is greater than 1, `ops` is a list containing all valid tuples `(i+1, j+1)` for which at least one of the conditions `A[i][j] == 1`, `A[i + 1][j] == 1`, `A[i][j + 1] == 1`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1` is true, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-1`. If the length of `ops` is greater than 2500, the output is `-1`. Otherwise, all elements of `ops` are printed.***
