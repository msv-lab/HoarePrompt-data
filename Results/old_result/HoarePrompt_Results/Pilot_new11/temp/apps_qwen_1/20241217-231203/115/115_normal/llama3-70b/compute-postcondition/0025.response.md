The code `continue` does not change any variable values or perform any operations. It simply skips to the next iteration of the loop (if in a loop context) without affecting the current values of the variables. Given that no changes occur due to the `continue` statement, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 1; A is a 2D list where the elements A[i][j], A[i+1][j], A[i][j+1], and A[i+1][j+1] are all equal to 1.**
