The code snippet `B[i][j] = B[i][j + 1] = B[i + 1][j] = B[i + 1][j + 1] = 1` does not change the values of `n`, `m`, or `operations`. It only modifies the elements of the 2D array `B`. Given that initially, `B[i][j] = B[i][j + 1] = B[i + 1][j] = B[i + 1][j + 1] = 1`, the code does not change these values because they are already set to 1.

The output state remains the same as the initial state, since no new assignments or operations that affect the mentioned variables are performed.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is at least 1, there exists a cell `A[i][j]` in a 2D array `A` such that `A[i][j] = A[i][j + 1] = A[i + 1][j] = A[i + 1][j + 1] = 1`, and `B[i][j] = B[i][j + 1] = B[i + 1][j] = B[i + 1][j + 1] = 1`, and `operations` is a list containing the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`; additionally, `j` is now `m - 1`.**
