The code `print(len(ops))` prints the length of the list `ops`. The length of `ops` is already determined in the initial state, and printing it does not change its value or any other variables. Therefore, the length of `ops` remains the same after executing the code.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 1, `ops` is a list containing all valid tuples `(i+1, j+1)` for which at least one of the conditions `A[i][j] == 1`, `A[i + 1][j] == 1`, `A[i][j + 1] == 1`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1` is true, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-1`, and the length of `ops` is less than or equal to 2500; the length of `ops` is printed.**
