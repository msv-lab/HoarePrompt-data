Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is at least 1, `i` is an index in the 2D array, `j` is `m - 1`. If `A[i][j] = A[i][j + 1] = A[i + 1][j] = A[i + 1][j + 1] = 1` and `B[i][j] = B[i][j + 1] = B[i + 1][j] = B[i + 1][j + 1] = 1`, then `operations` is a list containing the tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` and `(i + 1, m)`. Since there is no else part, this condition remains unchanged if the if condition is not met.***
