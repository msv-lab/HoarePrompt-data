Postcondition: ***`m` must be greater than 2, `j` is 2, and `i` is unknown. If the condition `A[i][j] == 1 or A[i + 1][j] == 1 or A[i][j + 1] == 1 or (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1)` is true, then the state remains unchanged. Since there is no else part, the state does not change if the condition is false.***
