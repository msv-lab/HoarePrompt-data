Postcondition: ***`A` is a 2D list of integers, `B` is a 2D list of integers, `i` is some index, `j` is 0. If the conditions `A[i][j] == 1 and A[i][j + 1] == 1 and (A[i + 1][j] == 1) and (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1)` are met, then `B[i][0]` is set to 1, `B[i][1]` is set to 1, `B[i + 1][0]` is set to 1, `B[i + 1][1]` is set to 1, and `operations` contains the tuple `(i + 1, 1)`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `B` and `operations` remains unchanged.***
