According to the code, the loop variable `j` ranges from `0` to `m-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `m` must be greater than 2, `j` is 1, and `i` is unknown.

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `2`. The condition inside the loop checks if any of the adjacent elements in the matrix `A` are equal to 1. If they are, the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` is added to the list `ops`.

Since the value of `j` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `j` should become 2. Therefore, we do not need to change the value of `m` or the value of `i` unless additional conditions within the loop body affect it. However, since no specific action is mentioned regarding `i` within this loop, we assume `i` remains unknown.

State: **`m` must be greater than 2, `j` is 2, and `i` is unknown.**
