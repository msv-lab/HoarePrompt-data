The code `min_speed = min(min_speed + d, max_speed)` updates `min_speed` to be the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`. According to the initial state, `max_speed` is defined as the maximum of `max_speed - d` and `min_speed`, and `min_speed` is defined as the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`. 

Let's denote the initial values of `max_speed` and `min_speed` as follows:
- `max_speed = max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`
- `min_speed = min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`

After executing the line `min_speed = min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`, `min_speed` is updated to be the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`. Given the definitions, this means that `min_speed` will take the value of `min_speed + d` if `min_speed + d` is less than or equal to `max_speed`, or `min_speed` if `min_speed + d` is greater than `max_speed`.

Since `max_speed` is the maximum of `max_speed - d` and `min_speed`, and `min_speed` is the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`, the new `min_speed` will be consistent with these relationships.

Therefore, the output state is:

**`v1` is an integer between 1 and 100, `v2` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is at least 2, `d` is an integer between 0 and 10, `max_speed` is the maximum of `max_speed - d` and `min_speed`, `min_speed` is the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`, `min_length` is `min_speed * t + 2 * min_speed`, `max_length` is incremented by `max_speed` twice, `i` is 2**
