Output State: **`v1` is an integer between 1 and 100, `v2` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is at least 2, `d` is an integer between 0 and 10, `max_speed` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2 - (t-1) * d` if `v1` and `v2 - (t-1) * d` is greater than or equal to the minimum of `v1` and `v2`, else `max_speed` is the minimum of `v1` and `v2`, `min_speed` is the minimum of `min_speed + (t-1) * d` and `max_speed`, `min_length` is `(t + (t-1)) * min_speed`, `max_length` is incremented by `max_speed` exactly `t-1` times.**

Explanation:
1. **Loop Initialization**: The loop starts with `i` set to `t-1` and decrements `i` until it reaches `0`. This means the loop will run `t-1` times.
2. **Speed Calculation**:
   - At each iteration, `max_speed` is updated to be the maximum of `max_speed - d` and `min_speed`. This ensures that `max_speed` never falls below `min_speed`.
   - `min_speed` is updated to be the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`. This ensures that `min_speed` does not exceed `max_speed`.
3. **Accumulation**:
   - `max_length` is incremented by `max_speed` in each iteration, so after `t-1` iterations, `max_length` is incremented by `max_speed` exactly `t-1` times.
   - `min_length` accumulates the value of `min_speed` in each iteration. Since the loop runs `t-1` times, `min_length` becomes `(t + (t-1)) * min_speed`.

Given these observations, the final state after the loop completes will reflect the above conditions.
