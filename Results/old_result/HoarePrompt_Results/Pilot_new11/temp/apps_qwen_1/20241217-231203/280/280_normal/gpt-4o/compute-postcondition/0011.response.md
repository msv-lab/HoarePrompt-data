Output State: **`v1` is `a`, `v2` is `b`, `t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `d` is the second integer input, `speeds` is a list of length `t` where the first element is `a` and the last element is `b`, and each element `speeds[i]` for `1 â‰¤ i < t` is calculated as `min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)`.**
