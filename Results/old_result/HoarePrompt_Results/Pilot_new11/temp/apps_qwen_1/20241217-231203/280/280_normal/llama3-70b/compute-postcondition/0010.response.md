`min_length` is incremented by `min_speed`. The initial value of `min_length` is `min_speed * t`. After adding `min_speed` to `min_length`, the new value of `min_length` becomes `min_speed * t + min_speed`.

The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`v1` is an integer between 1 and 100; `v2` is an integer between 1 and 100; `t` is at least 2; `d` is an integer between 0 and 10; `max_speed` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2 - d` if `v1` and `v2 - d` is greater than or equal to the minimum of `v1` and `v2`, else `max_speed` is the minimum of `v1` and `v2`; `min_speed` is the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`; `min_length` is `min_speed * t + min_speed`; `max_length` is incremented by `max_speed`.**
