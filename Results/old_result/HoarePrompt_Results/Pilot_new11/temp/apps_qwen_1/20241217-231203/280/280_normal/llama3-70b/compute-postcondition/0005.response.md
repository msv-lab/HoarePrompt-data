The code assigns `min_length` the value of `min_speed * t`. The previous values of `v1`, `v2`, `t`, `d`, `max_speed`, and `min_speed` remain unchanged. The output state should reflect these unchanged values and the new assignment to `min_length`.

Output State: **`v1` is an integer (1 ≤ v1 ≤ 100), `v2` is an integer (1 ≤ v2 ≤ 100); `t` is an integer (2 ≤ t ≤ 100); `d` is an integer (0 ≤ d ≤ 10); `max_speed` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2`; `min_speed` is the minimum of `v1` and `v2`; `min_length` is `min_speed * t`.**
