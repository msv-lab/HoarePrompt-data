The code `max_length += max_speed` increments the value of `max_length` by `max_speed`. Based on the initial state, `max_length` is already incremented by `max_speed` in the initial state. Therefore, `max_length` will be incremented by `max_speed` again.

Output State: **`v1` is an integer between 1 and 100; `v2` is an integer between 1 and 100; `t` is at least 2; `d` is an integer between 0 and 10; `max_speed` is the maximum of `max_speed - d` and `min_speed`; `min_speed` is the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`; `min_length` is `min_speed * t + min_speed`; `max_length` is incremented by `max_speed` twice; `i` is 2**
