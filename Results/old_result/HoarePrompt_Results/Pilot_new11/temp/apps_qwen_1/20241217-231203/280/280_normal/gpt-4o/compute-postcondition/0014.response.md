The function `func` accepts four parameters: `v_1` and `v_2` which are integers such that \(1 \leq v_1, v_2 \leq 100\), `t` which is an integer such that \(2 \leq t \leq 100\), and `d` which is an integer such that \(0 \leq d \leq 10\). The function does not return a value directly from the provided information, but rather we need to consider the possible outputs based on the given cases.

However, since no specific return values or conditions leading to different outputs are provided in the format of the example, we assume the function returns a value based on some internal logic not specified here. Given the structure, we can only describe the input parameters.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept four parameters: `v_1` and `v_2` as integers within the range [1, 100], `t` as an integer within the range [2, 100], and `d` as an integer within the range [0, 10].
