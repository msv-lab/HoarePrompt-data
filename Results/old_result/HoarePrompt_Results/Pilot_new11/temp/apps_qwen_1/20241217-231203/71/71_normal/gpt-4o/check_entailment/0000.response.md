Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle cases where the number `n` ends with fewer than `k` zeros. For example, consider the input `100020 3`. According to the problem description, the output should be `2`, as we can remove the last two digits (`02`) to get `1000`, which is divisible by \(10^3 = 1000\). However, the program will count all non-zero digits before encountering three zeros, resulting in an incorrect output.

Here is a counterexample:
- **Input**: `100020 3`
- **Expected Output**: `2`
- **Actual Output**: The program will count all non-zero digits, resulting in an output of `5`.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle cases where the number of trailing zeros is less than `k`, making it incorrect.
