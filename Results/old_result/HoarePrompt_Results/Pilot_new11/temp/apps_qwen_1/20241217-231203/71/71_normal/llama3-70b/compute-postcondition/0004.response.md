The code `n //= 10` divides `n` by 10 and assigns the quotient back to `n`. Since `n` is an input integer that is not divisible by \(10^k\) (where `k` is another input integer), the value of `n` after performing the division will no longer be divisible by \(10^k\). The variable `w` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is `n // 10`, `w` is 1, `n` is not divisible by \(10^k\)**
