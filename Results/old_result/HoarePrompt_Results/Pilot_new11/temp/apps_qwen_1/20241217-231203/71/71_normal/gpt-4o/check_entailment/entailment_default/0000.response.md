Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem for every potential case. Specifically, the code attempts to count the number of zeros from the end of the number and then assumes that the remaining digits need to be removed. However, this approach fails to consider cases where there are fewer than `k` zeros but the number can still be made divisible by \(10^k\) by removing other digits.

For example, consider the input `10203049 2`. According to the problem description, we need to remove the minimum number of digits to make the number divisible by \(10^2 = 100\). The correct solution involves removing the digits `1`, `2`, and `9`, resulting in `00304`, which is divisible by 100. However, the provided code would incorrectly count the zeros and remove more digits than necessary.

Here is a counterexample:
- **Input**: `10203049 2`
- **Expected Output**: `3` (remove `1`, `2`, and `9`)
- **Actual Output**: The code would remove more digits and produce an incorrect result.

Thus, the code does not handle all cases correctly and is therefore incorrect.
