The code `print(to_remove)` simply prints the value of `to_remove` without changing its value. The values of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `count_zeros`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string, `k` is a non-negative integer, `count_zeros` equals `k`, `to_remove` is the number of digits in `n` that have not been processed when the loop breaks or 0 if the loop does not execute, the value of `to_remove` is printed**
