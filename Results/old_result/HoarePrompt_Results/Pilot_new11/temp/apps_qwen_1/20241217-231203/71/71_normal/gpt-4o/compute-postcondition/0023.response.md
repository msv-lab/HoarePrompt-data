The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or the most nested block it is inside. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block that the `break` statement is explicitly inside, it simply exits the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. However, since no loops or conditions are mentioned in the initial state, the `break` statement here does not affect any variables.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State:

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is the count of zeros in `n` up to the current position either incremented by 1 if the current digit is '0', or remains the same if the current digit is not '0'; `to_remove` is the number of digits not yet processed, either decremented by 1 if the current digit is not '0', or remains the same if the current digit is '0', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
