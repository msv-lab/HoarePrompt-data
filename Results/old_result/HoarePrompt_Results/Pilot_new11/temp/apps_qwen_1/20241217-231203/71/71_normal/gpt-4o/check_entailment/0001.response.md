Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the number `n` itself is already divisible by \(10^k\). In such a scenario, no digits need to be removed, but the current implementation incorrectly prints the length of the number minus one (`len(n) - 1`) instead of zero.

To fix this, we should check if the number `n` is already divisible by \(10^k\) before entering the loop to count zeros. If it is, we should print `0` immediately. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(str, input().split())
    k = int(k)
    count_zeros = 0
    to_remove = 0
    # Check if the number is already divisible by 10^k
    if int(n) % (10 ** k) == 0:
        print(0)
        return
    
    for digit in reversed(n):
        if digit == '0':
            count_zeros += 1
        else:
            to_remove += 1
        if count_zeros == k:
            break
    if count_zeros == k:
        print(to_remove)
    else:
        print(len(n) - 1)

func()
```

This version correctly handles the case where the number is already divisible by \(10^k\) and prints `0` in that scenario.
