`w` is incremented by 1, so its new value is the original value of `w` plus 1. The condition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 10 remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is equal to its original value plus 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 10.

Output State: **`w` is equal to its original value plus 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 10**
