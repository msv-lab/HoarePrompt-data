Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is the count of zeros in `n` up to the current position, and `to_remove` is the number of digits not yet processed. If the current digit is '0', `count_zeros` is incremented and `to_remove` is decremented. If the current digit is not '0', `to_remove` is decremented.***
