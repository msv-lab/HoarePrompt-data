The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or the most nested block it is within. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block indicated, the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that we are breaking out of the most internal loop or block. The values of the variables remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is the count of zeros in `n` up to the current position, and `to_remove` is the number of digits not yet processed. We break out of the most internal loop or block.**
