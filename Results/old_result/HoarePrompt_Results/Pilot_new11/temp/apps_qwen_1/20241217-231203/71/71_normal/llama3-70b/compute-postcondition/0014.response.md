Functionality: **The function `func` accepts two parameters `n` (a non-negative integer where \(0 \leq n \leq 2,000,000,000\)) and `k` (a positive integer where \(1 \leq k \leq 9\)). It performs a series of operations to determine the number of times `n` needs to be divided by 10 until it becomes divisible by \(10^k\). After the loop, the function prints the count of divisions performed (`w`). The final state of the program is such that `n` is guaranteed to be divisible by \(10^k\), and the function does not return any value; instead, it prints the count of divisions required.**

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The annotation incorrectly states that the function returns a boolean value (`True` or `False`), but the actual function does not return anything. Instead, it prints the count of divisions required.
- If `n` is already divisible by \(10^k\), the loop will not execute, and `w` will remain 0. This case is handled correctly by the code.
