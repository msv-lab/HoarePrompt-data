Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is the count of zeros in `n` up to the current position either incremented by 1 if the current digit is '0', or remains the same if the current digit is not '0'; `to_remove` is the number of digits not yet processed, either decremented by 1 if the current digit is not '0', or remains the same if the current digit is '0'. If `count_zeros` equals `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
