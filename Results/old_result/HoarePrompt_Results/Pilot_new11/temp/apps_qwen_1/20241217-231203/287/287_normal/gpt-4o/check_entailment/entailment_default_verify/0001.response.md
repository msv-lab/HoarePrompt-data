Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` indeed counts the number of divisors of `num`, which is not relevant to finding the number of different weights of splits of `n`. The output hints confirm that the function returns the count of divisors, which is not aligned with the problem requirements. Therefore, the program fails to meet the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
