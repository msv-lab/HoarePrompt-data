`n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `n` now holds the integer value input by the user. The lower bound (1) and upper bound (10^9) constraints for `n` are preserved since the input is converted to an integer and must fall within these bounds.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user and is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive.**
