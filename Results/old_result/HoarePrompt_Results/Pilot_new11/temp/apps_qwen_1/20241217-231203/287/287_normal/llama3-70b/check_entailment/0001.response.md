Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to count the number of divisors of `n` (excluding 1 and `n` itself) to determine the number of different weights of its splits. However, this approach is incorrect because the number of different weights of splits of `n` is actually `n` itself.

To understand why, consider the following:
- For any integer `n`, you can always create a split with weight `n` using `[n]`.
- You can also create a split with weight `n-1` using `[k, k, ..., k, 1]` where `n = k * (n-1) + 1`.
- This pattern continues until you reach a weight of 1, which can be represented as `[1, 1, ..., 1]` (n times).

Therefore, the number of different weights is `n`.

The given program does not handle this logic correctly. It instead tries to count divisors of `n`, which is not related to the number of different weights of splits.

A correct implementation would simply print `n`.
