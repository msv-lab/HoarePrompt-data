Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem asks for the number of different weights of splits of a given integer \( n \). However, the annotated program calculates the number of divisors of \( n \) instead. 

To illustrate, let's analyze the problem and the program:

1. **Problem Description**: 
   - A split of \( n \) is a nonincreasing sequence of positive integers whose sum is \( n \).
   - The weight of a split is defined as the number of elements in the split that are equal to the first element.
   - We need to find the number of different weights of all possible splits of \( n \).

2. **Annotated Program**:
   - The program reads an integer \( n \).
   - It calls a function `func_1` with \( n \) as the argument.
   - The function `func_1` calculates the number of divisors of \( n \) and returns this count.

### Example Analysis:

- **Example Input**: \( n = 7 \)
  - **Expected Output**: According to the problem description, the weights of the splits of 7 are 1, 2, 3, and 7. Therefore, the expected output should be 4.
  - **Actual Output**: The program calculates the number of divisors of 7, which are 1 and 7. Thus, the output is 2.

- **Example Input**: \( n = 8 \)
  - **Expected Output**: The weights of the splits of 8 are 1, 2, 4, and 8. Therefore, the expected output should be 4.
  - **Actual Output**: The program calculates the number of divisors of 8, which are 1, 2, and 4. Thus, the output is 3.

- **Example Input**: \( n = 9 \)
  - **Expected Output**: The weights of the splits of 9 are 1, 3, and 9. Therefore, the expected output should be 3.
  - **Actual Output**: The program calculates the number of divisors of 9, which are 1 and 3. Thus, the output is 2.

From these examples, it is clear that the program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Instead of calculating the number of different weights of splits, it incorrectly counts the number of divisors of \( n \).

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
