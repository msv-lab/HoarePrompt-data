The initial state is that `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, and `res` is 1 because there exists an integer `i` such that `n % i == 0` and `i * i == n`, and `i` is 2. This means that `n` is a perfect square and `i` is its square root, which is 2 in this case, making `n` equal to 4. The code snippet updates `res` by adding 2 to its current value.

Since `res` initially is 1, after executing `res += 2`, the new value of `res` will be `1 + 2`, which is 3. The value of `n` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it.

Output State: **`n` is 4, `res` is 3**
