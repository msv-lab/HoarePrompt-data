The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Given the initial state, `i` starts at 1, and `count` is either 1 or 2 depending on the conditions specified. Since the code only modifies `i`, the value of `count` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`num` is an integer such that 1 <= num <= 10^9, `count` is 1 or 2 depending on whether `i` (which starts at 1) is a divisor of `num`, and `i` is 2.**
