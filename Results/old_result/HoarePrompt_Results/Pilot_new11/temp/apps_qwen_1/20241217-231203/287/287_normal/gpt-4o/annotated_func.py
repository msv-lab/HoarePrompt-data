#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is an integer such that 1 <= num <= 10^9.
def func_1(num):
    count = 0
    i = 1
    while i * i <= num:
        if num % i == 0:
            count += 1
            if i != num // i:
                count += 1
        
        i += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 10^9\), `count` is the number of divisors of `num`, and `i` is the smallest integer such that `i * i > num`.
    return count
    #`The program returns count, which is the number of divisors of num`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `num` within the range [1, 10^9] and returns the count of its divisors. It achieves this by initializing a counter `count` to zero and an index `i` to 1. The function then iterates through values of `i` starting from 1 up to the square root of `num`. For each value of `i`, if `i` divides `num` without a remainder, it increments the `count` by 1. If `i` is not equal to `num // i`, it also increments the `count` by 1 to account for the corresponding divisor greater than `i`. After the loop completes, the function returns the total count of divisors. Potential edge cases include when `num` is a perfect square, where the square root of `num` would be counted twice unless handled properly, but the code correctly handles this by ensuring `i` is not equal to `num // i`.
