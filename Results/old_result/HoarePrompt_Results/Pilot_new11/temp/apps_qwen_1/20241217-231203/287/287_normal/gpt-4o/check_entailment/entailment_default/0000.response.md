Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code attempts to count the number of divisors of the input number `n`, but the problem description asks for the number of different weights of splits of `n`. The code does not address the problem requirements at all. Specifically, the code does not generate splits of `n` or calculate their weights. Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
