Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem. The function `func_1` calculates the number of divisors of a given number `num`, but the problem requires finding the number of different weights of splits of `n`. The weights of splits are essentially the number of parts that are equal to the first element in the split, which ranges from 1 to `n` inclusive. Therefore, for any given `n`, the number of different weights of its splits is `n`.

The code should directly output `n` as the result, but instead, it calculates the number of divisors of `n`. This approach is incorrect because the number of divisors does not correspond to the number of different weights of splits.

For example, if the input is `7`, the correct output should be `7`, as the weights of the splits of `7` can be `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7`. However, the code outputs the number of divisors of `7`, which is `2` (since `7` is a prime number). This shows that the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
