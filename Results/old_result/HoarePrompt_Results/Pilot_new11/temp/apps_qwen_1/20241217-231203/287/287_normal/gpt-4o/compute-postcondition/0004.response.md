`count` is incremented by 1, which means the value of `count` is now 1 more than its previous value. The variables `num`, `i`, and their current relationship (where `i` is a divisor of `num`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `num` is an integer such that 1 <= num <= 10^9, `count` is 1, `i` is 1, and the current value of `i` is a divisor of `num`.

Output State: **`num` is an integer such that 1 <= num <= 10^9, `count` is 1, `i` is 1, and the current value of `i` is a divisor of `num`.**
