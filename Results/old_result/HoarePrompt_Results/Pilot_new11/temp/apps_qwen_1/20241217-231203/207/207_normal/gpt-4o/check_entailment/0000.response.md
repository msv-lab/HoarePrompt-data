Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to find \( f(i) \) for each \( i \) from 0 to \( m \). Specifically, the function `func_2` does not accurately calculate the number of distinct integers the frog can reach for each \( i \).

Let's consider the following cases:

1. **Case 1: \( m = 7, a = 5, b = 3 \)**

   According to the problem, we need to compute \( f(0) + f(1) + \ldots + f(7) \).
   - \( f(0) = 1 \) (the only reachable position is 0)
   - \( f(1) = 1 \) (the only reachable position is 1)
   - \( f(2) = 1 \) (the only reachable position is 2)
   - \( f(3) = 1 \) (the only reachable position is 3)
   - \( f(4) = 1 \) (the only reachable position is 4)
   - \( f(5) = 3 \) (reachable positions are 5, 0, and -5 but since we restrict to [0, x], it's 5, 0)
   - \( f(6) = 3 \) (reachable positions are 6, 1, and -1 but since we restrict to [0, x], it's 6, 1)
   - \( f(7) = 8 \) (reachable positions are 7, 2, -3, -8, 12, -1, -6, -11)

   Summing these values gives us 19. However, the provided function `func_2` returns 10, which is incorrect.

2. **Case 2: \( m = 1000000000, a = 1, b = 2019 \)**

   For large values of \( m \), the function `func_2` uses a simplified approach which assumes \( g = 1 \). This is correct when \( \gcd(a, b) = 1 \), but the function should handle other cases as well. Given \( a = 1 \) and \( b = 2019 \), the greatest common divisor is 1, so the function should work correctly. However, the output is incorrect due to the incorrect calculation of the sum of arithmetic series.

Since the program does not correctly compute \( f(i) \) for various cases, it fails to meet the problem requirements in all scenarios. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
