Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the given problem. Here's why:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes a dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to reach the value `i` using steps of `a` and `b`. The base case `dp[0] = 1` indicates that there is exactly one way to stay at position `0` (by doing nothing).

2. **Dynamic Programming Update**: 
   - For each index `i` from `0` to `m`, the program checks if adding `a` to `i` is within bounds (`i + a <= m`). If so, it updates `dp[i + a]` by adding the value of `dp[i]`. This step accounts for reaching `i + a` by taking a step of size `a` from `i`.
   - Similarly, if subtracting `b` from `i` is within bounds (`i - b >= 0`), it updates `dp[i]` by adding the value of `dp[i - b]`. This step accounts for reaching `i` by taking a step of size `-b` from `i - b`.

3. **Sum Calculation**: After filling the DP array, the program calculates the sum of all elements in `dp`, which represents the total number of distinct integers the frog can reach from `0` to `m` considering all possible paths using steps of `a` and `b`.

4. **Output**: The sum is printed, which is the desired output as per the problem statement.

Since the program correctly initializes the DP array, updates it according to the given constraints, and computes the sum of reachable positions as described in the problem, it meets the requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
