Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, consider the case where \(a\) and \(b\) are coprime but \(m\) is smaller than \(a + b - 1\). In such cases, the function `func_2` should directly return \((m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2\), which represents the sum of the first \(m+1\) natural numbers. However, the provided implementation includes unnecessary recursive calls and additional calculations that do not account for this simpler scenario.

For example, in the test case \(m = 100\), \(a = 100000\), and \(b = 1\), the frog cannot make any jumps since \(a > m\). Therefore, the result should be \(101\) because the only reachable position is \(0\). However, the current implementation incorrectly calculates the sum of the first \(100+1\) natural numbers plus some additional terms, leading to an incorrect result.

To fix this, the implementation should directly return \((m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2\) when \(m < a + b - 1\). This ensures that the program works correctly for all potential cases.
