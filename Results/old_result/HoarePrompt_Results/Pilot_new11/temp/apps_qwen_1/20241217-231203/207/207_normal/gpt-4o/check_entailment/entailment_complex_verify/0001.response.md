Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The annotated version clarifies that the function `func_2` does not correctly handle the case where \(a\) and \(b\) are coprime but \(m < a + b - 1\). Specifically, the function should directly return \((m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2\) in such cases, but the current implementation includes unnecessary recursive calls and additional calculations that lead to incorrect results. The annotated version confirms that the function does not correctly cover all potential scenarios, particularly the simpler case where \(m < a + b - 1\), which should be handled directly without further recursion. Therefore, the original assessment of the program being incorrect is valid.
