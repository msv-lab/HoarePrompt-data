You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A frog is initially at position $0$ on the number line. The frog has two positive integers $a$ and $b$. From a position $k$, it can either jump to position $k+a$ or $k-b$.

Let $f(x)$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $[0, x]$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $0$.

Given an integer $m$, find $\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$. That is, find the sum of all $f(i)$ for $i$ from $0$ to $m$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers $m, a, b$ ($1 \leq m \leq 10^9, 1 \leq a,b \leq 10^5$).


-----Output-----

Print a single integer, the desired sum.


-----Examples-----

Input

Output
101

Input
6 4 5

Output
10



-----Note-----

In the first example, we must find $f(0)+f(1)+\ldots+f(7)$. We have $f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$. The sum of these values is $19$.

In the second example, we have $f(i) = i+1$, so we want to find $\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$.

In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.
Annotated Functions:
(m, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
result = func_2(m, a, b)
print(result)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers where x >= y > 0.
def func_1(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`, `y` is 0
    return x
    #The program returns x that is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of x and y
#Overall this is what the function does:This function accepts two non-negative integers `x` and `y` where `x >= y > 0`, and computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD by repeatedly replacing `x` with `y` and `y` with `x % y` until `y` becomes 0. At that point, `x` holds the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`. The function returns `x` as the result. Potential edge cases include when `y` is 0; in this case, the function correctly returns `x` as the GCD since `x` is initially greater than or equal to `y` and `x` is never updated further once `y` becomes 0. There are no missing functionalities in the given code.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: m is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\), and a and b are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^5\).
def func_2(m, a, b):
    g = func_1(a, b)
    if (g != 1) :
        return func_2(m // g, a // g, b // g) * g
        #`The program returns the result of func_2(m // g, a // g, b // g) multiplied by g, where g is the return value of func_1(a, b)`
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `m` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\), `a` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^5\), `b` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 10^5\), `g` is the return value of `func_1(a, b)`, and \(g\) is equal to 1
    k = a + b - 1
    if (m < k) :
        return (m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2
        #`(m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2` where `m` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `m` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\), `a` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^5\), `b` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 10^5\), `g` is equal to 1, `k` is `a + b - 1`, and \(m \geq k\)
    sum_k = k * (k + 1) // 2
    sum_m = m * (m + 1) // 2 - k * (k - 1) // 2
    return sum_k + sum_m
    #`The program returns sum_k which is k * (k + 1) // 2 plus sum_m which is m * (m + 1) // 2 - k * (k - 1) // 2, where k is a + b - 1`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2(m, a, b)` accepts three parameters: `m`, `a`, and `b`, where `m` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\), and `a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^5\). It returns one of three possible results based on the values of `m`, `a`, and `b`:

1. If the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` (returned by `func_1(a, b)`) is not 1, the function recursively calls itself with `m // g`, `a // g`, and `b // g`, where `g` is the GCD, and multiplies the result by `g`.
2. If `m < a + b - 1`, the function returns \((m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2\).
3. Otherwise, the function calculates two sums: `sum_k` as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, where `k = a + b - 1`, and `sum_m` as `m * (m + 1) // 2 - k * (k - 1) // 2`. It then returns the sum of these two sums.

This function effectively handles the GCD case, the simple arithmetic case, and the combined summation case, ensuring all potential scenarios are covered.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
