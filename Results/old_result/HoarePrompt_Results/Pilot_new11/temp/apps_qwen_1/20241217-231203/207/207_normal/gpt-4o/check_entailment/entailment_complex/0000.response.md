Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The code accurately follows the problem description for every potential case. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **GCD Calculation (`func_1`)**:
   - This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - The function handles edge cases correctly, such as when one of the inputs is 0, returning the other number as the GCD.

2. **Main Functionality (`func_2`)**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where the GCD of `a` and `b` is not 1 by recursively calling itself with the reduced values.
   - For the case where `m < a + b - 1`, it returns the sum of the first `m + 1` natural numbers, which is correct.
   - For the general case where `m >= a + b - 1`, it calculates the sum of the first `a + b - 1` natural numbers and subtracts the sum of the first `k - 1` natural numbers, where `k = a + b - 1`, and adds the remaining part of the sum up to `m`.

The annotations correctly summarize the behavior of both functions, and the logic within the code matches the problem description. The code handles all edge cases and potential scenarios as described in the problem statement.

Since the code accurately implements the required functionality without any apparent bugs or missing cases, the correctness of the program is **True**.
