The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. Since the input is not specified in the example, we will represent the input integers as `n_input`, `m_input`, and `k_input`.

After executing the code, the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated to the input values.

Output State: **`n` is `n_input`, `m` is `m_input`, `k` is `k_input`**
