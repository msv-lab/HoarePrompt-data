The code snippet `print('YES')` does not affect the values of any variables. It only prints a string to the console. Therefore, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `area` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is `n_input`, `m` is `m_input`, `k` is `k_input`, `area` is `(n_input * m_input) / k_input`, and the area is not equal to 0**
