Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the code does not ensure that the points form a valid triangle with the required area. Let's analyze the code and find a case where it fails.

### Analysis of the Code
1. **Area Calculation and Validation:**
   - The code calculates the area as \(\frac{n \times m}{k}\) and checks if it is an integer.
   - If the area is not an integer, it prints 'NO'.
   - If the area is zero, it prints 'NO'.

2. **Generating Points:**
   - If the area is an integer and non-zero, it prints 'YES'.
   - It then tries to generate points based on certain conditions:
     - If \(2 \times \text{area} \leq n\), it prints points \((0, 0)\), \((2 \times \text{area}, 1)\), and \((0, 1)\).
     - If \(2 \times \text{area} > n\) but \(2 \times \text{area} \leq m\), it prints points \((1, 0)\), \((1, 2 \times \text{area})\), and \((0, 0)\).
     - If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints points \((n, \frac{m}{2})\), \((0, \frac{m}{2})\), and \((0, 0)\).

### Finding a Counterexample
Let's consider the following input:
```
2 2 5
```

- **Input:**
  - \(n = 2\)
  - \(m = 2\)
  - \(k = 5\)

- **Area Calculation:**
  \[
  \text{Area} = \frac{n \times m}{k} = \frac{2 \times 2}{5} = \frac{4}{5}
  \]
  - The area is not an integer, so the code should print 'NO'. However, the code does not handle this case correctly because it assumes the area will be an integer.

Since the code does not handle the case where the calculated area is not an integer, it will incorrectly print 'YES' and generate points without checking if they form a valid triangle with the required area. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description for every potential case.

Thus, the correctness is **False**.
