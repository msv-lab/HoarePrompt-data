Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the code does not ensure that the area of the triangle formed by the points is exactly \(\frac{nm}{k}\). Instead, it checks if the absolute value of \(n1 \times m\) is greater than or equal to \(g\) (which is \(x \times a + y \times b\)), where \(x\) and \(y\) are the coefficients from the extended Euclidean algorithm. However, this condition does not guarantee that the area of the triangle will be exactly \(\frac{nm}{k}\).

For example, consider the input \(n = 6\), \(m = 6\), and \(k = 2\). The required area of the triangle is \(\frac{6 \times 6}{2} = 18\). According to the code, the following points are printed:
```
YES
0 0
0 36
12 0
```
However, the area of the triangle formed by these points is \(\frac{1}{2} \times 12 \times 36 = 216\), which is not equal to 18. Therefore, the code does not correctly solve the problem for this case.

Thus, the code is not correct according to the problem description.
