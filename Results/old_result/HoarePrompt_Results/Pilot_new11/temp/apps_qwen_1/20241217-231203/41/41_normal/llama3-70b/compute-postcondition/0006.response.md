`ratings_after` is a list that initially contains no elements (an empty list). The code appends the value of `b` to this list, so `ratings_after` now contains `b`. The other variables (`n`, `ratings_before`, and `a`) are not affected.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `ratings_before` is a list containing `a`, `ratings_after` is a list containing `b`, `a` is an integer from input**
