Precondition: **The input consists of multiple lines. The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000) representing the number of round participants. Each of the next n lines contains two integers a_{i} and b_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i}, b_{i} ≤ 4126) representing the rating of the i-th participant before and after the round, respectively. The participants are listed in order from the top to the bottom of the standings.**
