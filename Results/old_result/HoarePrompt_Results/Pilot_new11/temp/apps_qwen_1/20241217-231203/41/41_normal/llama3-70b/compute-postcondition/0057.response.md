Postcondition: **`unrated` is `False`, `i` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `n` is greater than `i`, `j` is an integer with the current value of `j` being `i + 1`. The ratings before and after the change satisfy the condition: `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]`.**
