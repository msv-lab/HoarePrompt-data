`n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which reads an integer from the input. This integer represents the number of round participants. The values of `a_i` and `b_i` for each participant are not yet known, but they will be read in the subsequent lines. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is the number of round participants (an integer between 2 and 1000), and the values of `a_i` and `b_i` for each participant will be read in the following lines.**
