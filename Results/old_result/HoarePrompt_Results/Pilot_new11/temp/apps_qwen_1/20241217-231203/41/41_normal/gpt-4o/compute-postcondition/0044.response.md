Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `ratings` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two distinct integers (a, b), `is_rated` is `False`. If `is_unrated` is `True`, `is_unrated` remains `True`. Otherwise, `is_unrated` becomes `False` and `ratings` remains an empty list.***
