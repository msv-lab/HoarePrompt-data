`ratings` is a list that initially contains the elements `['a', 'b']`. The code appends a tuple `(a, b)` to the list `ratings`. Since `a` and `b` are integers obtained from input, they will be added to the list as a tuple. The values of the other variables (`n`, `is_rated`, `is_unrated`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `ratings` is `['a', 'b', (a, b)]`, `is_rated` is `True`, `is_unrated` is `False`, `a` is an integer from input, `b` is an integer from input**
