The code `break` does not affect the values of any variables and simply exits the current loop or conditional block. Since the given code snippet contains only a `break` statement, the values of all variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `ratings` is an empty list, `is_rated` is `False`, `is_unrated` is `True`, `i` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
