Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `unrated` is `False`
   - `i` and `n` are integers
   - `n` is greater than `i`
   - `j` is an integer with the current value of `j` being `i + 2`
   - The loop checks if `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]`. If true, it breaks out of the loop.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(i + 1, n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop starts with `j = i + 1`.
   - `j` increases by 1 in each iteration until `j` reaches `n`.
   - The condition `j < n` must be true for the loop to continue.

4. **Current Values:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `i + 2`.

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 to become `i + 3`.
   - This means the new value of `j` should be `i + 3`.
   - The loop continues as long as `j < n`, so `n` remains unchanged.

6. **Updated States:**
   - `unrated` remains `False` (since there is no indication that it would change within this loop).
   - `i` remains unchanged.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `j` is updated to `i + 3`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration of the loop are:

State: **`unrated` is `False`, `i` and `n` are integers, `n` is greater than `i`, `j` is an integer with the current value of `j` being `i + 3`**
