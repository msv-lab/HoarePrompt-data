Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 1, and `unrated` is False. If `ratings_before[i] < ratings_after[i]` and `ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]` hold true, then these conditions remain unchanged. Since there is no else part, the conditions do not change under any other scenario.***
