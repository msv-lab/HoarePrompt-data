According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop iterates from `1` to `n-1`, and at the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3. Additionally, `n` must still satisfy the condition of being greater than 1. Since `n` is not modified within the loop itself, it remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these changes:

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `ratings` is an empty list, `is_rated` is `False`, `is_unrated` is `True`, `i` is 3**
