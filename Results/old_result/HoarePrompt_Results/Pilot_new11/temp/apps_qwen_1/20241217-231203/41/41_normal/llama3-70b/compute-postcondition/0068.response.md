Postcondition: ***`unrated` remains `False`, `i` and `n` are integers with `n` greater than `i`, and `j` is `i + 3`. If `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]`, then the conditions are met as they are initially. Otherwise, the conditions remain unchanged.***
