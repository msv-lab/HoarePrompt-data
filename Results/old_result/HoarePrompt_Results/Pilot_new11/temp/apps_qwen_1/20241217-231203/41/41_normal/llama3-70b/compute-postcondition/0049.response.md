The code `break` does not affect the values of any variables. It only breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement. Since there is no loop or switch statement in the given code, the variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 2, `unrated` is `False`, and `j` is 3.**
