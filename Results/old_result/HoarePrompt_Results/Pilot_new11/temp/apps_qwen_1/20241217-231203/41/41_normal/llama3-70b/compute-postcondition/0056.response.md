State: **`unrated` is `False`, `i` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `n` is greater than `i`, `j` is initialized to `i + 1`**

### Explanation:
- **`unrated` is `False`:** The initial state of `unrated` is given as `False`. This does not directly affect the execution of the for loop but might be relevant in other parts of the program logic.
- **`i` is an integer:** `i` must be an integer because it is used as the starting point for the range function.
- **`n` is an integer:** Similarly, `n` must be an integer because it defines the upper bound for the range function.
- **`n` is greater than `i`:** For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than `i` to define a valid range that includes at least one element.
- **`j` is initialized to `i + 1`:** Although `j` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, it is implied that `j` starts at `i + 1`. This ensures that the loop will iterate over valid indices starting from `i + 1` up to `n - 1`.

These conditions ensure that the for loop can be properly initialized and executed.
