Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `ratings` is an empty list.
   - `is_rated` is `False`.
   - `is_unrated` is `True`.
   - The current value of `i` satisfies that the rating at index `i-1` is less than the rating at index `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`.

3. **Key Points to Consider:**
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - The initial value of `i` satisfies the condition where `ratings[i-1] < ratings[i]` and then breaks out of the loop.
   - Since `i` is currently set such that it satisfies the breaking condition, it means `i` is either just before or at the point where the break occurred.

4. **Next Iteration Analysis:**
   - For the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - The loop will check if `i < n`. If `i` was at the breaking point (which implies `i+1` would still satisfy the loop condition), then `i` should now be `2` (since the loop starts from `1`).

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - `n` remains the same as it did not change within the loop.
   - `ratings` remains an empty list as no ratings were added in this iteration.
   - `is_rated` and `is_unrated` remain unchanged since no ratings were processed in the loop.

Given the above analysis, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `ratings` is an empty list, `is_rated` is `False`, `is_unrated` is `True`, `i` is 2**
