Postcondition: ***`n` remains the same, `divisors` includes `prev_i`, `n // prev_i`, or `n // (prev_i + 1)`, `i` is `prev_i + 2`, `divisors` now includes `i`, and if `prev_i + 2 != n // (prev_i + 1)`, then `n // (prev_i + 2)` is added to `divisors`. Since there is no else part, the condition `i != n // i` is sufficient to cover all cases where `n // (prev_i + 2)` is added to `divisors`.***
