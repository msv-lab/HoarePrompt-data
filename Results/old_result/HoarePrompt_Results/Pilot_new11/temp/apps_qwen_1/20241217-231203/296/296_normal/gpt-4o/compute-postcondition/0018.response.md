The code `divisors.append(n // i)` appends the value of `n // i` to the list `divisors`. From the initial state, we know that `i` is `prev_i + 2`, and `divisors` includes `prev_i`, `n // prev_i`, or `n // (prev_i + 1)`, and also includes `i` itself. Additionally, if `prev_i + 2 != n // (prev_i + 1)`, then `n // (prev_i + 2)` is added to `divisors`.

Given this, let's determine the new state:

1. `i` is `prev_i + 2`.
2. We append `n // i` to `divisors`.

Since `i` is `prev_i + 2`, `n // i` will be `n // (prev_i + 2)`. This value is already included in `divisors` if `prev_i + 2 != n // (prev_i + 1)`. Therefore, appending `n // (prev_i + 2)` to `divisors` does not add a new unique element because it was already there.

The output state remains the same in terms of the list `divisors` except that `n // (prev_i + 2)` is included if it wasn't already there due to the condition.

Output State: **`n` remains the same, `divisors` includes `prev_i`, `n // prev_i`, or `n // (prev_i + 1)`, `i` is `prev_i + 2`, `divisors` now includes `i`, and if `prev_i + 2 != n // (prev_i + 1)`, then `n // (prev_i + 2)` is added to `divisors`, and `n // (prev_i + 2)` is appended to `divisors`.**
