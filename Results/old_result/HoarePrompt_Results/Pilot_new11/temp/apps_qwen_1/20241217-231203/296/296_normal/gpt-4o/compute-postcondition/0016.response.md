Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `divisors` includes `prev_i` and either `n // prev_i` or `n // (prev_i + 1)`.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - If `i != n // i`, then `n // (prev_i + 1)` is added to `divisors`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 2` to `i < int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.

3. **Current State Analysis:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the new value of `i` is `prev_i + 1`.
   - The condition for the next iteration is that `i` should be less than `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.

4. **Next Iteration Requirements:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.
   - Since `i` is currently `prev_i + 1`, we need to ensure that `prev_i + 2` (the new value of `i`) is less than `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `divisors` will include the current values plus the next potential divisor if applicable.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 again, making it `prev_i + 2`.
   - If `prev_i + 2 != n // (prev_i + 1)`, then `n // (prev_i + 2)` will be added to `divisors`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`n` remains the same, `divisors` includes `prev_i` and either `n // prev_i` or `n // (prev_i + 1)`, `i` is `prev_i + 2`, and if `prev_i + 2 != n // (prev_i + 1)`, then `n // (prev_i + 2)` is added to `divisors`**.
