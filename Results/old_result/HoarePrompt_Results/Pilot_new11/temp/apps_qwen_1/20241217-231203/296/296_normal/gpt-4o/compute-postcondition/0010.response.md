Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that \(2 < n \leq 10^9\), `divisors` is a list containing either 2 or the smallest divisor of `n` other than 1 (denoted as `d` where \(n \% d == 0\)), and `i` is 2 or the smallest divisor of `n` other than 1, with `i` being less than or equal to the square root of `n` + 1.***
