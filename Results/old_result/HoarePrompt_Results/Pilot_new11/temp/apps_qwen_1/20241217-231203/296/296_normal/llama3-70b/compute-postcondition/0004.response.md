The code simply prints 'YES' to the console, which does not affect the values of any variables. The only change is the printed output. Therefore, the output state includes the printed message and the unchanged values of the variables.

Output State: **'YES' is printed to the console, `n` is an integer within the range of 2 to \(10^9\), inclusive, and `n` is not equal to 2**
