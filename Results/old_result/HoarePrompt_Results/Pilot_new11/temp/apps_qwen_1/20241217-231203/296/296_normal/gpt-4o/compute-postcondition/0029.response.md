Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\). It checks if `n` has any divisors other than 1 and itself within the range \(2 \leq d \leq \sqrt{n}\). If `n` has no such divisors, it returns 'NO'. Otherwise, it returns 'YES' followed by the number of divisors (`k`) and each divisor `d` paired with 1, formatted as '1 d'.**

This function aims to determine whether a given number `n` has any non-trivial divisors (divisors other than 1 and itself) up to its square root. If `n` is prime or has no such divisors, it returns 'NO'. For numbers with divisors, it returns 'YES' along with the count of these divisors and their corresponding pairs (1, d).

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- The function correctly handles the case where `n` is prime (no divisors within the specified range), returning 'NO'.
- The function also correctly handles composite numbers by identifying all divisors up to \(\sqrt{n}\) and returning 'YES' followed by the count of these divisors and their pairs (1, d).
- There are no explicit missing functionalities; however, the function assumes that the input `n` is always within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\), which is correctly checked at the beginning. If `n` were outside this range, the function would not execute as expected, but this is beyond the scope of the function's defined behavior.
