The code initializes an empty list called `divisors`. This means that no divisors are added to this list. The initial value of `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the only variable affected is `divisors`, which is now an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 < n <= 10^9; `divisors` is an empty list**
