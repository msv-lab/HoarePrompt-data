The code snippet `divisors.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `divisors`. Given the initial conditions, `i` is set to 2 and `n % i == 0`, meaning that `n` is divisible by 2. Therefore, `i` (which is 2) will be added to the list `divisors`. 

After appending, the value of `i` remains unchanged, as the code does not modify `i` itself. The other variables (`n`, `divisors`, and the condition `i <= sqrt(n) + 1`) remain in their respective initial states.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 < n <= 10^9, `divisors` is a list containing 2, `i` is 2, `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `n` + 1, `n % i == 0`**
