`ans` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `i` is 4, and `n` must be greater than 4. The value of `s` is an input string, and the value of `ans` remains unchanged if `s[4]` equals `s[3]`, otherwise it updates to `ans + 1`. Since the code only affects `ans`, the output state is as follows:

Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 4, `s` is the input string, `ans` is the original value plus 1 if `s[4]` does not equal `s[3]`, else `ans` remains unchanged.**
