`ans` is incremented by 1. Initially, `ans` is 1, so after the increment, `ans` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `s` is the input string, `ans` is 2, the current value of `s[i]` is not equal to the current value of `s[i - 1]`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `s` is the input string, `ans` is 2, the current value of `s[i]` is not equal to the current value of `s[i - 1]`**
