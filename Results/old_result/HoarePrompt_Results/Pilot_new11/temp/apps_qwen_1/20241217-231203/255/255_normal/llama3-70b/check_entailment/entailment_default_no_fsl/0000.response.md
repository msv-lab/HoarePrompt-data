Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem. The code counts the number of distinct consecutive pairs of characters in the string, which is not the same as calculating the minimum number of operations needed to delete the entire string by removing contiguous substrings where all characters are the same.

For example, consider the string "aaaa". According to the problem description, the correct answer should be 1 because we can remove the entire string in one operation. However, the provided code would output 3 because it counts the pairs (a,a), (a,a), and (a,a).

Another example is the string "ababa". The correct answer should be 2 because we can first remove "baba" and then "a", but the provided code would output 5 because it counts the pairs (a,b), (b,a), (a,b), (b,a), and (a,a).

Therefore, the code does not handle the problem correctly for every potential case.
