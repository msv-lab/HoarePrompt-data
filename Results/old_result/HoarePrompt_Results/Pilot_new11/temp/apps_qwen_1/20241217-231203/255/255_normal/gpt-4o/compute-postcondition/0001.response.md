The code `s = input()` reads a string from the user and assigns it to the variable `s`. The variable `n` remains unchanged because no operation on `n` is performed in the given code snippet. The initial state of `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 500, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. After executing the code, the new value of `s` will be the string input by the user, and the length of `s` should be equal to the original value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 500, `s` is the string input by the user and its length is equal to `n`.**
