Let's analyze the given loop and derive the final state of the variables after the loop has executed all its iterations.

### Initial State
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 500.
- `s` is the input string.
- `ans` is 1.

### Loop Code
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    if s[i] != s[i - 1]:
        ans += 1
```

### Analysis of the Loop
1. **Initialization**:
   - `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 until it reaches `n`.

2. **Condition Check**:
   - For each iteration, the loop checks if `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i - 1]`.
   - If the condition is true, `ans` is incremented by 1.

3. **Final Iteration**:
   - After the loop finishes, `i` will be `n` (since the loop condition is `range(1, n)`).

### Determining the Final Values
- **`i`**: After the loop, `i` will be `n` because the loop runs from 1 to `n-1` inclusive.
- **`n`**: Remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- **`s`**: Remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- **`ans`**: The value of `ans` depends on how many times the condition `s[i] != s[i - 1]` was satisfied. Initially, `ans` is 1, and it is incremented each time the condition is true.

### Final State
To determine the final state, we need to consider both cases: when the loop executes and when it does not execute.

#### Case 1: Loop Executes
- The loop will execute `n-1` times (from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`).
- Each time the condition `s[i] != s[i - 1]` is true, `ans` is incremented by 1.
- The maximum possible value of `ans` would be `n-1` if every pair of consecutive characters in `s` are different.

#### Case 2: Loop Does Not Execute
- This happens if `n` is 1, in which case the loop body never runs.
- Therefore, `ans` remains 1.

### Output State
Combining both cases, we can describe the final state as follows:

- `i` is `n`.
- `n` remains the same as the initial value.
- `s` remains the same as the initial value.
- `ans` is the count of distinct consecutive pairs in the string `s`, starting from the second character. It will be between 1 and `n-1` depending on the string `s`.

Thus, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is:

**Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is the same as the initial value, `s` is the same as the initial value, `ans` is the count of distinct consecutive pairs in the string `s` (ranging from 1 to `n-1`).**
