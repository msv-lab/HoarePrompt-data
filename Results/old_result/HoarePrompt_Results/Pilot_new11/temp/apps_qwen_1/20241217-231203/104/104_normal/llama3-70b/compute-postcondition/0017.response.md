Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - 2`, `j` is `n - 1` or more, `max_erase` is the maximum value of `j - i - 1` encountered during the loop iterations. The condition `all((a[k] - a[i] == k - i for k in range(i, j)))` holds true for all elements in the range from `i` to `j-1`.***
