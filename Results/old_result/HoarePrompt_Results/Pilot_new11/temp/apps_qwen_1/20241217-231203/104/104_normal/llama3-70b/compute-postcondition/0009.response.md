The code updates `max_erase` to be the maximum of its current value and `j - i - 1`. Given the initial state where `j` is `j + 1` (which means `j` is incremented by 1), let's analyze the impact:

- `i` is initially 0.
- `j` is incremented by 1, making `j` equal to `initial_j + 1`.
- `max_erase` remains unchanged.

Let's denote the initial value of `j` as `initial_j`. After the increment, `j` becomes `initial_j + 1`.

The code sets `max_erase` to `max(max_erase, (initial_j + 1) - 0 - 1)`, which simplifies to `max(max_erase, initial_j)`.

Therefore, `max_erase` will now be the maximum of its original value and `initial_j`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is `initial_j + 1`, `max_erase` is the maximum of its original value and `initial_j`**
