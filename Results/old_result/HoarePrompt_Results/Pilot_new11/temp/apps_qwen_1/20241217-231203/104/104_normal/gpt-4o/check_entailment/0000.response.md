Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program attempts to find the maximum gap between consecutive elements in the array and uses this gap to determine the number of consecutive elements that can be erased. However, this approach is flawed because it does not consider the possibility of erasing non-consecutive elements.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
1 2 3 5 7
```
In this case, the program would calculate the gaps between consecutive elements and determine that the maximum gap is 1 (between 2 and 3, and between 3 and 5). Thus, it would output `1` as the maximum number of consecutive elements that can be erased. However, the correct solution is to erase the elements `[3, 5]`, which allows the array to be restored to `[1, 2, _, _, 7]`. Therefore, the maximum number of consecutive elements that can be erased is actually `2`.

To fix this, the program needs to consider the possibility of erasing non-consecutive elements and ensure that the remaining elements still allow the original array to be restored.
