The code updates the variable `max_erase` to be the maximum between its current value and `j - i - 1`. The initial state is that `total` is 0, `i` is an integer, `n` must be greater than `i`, and `max_erase` is updated to be the maximum between its current value and `j - i - 1` where `j` is now `j_old + 1`.

After executing the line `max_erase = max(max_erase, j - i - 1)`, the value of `max_erase` is updated based on the new value of `j`, which is `j_old + 1`. However, since `j_old` is not defined in the initial state, we can represent `j` as `j_old + 1`. The value of `i` remains unchanged.

The output state is:
Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is an integer, `n` is greater than `i`, `max_erase` is the maximum between its current value and `(j_old + 1) - i - 1`**
