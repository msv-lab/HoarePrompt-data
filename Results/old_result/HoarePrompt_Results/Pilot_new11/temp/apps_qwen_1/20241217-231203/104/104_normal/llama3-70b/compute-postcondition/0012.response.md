The code updates `max_erase` to be the maximum of its current value and `j - i - 1`. Given the initial conditions, we know `i` is 1 and `j` is either `initial_j + 1` or the same as `initial_j`. Since `max_erase` is the maximum of its original value and `initial_j`, let's denote `initial_j` as `j_initial`.

- If `j` is `j_initial + 1`, then `j - i - 1` would be `j_initial`.
- If `j` is `j_initial`, then `j - i - 1` would be `j_initial - 2`.

In both cases, `max_erase` will be updated to be the maximum of its current value and `j_initial`. Therefore, the new value of `max_erase` will be the maximum of its original value and `j_initial`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is either `initial_j + 1` or `initial_j`, `max_erase` is the maximum of its original value and `j_initial`**
