Let's break down the given for loop and determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given for loop:
```
for i in range(mid + 1, 101):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Range Definition**: The loop iterates over values of `i` starting from `mid + 1` up to (but not including) 101.
   - This means `i` will take values from `mid + 1` to 100.
   - For the loop to start, `i` must be less than 101, but it must also be greater than or equal to `mid + 1`.

2. **Initial Value of `i`**: At the start of the loop, `i` should be set to the first value it will iterate over, which is `mid + 1`.
   - If `mid + 1` is greater than or equal to 101, the loop won't execute because there are no values in the range that satisfy the condition.

3. **Value of `mid`**: The variable `mid` determines the starting point of the loop. Therefore, `mid` must be an integer such that `mid + 1` is within the valid range [1, 100].

### Required Adjustments:

- `i` must be `mid + 1`.
- `mid` must be an integer such that `mid + 1` is less than 101.

### Final State Adjustment:

State: **`i` is `mid + 1`, `mid` must be an integer such that `mid + 1` is less than 101**
