The code reads a list of integers from the input and assigns it to the variable `a`. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 1000` and `a` is a list of `n` integers each between `1` and `100`, the input will replace the existing list `a` with a new list of integers. However, the value of `n` remains unchanged.

Let's denote the input as `input_str`, which is a space-separated string of integers. After converting this string using `map(int, input().split())`, the list `a` is updated with these integers.

Since the exact input is not specified, the output state will reflect that `a` now holds the newly inputted list of integers, while `n` retains its original value.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 1000`; `a` is a list of integers such that each integer in `a` is between `1` and `100` and the length of `a` is equal to `n`**
