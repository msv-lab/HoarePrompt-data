`min_t` is assigned the value of `i`, which is `mid + 1`. The value of `mid` and `min_cost` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `mid + 1`; `mid` is an integer such that `mid + 1` is less than 101; `min_cost` is the current value of `cost`; `min_t` is `mid + 1`.

Output State: **`i` is `mid + 1`; `mid` is an integer such that `mid + 1` is less than 101; `min_cost` is the current value of `cost`; `min_t` is `mid + 1`.**
