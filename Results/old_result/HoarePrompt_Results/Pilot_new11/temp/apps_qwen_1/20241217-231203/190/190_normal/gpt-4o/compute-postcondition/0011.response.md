The code snippet updates the `current_cost` by adding the difference between the length of the list `a` and `t + 1` to the current cost. Given that the length of `a` is greater than or equal to `t + 1`, let's denote the length of `a` as `len_a`. 

The initial state is:
- `t` is 1
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\)
- `a` is a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 100 and the length of `a` is equal to `n`
- `min_cost` is infinity (`float('inf')`)
- `best_t` is -1
- `current_cost` is 0
- The length of `a` is greater than or equal to `t + 1`

After the code runs, `current_cost` becomes:
\[ \text{current\_cost} = 0 + (\text{len\_a} - (1 + 1)) = \text{len\_a} - 2 \]

Therefore, the updated variables are:
- `t` remains 1
- `n` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\)
- `a` remains a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 100 and the length of `a` is equal to `n`
- `min_cost` remains infinity (`float('inf')`)
- `best_t` remains -1
- `current_cost` is now `len_a - 2`
- The length of `a` is greater than or equal to `t + 1`

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `a` is a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 100 and the length of `a` is equal to `n`, `min_cost` is infinity (`float('inf')`), `best_t` is -1, `current_cost` is `len_a - 2`, the length of `a` is greater than or equal to `t + 1`**
