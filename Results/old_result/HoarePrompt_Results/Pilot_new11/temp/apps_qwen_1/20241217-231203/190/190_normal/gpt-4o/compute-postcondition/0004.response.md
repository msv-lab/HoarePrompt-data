Let's break down the given code and determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Code:
```python
for t in range(1, 101):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Initial States:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\)
- `a` is a list of integers such that each integer in `a` is between 1 and 100 and the length of `a` is equal to `n`
- `min_cost` is infinity (`float('inf')`)
- `best_t` is -1

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variable `t`**:
   - The loop iterates over values from 1 to 100 (inclusive). Therefore, `t` must take on these values within the loop.
   - Before entering the loop, `t` should not have a specific value but rather be set to the initial value of the range, which is 1.

2. **Other Variables**:
   - The other variables (`n`, `a`, `min_cost`, `best_t`) do not directly influence the execution of the loop itself. They are initialized before the loop and used inside the loop for computations.
   - However, since the loop body is omitted, we assume there are no conditions inside the loop that require changes to these variables' states. They remain as they were initialized.

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs adjustment for the loop to execute correctly is ensuring that `t` is set to the initial value of the range, which is 1.

### Final Answer:
State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `a` is a list of integers such that each integer in `a` is between 1 and 100 and the length of `a` is equal to `n`, `min_cost` is infinity (`float('inf')`), `best_t` is -1**
