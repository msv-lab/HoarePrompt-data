Postcondition: **`t` is 4, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `a` is a list of integers with length 4, `current_cost` is updated by either subtracting 1 from its current value or adding `a[3] - 5` to its current value (depending on whether the length of `a` is greater than `t - 1`), `min_cost` remains unchanged, and `best_t` remains 2.**
