`n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since `n` was initially an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 1000`, after executing this line, the value of `n` remains within this range, but the exact value depends on the user's input. The precondition that `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100; `n` is the integer input by the user.**
