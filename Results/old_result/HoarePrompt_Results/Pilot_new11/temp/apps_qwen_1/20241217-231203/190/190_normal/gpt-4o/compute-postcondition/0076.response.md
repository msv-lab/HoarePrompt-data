The code `min_cost = current_cost` updates the value of `min_cost` to be equal to `current_cost`. Given that `current_cost` is lower than `min_cost`, this assignment does not change the value of `min_cost`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is 4, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `a` is a list of integers with length 4, `current_cost` is the sum of the differences between each element in `a` and 5 if they are greater than 4, otherwise it is 0, `min_cost` is the value of `current_cost`, and `best_t` remains 2.**
