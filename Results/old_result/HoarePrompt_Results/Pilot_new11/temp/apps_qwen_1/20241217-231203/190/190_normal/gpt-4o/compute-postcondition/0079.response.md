Output State: **`t` is 100, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `a` is a list of integers with length `n`, each element is between 1 and 100, `current_cost` is the final calculated cost based on the loop conditions, `min_cost` is the minimum value of `current_cost` encountered during the loop, and `best_t` is the value of `t` when `min_cost` is achieved.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over `t` from 1 to 100. For each `t`, it calculates `current_cost` based on the conditions provided in the inner loop.
- The outer loop continues until it finds the `t` that minimizes `current_cost`.
- After the loop completes, `t` will be set to the highest possible value (100) because the loop checks all values from 1 to 100.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is a constant input to the problem.
- `a` remains unchanged as it is a constant list input to the problem.
- `min_cost` will hold the lowest `current_cost` found during the loop.
- `best_t` will hold the value of `t` that resulted in the lowest `min_cost`.

If the loop does not execute at all (which would be the case if `n` were 0, but since `n` is specified to be between 1 and 1000, this scenario is not applicable here), the initial values would remain:
- `t` would be -1 (as per the initial state).
- `min_cost` would still be `float('inf')` (as per the initial state).
- `best_t` would remain -1 (as per the initial state).

However, since `n` is specified to be within the range [1, 1000], the loop will always execute at least once, ensuring that `t` is set to a valid value (100 in this case).
