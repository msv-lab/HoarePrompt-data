Postcondition: ***`t` is 4, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `a` is a list of integers with length 4, `current_cost` is updated by subtracting 1, `min_cost` remains unchanged, and `best_t` remains 2. Since the condition `length > t + 1` does not apply (as `length` is 4 and `t + 1` is 5), the if part is not executed and the postcondition follows the else part which is essentially the same as the precondition.***
