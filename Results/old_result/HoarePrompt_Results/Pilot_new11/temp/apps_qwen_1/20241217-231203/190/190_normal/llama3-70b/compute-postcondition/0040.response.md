Postcondition: **`i` is `mid + 3`, `cost` is the sum of minimum absolute differences calculated from the list `sticks` for each element `x` with respect to `i` and `i-1`. If `cost < min_cost`, then `min_cost` is updated to `cost` and `min_t` is set to `i`. Otherwise, `min_cost` and `min_t` remain unchanged.**
