The code initializes the variable `min_cost` to infinity (`float('inf')`). This does not affect the values of `n` or `a`. Therefore, the only change is the assignment of a new value to `min_cost`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 1000`; `a` is a list of integers such that each integer in `a` is between `1` and `100` and the length of `a` is equal to `n`; `min_cost` is infinity (`float('inf')`).**
