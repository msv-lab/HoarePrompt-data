`min_t` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `cost` and `min_cost` is determined by the initial state and remains unchanged, as the code only updates `min_t` without affecting `cost` or `min_cost`. Therefore, the Output State is: `cost` is the sum of `min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i + 1)))` for each `x` in `sticks`; `min_cost` is equal to `cost`; `min_t` is `i`.

Output State: **`cost` is the sum of `min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i + 1)))` for each `x` in `sticks`; `min_cost` is equal to `cost`; `min_t` is `i`.**
