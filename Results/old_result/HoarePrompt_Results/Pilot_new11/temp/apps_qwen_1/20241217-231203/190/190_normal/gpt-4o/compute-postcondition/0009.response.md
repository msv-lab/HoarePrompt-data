Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `a` is a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 100 and the length of `a` is equal to `n`, `min_cost` is infinity (`float('inf')`), `best_t` is -1, `current_cost` is 0, and the length of `a` is greater than or equal to `t - 1`**
