The given code prints the values of `best_t` and `min_cost`. Since the code does not assign new values to these variables, the values of `best_t` and `min_cost` remain unchanged. The states of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `current_cost`) are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is 100, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `a` is a list of integers with length `n`, each element is between 1 and 100, `current_cost` is the final calculated cost based on the loop conditions, `min_cost` is the minimum value of `current_cost` encountered during the loop, `best_t` is the value of `t` when `min_cost` is achieved, and `best_t` and `min_cost` are printed.**
