Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State
- `t` is 2.
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\).
- `a` is a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 100 and the length of `a` is equal to `n`.
- `current_cost` is 0.
- `min_cost` is equal to `current_cost`, so initially, `min_cost` is also 0.
- `best_t` is 1.

### Loop Code
```python
for length in a:
    if length < t - 1:
        current_cost += t - 1 - length
    elif length > t + 1:
        current_cost += length - (t + 1)
```

### Analysis
1. **Case 1: `length` is less than `t - 1` (which is 1)**
   - This means `length` is 1.
   - The loop updates `current_cost` by adding `t - 1 - length` which is `2 - 1 = 1`.
   - Therefore, `current_cost` increases by 1 for each occurrence of `length` being 1.

2. **Case 2: `length` is greater than `t + 1` (which is 3)**
   - This means `length` is 4 or more.
   - The loop updates `current_cost` by adding `length - (t + 1)` which is `length - 3`.
   - Therefore, `current_cost` increases by the difference between `length` and 3 for each occurrence of `length` being 4 or more.

### Final Output State
After the loop has finished executing for all elements in `a`, we need to consider the following:
- The final value of `current_cost` will be the sum of all increments made during the loop based on the conditions above.
- `min_cost` will be the minimum value of `current_cost` encountered during the loop, but since `current_cost` starts at 0 and only increases, `min_cost` will always be 0 unless there are no valid `length` values (which we'll discuss later).

#### Key Observations:
- If all lengths in `a` are either 1 or 4 or more, `current_cost` will reflect the sum of these increments.
- If any length is exactly 2 or 3, no changes will occur to `current_cost`.

### Conclusion
- `t` remains 2.
- `n` remains within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\).
- `a` remains a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 100 and the length of `a` is equal to `n`.
- `current_cost` will be the sum of increments based on the conditions in the loop.
- `min_cost` is 0.
- `best_t` remains 1.

### Output State
Output State: **`t` is 2, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `a` is a list of integers with length `n`, each element is between 1 and 100, `current_cost` is the sum of increments based on the loop conditions, `min_cost` is 0, and `best_t` is 1.**
