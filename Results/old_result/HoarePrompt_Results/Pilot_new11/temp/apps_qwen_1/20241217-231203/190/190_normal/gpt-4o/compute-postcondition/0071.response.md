`current_cost` is incremented by `length - (t + 1)`. Given that `t` is 4, the expression `length - (t + 1)` simplifies to `length - 5`. Since `length` is part of the list `a` and we are processing the fourth element, let's denote the fourth element of `a` as `a[3]`. Therefore, `length` is `a[3]`. So, `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + a[3] - 5`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 4, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `a` is a list of integers with length 4, `current_cost` is updated by adding `a[3] - 5` to its current value, `min_cost` remains unchanged, and `best_t` remains 2.

Output State: **`t` is 4, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `a` is a list of integers with length 4, `current_cost` is updated by adding `a[3] - 5` to its current value, `min_cost` remains unchanged, and `best_t` remains 2.**
