The `min_cost` is updated to the value of `current_cost`. Since `current_cost` is currently less than `min_cost` (which is 0), `min_cost` will now be equal to `current_cost`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `a` is a list of integers with length `n`, each element is between 1 and 100, `current_cost` is the sum of increments based on the loop conditions and is currently less than `min_cost`, `min_cost` is equal to `current_cost`, and `best_t` is 1.**
