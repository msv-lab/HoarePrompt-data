Postcondition: ***`t` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `a` is a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 100 and the length of `a` is equal to \(n - 1\). If `length < t - 1`, then `current_cost` is -2. Otherwise, `current_cost` is \(2n - 5\) if \(n > 3\), \(1\) if \(n = 3\), and \(0\) if \(n < 3\).***
