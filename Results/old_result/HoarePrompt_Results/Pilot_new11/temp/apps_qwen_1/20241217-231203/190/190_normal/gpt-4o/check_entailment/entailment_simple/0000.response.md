Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads the integer `n` which represents the number of sticks.
   - It then reads a list of integers representing the lengths of the sticks.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes `min_cost` to infinity and `best_t` to -1. These variables are used to keep track of the minimum cost and the corresponding value of `t`.

3. **Iterating Over Possible Values of `t`**:
   - The program iterates over all possible values of `t` from 1 to 100. For each value of `t`, it calculates the cost of making all sticks almost good for `t`.
   - The cost calculation involves iterating over each stick length `length` and determining the cost to make it almost good for `t`. The cost is calculated as:
     - `t - 1 - length` if `length < t - 1`
     - `length - (t + 1)` if `length > t + 1`
   - The costs are summed up for all sticks to get `current_cost`.

4. **Updating Minimum Cost and Best Value of `t`**:
   - After calculating `current_cost` for each `t`, the program updates `min_cost` and `best_t` if `current_cost` is less than the previously recorded `min_cost`.

5. **Output**:
   - Finally, the program prints the value of `t` (`best_t`) and the minimum cost (`min_cost`).

Given these steps, the program correctly follows the problem description:

- It iterates over all possible values of `t` (from 1 to 100).
- For each `t`, it calculates the cost of making all sticks almost good for `t`.
- It keeps track of the minimum cost and the corresponding `t`.
- It outputs the value of `t` and the minimum cost.

Since the program handles all cases as specified in the problem description and performs the necessary calculations accurately, the program is correct.
