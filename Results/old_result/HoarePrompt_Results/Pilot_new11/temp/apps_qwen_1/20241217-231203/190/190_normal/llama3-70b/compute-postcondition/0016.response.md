The code sets `min_cost` to the value of `cost`. This means that the value of `min_cost` is now the same as the original value of `cost`, while `cost` remains unchanged, and `min_t` remains unchanged as well.

Output State: **`cost` is the sum of `min(abs(x - (i + 1)), abs(x - i))` for each `x` in `sticks`; `min_cost` is equal to `cost`; `min_t` is unchanged.**
