Postcondition: **`t` is 2, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element and each element is between 1 and 100. If the length of the list `a` is less than 1, then `current_cost` is 1, `min_cost` is 1, and `best_t` is 1. If the length of the list `a` is greater than 3, then `current_cost` is `length - 3`, `min_cost` is 0, and `best_t` is 1.**
