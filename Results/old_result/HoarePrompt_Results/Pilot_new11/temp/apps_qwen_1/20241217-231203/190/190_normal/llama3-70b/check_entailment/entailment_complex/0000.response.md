Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the solution for the given problem description. Here's why:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding an integer \( t \) such that the total cost of changing the lengths of the sticks to be almost good for \( t \) is minimized. The cost of changing a stick's length from \( a \) to \( b \) is \( |a - b| \).

2. **Median Calculation**: The program starts by sorting the list of stick lengths. Sorting helps in finding the median, which is a good candidate for \( t \) because it minimizes the sum of absolute deviations in many cases. The median \( t \) is chosen as the middle element of the sorted list, which is a common heuristic to minimize the sum of absolute differences.

3. **Initial Cost Calculation**: The initial cost is calculated using the median \( t \). This ensures that the cost is minimized for the median value.

4. **Optimization Loop**: The program then iterates over possible values of \( t \) from \( \text{median} - 1 \) down to 1 and from \( \text{median} + 1 \) up to 100. For each \( t \), it calculates the total cost of changing the stick lengths to be almost good for \( t \) or \( t+1 \) and updates the minimum cost and corresponding \( t \) if a lower cost is found.

5. **Final Output**: After completing the optimization loop, the program prints the value of \( t \) and the minimum cost.

### Detailed Steps:

1. **Sorting the List**: The list of stick lengths is sorted, which helps in finding the median efficiently.
2. **Initial Median Calculation**: The median \( t \) is chosen as the middle element of the sorted list.
3. **Cost Calculation for Median**: The initial cost is calculated using the median \( t \).
4. **Optimization Loop**:
   - Iterate from \( \text{median} - 1 \) down to 1 and calculate the cost for each \( t \) and \( t+1 \).
   - Update the minimum cost and corresponding \( t \) if a lower cost is found.
   - Similarly, iterate from \( \text{median} + 1 \) up to 100 and update the minimum cost and corresponding \( t \) if a lower cost is found.
5. **Final Output**: Print the value of \( t \) and the minimum cost.

Given that the program follows the steps described in the problem statement and handles the necessary calculations correctly, the program is correct for all potential valid inputs as per the problem description.
