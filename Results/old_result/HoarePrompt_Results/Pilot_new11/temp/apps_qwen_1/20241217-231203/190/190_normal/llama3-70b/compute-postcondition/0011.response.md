`min_cost` is assigned the value of `cost`. The value of `cost` is less than `min_cost`, so `min_cost` is updated to be equal to `cost`. The state of `cost` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`cost` is the sum of `min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i + 1)))` for each `x` in `sticks`; `min_cost` is equal to `cost`.**
