The function `func` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, which are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 100\), and a parameter `s`, which is a string consisting of lowercase letters representing the colors of the balloons. 

Case_1: If the length of the string `s` is less than `k`, the function returns an error message indicating that the string is too short.

Case_2: The function returns the substring of `s` starting from index `n` and having a length of `k`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept parameters `n`, `k`, and `s`, and if the length of `s` is less than `k`, it returns an error message. Otherwise, it returns a substring of `s` starting from index `n` and having a length of `k`.
