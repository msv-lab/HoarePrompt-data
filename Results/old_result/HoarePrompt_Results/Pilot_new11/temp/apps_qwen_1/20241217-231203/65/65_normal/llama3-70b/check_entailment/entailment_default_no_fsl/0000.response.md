Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It counts the occurrences of each color of balloon and checks if the maximum count of any color is less than or equal to the number of friends. If this condition is met, it prints 'YES', indicating that the balloons can be distributed without any friend getting two balloons of the same color. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The code handles all the given examples and potential edge cases as follows:
1. When `max_color_count <= k`, the program prints 'YES'.
2. When `max_color_count > k`, the program prints 'NO'.
3. The code correctly handles strings with multiple characters and different counts of each character.
4. The code also correctly handles the case where the input string is empty (`s = ''`), which would result in `max_color_count` being 0 and thus printing 'YES'.
5. The code correctly handles the maximum constraints for `n` and `k` (1 to 100).

Since the code works correctly for all the provided examples and potential edge cases, the program is correct.
