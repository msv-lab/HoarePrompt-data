The function `func` accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`, both within the range 1 to 100, and a string `s` consisting of lowercase letters representing the colors of the balloons. It then creates a dictionary `color_count` to store the count of each character in the string `s`. After counting the characters, it determines the maximum count of any character in `s` and checks if this maximum count is less than or equal to `k`. If the maximum count is less than or equal to `k`, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return anything but modifies the state by printing the result to the console. Potential edge cases include when `s` is an empty string or when `n` and `k` are outside the specified range, although these cases are not explicitly handled in the code.
