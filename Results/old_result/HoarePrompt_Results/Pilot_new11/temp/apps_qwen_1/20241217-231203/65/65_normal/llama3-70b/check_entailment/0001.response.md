Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly determines whether Kefa can distribute all the balloons among his friends such that no friend gets two balloons of the same color. The program works by counting the occurrences of each balloon color using a dictionary and then checking if the maximum count of any color is less than or equal to the number of friends. If this condition is met, it prints "YES", indicating that the distribution is possible without any friend being upset. If the condition is not met, it prints "NO".

Given the problem description and the examples provided, the program handles all potential cases correctly. It accurately checks the distribution requirement and outputs the appropriate response based on the conditions specified. There are no scenarios identified where the program would fail to meet the requirements.
