Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the given problem. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the program meets the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads a positive integer `x` from the input and converts it to a string (`x_str`). It checks the first character of `x_str` to decide the approach for finding the integer with the maximum sum of digits.

2. **Candidate Integer Generation**:
   - If the first character of `x_str` is not '1', it generates a candidate integer by decrementing the first character by one and appending '9's to the rest of the string. This ensures the sum of digits is maximized while keeping the number less than or equal to `x`.
   - If the first character is '1', it generates a candidate integer consisting of '9's for the remaining digits. This also maximizes the sum of digits.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The program calculates the sum of digits for both `x` and the candidate integer using the `func_1` function.
   - It then compares these sums. If the sum of the candidate integer is greater than or equal to the sum of `x`, it prints the candidate integer. Otherwise, it prints `x`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where the maximum sum of digits is achieved by numbers like 99, 999, etc., which would be the candidate integers.
   - For numbers where the maximum sum is achieved by the number itself, like 48 or 521, the program correctly prints the original number.

5. **Functionality**:
   - The `func_1` function correctly computes the sum of digits of a given integer. It works for all valid inputs within the specified range (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18).

Since the program follows the problem description accurately, it will work correctly for all valid inputs within the specified constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
