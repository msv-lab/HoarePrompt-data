State before the loop starts: `x` is the integer value of the input string and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^18, `max_num` is 0, `max_sum` is 0.

For the loop to execute, we need to consider the initialization and the conditions required for the loop to start. The loop is defined as:

```python
for i in range(1, x + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Initialization**: The loop will start with `i = 1` and increment `i` until `i` reaches `x + 1`. This means that the loop will execute if `x` is greater than or equal to 1.
   
2. **Variable `max_num` and `max_sum`**: These variables are initialized to 0. They are not directly involved in determining whether the loop should execute, but they will be updated within the loop body.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `1 ≤ i < x + 1`.

### Required Adjustments:

- **Value of `x`**: Since the loop starts from `1` and goes up to `x`, `x` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute. Given the constraint \(1 \leq x \leq 10^{18}\), we only need to ensure that `x` is at least 1.
- **Values of `max_num` and `max_sum`**: While these values are initialized to 0, their initial values do not affect whether the loop starts executing.

### Final State:

The state before the loop starts needs to be adjusted to reflect that the loop can only execute if `x` is at least 1. 

**State: **`x` must be at least 1, `max_num` is 0, `max_sum` is 0**
