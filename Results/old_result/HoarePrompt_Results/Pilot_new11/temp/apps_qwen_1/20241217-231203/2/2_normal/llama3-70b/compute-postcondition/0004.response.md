The code `digit_sum = sum(int(digit) for digit in str(i))` calculates the sum of digits of the integer `i`. However, the initial state does not specify the value of `i`. The values of `x` and `max_num` remain unchanged, while `max_sum` is not affected because no assignment to `max_sum` is made in the given code snippet.

Output State: **`x` must be at least 1, `max_num` is 0, `max_sum` is 0, `digit_sum` is the sum of digits of `i`.**
