The code calculates the digit sum of `i` and assigns it to `digit_sum`. Let's break it down:

- The initial state includes: `x` must be at least 1, `max_num` is equal to the previous `i`, and `max_sum` is equal to the current digit sum of the previous `i`. `i` is now `i + 1`.
- The code `digit_sum = sum(int(digit) for digit in str(i))` computes the sum of the digits of the new value of `i`.

Since the exact value of `i` was not specified in the initial state, let's denote the previous value of `i` as `prev_i` and the new value of `i` as `new_i = prev_i + 1`.

- `max_num` remains unchanged and is still equal to `prev_i`.
- `max_sum` remains unchanged and is still equal to the digit sum of `prev_i`.
- `digit_sum` is now the digit sum of `new_i`.

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `max_num` is equal to the previous `i`.
- `max_sum` is equal to the current digit sum of the previous `i`.
- `digit_sum` is the digit sum of `i + 1`.

Output State: **`x` must be at least 1, `max_num` is equal to the previous `i`, `max_sum` is equal to the current digit sum of the previous `i`, `digit_sum` is the digit sum of `i + 1`.**
