The code assigns the value of `digit_sum` to `max_sum`. This means that `max_sum` now holds the value of `digit_sum`, which was previously greater than `max_sum`. The value of `x` remains at least 1, and `max_num` remains 0. The current digit sum of `i` is also unchanged.

Output State: **`x` must be at least 1, `max_num` is 0, `max_sum` is equal to `digit_sum`, and the current digit sum of `i` is greater than `max_sum`.**
