The code `print(0)` simply prints the number 0 to the console and does not affect any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters "-" and "+"; `minus_count` is the count of '-' characters in `s`; `plus_count` is the count of '+' characters in `s`; the current value of `minus_count` is greater than `plus_count`**
