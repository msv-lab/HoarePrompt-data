`minus_count` is assigned the value of `s.count('-')`, which counts the number of '-' characters in the string `s`. The count of '-' characters in `s` is dependent on the user input, but `n` remains unchanged as the count operation does not affect its value.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters "-" and "+"; `minus_count` is the count of '-' characters in `s`.**
