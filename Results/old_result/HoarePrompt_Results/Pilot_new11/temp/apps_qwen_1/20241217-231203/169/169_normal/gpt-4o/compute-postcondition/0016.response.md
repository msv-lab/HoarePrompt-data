Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is an integer.
   - `s` is a non-empty string consisting of `n` characters, either "-" or "+".
   - `stones` is either 0 or 2 depending on the first character in `s`.
     - If the first character in `s` is '+', `stones` becomes 2.
     - If the first character in `s` is '-', `stones` remains 0.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`.

3. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - We need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

4. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:
     - `n` is still the same integer.
     - `s` is still the same string, but one character has been processed.
     - `stones` retains its value based on the first character in `s`.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over each character in `s`, the next character in `s` will be processed in the next iteration.
   - `stones` will remain the same as it is determined by the first character in `s` and does not change within the loop.
   - The length of `s` is reduced by one because one character has already been processed.

6. **New State**:
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `s` is now a string one character shorter than before.
   - `stones` remains the same as it was determined by the first character in `s`.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

**`n` is an integer, `s` is a non-empty string consisting of `n-1` characters either "-" or "+", `stones` is either 0 or 2 depending on the first character in `s`.**

State: **`n` is an integer, `s` is a non-empty string consisting of `n-1` characters either "-" or "+", `stones` is either 0 or 2 depending on the first character in `s`**
