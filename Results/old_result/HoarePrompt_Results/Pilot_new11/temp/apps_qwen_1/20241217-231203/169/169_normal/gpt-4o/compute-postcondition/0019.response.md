Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `s` is a non-empty string consisting of `n-1` characters either "-" or "+`, `stones` is either 0 or 1 depending on the first character in `s`. If the `operation` is '-', `stones` is updated accordingly (either 0 or 1). Since there is no else part, `stones` remains unchanged if `operation` is not '-'***.
