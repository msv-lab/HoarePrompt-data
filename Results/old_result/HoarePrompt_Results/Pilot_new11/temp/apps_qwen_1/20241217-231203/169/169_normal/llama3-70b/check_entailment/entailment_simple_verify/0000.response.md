Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided annotated version of the code. The program correctly calculates the minimal possible number of stones in the pile after performing the given operations. The logic counts the number of operations that add a stone (`+`) and subtracts the number of operations that take away a stone (`-`). 

1. **Initial State**: The program starts by reading an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` containing characters `'-'` and `'+')`.
2. **Count Operations**: It then counts the number of `'-'` and `'+`' characters in the string `s` and stores them in `minus_count` and `plus_count` respectively.
3. **Condition Check**: The program checks if `minus_count` is greater than `plus_count`. If true, it prints `0` because it is not possible to have more removal operations than addition operations without violating the condition that the pile cannot be empty during removal operations.
4. **Result Calculation**: If `minus_count` is not greater than `plus_count`, it prints `plus_count - minus_count`, which gives the minimal number of stones left in the pile.

The annotated version confirms that the program behaves as expected and handles all scenarios correctly according to the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being True is valid.
