The code `stones = max(0, stones - 1)` impacts the value of `stones`. Initially, `stones` is 0. The expression `max(0, stones - 1)` evaluates to `max(0, 0 - 1)`, which simplifies to `max(0, -1)`, resulting in 0. Therefore, the value of `stones` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `s` is a non-empty string consisting of `n` characters either "-" or "+", `stones` is 0, and the operation is now set to '-'**
