Output State: **`n` is an integer, `s` is a non-empty string consisting of `n` characters either "-" or "+", and `stones` is the final value calculated based on the operations in `s`. If the first character in `s` is '+', `stones` will be the count of '+' operations minus the count of '-' operations (considering the initial value of `stones` as 0). If the first character in `s` is '-', `stones` will be the count of '+' operations minus the count of '-' operations, ensuring `stones` is never less than 0.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`.
- For each `'+'` operation, `stones` is incremented by 1.
- For each `'-'` operation, `stones` is decremented by 1, but it is constrained to be at least 0.
- After the loop completes, `stones` will be the net effect of all operations in `s`, starting from an initial value of 0.

Thus, the final value of `stones` is determined by the balance between the number of `'+'` and `'-'` operations in `s`.
