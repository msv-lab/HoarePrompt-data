Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `s` is a non-empty string consisting of `n-1` characters either "-" or "+`. Depending on the value of `operation`, `stones` is updated as follows: if `operation` is '+', `stones` is set to either 1 or 3. If `operation` is '-', `stones` is updated to either 0 or 1 depending on the first character in `s`. If `operation` is neither '+' nor '-', `stones` remains unchanged.***
