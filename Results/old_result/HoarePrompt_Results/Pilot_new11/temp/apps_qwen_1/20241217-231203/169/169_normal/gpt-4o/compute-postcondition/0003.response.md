According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute if `s` contains at least one character. Since `s` consists of `n` characters either "-" or "+", we need to ensure that `s` is not empty.

Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer input, `s` is a string input from the second line consisting of `n` characters either "-" or "+", and `stones` is 0. For the loop to execute, `s` must contain at least one character.

Let's summarize the necessary adjustments:

- `n` is already provided as an integer.
- `s` must be a non-empty string consisting of `n` characters either "-" or "+".
- `stones` is already 0.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `s` is a non-empty string.

State: **`n` is the integer input from the first line, `s` is a non-empty string consisting of `n` characters either "-" or "+", `stones` is 0**
