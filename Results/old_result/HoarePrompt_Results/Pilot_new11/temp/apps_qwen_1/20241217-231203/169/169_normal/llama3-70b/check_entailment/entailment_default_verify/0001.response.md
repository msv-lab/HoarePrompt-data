Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle the case where the initial number of stones is less than the number of subtraction operations. As explained, if the number of '-' operations exceeds the number of '+' operations, the program incorrectly prints 0, which is not the minimal possible number of stones in the pile. For example, if the input is:

```
3
---
```

The program outputs `0`, but the correct output should be `0` if we start with at least 3 stones, but if we start with fewer than 3 stones, the program fails to account for the possibility of an empty pile during subtraction operations. Therefore, the program is not correct for all potential cases.
