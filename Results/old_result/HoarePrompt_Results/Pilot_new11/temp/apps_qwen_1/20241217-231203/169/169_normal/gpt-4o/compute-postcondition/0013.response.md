The initial state is: `n` is an integer, `s` is a non-empty string consisting of `n` characters either "-", "+" or both, `stones` is 1, and the next `operation` is the first character in `s`.

The code snippet `stones = max(0, stones - 1)` impacts the following:
- The value of `stones` is updated to the maximum of 0 and the current value of `stones` minus 1. Since `stones` was initially 1, `stones - 1` equals 0, and `max(0, 0)` is 0. Thus, `stones` becomes 0.

The output state remains with the same information about `n`, `s`, and the precondition that the next operation is the first character in `s`. The only change is in the value of `stones`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `s` is a non-empty string consisting of `n` characters either "-" or "+", `stones` is 0, and the next `operation` is the first character in `s`.**
