Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the code fails to consider the initial number of stones in the pile. The problem statement requires finding the minimal possible number of stones in the pile after performing the given operations, starting from an unknown initial number of stones. However, the code only calculates the difference between the number of "+" and "-" operations, which does not account for the initial number of stones.

For example, consider the following inputs:

- Input:
```
3
---
```
Expected output: `0` (if Vasya starts with 3 stones, he can end up with 0 stones after performing the operations).

The code outputs `0`, which is correct in this specific case.

However, consider another input:

- Input:
```
2
-+
```
Expected output: `1` (if Vasya starts with 1 stone, he ends up with 1 stone after performing the operations).

The code outputs `1`, which is correct in this specific case.

But now consider:

- Input:
```
2
++
```
Expected output: `2` (if Vasya starts with 0 stones, he needs to start with at least 2 stones to end up with 2 stones after performing the operations).

The code incorrectly outputs `0`.

Since the code does not account for the initial number of stones, it fails to provide the correct minimal possible number of stones in the pile for all potential cases. Therefore, the code is not correct.
