Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the movement constraints and final position requirements as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not ensure that:

1. **Movement Constraints**: The program allows movements other than "North" or "South" when Limak is already at the North or South Pole, which violates the condition that Limak can only move South from the North Pole and North from the South Pole.
2. **Final Position**: The program does not explicitly check that the final latitude is exactly 90 degrees North (the North Pole). It instead checks if `curr_lat` is close to 90 degrees but does not account for floating-point precision issues.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
20000 South
10 East
20000 North
```
In this case, Limak moves 20000 km South from the North Pole, reaching the South Pole. He then moves 10 km East, which does not change his latitude but only changes his longitude. Finally, he moves 20000 km North, which should bring him back to the North Pole. However, due to the floating-point arithmetic used in the conversion from kilometers to latitude (using `t / 111.195`), the latitude might not be exactly 90 degrees North, causing the program to incorrectly output "NO".

To fix these issues, the program should:
- Ensure that movements are only allowed in the allowed directions when Limak is at the poles.
- Check that the final latitude is exactly 90 degrees North, possibly using a more precise comparison method to account for floating-point precision.
