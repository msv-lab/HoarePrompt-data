Functionality: **The function processes a series of movements in cardinal directions (North, South, West, East) and updates the current latitude accordingly. It ensures that the latitude remains within the valid range of -90 to 90 degrees. If the latitude reaches -90, the next movement must be North; if it reaches 90, the next movement must be South. If any movement results in the latitude exceeding the valid range or violates the above rules, the function prints 'NO' and exits. After processing all movements, if the final latitude is exactly 90 degrees, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If the final latitude is -90 and the last movement was not North, the function prints 'NO'.
- If the final latitude is 90 and the last movement was not South, the function prints 'NO'.
- If any movement causes the latitude to exceed -90 or 90, the function prints 'NO' and exits.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not handle movements in the West or East directions, which are not accounted for in the provided code. Therefore, these directions should be considered invalid and could potentially cause the function to print 'NO' if encountered.
