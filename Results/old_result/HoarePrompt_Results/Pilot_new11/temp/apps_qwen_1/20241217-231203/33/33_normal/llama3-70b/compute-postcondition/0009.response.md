`curr_lat` is reduced by `t / 111.195`. The value of `t` is an integer converted from the original string `t`, and the current value of `dir` is 'South'. The initial value of `curr_lat` is 90. After the subtraction, `curr_lat` will be `90 - t / 111.195`.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `curr_lat` is 90 - t / 111.195, `t` is an integer (converted from the original string `t`), `dir` is a string from the input split by space, `dir` is not equal to 'North', and the current value of `dir` is 'South'**
