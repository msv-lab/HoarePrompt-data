Postcondition: ***`position` is an integer, `dir` is a string representing a direction, `n` is `n-1`, `valid` is `False`, `t` is an integer representation of the second word from the input. If `dir` is 'South', then `position` is updated to `position + t`. Otherwise, if `position` is either 0 or 20000, the condition remains unchanged.***
