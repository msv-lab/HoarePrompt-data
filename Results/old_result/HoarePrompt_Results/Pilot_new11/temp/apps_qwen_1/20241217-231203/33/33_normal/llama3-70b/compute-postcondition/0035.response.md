The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately without further executing any code or modifying any variables. The variables `n` and `curr_lat` retain their initial states since no changes are made to them within the code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `curr_lat` is updated based on the direction `dir`. If `dir` is 'North', `curr_lat` is increased by `t / 111.195`. If `dir` is 'South', `curr_lat` is decreased by `t / 111.195`. Otherwise, `curr_lat` remains unchanged.**
