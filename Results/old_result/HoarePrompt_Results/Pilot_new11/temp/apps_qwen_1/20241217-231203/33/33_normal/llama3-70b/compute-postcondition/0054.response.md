The code snippet prints 'NO' to the console and terminates the program. This means that regardless of the values of `n`, `curr_lat`, `t`, and `dir`, the program will print 'NO' and the values of the variables will not be updated. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `curr_lat` is adjusted according to the direction specified by `dir`; if `dir` is 'North', `curr_lat` is its initial state plus `t / 111.195`, if `dir` is 'South', `curr_lat` is its initial state minus `t / 111.195`; in any other case, `curr_lat` remains within its initial state. `t` is the integer value of the original string `t`, and `dir` is the second value from input split by a space. The program prints 'NO' to the console.**
