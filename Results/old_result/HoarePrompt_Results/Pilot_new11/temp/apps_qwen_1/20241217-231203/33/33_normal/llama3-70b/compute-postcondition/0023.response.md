The code snippet `print('NO')` does not affect the values of any variables; it only prints the string 'NO' to the console. The variables `n` and `curr_lat` retain their initial values, and the condition about `dir` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `curr_lat` is 90, `dir` is not 'South', the printed output is 'NO'**
