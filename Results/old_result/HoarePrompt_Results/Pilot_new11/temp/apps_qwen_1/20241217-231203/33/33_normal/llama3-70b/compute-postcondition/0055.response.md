The code `exit()` is used to terminate the program immediately. This means that no further operations will be performed, and the current state of the variables will be the final state. In this case, the variables `n`, `curr_lat`, `dir`, and `t` will retain their last known values before the exit command.

Given the initial conditions:
- `n` is at least 1.
- `curr_lat` is adjusted according to the direction specified by `dir`.
- `t` is the integer value of the original string `t`.
- `dir` is the second value from input split by a space.

The output state after executing the `exit()` command is:

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `curr_lat` is adjusted according to the direction specified by `dir`, `t` is the integer value of the original string `t`, `dir` is the second value from input split by a space, the program prints 'NO' to the console, and the program terminates.**
