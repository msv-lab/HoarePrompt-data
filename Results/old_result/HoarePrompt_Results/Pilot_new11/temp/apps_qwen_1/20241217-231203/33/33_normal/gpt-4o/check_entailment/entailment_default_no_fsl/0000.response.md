Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, the code does not enforce the rule that if Limak is on the North Pole, he can only move to the South, and if he is on the South Pole, he can only move to the North. Hereâ€™s an example to illustrate this:

Consider the following input:
```
3
20000 South
10 East
20000 North
```

According to the problem description:
- Limak starts at the North Pole (position = 0).
- He moves 20000 kilometers South, reaching the South Pole (position = 20000).
- He then moves 10 kilometers East, which is allowed because he is not restricted by the North Pole/South Pole rules in this case.
- Finally, he moves 20000 kilometers North, back to the North Pole (position = 0).

However, the provided code allows this sequence of movements without checking the constraints on moving between the poles. This means the code incorrectly accepts this input, leading to a false positive.

The code should include checks to ensure that:
- When Limak is at the North Pole (position = 0), he can only move South.
- When Limak is at the South Pole (position = 20000), he can only move North.

To fix this, you need to add these conditional checks within the loop.
