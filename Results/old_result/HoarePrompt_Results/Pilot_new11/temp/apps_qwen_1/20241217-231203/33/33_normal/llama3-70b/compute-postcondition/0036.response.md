Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, and `curr_lat` is updated based on the direction `dir`. If `dir` is 'North', `curr_lat` is increased by `t / 111.195`. If `dir` is 'South', `curr_lat` is decreased by `t / 111.195`. If `curr_lat` is outside the range [-90, 90], the function does nothing. Otherwise, `curr_lat` remains within the valid latitude range.***
