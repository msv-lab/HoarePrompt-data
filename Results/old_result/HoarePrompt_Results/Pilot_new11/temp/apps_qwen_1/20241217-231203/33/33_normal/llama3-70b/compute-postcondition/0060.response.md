Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `t_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t_i` ≤ 10^6 for each i (1 ≤ i ≤ `n`), `dir_i` is a string representing the direction ("North", "South", "West", "East"), `curr_lat` is the final latitude after all valid directions are applied, `curr_lat` is within the range [-90, 90]. If `curr_lat` is 90, `dir` must be 'South' for the loop to continue without termination. If `curr_lat` is -90, `dir` must be 'North' for the loop to continue without termination. If the loop terminates due to invalid conditions, the printed output is 'NO'.**
