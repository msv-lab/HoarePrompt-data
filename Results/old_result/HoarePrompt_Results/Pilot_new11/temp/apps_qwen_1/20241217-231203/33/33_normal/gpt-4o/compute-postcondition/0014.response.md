The variable `valid` is set to `False`. All other variables retain their previous values. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`position` is the value of `t`, `dir` is 'South', `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `valid` is False, `t` is an integer, and the current value of `position` + `t` is greater than 20000.**
