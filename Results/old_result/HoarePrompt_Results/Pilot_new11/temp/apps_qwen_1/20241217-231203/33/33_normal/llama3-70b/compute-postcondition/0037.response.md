The code `print('NO')` simply prints the string 'NO' to the console. It does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, and `curr_lat` is updated based on the direction `dir`. If `dir` is 'North', `curr_lat` is increased by `t / 111.195`. If `dir` is 'South', `curr_lat` is decreased by `t / 111.195`. If `curr_lat` is outside the range [-90, 90], the function does nothing. Otherwise, `curr_lat` remains within the valid latitude range. Print statement outputs 'NO'**
