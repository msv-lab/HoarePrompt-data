`position` is updated to the value of `t` (which is an integer), and `dir` is updated to the value of `dir` (which is a string representing a direction). The values of `n`, `t_i`, `dir_i`, and `valid` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`position` is the value of `t`, `dir` is the value of `dir`, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, for each i where 1 ≤ i ≤ n, `t_{i}` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t_{i} ≤ 10^6 and `dir_{i}` is a string representing a direction ("North", "South", "West", "East"), `valid` is True**
