Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to verify if Limak's journey adheres to the given conditions. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Initial Latitude Check**: The program initializes `curr_lat` to 90, representing the North Pole.
2. **Iterating Through Movements**: For each movement, it updates the current latitude based on the direction and distance.
3. **Boundary Checks**: It ensures that the current latitude stays within the range of -90 to 90 degrees (equivalent to the Southern and Northern poles).
4. **Direction Validation**: It checks if moving North when at the South Pole or moving South when at the North Pole results in an invalid state and prints "NO" immediately.
5. **Final Position Check**: After processing all movements, it checks if Limak ends up at the North Pole (90 degrees latitude).

Given these checks, the program correctly validates the conditions specified in the problem description for all possible inputs, ensuring that no invalid moves occur and the final position is always at the North Pole. Therefore, the program is correct.
