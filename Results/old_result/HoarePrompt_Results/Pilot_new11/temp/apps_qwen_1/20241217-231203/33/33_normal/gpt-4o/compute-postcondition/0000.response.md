`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which means it takes an integer input from the user within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 50. The values of `t_{i}` and `dir_{i}` for each `i` where 1 ≤ i ≤ n remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, for each i where 1 ≤ i ≤ n, `t_{i}` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t_{i} ≤ 10^6 and `dir_{i}` is a string representing a direction ("North", "South", "West", "East"). `n` is updated to the integer input from the user.**
