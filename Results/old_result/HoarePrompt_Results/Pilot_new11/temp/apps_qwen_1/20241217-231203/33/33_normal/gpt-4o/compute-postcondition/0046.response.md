`t` is assigned the value of `int(t)`, which converts the string representation of the second word from the input into an integer. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `position` is an integer, `dir` is a string representing a direction, `n` is 1 or more, `valid` is `False`, `t` is an integer.

Output State: **`position` is an integer, `dir` is a string representing a direction, `n` is 1 or more, `valid` is `False`, `t` is an integer**
