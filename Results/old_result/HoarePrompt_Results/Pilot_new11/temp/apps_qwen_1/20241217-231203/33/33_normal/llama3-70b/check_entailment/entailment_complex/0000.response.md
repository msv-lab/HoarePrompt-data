Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Initial Latitude and Input Handling**: 
   - The program initializes `curr_lat` to 90, which represents the starting point at the North Pole.
   - It reads the number of movements (`n`) and iterates through each movement, updating `curr_lat` based on the direction and distance specified.

2. **Latitude Update Logic**:
   - For each movement, the program updates `curr_lat` based on the direction:
     - Moving North increases the latitude.
     - Moving South decreases the latitude.
   - The program uses the conversion factor `111.195` to convert kilometers to degrees of latitude, which is appropriate given the assumption of a spherical Earth.

3. **Validation of Movement Directions**:
   - The program checks if the updated latitude exceeds the valid range of -90 to 90 degrees and prints "NO" and exits if it does.
   - If `curr_lat` becomes -90, the next movement must be "North". If any other movement is attempted, the program prints "NO" and exits.
   - Similarly, if `curr_lat` becomes 90, the next movement must be "South". If any other movement is attempted, the program prints "NO" and exits.

4. **Final Latitude Check**:
   - After processing all movements, the program checks if `curr_lat` is exactly 90 degrees. If it is, the program prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Summary:
The program correctly enforces the constraints described in the problem statement. It ensures that:
- Movements are valid based on the current latitude.
- The journey ends on the North Pole (latitude 90).
- Invalid movements (such as moving South from the North Pole or moving North from the South Pole) are detected and handled appropriately.

Since the program accurately implements the logic required by the problem statement for all possible inputs, the program is correct.
