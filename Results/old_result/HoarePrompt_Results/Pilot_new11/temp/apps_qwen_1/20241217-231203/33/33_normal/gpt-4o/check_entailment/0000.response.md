Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the condition that Limak can only move South if he is on the North Pole and can only move North if he is on the South Pole. For example, consider the following input:

```
2
20000 South
10000 North
```

In this case, Limak starts at the North Pole. After moving 20,000 kilometers South, he should be at the South Pole. However, the program allows him to move 10,000 kilometers North from the South Pole, which is not allowed according to the problem description. This violates the rule that he can only move North from the South Pole. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
