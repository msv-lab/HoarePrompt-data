Postcondition: ***`position` is updated based on the value of `dir`. If `dir` is 'South', `position` is updated to `position` + `t`. Otherwise, `position` is set to `t`. The value of `n` remains unchanged, `dir` is set to the original value of `dir`, and `valid` is always `False`. `t` and `valid` retain their original values unless `position` is set to `t` and meets certain conditions (0 or 20000 with `dir` as 'West' or 'East'), in which case `valid` is set to `False`.***
