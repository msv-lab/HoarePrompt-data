Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Specifically, the program does not correctly enforce the constraints related to Limak's movement from the North Pole to the South Pole and vice versa. Here are the key issues:

1. **Movement Validation from the North Pole:**
   - The program checks if `position - t < 0` when `dir` is 'North', which means it checks if Limak is moving northward and if his new position would be less than 0. However, the problem statement explicitly states that if Limak is at the North Pole, he can only move southward. The current implementation allows him to move northward from the North Pole, which violates the rule.

2. **Movement Validation from the South Pole:**
   - Similarly, the program checks if `position + t > 20000` when `dir` is 'South', meaning it checks if Limak is moving southward and if his new position would exceed 20000. However, the problem statement states that if Limak is at the South Pole, he can only move northward. The current implementation allows him to move southward from the South Pole, which also violates the rule.

3. **Ending Condition:**
   - The program correctly checks if the final position is 0, but it does not properly enforce the movement constraints for each step of the journey.

To fix these issues, the program needs to ensure that:
- If Limak is at the North Pole (`position == 0`), the only allowed directions are 'South'.
- If Limak is at the South Pole (`position == 20000`), the only allowed directions are 'North'.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    position = 0
    valid = True
    
    for _ in range(n):
        t, dir = input().split()
        t = int(t)
        
        if position == 0 and dir != 'South':
            valid = False
        elif position == 20000 and dir != 'North':
            valid = False
        elif dir == 'North':
            position -= t
        elif dir == 'South':
            position += t
        elif dir in ('West', 'East'):
            valid = False
        
        if position < 0 or position > 20000:
            valid = False
    
    if position != 0:
        valid = False
    
    if valid:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```

In this corrected version:
- The program checks if the position is 0 and the direction is not 'South'.
- The program checks if the position is 20000 and the direction is not 'North'.
- The program does not allow 'West' or 'East' movements at any point, ensuring Limak stays on the equator.

This ensures that the program correctly enforces all the movement constraints described in the problem statement.
