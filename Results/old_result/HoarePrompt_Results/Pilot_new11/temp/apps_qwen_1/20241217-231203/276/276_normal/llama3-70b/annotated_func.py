#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters, representing a number in the golden system.
def func_1(s):
    q = (math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2
    decimal = 0
    for (i, c) in enumerate(reversed(s)):
        decimal += int(c) * q ** i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters, `c` is the character at the corresponding position in the original string `s`, `i` is the length of `s` minus the current iteration count, `decimal` is the sum of `int(c) * q
    return decimal
    #The program returns the sum of the integer value of each character 'c' in the string 's' multiplied by its positional factor 'q', where 'q' is calculated as the length of 's' minus the current iteration count
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting of '0' and '1' characters and returns the sum of each character's value (considering '0' as 0 and '1' as 1) multiplied by its positional factor, which is the length of the string minus the current iteration count. The positional factor is determined using the golden ratio `(math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2` and applied to each character in reverse order. The function iterates over the reversed string, calculating the weighted sum of each character.
