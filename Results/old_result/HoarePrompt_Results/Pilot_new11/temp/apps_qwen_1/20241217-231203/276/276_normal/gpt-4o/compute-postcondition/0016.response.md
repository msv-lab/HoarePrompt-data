Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` consisting of '0' and '1' characters, representing a number in the golden system notation. It calculates the value of the string `s` based on the golden ratio `q`, where `q = (5 ** 0.5 + 1) / 2`. The function then returns this calculated value. However, the code simplifies the calculation such that regardless of the input string `s`, the returned value is always 5. There are no edge cases considered within the provided code, and the calculation logic only leads to the constant value 5, irrespective of the input string.**
