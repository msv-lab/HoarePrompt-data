Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code provides clear insights into the state of the program at different points and aligns well with the logic described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` correctly converts a number from the golden system to its decimal value by iterating over the string in reverse order and applying the positional factor derived from the golden ratio. The main part of the program correctly compares the decimal values of the two numbers and outputs the appropriate symbol ('>', '<', or '=') based on their comparison. There are no discrepancies or logical errors identified from the provided annotations and the original problem description. Therefore, the program meets the requirements and is correct.
