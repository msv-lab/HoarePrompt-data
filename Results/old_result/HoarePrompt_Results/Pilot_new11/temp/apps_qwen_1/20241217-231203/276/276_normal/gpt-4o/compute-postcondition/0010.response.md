Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `s` is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters.
   - `q` is 5.
   - `value` is either 5 (if `s[i]` is '0') or 10 (if `s[i]` is '1').
   - `i` is 5.
   - `n` is greater than 5.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(n)`.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current State Analysis:**
   - Since `i` is currently 5 and `n` is greater than 5, the condition `i < n` is true.
   - Therefore, the loop will execute one more time.

4. **State Adjustments:**
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 6.
   - The value of `value` will be determined by the character at `s[6]`:
     - If `s[6]` is '0', then `value` will be 5.
     - If `s[6]` is '1', then `value` will be 10.
   - The other states (`s`, `q`, and `n`) remain unchanged because they are not affected by the loop itself.

Based on this analysis, the new state at the start of the next iteration will be:

**State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters, `q` is 5, `value` is either 5 (if `s[6]` is '0') or 10 (if `s[6]` is '1'), `i` is 6, `n` is greater than 5**
