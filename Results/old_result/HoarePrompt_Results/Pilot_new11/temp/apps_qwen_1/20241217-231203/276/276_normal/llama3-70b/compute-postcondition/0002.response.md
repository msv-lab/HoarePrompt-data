To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop starts. The loop iterates over the reversed version of the string `s` using `enumerate`, which means:

1. `s` must be a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters as stated.
2. The variable `c` will take the value of each character in the reversed string `s` during each iteration.
3. The variable `i` will be the index of the current character in the reversed string.

Given these points, the initial state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can begin executing. Specifically:

- `s` must be a non-empty string (which is already given).
- `c` should start with the last character of `s` (since the string is reversed), and `i` should start with the length of `s` minus one (the index of the last character in the reversed string).

So, the required adjustments are:

- `s` is a non-empty string.
- `c` is the last character of `s`.
- `i` is the length of `s` minus one.

Therefore, the final state is:

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `c` is the last character of `s`, `i` is the length of `s` minus one, `decimal` is 0**
