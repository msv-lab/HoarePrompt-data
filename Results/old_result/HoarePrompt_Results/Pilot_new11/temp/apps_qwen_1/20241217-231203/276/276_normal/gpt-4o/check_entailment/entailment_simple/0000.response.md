Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to compare two numbers in the golden system. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Golden Value**: The function `func_1` calculates the decimal value of a single number in the golden system, but it does not compare two such values. It simply sums the contributions of each digit weighted by powers of \( q \). However, the program does not use these calculated values to compare the two numbers.

2. **Comparison Logic Missing**: After calculating the values of both strings using `func_1`, the program should compare these values to determine which is greater. However, the program directly prints the comparison result without actually performing the comparison of the computed values. For instance, it should check if `value1 > value2`, `value1 < value2`, or `value1 == value2`.

To correct this, the program should calculate the decimal values of both input strings and then compare these values. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(s):
    q = (5 ** 0.5 + 1) / 2
    value = 0
    n = len(s)
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '1':
            value += q ** (n - i - 1)
    return value

s1 = input().strip()
s2 = input().strip()

value1 = func_1(s1)
value2 = func_1(s2)

if value1 > value2:
    print('>')
elif value1 < value2:
    print('<')
else:
    print('=')
```

In this corrected version:
- The function `func_1` correctly computes the decimal value of a number in the golden system.
- The main part of the program uses the results from `func_1` to compare the two numbers and prints the appropriate symbol (`>`, `<`, or `=`) based on their decimal values.
