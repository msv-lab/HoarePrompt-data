Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information
- `s` is a non-empty string.
- `c` is the second-to-last character of `s`.
- `i` is the length of `s` minus two.
- `decimal` is `2 * int(c) * q`.

### For Loop
The for loop iterates over the reversed string `s` using `enumerate`, which provides both the index and the character.

### Current State
- `s` is a non-empty string.
- `c` is the second-to-last character of `s`.
- `i` is the length of `s` minus two.
- `decimal` is `2 * int(c) * q`.

### Understanding the Loop
- The loop starts from the last character of `s` and moves towards the first character.
- In the last iteration, `c` is the second-to-last character, and `i` is the length of `s` minus two.

### Next Iteration
- For the loop to execute one more time, it needs to move to the third-to-last character of `s`.
- This means `i` will be decreased by 1, making `i` equal to `length_of_s - 3`.
- Since we are iterating through the reversed string, the new value of `c` will be the third-to-last character of `s`.

### Adjusted States
- `s` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
- `c` becomes the third-to-last character of `s`.
- `i` becomes the length of `s` minus three.
- `decimal` remains unchanged as it is not dependent on the loop iteration but on the initial values of `c` and `q`.

### Final Answer
State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `c` is the third-to-last character of `s`, `i` is the length of `s` minus three, `decimal` is `2 * int(c) * q`**
