Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the golden system comparison as described in the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` calculates the decimal value of a single number in the golden system, but it does not compare two numbers as required. 

The problem requires comparing two numbers, but the code only computes the value of a single number and compares these values. This approach fails to correctly handle cases where the lengths of the strings differ, or where the leading digits are the same but subsequent digits differ.

For example, consider the following inputs:
- Input 1: `110`
- Input 2: `101`

According to the golden system, both `110` and `101` represent the same value, which is \( q^2 + q = ((\sqrt{5} + 1)/2)^2 + (\sqrt{5} + 1)/2 = 1.618033988^2 + 1.618033988 \approx 3.236 \).

However, the current implementation would compute:
- For `110`: \( q^2 + q + 1 = 1.618033988^2 + 1.618033988 + 1 \approx 4.236 \)
- For `101`: \( q^2 + q = 1.618033988^2 + 1.618033988 \approx 3.236 \)

This results in the incorrect output of `>` instead of `=`.

To fix this, the code needs to implement a comparison mechanism that accounts for the full representation of the golden numbers, including handling cases where the strings have different lengths or the same leading digits but differ later on.
