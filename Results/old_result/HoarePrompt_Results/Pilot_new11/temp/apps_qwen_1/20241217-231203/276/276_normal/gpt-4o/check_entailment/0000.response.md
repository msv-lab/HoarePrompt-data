Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the golden system comparison. Specifically, the `func_1` function only calculates the decimal value of the given golden number but does not compare two numbers as required by the problem description. The program should compare the decimal values of the two inputs directly, but it only computes the value of the first input and compares it with the computed value of the second input, which is incorrect. 

For instance, consider the following inputs:
- Input 1: `1000`
- Input 2: `111`

The program would compute:
- Value of `1000` as approximately \(1.618033988^3 \approx 4.236\)
- Value of `111` as approximately \(1.618033988^2 + 1.618033988 + 1 \approx 5.236\)

However, the program only computes the value of the first input and compares it with the computed value of the second input, which leads to incorrect results. It should compare both values directly:

```python
s1 = input().strip()
s2 = input().strip()
value1 = func_1(s1)
value2 = func_1(s2)
if value1 > value2:
    print('>')
elif value1 < value2:
    print('<')
else:
    print('=')

def func_1(s):
    q = (5 ** 0.5 + 1) / 2
    value = 0
    n = len(s)
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '1':
            value += q ** (n - i - 1)
    return value
```

This approach still does not correctly handle the comparison of two numbers in the golden system. A correct solution would involve comparing the two numbers directly without computing their decimal values separately.
