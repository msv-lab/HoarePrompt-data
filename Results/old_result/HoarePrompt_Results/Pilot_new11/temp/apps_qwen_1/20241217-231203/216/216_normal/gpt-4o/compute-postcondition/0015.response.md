Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 200\), `s` is a non-empty string, `max_count` remains 0, `current_set` is a set containing at least one unique character plus `char` if `char` is lowercase, otherwise `current_set` is an empty set, and `current_count` is 1 if `char` is lowercase and not already in `current_set`, otherwise it remains 0.***
