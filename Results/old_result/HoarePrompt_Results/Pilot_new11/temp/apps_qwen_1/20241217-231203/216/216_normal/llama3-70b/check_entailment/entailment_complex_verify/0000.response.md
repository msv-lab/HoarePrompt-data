Final: **False**

Reason: Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the program does not correctly implement the requirement that there should be no uppercase letters between the selected positions in the pretty set. The annotated version confirms that the program only counts the indices of lowercase letters without checking for any uppercase letters between them. For instance, in the input "aaaaBaabAbA", the program would incorrectly count positions 6 and 8 as part of the pretty set, even though there is an uppercase 'B' between these positions. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate as the program fails to meet the problem description's requirements.
