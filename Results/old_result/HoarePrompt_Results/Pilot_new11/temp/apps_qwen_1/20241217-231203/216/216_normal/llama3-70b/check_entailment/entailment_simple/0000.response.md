Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. Specifically, the program only considers positions where the letters are lowercase and does not ensure that there are no uppercase letters between the selected positions. The program simply prints the count of all lowercase letters' positions, which does not satisfy the condition that no uppercase letters should be present between the selected positions.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to find the maximum number of non-overlapping lowercase letters' positions such that no uppercase letter is between them. The current implementation does not enforce this constraint, making it incorrect according to the problem statement.
