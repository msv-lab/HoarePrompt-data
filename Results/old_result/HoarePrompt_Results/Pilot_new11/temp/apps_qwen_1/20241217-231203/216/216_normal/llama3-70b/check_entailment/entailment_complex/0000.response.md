Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, the program simply counts the number of lowercase letters in the string without considering the constraints related to the positions of these lowercase letters and the presence of uppercase letters between them.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to:
1. Identify all positions of lowercase letters.
2. Ensure that no two selected positions have uppercase letters between them.
3. Determine the maximum number of such positions.

The current implementation only identifies the positions of lowercase letters and prints their count, which does not satisfy the conditions required to form a "pretty" set of positions. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
