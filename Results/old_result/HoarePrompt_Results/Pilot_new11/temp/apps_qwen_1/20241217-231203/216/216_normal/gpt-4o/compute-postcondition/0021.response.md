`current_set` is cleared, which means it is now an empty set. The values of the other variables (`n`, `s`, `max_count`, and `current_count`) remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 200\), `s` is a non-empty string, `max_count` is 1, `current_set` is an empty set, and `current_count` remains 0**.
