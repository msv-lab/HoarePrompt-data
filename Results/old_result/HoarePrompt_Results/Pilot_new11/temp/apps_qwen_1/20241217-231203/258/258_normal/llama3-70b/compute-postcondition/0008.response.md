The `times` list is sorted using the `sort()` method. Sorting a list does not return a new list but sorts the original list in-place. The sorting process arranges the elements in ascending order. Given that `times` is a list of two integers, sorting it will not change its length or the fact that it contains exactly two elements.

The initial state is:
- `x` is an integer in the range \([-1000, 1000]\)
- `y` is an integer in the range \([-1000, 999]\)
- `times` is a sorted list of two integers in the range \([-1000, 1000]\)
- `ans` is the minimum between the current value of `ans` and `times[1]`

After sorting, the `times` list will still contain two integers, but they will be in ascending order. The value of `ans` remains unchanged because the sorting operation does not affect `ans`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer in the range \([-1000, 1000]\), `y` is an integer in the range \([-1000, 999]\), `times` is a sorted list of two integers in the range \([-1000, 1000]\), `ans` is the minimum between the current value of `ans` and `times[1]`**
