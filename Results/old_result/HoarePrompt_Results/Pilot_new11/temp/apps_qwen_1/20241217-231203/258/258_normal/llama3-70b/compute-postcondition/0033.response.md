The initial state includes `x` being -999, `y` being within the range -1000 to 1000, and `times` being a sorted list containing [-999, `y`]. The code assigns the minimum value between `ans` (which is initially unspecified but does not affect the list or its elements) and `times[K - 1]` to `ans`. Since `K` is not specified, let's assume `K` is 1 for simplicity (the most straightforward case), which means `times[K - 1]` is `times[0]`, which is -999.

Given this, the value of `times[K - 1]` is -999, and since `-999` is the minimum value between `ans` (initially unspecified) and -999, `ans` is set to -999.

Output State: **`x` is -999, `y` is within the range -1000 to 1000, `times` is a sorted list containing [-999, `y`], `ans` is -999**
