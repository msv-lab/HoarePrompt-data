The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `meats`, `K`, and `T`. 

- `meats` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (x_i, y_i, c_i) representing the coordinates and hardness of the i-th piece of meat.
- `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= K <= N, where N is the length of the `meats` list.
- `T` is an integer.

The function has multiple return cases:
- Case_1 through Case_9 all return True.
- Case_10 returns False.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of tuples `meats`, a positive integer `K`, and an integer `T`, and return True in most cases (Cases 1 through 9) and False in one specific case (Case 10).
