The code `index += 3` increments the value of `index` by 3. Initially, `index` is 2. After the increment, `index` becomes 5. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is:

**`data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting an input, `N` is a positive integer, `meats` is a list containing one tuple `(x, y, c)`, `index` is 5, `x` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `y` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[4]`.**
