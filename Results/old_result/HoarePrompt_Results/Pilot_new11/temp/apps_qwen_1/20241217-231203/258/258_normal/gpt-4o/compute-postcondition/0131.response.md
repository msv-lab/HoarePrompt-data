The code `continue` is used in a loop to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, all the variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`dx` is \((x1 - x2) / 2\), `dy` is \((meats[j][1] - meats[i][1]) / 2\), `d2` is \(\left( \frac{x1 - x2}{2} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{meats[j][1] - meats[i][1]}{2} \right)^2\), `d` retains its value, `cx` is \((x1 + x2) / 2\), `cy` is \((y1 + y2) / 2\), `count` retains its value, `j` is `i + 1`, `x2` is equal to `meats[i][0]`, `y2` is equal to `meats[i][1]`, `c2` is equal to `meats[i][2]`, `x1` is equal to `meats[j][0]`, `y1` is equal to `meats[j][1]`, `c1` is equal to `meats[j][2]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
