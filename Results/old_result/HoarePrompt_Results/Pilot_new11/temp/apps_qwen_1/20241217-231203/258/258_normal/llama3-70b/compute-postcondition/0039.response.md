The code `times = func_2(x, y, x, y)` calls the function `func_2` with arguments `x`, `y`, `x`, and `y`. Given the initial state where `x` is -999 and `y` is -1000, `func_2(-999, -1000, -999, -1000)` will return a sorted list of two elements with these values.

Since the exact implementation of `func_2` is not provided, we assume it returns the sorted list of its arguments. Therefore, `func_2(-999, -1000, -999, -1000)` will return `[-1000, -999]`.

After the assignment, `times` is now `[-1000, -999]`, and the other variables (`x`, `y`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is -999, `y` is -1000, `times` is [-1000, -999], `ans` is -999**
