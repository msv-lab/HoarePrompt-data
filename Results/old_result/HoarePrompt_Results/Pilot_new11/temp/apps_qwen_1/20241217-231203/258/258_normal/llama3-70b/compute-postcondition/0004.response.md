`times` is the return value of `func_2(x, y, x, y)`. The code sorts the list `times`. Since the exact values of `x` and `y` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact sorted values of `times`. However, we know that `times` was originally a list containing two elements, both of which are integers in the range [-1000, 1000].

After sorting, the output state will have `times` as a sorted list of its original elements.

Output State: **`x` is an integer in the range [-1000, 1000], `y` is an integer in the range [-1000, 1000], `times` is a sorted list of two integers in the range [-1000, 1000]**
