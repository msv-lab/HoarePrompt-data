According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop runs from `j = i + 1` to `j = N - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:

- `dx` is \((x1 - x2) / 2\)
- `dy` is \((y1 - y2) / 2\)
- `d2` is \(((x1 - x2) / 2)\)
- `mx` is \(cx + dy * \mathsqrt{(d2 * d - d * d)} / d2\)
- `my` is \(cy - \mathsqrt{d}\)
- The count is determined by the condition \(c * \mathsqrt{(mx - x1)} < \mathsqrt{d2 * (N - i - 1)}\)

At the end of the last iteration, the value of `j` is one less than the upper bound of the loop, which is `N`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be equal to `i + 1`.

Let's adjust the states accordingly:

- `dx` remains \((x1 - x2) / 2\)
- `dy` remains \((y1 - y2) / 2\)
- `d2` remains \(((x1 - x2) / 2)\)
- `mx` remains \(cx + dy * \mathsqrt{(d2 * d - d * d)} / d2\)
- `my` remains \(cy - \mathsqrt{d}\)
- For the loop to execute, `j` must be `i + 1`

Therefore, the updated state is:

State: **`dx` is \((x1 - x2) / 2\), `dy` is \((y1 - y2) / 2\), `d2` is \(((x1 - x2) / 2)\), `mx` is \(cx + dy * \mathsqrt{(d2 * d - d * d)} / d2\), `my` is \(cy - \mathsqrt{d}\), and `j` must be `i + 1`**
