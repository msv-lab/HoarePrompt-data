The code `times.sort()` sorts the list `times`. However, the initial values of `x`, `y`, `ans`, and `times` are not fully specified in the initial state, and no specific operations on these variables are mentioned. Therefore, the only operation that changes the state is sorting `times`.

- `x` and `y` remain unchanged as they are not involved in the sorting operation.
- `ans` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the sorting operation.
- `times` is sorted, but its contents are not specified in the initial state.

Given this, the output state will reflect the sorting operation on `times`.

Output State: **`x` is `x_current + 1` if `x_current < 1000`, otherwise `x` is `-1000`; `y` must iterate through the range \([-1000, 1000]\); `ans` is the minimum value of the K-th smallest element from all times lists generated during the loop iterations; `times` is sorted.**
