The function `func_2` accepts four floating-point numbers `x`, `y`, `X`, and `Y`, and a list of tuples `meats` where each tuple contains three integers (x_i, y_i, c_i). It returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a hardness value `c` from the `meats` list multiplied by the result of `func_1(x, y, X, Y)` for the corresponding coordinates. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the annotations, but the function assumes that `meats` is a non-empty list. If `meats` is empty, the function would return an empty list, which is not explicitly stated in the annotations.
