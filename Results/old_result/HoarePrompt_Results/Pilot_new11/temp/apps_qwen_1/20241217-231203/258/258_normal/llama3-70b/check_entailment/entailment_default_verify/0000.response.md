Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly solve the problem because it only checks integer coordinates for the heat source, while the problem description specifies that the coordinates \(X\) and \(Y\) are real numbers. The output hints confirm this by stating that the function `func_3()` iterates over all possible integer values of `x` and `y` within the range \([-1000, 1000]\). This approach will miss the optimal solution where the heat source is placed at a non-integer coordinate, leading to a suboptimal result. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and must be revised to consider real-number coordinates for the heat source.
