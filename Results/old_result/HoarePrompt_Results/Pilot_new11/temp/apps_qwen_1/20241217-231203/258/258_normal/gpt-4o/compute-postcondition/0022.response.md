`index` is incremented by 3. Initially, `index` was 12, so after incrementing, `index` becomes 15. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting an input, `N` must be greater than 1, `meats` is a list containing [tuple_from_data_8_to_10, tuple_from_data_8_to_10, (x, y, c)], `index` is 15, `x` is the integer value of `data[12]`, `y` is the integer value of `data[13]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[14]`.**
