`K` is assigned the value `int(data[1])`, which means `K` is now the integer value of the second element in the list `data`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting an input, `N` is the integer value of the first element in `data`, `K` is the integer value of the second element in `data`, `meats` is a list of tuples (x, y, c) representing the coordinates and hardness of each piece of meat, where the length of `meats` is equal to `N`.
