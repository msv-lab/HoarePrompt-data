The code updates the variable `ans` by setting it to the minimum between its current value and `times[K - 1]`. However, the initial state does not specify the exact value of `ans` or `times[K - 1]`. Since the code only modifies `ans`, the updated value of `ans` will be the minimum of its current value and `times[K - 1]`.

Given the initial state, we know:
- `x` is `x_current + 1` if `x_current < 1000`, otherwise `-1000`.
- `y` is `-997`.
- `ans` is the minimum between its current value and `times[K - 1]`.
- `times` is sorted in ascending order.

Since the code only affects `ans`, the output state will reflect this change.

Output State: **`x` is `x_current + 1` if `x_current < 1000`, otherwise `-1000`; `y` is `-997`; `ans` is the minimum between its current value and `times[K - 1]` after updating it to be the minimum of its current value and `times[K - 1]`; `times` is sorted in ascending order.**
