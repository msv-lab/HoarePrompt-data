The function `func_2(x, y, x, y)` is called with the same arguments `x` and `y`. Given that `x` is `x_current + 1` if `x_current < 1000`, otherwise `x` is `-1000`, and `y` is \(-998\), the function `func_2` will return a value based on these inputs. However, the specific implementation of `func_2` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact value returned by `func_2`. Therefore, we only know that `times` is set to the return value of `func_2(x, y, x, y)`, and `times` is sorted.

Given the initial conditions, the only variables affected by the code are `times`, which is updated to the return value of `func_2(x, y, x, y)`, and `times` is sorted. The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is `x_current + 1` if `x_current < 1000`, otherwise `x` is `-1000`; `y` is \(-998\); `times` is sorted and equals to the return value of `func_2(x, y, x, y)`**
