The `times` list is already sorted, so calling `times.sort()` again does not change its order. However, the fact that `times` is sorted is now explicitly known. The states of the other variables (`x`, `y`, and `ans`) are not affected.

Output State: **`x` is an integer in the range \([-1000, 1000]\), `y` is 1000, `times` is a sorted list of two integers \([a, b]\), `ans` is the minimum between its current value and `b`.**
