`cy` is assigned the value `(y1 + y2) / 2`. The value of `y1 + y2` divided by 2 will give us the new value of `cy`. Since `cx` is already defined as the average of `x1` and `x2`, this new assignment does not affect the values of `cx`, `x1`, or `x2`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `d2`, `d`, `N`, `meats`, `i`, `cx`, `y1`, `y2`, `dx`, `dy`, `mx`, `my`, `count`, `d` remain unchanged, `cy` is the average of `y1` and `y2`.
Output State: **`d2`, `d`, `N`, `meats`, `i`, `cx` is the average of `x1` and `x2`, `y1`, `y2`, `dx`, `dy`, `mx`, `my`, `count`, `d` remain unchanged, `cy` is the average of `y1` and `y2`.**
