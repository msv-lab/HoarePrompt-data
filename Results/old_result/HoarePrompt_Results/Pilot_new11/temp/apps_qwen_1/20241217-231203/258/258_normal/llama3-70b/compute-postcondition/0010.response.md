Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial States:**
   - `x` is an integer in the range \([-1000, 1000]\).
   - `y` is an integer in the range \([-1000, 999]\).
   - `times` is a sorted list of two integers in the range \([-1000, 1000]\).
   - `ans` is the minimum between its current value and `times[1]` (which is `times[1]` after the assignment).

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `y` in the range from \(-1000\) to \(1000\).

3. **End of Previous Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `y` was some value within the range \([-1000, 999]\).

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be in the next possible range of values. Since the loop iterates from \(-1000\) to \(1000\), and assuming the loop just finished iterating over a value in the range \([-1000, 999]\), the next value of `y` would be \(1000\).

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `x` remains unchanged as it was not involved in the loop condition.
   - `y` changes to \(1000\) because the loop is about to start a new iteration.
   - `times` and `ans` remain unchanged as they were not involved in the loop condition.

6. **Final State:**
   - `x` is an integer in the range \([-1000, 1000]\).
   - `y` is \(1000\).
   - `times` is a sorted list of two integers in the range \([-1000, 1000]\).
   - `ans` is the minimum between its current value and `times[1]` (which is `times[1]` after the assignment).

Therefore, the updated state is:

State: **`x` is an integer in the range \([-1000, 1000]\), `y` is 1000, `times` is a sorted list of two integers in the range \([-1000, 1000]\), `ans` is the minimum between its current value and `times[1]` (which is `times[1]` after the assignment)**
