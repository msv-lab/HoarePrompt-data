Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables and Their Initial States:**
   - `data`: A list of strings obtained from splitting an input.
   - `N`: An integer value of the first element in `data`.
   - `K`: An integer value of the second element in `data`.
   - `meats`: An empty list.
   - `index`: 2.

2. **Understand the For Loop:**
   ```python
   for _ in range(N):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```
   This loop runs `N` times, where `N` is the number of elements in the `data` list (excluding the first two elements since they are used for `N` and `K`).

3. **Determine the Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop requires `N` to be a positive integer. If `N` is less than or equal to 0, the loop will not execute.
   - The `range(N)` function will generate numbers from 0 to `N-1`. Since we are using `_` as the loop variable (which is common when we don't care about the actual value), we only need to ensure that `N` is a positive integer.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - We need to ensure that `N` is a positive integer. Therefore, `N` should be greater than 0.
   - The initial state of `data`, `meats`, and `index` do not directly affect the loop's execution, but they should remain as given since they are not modified within the loop.

### Final State:

Given the analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `N` must be greater than 0.

Thus, the final state is:

State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting an input, `N` is a positive integer, `meats` is an empty list, `index` is 2**
