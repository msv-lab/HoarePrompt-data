The `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the remaining part of the current iteration and move on to the next iteration, but it does not change the values of any variables. All the variables retain their previous values. 

Output State: **`dx` retains its value, `dy` retains its value, `d2` retains its value, `mx` retains its value, `my` retains its value, `j` is `i + 1`, `x2` is equal to `meats[i][0]`, `y2` is equal to `meats[i][1]`, `c2` is equal to `meats[i][2]`, `x1` is equal to `meats[j][0]`, `y1` is equal to `meats[j][1]`, `c1` is equal to `meats[j][2]`, `d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T`, `cx` retains its value, `cy` retains its value, `count` retains its value, and the loop moves to the next iteration.**
