Postcondition: ***`dx` retains its value, `dy` retains its value, `d2` retains its value, `mx` retains its value, `my` retains its value, `j` is `i + 1`, `x2` is equal to `meats[i][0]`, `y2` is equal to `meats[i][1]`, `c2` is equal to `meats[i][2]`, `x1` is equal to `meats[j][0]`, `y1` is equal to `meats[j][1]`, `c1` is equal to `meats[j][2]`, `d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T`, `cx` retains its value, `cy` retains its value, `count` retains its value, and the loop either continues to the next iteration if `d < 0` or does not change if there is no else part.***
