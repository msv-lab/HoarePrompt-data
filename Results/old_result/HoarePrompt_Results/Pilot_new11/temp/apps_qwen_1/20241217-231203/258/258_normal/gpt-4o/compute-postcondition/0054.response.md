The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. It does not affect the values of any variables outside the loop. Since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement will not change any variable values or add any specific information to the output state.

Given the initial state and the fact that the `continue` statement does not modify any variable values:

Output State: **`d2`, `d`, `N`, `meats`, `i`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `mx`, `my`, `count`, `d` remain unchanged**
