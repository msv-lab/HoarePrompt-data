The code calculates `mx` using the formula `mx = cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`. Let's break down the calculation:

1. `mx` is calculated using the provided formula.
2. `cx` remains unchanged.
3. `dy` remains unchanged.
4. `d2` remains unchanged.
5. `d` remains unchanged.

Given the formula `mx = cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, we can simplify it since `d * d` is the same as `d2` (because `d2 = dx^2 + (y1 - y2)^2 / 4` and assuming `d` is a constant or previously defined).

Thus, the term `d2 * d - d * d` simplifies to `d2 * d - d2` which further simplifies to `d2 * (d - 1)`.

Since `d2` is part of the denominator and the numerator is `dy * math.sqrt(d2 * (d - 1))`, we get:

\[ mx = cx + \frac{dy \cdot \math.sqrt(d2 \cdot (d - 1))}{d2} \]

This results in:

\[ mx = cx + \frac{dy \cdot \sqrt{(dx^2 + (y1 - y2)^2 / 4) \cdot (d - 1)}}{dx^2 + (y1 - y2)^2 / 4} \]

Given that the initial state of the variables is:

- `i` is `i_end - 1`
- `N` is greater than `i_end`
- The condition `c1 * T < c2 * T` is false
- `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `d`, `x2`, `y2`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx` remain unchanged
- `dy` is \((y1 - y2) / 2\)
- `d2` is \(dx^2 + \left(\frac{y1 - y2}{2}\right)^2\)

After executing the code, the only new value is `mx`.

Output State: **`i` is `i_end - 1`, `N` is greater than `i_end`, the condition `c1 * T < c2 * T` is false, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `d`, `x2`, `y2`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx` remain unchanged, `dy` is \((y1 - y2) / 2\), `d2` is \(dx^2 + \left(\frac{y1 - y2}{2}\right)^2\), `mx = cx + \frac{dy \cdot \sqrt{(dx^2 + (y1 - y2)^2 / 4) \cdot (d - 1)}}{dx^2 + (y1 - y2)^2 / 4}`**
