`cy` is assigned the value `(y1 + y2) / 2`. The value of `cx` remains unchanged from its previous value, which was `(x1 + x2) / 2`. The value of `d` remains unchanged and is still less than 0 and equal to `d / (c1 * c2)`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, `N`, `i`, `meats`, `d`, `cx`, `cy` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, and `count` remain unchanged; `d` is less than 0 and equal to `d / (c1 * c2)`**
