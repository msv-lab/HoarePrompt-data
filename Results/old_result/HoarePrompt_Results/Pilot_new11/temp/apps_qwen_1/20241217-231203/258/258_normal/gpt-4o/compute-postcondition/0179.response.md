The `continue` statement in the code does not affect any of the variables' values. It simply moves to the next iteration of the loop it is inside, but does not change any variable values. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `i_end - 1`, `j` is `i_end`, `N` is greater than `i_end`, the condition `c1 * T < c2 * T` remains false, `x1` is `meats[i_end - 1][0]`, `y1` is `meats[i_end - 1][1]`, `c1` is `meats[i_end - 1][2]`, `x2` is `meats[j][0]`, `y2` is `meats[j][1]`, `c2` is `meats[j][2]`, `d` is `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is `(meats[i_end - 1][0] + meats[j][0]) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(meats[i_end - 1][0] - meats[j][0]) / 2`, `dy` is `(meats[i_end - 1][1] - meats[j][1]) / 2`, `d2` is `((meats[i_end - 1][0] - meats[j][0]) / 2)^2 + ((meats[i_end - 1][1] - meats[j][1]) / 2)^2`, `mx`, `my` are unchanged, `count` is less than `K`.**
