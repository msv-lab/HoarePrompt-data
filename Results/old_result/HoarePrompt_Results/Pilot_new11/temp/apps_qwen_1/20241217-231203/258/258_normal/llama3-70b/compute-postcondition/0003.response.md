The code snippet provided is:

```python
times = func_2(x, y, x, y)
```

Let's analyze the impact of this code on the program:

1. **Function Call**:
   - `func_2(x, y, x, y)` is called with four arguments: `x`, `y`, `x`, and `y`.
   - The function `func_2` is not defined in the provided context, so we cannot determine what it does exactly. However, we know that it returns a value, which is assigned to the variable `times`.

2. **Variables**:
   - `x` and `y` are passed as arguments twice to the function `func_2`.
   - After the function call, the result of `func_2(x, y, x, y)` is assigned to `times`.

3. **State Update**:
   - The variable `times` now holds the return value of `func_2(x, y, x, y)`.
   - The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged.

Given the above points, the output state after executing the provided code is:

Output State: **`x` is an integer in the range [-1000, 1000], `y` is an integer in the range [-1000, 1000], `times` is the return value of `func_2(x, y, x, y)`**
