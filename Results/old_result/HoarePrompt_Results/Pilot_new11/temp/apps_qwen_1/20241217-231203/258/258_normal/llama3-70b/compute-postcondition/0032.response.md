The `times` variable holds the return value of `func_2(-999, y, -999, y)`. The `sort()` method sorts the list in-place, meaning it modifies the list itself without returning a new list. After sorting, the `times` list will contain two elements: `-999` and `y`, which is within the range of -1000 to 1000. 

Output State: **`x` is -999, `y` is within the range -1000 to 1000, `times` is a sorted list containing [-999, `y`]**
