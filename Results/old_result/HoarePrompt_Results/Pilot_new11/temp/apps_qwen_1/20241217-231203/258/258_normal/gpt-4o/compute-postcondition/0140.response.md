Let's break down the given for loop and determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute:

Given for loop:
```
for j in range(i + 1, N):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Initial state before the loop starts:
- `i` is `i_end - 1`
- `N` must be greater than `i_end - 1`

To understand if the loop can execute, we need to check the conditions for the `range` function:
- The start of the range is `i + 1`
- The end of the range is `N`

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Determine the start of the range:**
   - The start of the range is `i + 1`.
   - Given that `i` is `i_end - 1`, the start of the range becomes `(i_end - 1) + 1 = i_end`.

2. **Determine the end of the range:**
   - The end of the range is `N`.
   - We know from the initial state that `N` must be greater than `i_end - 1`.

3. **Check the validity of the range:**
   - For the range to be valid and non-empty, the start (`i_end`) must be less than the end (`N`).
   - Therefore, `i_end < N`.

4. **Identify additional states needed:**
   - The variable `j` will be used as the loop counter, starting from `i_end` and ending just before `N`.
   - However, no specific value for `j` is required before the loop starts since the loop will start with `j = i_end` and increment until it reaches `N`.

### Conclusion:

The loop will execute if `i_end < N` because this ensures that the range is non-empty.

### Final Answer:

State: **`i` is `i_end - 1`, `N` must be greater than `i_end`**
