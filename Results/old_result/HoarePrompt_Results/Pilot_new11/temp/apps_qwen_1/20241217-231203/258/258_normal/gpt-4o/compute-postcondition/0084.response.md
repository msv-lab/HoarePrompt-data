`dx` is assigned the value `(x1 - x2) / 2`. The value of `x1` and `x2` will be used to calculate `dx`. The other variables are not affected.

Given the initial state, we know:
- `dx = (x1 - x2) / 2`
- All other variables (`y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, `N`, `i`, `meats`, `d`, `cx`, `cy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, and `count`) remain unchanged.
- `d` is less than 0 and equal to `d / (c1 * c2)`

Output State: **`dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, `N`, `i`, `meats`, `d` is less than 0 and equal to `d / (c1 * c2)`, `cx`, `cy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, and `count` remain unchanged.**
