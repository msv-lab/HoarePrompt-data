The function `func_1` accepts four floating-point numbers `x`, `y`, `X`, and `Y` representing coordinates on a 2D plane. It calculates and returns the Euclidean distance between the coordinates `(x, y)` of a piece of meat and the coordinates `(X, Y)` of a potential heat source. The Euclidean distance is computed using the formula `math.sqrt((X - x)
