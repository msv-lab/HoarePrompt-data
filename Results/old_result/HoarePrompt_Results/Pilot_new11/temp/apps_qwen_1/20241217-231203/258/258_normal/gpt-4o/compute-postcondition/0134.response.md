Given the code snippet and the initial state, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate `d2`**: This value remains the same as calculated initially.
2. **Simplify the term under the square root**: As previously determined, \(d2 * d - d^2 = 0\).
3. **Calculate `my`**:
   \[
   my = cy - dx * \frac{\sqrt{d2 * d - d^2}}{d2} = cy - dx * \frac{\sqrt{0}}{d2} = cy - dx * 0 = cy
   \]

Thus, `my` ends up being equal to `cy`.

### Output State:
- `dx` is \((x1 - x2) / 2\)
- `dy` is \((meats[j][1] - meats[i][1]) / 2\)
- `d2` is \(\left( \frac{x1 - x2}{2} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{meats[j][1] - meats[i][1]}{2} \right)^2\)
- `d` retains its value
- `cx` is \((x1 + x2) / 2\)
- `cy` is \((y1 + y2) / 2\)
- `count` retains its value
- `j` is `i + 1`
- `x2` is equal to `meats[i][0]`
- `y2` is equal to `meats[i][1]`
- `c2` is equal to `meats[i][2]`
- `x1` is equal to `meats[j][0]`
- `y1` is equal to `meats[j][1]`
- `c1` is equal to `meats[j][2]`
- `mx` is equal to `cx`
- `my` is equal to `cy`
