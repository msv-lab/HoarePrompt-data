The code `c = int(data[index + 2])` impacts the variable `c` by assigning it the value of `data[index + 2]` converted to an integer. Given the initial state, `index` is 2, so `data[index + 2]` corresponds to `data[4]`. Therefore, `c` is assigned the integer value of `data[4]`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is:

**`data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting an input, `N` is a positive integer, `meats` is an empty list, `index` is 2, `x` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `y` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[4]`.**
