The function `func` accepts two parameters: `x`, which is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and 1000 inclusive, and `y`, which is also a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and 1000 inclusive. The parameter `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.

Based on the given constraints and relationships, the function has two cases:
- Case_1: The function returns the sum of elements in list `x`.
- Case_2: The function returns the sum of elements in list `y`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a list `x` and a list `y`, both containing `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and 1000 inclusive, and `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, and it returns the sum of elements in either list `x` or list `y` depending on the case.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, where `x` and `y` are lists of `n` integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) with each integer between 0 and 1000 inclusive. It returns the sum of elements in either list `x` or list `y` depending on the case.**
