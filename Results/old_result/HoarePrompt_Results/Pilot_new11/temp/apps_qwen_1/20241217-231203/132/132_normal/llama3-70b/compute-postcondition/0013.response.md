Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `x` is a list of `n` integers, and `y` is a list of `n` integers. If the sum of elements in `x` is not equal to the sum of elements in `y`, the function prints 'No'. Otherwise, `x` is sorted in ascending order and `y` is sorted in ascending order. If the sorted `x` is equal to the sorted `y`, the function continues without any change. If `x` is not equal to `y`, the console prints 'No'.***
