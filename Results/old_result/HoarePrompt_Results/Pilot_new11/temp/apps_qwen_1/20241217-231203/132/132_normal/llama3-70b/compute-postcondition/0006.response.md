The code `x.sort()` sorts the list `x` in ascending order. Since the initial state includes that `x` and `y` are lists of `n` integers each, and the sum of elements in `x` is equal to the sum of elements in `y`, the sorting operation does not affect the sum of the elements in `x` or `y`. However, the order of elements in `x` changes.

The Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `x` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, `y` is a list of `n` integers, and the sum of elements in `x` is equal to the sum of elements in `y`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `x` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, `y` is a list of `n` integers, and the sum of elements in `x` is equal to the sum of elements in `y`.**
