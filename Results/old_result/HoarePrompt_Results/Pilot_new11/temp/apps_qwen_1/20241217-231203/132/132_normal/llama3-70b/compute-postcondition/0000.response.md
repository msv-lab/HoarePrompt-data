`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which means `n` is now an integer entered by the user within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 50. The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `x` and `y` are lists of `n` integers each where 0 ≤ x[i] ≤ 1000 and 0 ≤ y[i] ≤ 1000 for all i in range(n)**.
