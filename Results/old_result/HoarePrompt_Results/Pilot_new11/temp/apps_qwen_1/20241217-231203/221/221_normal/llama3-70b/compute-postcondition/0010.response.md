Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer between 2 and \(10^{12}\), `x` is an integer between 0 and \(10^{12}\), `count` is 2, `a` is 2, `b` is `s - 2`, and the current value of \(a \oplus b\) is \(2 \oplus (s - 1)\). This holds true whether \(a \oplus b\) equals `x` or not, as the else part does not change these variables' states.***
