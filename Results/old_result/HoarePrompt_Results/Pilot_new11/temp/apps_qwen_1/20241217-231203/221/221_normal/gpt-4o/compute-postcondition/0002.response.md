The function `func` accepts two parameters `s` and `x`. Both `s` and `x` are non-negative integers such that `2 ≤ s ≤ 10^12` and `0 ≤ x ≤ 10^12`. The function has two cases based on the relationship between `s` and `x`:

- **Case_1:** If `x` is greater than `s`, the function returns an error message indicating that `x` cannot be greater than `s`.
- **Case_2:** If `x` is less than or equal to `s`, the function returns the result of dividing `s` by `x`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two parameters `s` and `x` and return either an error message if `x` is greater than `s` or the result of dividing `s` by `x` if `x` is less than or equal to `s`.
