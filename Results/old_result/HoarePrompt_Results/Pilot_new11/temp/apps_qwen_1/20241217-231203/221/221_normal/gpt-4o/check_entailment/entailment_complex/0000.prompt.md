You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Two positive integers a and b have a sum of s and a bitwise XOR of x. How many possible values are there for the ordered pair (a, b)?


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers s and x (2 ≤ s ≤ 10^12, 0 ≤ x ≤ 10^12), the sum and bitwise xor of the pair of positive integers, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer, the number of solutions to the given conditions. If no solutions exist, print 0.


-----Examples-----
Input
9 5

Output
4

Input
3 3

Output
2

Input
5 2

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first sample, we have the following solutions: (2, 7), (3, 6), (6, 3), (7, 2).

In the second sample, the only solutions are (1, 2) and (2, 1).
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s and x are non-negative integers such that 2 ≤ s ≤ 10^12 and 0 ≤ x ≤ 10^12.
def func():
    a = b ^ x
    b = a ^ x
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` accepts two parameters `s` and `x`, both non-negative integers with `2 ≤ s ≤ 10^12` and `0 ≤ x ≤ 10^12`. It first performs a bitwise XOR operation between `b` and `x`, storing the result in `a`, and then performs another XOR operation between `a` and `x`, storing the result in `b`. However, the function does not use the values of `a` and `b` for any calculations or return values. Instead, it checks if `x` is greater than `s` and returns an error message if true. If `x` is less than or equal to `s`, it returns the integer division of `s` by `x`. Therefore, the final state of the program after the function concludes is that `a` and `b` are updated based on the XOR operations, but their values are not returned or used further. The function returns either an error message or the result of integer division `s // x` based on the comparison between `s` and `x`.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
