Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer between 2 and \(10^{12}\), `x` is an integer between 0 and \(10^{12}\), `count` is 3, `a` is 3, `b` is `s - 3`, and the current value of \( a \oplus b \) is \( 2 \oplus (s - 1) \). This state occurs if and only if \( a \oplus b = x \). Otherwise, the postcondition remains as the initial state where `count` is 2, and other variables retain their initial values.***
