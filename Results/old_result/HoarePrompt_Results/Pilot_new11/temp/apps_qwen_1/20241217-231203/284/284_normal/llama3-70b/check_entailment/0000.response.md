Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find a counterexample for the given hypothesis. For any input `n`, it iterates through values of `m` from 1 to 1000 and checks if `n * m + 1` is a composite number using the `func_1` function. The `func_1` function correctly determines if a number is prime by checking divisibility up to the square root of the number. Since it is guaranteed that there exists at least one valid `m` within the specified range, the program will always find and print a valid `m`. Thus, the program works correctly for all potential cases.
