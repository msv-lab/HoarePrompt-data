Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program is designed to find a counterexample for PolandBall's hypothesis, which states that there exists a positive integer \( n \) such that for each positive integer \( m \), the expression \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is a prime number. The program aims to disprove this hypothesis by finding an \( m \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number.

#### Key Points:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads an integer \( n \) from the input, ensuring \( 1 \leq n \leq 1000 \).
2. **Search for Counterexample**: The program iterates over possible values of \( m \) (from 1 to 1000) and checks whether \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is a prime number using the `func_1` function.
3. **Prime Number Check**:
   - The function `func_1` efficiently checks if a number \( x \) is prime.
   - It handles small cases directly (numbers less than or equal to 3).
   - For larger numbers, it uses a trial division method starting from 5, checking divisibility up to the square root of \( x \).

#### Detailed Analysis:
- **Functionality**: The main logic of the program correctly implements the task of finding an \( m \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number. It uses a straightforward approach to check each value of \( m \) until it finds a non-prime.
- **Efficiency**: The function `func_1` is efficient enough to handle the constraints (values of \( x \) up to 1000001, given \( 1 \leq n \leq 1000 \)).
- **Guaranteed Answer**: Since it is guaranteed that an answer exists (as per the problem statement), the program will always find a valid \( m \) within the specified range (1 to 1000).

Given that the program meets all the requirements and constraints described in the problem, the correctness is **True**.
