Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to find a counterexample for PolandBall's hypothesis. The function `func_1` accurately checks whether a number is prime according to the provided output hints. The program iterates through values of \( m \) from 1 to 1000 and uses `func_1` to determine if \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is a prime number. Since the problem guarantees that an answer exists within the specified range, the program will always find and print a valid \( m \). Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the output hints support its correctness.
