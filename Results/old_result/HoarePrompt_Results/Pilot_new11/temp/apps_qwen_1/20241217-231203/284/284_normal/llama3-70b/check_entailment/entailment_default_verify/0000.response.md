Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to find a counterexample for PolandBall's hypothesis. It iterates through values of `m` from 1 to 1000 and uses the `func_1` function to check if `n * m + 1` is a composite number. The `func_1` function correctly determines if a number is prime by checking divisibility up to the square root of the number. Since it is guaranteed that there exists at least one valid `m` within the specified range, the program will always find and print a valid `m`. The output hints confirm that the function `func_1` works as expected for determining primality. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the output hints support its correctness.
