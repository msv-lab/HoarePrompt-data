Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code provides a clear and detailed breakdown of the states and conditions within the program. It confirms that the program correctly implements the logic to find a counterexample for PolandBall's hypothesis. Specifically:

1. The program correctly reads an integer input \( n \).
2. It iterates through values of \( m \) from 1 to 1000 and calculates \( n \cdot m + 1 \).
3. It uses the function `func_1` to check if the calculated value is a prime number.
4. The function `func_1` correctly handles edge cases and efficiently checks for primality by ensuring that no divisors exist up to the square root of the number, skipping even numbers and multiples of 3.
5. The program prints the first \( m \) that makes \( n \cdot m + 1 \) non-prime and exits, satisfying the problem requirements.

Given these points, the program correctly identifies a counterexample for any given \( n \) within the specified range, thus proving PolandBall's hypothesis false. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the final assessment remains **True**.
