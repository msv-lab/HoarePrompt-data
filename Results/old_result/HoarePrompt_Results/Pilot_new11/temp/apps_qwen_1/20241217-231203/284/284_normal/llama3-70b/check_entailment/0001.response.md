Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly identifies a counterexample for the given hypothesis. For any input \( n \) within the specified range, the program iterates through possible values of \( m \) (from 1 to 1000) and checks if \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is a composite number using the `func_1` function. The `func_1` function correctly determines whether a number is prime or not by checking divisibility up to the square root of the number. Since the problem guarantees that there is always a valid \( m \) for any \( n \) within the given range, the program will eventually find and print such an \( m \). Therefore, the program meets the requirements for all potential cases.
