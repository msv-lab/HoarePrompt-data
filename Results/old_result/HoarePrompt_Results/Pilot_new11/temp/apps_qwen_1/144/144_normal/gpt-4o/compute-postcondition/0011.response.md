Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\).
   - If `num` (the current element being processed in the list) is greater than or equal to 3, `mex` (the smallest non-negative integer not present in the list) is set to 3. Otherwise, `mex` remains 2.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over each element `num` in the list `a`.
   - For the loop to execute again, there must be at least one more element in the list to process.

3. **State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - We need to determine what the state will be at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

4. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, letâ€™s assume we have processed an element `num` from the list `a`.
   - Since the list is sorted, if `num` was the last element, the next element does not exist, and the loop would terminate.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute again, the list must have at least one more element to process.
   - Additionally, since `num` was processed, it means the list now has one less element than before the loop started.

5. **Updated State**:
   - The list `a` now has `n-1` elements.
   - `num` will be the next element in the list that needs to be processed.
   - The value of `mex` remains unchanged unless the new `num` (which is the next element) is greater than or equal to 3.

Given this analysis, the updated state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`a` is a sorted list of `n-1` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `n` is now `n-1`, and `mex` is either 2 or 3 depending on the next element `num`.** 

Since we don't know the exact value of `num` yet, we'll keep `mex` as it is until the next assignment. 

Therefore, the final state is:

State: **`a` is a sorted list of `n-1` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `n` is `n-1`, and `mex` is either 2 or 3.**
