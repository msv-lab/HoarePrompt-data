The value of `mex` is incremented by 1. Since `mex` was either 2 or 3, incrementing it by 1 changes its value to 3 or 4 respectively. The values of `a` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of `n-1` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `n` is `n-1`, and `mex` is either 3 or 4.**
