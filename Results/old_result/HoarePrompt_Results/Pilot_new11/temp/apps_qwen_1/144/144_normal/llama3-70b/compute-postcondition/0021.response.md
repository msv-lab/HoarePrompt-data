Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `arr` is a non-empty list containing at least two elements, `mex` is either 1 or 2. If `num` equals `mex` (which is 2), then the values of `n`, `arr`, and `mex` remain unchanged. If `num` does not equal `mex`, the values of `n`, `arr`, and `mex` remain unchanged since there is no specific action defined in the else part.***
