Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `arr` is a non-empty list containing at least two elements, `mex` is either 1 or 2. If `num > mex`, the relationship among these variables remains unchanged. Since there is no else part, the postcondition is the same as the precondition under the if condition.***
