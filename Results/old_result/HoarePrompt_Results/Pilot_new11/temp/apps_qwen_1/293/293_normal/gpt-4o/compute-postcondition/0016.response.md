The code `current_node = 2 * current_node + 1` impacts the variable `current_node`. Initially, `current_node` is either 1 or 2 depending on the first character of the original `path`. Let's consider both cases:

1. If `current_node` is 1, then `current_node = 2 * 1 + 1 = 3`.
2. If `current_node` is 2, then `current_node = 2 * 2 + 1 = 5`.

The other variables (`total_leaves`, `visited_count`, `path`, and `current_level`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `total_leaves` is 2, `visited_count` is 2, `path` is the remaining part of the original path (one character shorter), `current_level` is 1, `current_node` is either 3 or 5.

Output State: **`total_leaves` is 2, `visited_count` is 2, `path` is the remaining part of the original path (one character shorter), `current_level` is 1, `current_node` is either 3 or 5**.
