Functionality: **The function reads two integers \( h \) and \( n \) from standard input, where \( 1 \leq h \leq 50 \) and \( 1 \leq n \leq 2^h \). It then converts \( n \) into its binary representation (excluding the leading '1') and traverses a binary tree of height \( h \) according to the binary digits of \( n \). For each binary digit, it simulates moving left (if the digit is '0') or right (if the digit is '1') in the tree. The function counts the number of nodes visited during this traversal. After completing the traversal, it prints the count of visited nodes.**

This summary covers the following:
- The function accepts no explicit parameters; instead, it reads \( h \) and \( n \) from standard input.
- It ensures \( h \) and \( n \) are within their specified ranges.
- It converts \( n - 1 \) to its binary form and pads it with zeros to match the length \( h \).
- It simulates a traversal through a binary tree of height \( h \), starting from the root.
- It counts the number of nodes visited during the traversal.
- The final printed output is the number of nodes visited.
