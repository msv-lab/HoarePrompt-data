`total_leaves` is assigned the value `2 ** h`. This operation calculates the total number of leaves in a complete binary tree of height `h`. The values of `h` and `n` remain unchanged, and the reassignment of `input` to `sys.stdin.read` does not affect the values of other variables.

Output State: **`h` is an integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 50; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^`h`; `total_leaves` is 2 ** `h`; `input` is reassigned to `sys.stdin.read`**
