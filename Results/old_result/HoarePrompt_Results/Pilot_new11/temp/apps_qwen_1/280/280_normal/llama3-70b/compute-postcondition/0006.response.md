Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   The loop condition is `range(t - 1, 0, -1)`. This means the loop will start from `t - 1` and decrement by 1 until it reaches 0.

2. **Determine the Valid Range for `i`:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `t - 1` is greater than or equal to 0.
   - Since `t` is defined as an integer such that `2 ≤ t ≤ 100`, the smallest value `t` can take is 2.
   - Therefore, `t - 1` will always be at least 1 (since `2 - 1 = 1`).

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - We need to ensure that `t` is within the valid range `[2, 100]`.
   - We also need to set `i` to the starting point of the loop, which is `t - 1`.

### Adjusted States

Given the constraints and the loop condition, we need to adjust the following states:

- `t` should be within the range `[2, 100]`.
- `i` should be initialized to `t - 1`.

### Final Answer

State: **`v1` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v1 ≤ 100, `v2` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v2 ≤ 100, `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100, `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10, `max_speed` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2`, `min_speed` is the minimum of `v1` and `v2`, `max_length` is `max(v1, v2) * t`, `min_length` is `min_speed * t`, `i` is `t - 1`**.
