The code initializes an empty list named `cycle`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, or `visited[i]`. Therefore, the value of `i` remains 0, `n` remains an integer within the specified range, and `visited[i]` remains False.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), and `visited[i]` is False; `cycle` is an empty list**
