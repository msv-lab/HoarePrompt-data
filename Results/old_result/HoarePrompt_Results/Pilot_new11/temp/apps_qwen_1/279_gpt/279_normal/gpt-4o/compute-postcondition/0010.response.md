`x` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `i` is 0, so `x` is also 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `visited[0]` is False; `cycle` is an empty list, `x` is 0.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `visited[0]` is False; `cycle` is an empty list, `x` is 0**
