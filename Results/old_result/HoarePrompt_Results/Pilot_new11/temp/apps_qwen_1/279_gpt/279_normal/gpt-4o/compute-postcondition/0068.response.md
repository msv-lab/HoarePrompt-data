Postcondition: ***`no_reverse_components` is the sum of boolean values based on the condition `all(b[x] == 0 for x in cycle)` for each cycle in `cycles`; `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `visited` is a list where each element is either `True` or `False` depending on whether the corresponding index was part of any cycle; `cycles` is a list of lists where each inner list represents a cycle found in the graph represented by `p`, and `p` and `b` are lists of integers as originally defined. If `len(cycles) == 1`, the function does not change `no_reverse_components`. Otherwise, the function prints `no_reverse_components` if it is greater than 0, otherwise it prints `1`.***
