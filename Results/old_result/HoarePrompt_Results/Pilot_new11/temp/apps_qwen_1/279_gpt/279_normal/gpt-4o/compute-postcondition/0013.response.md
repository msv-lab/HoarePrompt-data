`cycle.append(x)` appends the current value of `x` to the list `cycle`. Since the initial value of `x` is 0, `cycle` now contains `[0]`. The values of the other variables (`i`, `n`, `visited[0]`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `visited[0]` is True; `cycle` is [0], `x` is 0**
