`cycles.append(cycle)` appends the current `cycle` to the list `cycles`. The `cycle` list contains all elements in the cycle starting from 1 until the last element `x` which is `p[x] - 1`, and all elements in `cycle` are marked as `True` in the `visited` list. The values of `i`, `n`, and `visited` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `cycle` contains all elements in the cycle starting from 1 until the last element `x` which is `p[x] - 1`, `x` is `p[x] - 1`, and all elements in `cycle` are marked as `True` in the `visited` list; `cycles` now includes the appended `cycle`**
