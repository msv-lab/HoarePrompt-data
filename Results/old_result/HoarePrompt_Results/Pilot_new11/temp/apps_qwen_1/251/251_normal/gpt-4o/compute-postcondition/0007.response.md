Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `cakes` is a list of tuples `(r_i, h_i)`, `volumes` is a list of volumes calculated as \( \pi \times r_i^2 \times h_i \) for each cake, `dp` is a list of `n` zeros where the first element is now equal to `volumes[0]`, `i` is 1 (or greater), and `i` is less than `n`. For all `j` such that `volumes[j] < volumes[i]`, `dp[i]` is updated to be `max(dp[i], dp[j] + volumes[i])`.***
