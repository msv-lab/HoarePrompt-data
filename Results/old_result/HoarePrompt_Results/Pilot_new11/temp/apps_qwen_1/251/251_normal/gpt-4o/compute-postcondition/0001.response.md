`n` is assigned the value `int(data[0])`. This means `n` is now an integer derived from the first element of the list `data`. The radius and height of the cakes (`cakes`) and the list of strings (`data`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `cakes` is a list of tuples where each tuple (r_i, h_i) represents the radius and height of the i-th cake such that 1 ≤ r_i, h_i ≤ 10 000, and `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.**
