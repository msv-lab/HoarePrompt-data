Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `total` is 0
   - `i` is `n`
   - `j` ranges from 0 to `n-1`
   - For every valid `j`, if `volumes[j]` is less than `volumes[i]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + volumes[i]`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `dp[i]` and `dp[j]`.

2. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - For each `i`, it checks all `j` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - It updates `dp[i]` based on the condition mentioned.

3. **State Analysis at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop just ended, `i` was equal to `n` at the end of the previous iteration.
   - Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` will be incremented to `n+1`.
   - The range for `j` remains from 0 to `n-1`.

4. **Updated States:**
   - `total` remains 0 as there are no operations that change it outside the loop.
   - `i` will be `n+1` because it is incremented after each iteration.
   - `j` still ranges from 0 to `n-1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `n+1`, `j` ranges from 0 to `n-1`**
