`r` and `h` are assigned the values obtained from the input, which are split and converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The values of `n` and `cakes` remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 and `cakes` is an empty list is still valid.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `cakes` is an empty list, `r` is an input integer, `h` is an input integer**
