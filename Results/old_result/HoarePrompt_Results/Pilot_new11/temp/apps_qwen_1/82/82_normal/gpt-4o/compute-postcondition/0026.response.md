The code `current_lcm = func_2(new_a, new_b)` does not provide the exact definition of `func_2`, but we know that `func_2` likely calculates something related to `new_a` and `new_b`. However, since `func_2` is not defined in the snippet, we can only say that `current_lcm` is assigned the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.

- `new_a` is the nearest multiple of the current `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a` and is calculated as `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.
- `new_b` is the nearest multiple of the current `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b` and is calculated as `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.

The states of the other variables (`a`, `candidate`, `diff`, `b`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state remains as follows:

Output State: **`a` is the nearest multiple of the current `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`; `candidate` is unchanged; `new_a` is the nearest multiple of the current `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a` and is calculated as (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate; `diff` is the absolute value of `a - b` and is at least 1; `new_b` is the nearest multiple of the current `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b` and is calculated as (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate; `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`**.
