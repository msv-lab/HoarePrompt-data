The code `a, b = b, a % b` updates the values of `a` and `b`. Given the initial state where `a` is `b` and `b` is non-zero, let's substitute the initial values into the code.

1. Initially, `a = b` and `b` is non-zero.
2. After executing the line `a, b = b, a % b`:
   - `a` is now set to `b`.
   - `b` is set to `a % b`, which is `b % b`.

Since `b % b` is always 0 (for any non-zero `b`), `b` will be 0 after the operation.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`a` is `b`, `b` is 0**
