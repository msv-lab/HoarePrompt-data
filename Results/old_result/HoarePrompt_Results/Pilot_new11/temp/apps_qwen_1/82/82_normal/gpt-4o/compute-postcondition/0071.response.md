The code `min_k = candidate` assigns the value of `candidate` to `min_k`. Since `candidate` can be either `k` or `diff // k`, `min_k` will take the value of whichever `candidate` was assigned. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`new_a` is \((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\); `a` is an integer; `b` is an integer; `diff` is the absolute value of `a - b`; `k` is a positive integer; `diff // k` is an integer; `new_b` is \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\); `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`; `min_k` is `candidate`.**
