The line `min_lcm = current_lcm` updates the value of `min_lcm` to be equal to `current_lcm`. Since `current_lcm` is already defined in the initial state, the value of `min_lcm` will be updated to match `current_lcm`. The other variables are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `b` is `b + new_candidate - 1`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` is `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_lcm` is `current_lcm`, `min_k` is `min((diff // k), min_k)` if the conditions are met.**
