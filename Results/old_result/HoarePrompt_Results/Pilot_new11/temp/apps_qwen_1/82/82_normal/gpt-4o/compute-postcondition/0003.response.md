The code `diff = abs(a - b)` calculates the absolute difference between `a` and `b` and assigns it to the variable `diff`. Since `a` and `b` are integers within the range \(1 \le a, b \le 10^9\) and \(a \neq b\), the value of `diff` will be a non-zero integer. The original values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is an integer such that \(1 \le a \le 10^9\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \le b \le 10^9\) and \(a \neq b\), `diff` is the absolute value of \(a - b\)**
