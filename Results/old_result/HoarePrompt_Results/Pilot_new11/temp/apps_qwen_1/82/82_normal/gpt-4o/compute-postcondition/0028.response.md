The code assigns the value of `candidate` to `min_k`. This does not change the values of `a`, `new_a`, `diff`, `new_b`, `current_lcm`, `min_lcm`, or `candidate`. The only change is that `min_k` now holds the value of `candidate`.

Output State: **`a` is the nearest multiple of the current `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`; `candidate` is unchanged; `new_a` is the nearest multiple of the current `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a` and is calculated as (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate; `diff` is the absolute value of `a - b` and is at least 1; `new_b` is the nearest multiple of the current `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b` and is calculated as (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate; `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`; `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`; `min_k` is `candidate`**
