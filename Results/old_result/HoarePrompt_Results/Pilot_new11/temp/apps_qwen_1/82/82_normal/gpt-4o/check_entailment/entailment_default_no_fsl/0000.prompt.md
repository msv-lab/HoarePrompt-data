You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Neko loves divisors. During the latest number theory lesson, he got an interesting exercise from his math teacher.

Neko has two integers $a$ and $b$. His goal is to find a non-negative integer $k$ such that the least common multiple of $a+k$ and $b+k$ is the smallest possible. If there are multiple optimal integers $k$, he needs to choose the smallest one.

Given his mathematical talent, Neko had no trouble getting Wrong Answer on this problem. Can you help him solve it?


-----Input-----

The only line contains two integers $a$ and $b$ ($1 \le a, b \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

Print the smallest non-negative integer $k$ ($k \ge 0$) such that the lowest common multiple of $a+k$ and $b+k$ is the smallest possible.

If there are many possible integers $k$ giving the same value of the least common multiple, print the smallest one.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 10

Output
2
Input
21 31

Output
9
Input
5 10

Output
0


-----Note-----

In the first test, one should choose $k = 2$, as the least common multiple of $6 + 2$ and $10 + 2$ is $24$, which is the smallest least common multiple possible.
Functions with output description for each function:
import math

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().strip().split()
    a = int(data[0])
    b = int(data[1])
    print(func_3(a, b))

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts two positive integer parameters `x` and `y`. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. The function modifies `x` to be the GCD of the initial values of `x` and `y`, and sets `y` to 0. The function returns these two values: the GCD of `x` and `y`, and `y` which is 0. 

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function correctly handles the case where `x` and `y` are positive integers.
- The function correctly handles the case where `x` or `y` is equal to 1, as the GCD of any number and 1 is 1.
- The function correctly handles the case where `x` and `y` are equal, as the GCD would be the value of `x` (or `y`).
- The function correctly handles the case where one of the inputs is 0, as the GCD of any number and 0 is the non-zero number itself.
- The function does not handle the case where either `x` or `y` is negative, although the initial conditions specify that both are positive integers.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(x, y):
    return x * y // func_1(x, y)
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts two positive integer parameters `x` and `y`. It computes the product of `x` and `y`, then divides this product by the result of calling another function `func_1(x, y)`, performing integer division (//). If `func_1(x, y)` returns zero, the function will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`. The function returns the resulting integer from the division. If either `x` or `y` is not a positive integer, the behavior is undefined as the function expects them to be positive integers.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3(a, b):
    if a == b:
        return 0
    diff = abs(a - b)
    min_lcm = float('inf')
    min_k = 0
    for k in range(1, int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1):
        if diff % k == 0:
            for candidate in [k, diff // k]:
                new_a = (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
                new_b = (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
                current_lcm = func_2(new_a, new_b)
                if current_lcm < min_lcm or (current_lcm == min_lcm and candidate < min_k):
                    min_lcm = current_lcm
                    min_k = candidate
    return min_k
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` accepts two integers `a` and `b`, both within the range \(1 \le a, b \le 10^9\) and ensures \(a \neq b\). It first checks if `a` equals `b`, returning 0 if true. Otherwise, it calculates the absolute difference `diff` between `a` and `b`. It then iterates through possible values of `k` from 1 to the square root of `diff`, checking each pair of factors of `diff`. For each factor pair, it adjusts `a` and `b` to the nearest multiples of `k` and computes their least common multiple using `func_2`. It keeps track of the minimum LCM found and the corresponding `k` that achieves this minimum LCM. Finally, it returns either 0 (if no valid `k` was found) or the `k` that results in the smallest LCM found.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
