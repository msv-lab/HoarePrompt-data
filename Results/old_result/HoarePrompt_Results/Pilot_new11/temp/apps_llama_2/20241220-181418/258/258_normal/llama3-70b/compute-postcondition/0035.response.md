To determine the output state, let's consider the given initial state and the provided code snippet. The initial state is as follows:

- `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`.
- `N` is a positive integer.
- `ans` is the minimum of its old value and `times[K - 1]`.
- `x` is -998.
- `y` is -999.
- `times` is still the sorted return value of `func_2(-998, -1000, -998, -1000)`.

The code snippet provided is:

```python
times = func_2(x, y, x, y)
```

Given that `x` is -998 and `y` is -999, the code snippet essentially computes:

```python
times = func_2(-998, -999, -998, -999)
```

This means `times` is updated to be the return value of `func_2` with the arguments (-998, -999, -998, -999). However, without the specific definition of `func_2`, we cannot directly compute the new value of `times`. Nevertheless, we can infer that `times` will now hold a new value based on the execution of `func_2` with the given arguments.

Considering the initial state and the effect of the code snippet, the variables `K`, `N`, `ans`, `x`, and `y` retain their initial values since the code snippet does not modify them. The only variable that changes is `times`, which is updated to the return value of `func_2(-998, -999, -998, -999)`.

Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a positive integer, `ans` is the minimum of its old value and the old `times[K - 1]`, `x` is -998, `y` is -999, and `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-998, -999, -998, -999)`**.
