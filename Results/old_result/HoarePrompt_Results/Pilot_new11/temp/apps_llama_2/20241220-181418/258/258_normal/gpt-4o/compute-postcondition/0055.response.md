Postcondition: ***`K` is a positive integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is at least 3, `i` is at most 2, `j` is 3, `meats` is a list of triples. If `d` is less than 0, where `d` is equal to `c1 * T - c2 * T`, the program continues to the next iteration of the most internal loop; otherwise, the program proceeds with the current values of `K`, `T`, `N`, `i`, `j`, and `meats`.***
