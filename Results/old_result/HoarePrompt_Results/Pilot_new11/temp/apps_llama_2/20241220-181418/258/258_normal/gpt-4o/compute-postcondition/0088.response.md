The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. Since there's no loop provided in the given code snippet, we'll assume it's part of a larger loop structure that isn't shown here. 

When the `continue` statement is executed, it immediately stops the execution of the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration of the loop. However, without knowing the specific loop structure (e.g., for loop, while loop) or any conditionals that might be present, we can only conclude that the execution of the current iteration is skipped, and the loop proceeds to its next iteration if the loop condition still holds true.

Given that there are no direct modifications to variables within the `continue` statement itself, the values of the variables `meats`, `K`, `T`, `N`, `i`, `j`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, `count`, and `d` remain unchanged as a direct result of executing the `continue` statement.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of triples with `meats[0]` potentially modified, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is a positive integer and at least 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `((x1 - x2) / 2)^2 + ((y1 - y2) / 2)^2`, `mx` and `my` are calculated based on the last iteration, `count` is either the final sum or the value leading to early return if `count >= K`, and `d` equals `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, and we proceed to the next iteration of the loop.**
