To calculate the output state, we need to consider the given code and the initial state. 

The initial state provides the following information: 
- `K` is a positive integer
- `T` is a positive real number
- `N` is at least 3
- `i` is at most 2
- `j` is 3
- `meats` is a list of triples
- `d` is equal to `T*(1/c2 - 1/c1)`
- `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`

The given code is:
```python
cy = (y1 + y2) / 2
```
This code introduces a new variable `cy` and assigns it the value of the average of `y1` and `y2`. However, the values of `y1` and `y2` are not provided in the initial state.

Since the initial state does not provide values for `y1` and `y2`, and these variables are not related to any other variables in the initial state, we cannot determine a specific value for `cy`. 

The values of `K`, `T`, `N`, `i`, `j`, `meats`, and `d` are not changed by the code.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
**`K` is a positive integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is at least 3, `i` is at most 2, `j` is 3, `meats` is a list of triples, `d` is equal to `T*(1/c2 - 1/c1)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, and `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`**
