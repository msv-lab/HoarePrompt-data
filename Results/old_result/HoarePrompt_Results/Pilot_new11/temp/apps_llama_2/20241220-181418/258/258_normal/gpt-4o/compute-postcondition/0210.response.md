The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `meats`, `K`, and `T`. `meats` is a list of triples, where each triple contains three integers representing the x-coordinate, y-coordinate, and hardness of a piece of meat. `K` is a positive integer representing the minimum number of pieces of meat to be ready, and `T` is a positive real number representing the maximum allowed time. After executing the function body, the function returns a boolean value. In all cases except Case_10, the function returns `True`. In Case_10, the function returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of meat pieces `meats`, an integer `K`, and a real number `T`, and return `True` under multiple conditions while handling a specific condition where it returns `False`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of meat pieces `meats`, an integer `K`, and a real number `T`, and returns `True` under multiple conditions, while returning `False` under a specific condition.**
