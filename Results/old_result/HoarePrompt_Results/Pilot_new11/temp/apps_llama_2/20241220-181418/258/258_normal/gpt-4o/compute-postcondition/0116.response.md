Postcondition: **`meats` is a list of triples with `meats[0]` potentially modified, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is a positive integer and at least 4, `i` is 1, if `c1 * T < c2 * T`, then `j` is 3, otherwise `j` retains its original value. If `count` is greater than or equal to `K`, the program returns a boolean value True. Otherwise, the program state remains unchanged, with `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` retaining their original values if `c1 * T` is not less than `c2 * T`. The values of `d`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, and `count` depend on the calculations performed based on the `meats` list and the conditions specified.**
