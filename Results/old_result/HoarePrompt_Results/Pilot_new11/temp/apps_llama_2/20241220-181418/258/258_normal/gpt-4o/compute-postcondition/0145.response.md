Postcondition: **`meats` is a list of triples with `meats[0]` potentially modified, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is a positive integer at least 4, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the values of the triple at `meats[2]`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the values of the triple at `meats[3]`. If `c1 * T` is less than `c2 * T`, then the values of `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are actually the values of the triple at `meats[3]` and the values of `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the values of the triple at `meats[2]`. Otherwise, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` remain the values of the triple at `meats[2]` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` remain the values of the triple at `meats[3]`.**
