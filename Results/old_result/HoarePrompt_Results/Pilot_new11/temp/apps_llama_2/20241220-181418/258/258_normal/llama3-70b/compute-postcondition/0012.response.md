The code snippet `times.sort()` sorts the list `times` in ascending order. Since `times` is already defined as the sorted return value of `func_2(-1000, -998, -1000, -998)`, the sort operation does not change the list `times`. 

The values of `K`, `N`, `x`, `y`, and `ans` are not affected by the code snippet. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a positive integer, `x` is -1000, `y` is -998, `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-1000, -998, -1000, -998)`, and `ans` is `times[K - 1]`.
Output State: **`K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a positive integer, `x` is -1000, `y` is -998, `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-1000, -998, -1000, -998)`, and `ans` is `times[K - 1]`.**
