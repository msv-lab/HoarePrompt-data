The given code snippet is `times.sort()`. This line of code sorts the list `times` in ascending order.

Given the initial state:
- `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`
- `N` is a positive integer
- `ans` is the minimum of the old `times[K - 1]` for all `y` from -1000 to 1000
- `x` is -998
- `y` is -1000
- `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-998, -1000, -998, -1000)`, but it is stated that `times` is already the sorted return value, so sorting it again does not change its sorted nature.

After executing the code `times.sort()`:
- The list `times` remains sorted because it was already sorted, so its contents do not change.
- `K`, `N`, `ans`, `x`, and `y` are not affected by the sorting operation on `times`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`
- `N` is a positive integer
- `ans` is the minimum of the old `times[K - 1]` for all `y` from -1000 to 1000
- `x` is -998
- `y` is -1000
- `times` is still the sorted return value of `func_2(-998, -1000, -998, -1000)`

Output State: **`K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a positive integer, `ans` is the minimum of the old `times[K - 1]` for all `y` from -1000 to 1000, `x` is -998, `y` is -1000, and `times` is still the sorted return value of `func_2(-998, -1000, -998, -1000)`**
