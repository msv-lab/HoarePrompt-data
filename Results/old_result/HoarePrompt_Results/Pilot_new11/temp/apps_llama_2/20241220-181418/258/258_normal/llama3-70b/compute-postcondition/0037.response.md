The value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its old value and the value of `times[K - 1]`. The old value of `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and the old `times[K - 1]`, which means `ans` is already the minimum of its previous value and the old `times[K - 1]`. Therefore, the new value of `ans` is the minimum of the minimum of its previous value and the old `times[K - 1]` and `times[K - 1]`, which is still the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a positive integer, `ans` is the minimum of its previous minimum value and `times[K - 1]`, `x` is -998, `y` is -999, and `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-998, -999, -998, -999)**
