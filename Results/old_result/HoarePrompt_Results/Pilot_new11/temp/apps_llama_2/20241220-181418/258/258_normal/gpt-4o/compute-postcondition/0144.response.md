The code swaps the values of `x1`, `y1`, `c1` with `x2`, `y2`, `c2`. This means that after the execution, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` will have the values of `x2`, `y2`, `c2` which were originally the values of the triple at `meats[3]`, and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` will have the values of `x1`, `y1`, `c1` which were originally the values of the triple at `meats[2]`. 

Also, the condition `c1 * T` is less than `c2 * T` will be inverted after the swap, because the new `c1` is the old `c2` and the new `c2` is the old `c1`. Therefore, the new `c1 * T` (which is actually the old `c2 * T`) will be greater than the new `c2 * T` (which is actually the old `c1 * T`).

The values of `meats[0]`, `K`, `T`, `N`, `i`, `j` are not affected by the code.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of triples with `meats[0]` potentially modified, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is a positive integer at least 4, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the values of the triple at `meats[3]`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the values of the triple at `meats[2]`, and the current value of `c1 * T` is greater than the current value of `c2 * T`.**
