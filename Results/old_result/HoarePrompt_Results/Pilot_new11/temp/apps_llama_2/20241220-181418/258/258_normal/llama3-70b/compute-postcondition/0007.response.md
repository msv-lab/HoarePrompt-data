The value of `times` is updated and becomes the sorted return value of `func_2(x, y, x, y)`. Given that `x` is -1000 and `y` is -999, `times` is now the sorted return value of `func_2(-1000, -999, -1000, -999)`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a positive integer, `ans` is `times[K - 1]`, `x` is -1000, `y` is -999, `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-1000, -999, -1000, -999)`.

Output State: **`K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a positive integer, `ans` is `times[K - 1]`, `x` is -1000, `y` is -999, `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-1000, -999, -1000, -999)`**
