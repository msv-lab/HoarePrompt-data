According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y`. If `y` is less than 1000, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is -999. For the loop to execute again, `y` must be increased by 1. 

State: **`K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a positive integer, `ans` is the minimum of its previous minimum and `times[K - 1]`, `x` is -999, `y` is -998, and `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-999, -999, -999, -999)`**
