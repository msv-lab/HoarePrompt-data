Postcondition: ***`meats` is a list of triples with `meats[0]` potentially modified, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is a positive integer and at least 4, `i` is 1, if `c1 * T < c2 * T`, then `j` is 3, `x1` is `meats[3][0]`, `y1` is `meats[3][1]`, `c1` is `meats[3][2]`, `x2` is `meats[1][0]`, `y2` is `meats[1][1]`, `c2` is `meats[1][2]`, otherwise `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` retain their original values, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, and `my` may need to be updated based on the new `j`, `count` is the number of points in `meats` where the condition is met***
