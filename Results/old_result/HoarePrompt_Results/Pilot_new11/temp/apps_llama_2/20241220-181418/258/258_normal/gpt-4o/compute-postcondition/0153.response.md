The code calculates `dx` as half of the difference between `x1` and `x2`. The previous values of the variables are still valid, with the exception of `dx`, which now has a new value.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of triples with `meats[0]` potentially modified, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is a positive integer at least 4, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the values of the triple at `meats[2]` or `meats[3]` based on the condition, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the values of the triple at `meats[3]` or `meats[2]` based on the condition, `d` is equal to `T * (1/c1 - 1/c2)`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`**
