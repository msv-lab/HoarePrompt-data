Correctness: **False**.

The program provided does not follow the problem description for every potential case. It has several issues that lead to incorrect results:

1.  The `func_2` does not use the actual coordinates of the meats. It uses the `x` and `y` passed to it, which is incorrect because it should be using the coordinates of each piece of meat. It should iterate over all the meats and calculate the time for each.

2.  The `func_2` function also does not consider the `c` value of each meat, which is a crucial factor in calculating the time required for each piece to be ready.

3.  In the `func_3` function, it tries all possible integer coordinates for the heat source, but it does not consider the actual coordinates of the meats when calculating the time. Also, it sorts the times for a single piece of meat at coordinates `(x, y)` which is not correct, because it should be considering the times for all pieces of meat at their respective coordinates.

4.  The `func_3` function only checks integer coordinates for the heat source, while the problem allows real number coordinates.

5.  The `meats` variable is used but not defined anywhere in the code. This variable should hold the list of meats with their coordinates and hardness.

Here's a case where the program does not work correctly: Consider a scenario where there are 3 pieces of meat with coordinates (0, 0), (1, 1), and (2, 2), and hardness values 1, 2, and 3 respectively. The program should find the optimal place to put the heat source such that at least 2 pieces of meat are ready within the minimum time possible. However, due to the issues mentioned above, the program will not be able to find the correct solution.

This code does not follow the problem description and does not handle all potential cases. Therefore, the Correctness is **False**.
