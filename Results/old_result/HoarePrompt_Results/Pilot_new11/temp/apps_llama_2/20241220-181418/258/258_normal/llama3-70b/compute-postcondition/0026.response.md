The code `times.sort()` sorts the list `times` in ascending order. The previous state of `times` was the sorted return value of `func_2(-999, -998, -999, -998)`, but since it is already sorted, the sorting operation does not change the list. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a positive integer, `ans` is the minimum of its previous minimum and `times[K - 1]`, `x` is -999, `y` is -998, and `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-999, -998, -999, -998)` which is already sorted.

Output State: **`K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a positive integer, `ans` is the minimum of its previous minimum and `times[K - 1]`, `x` is -999, `y` is -998, and `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-999, -998, -999, -998)`**
