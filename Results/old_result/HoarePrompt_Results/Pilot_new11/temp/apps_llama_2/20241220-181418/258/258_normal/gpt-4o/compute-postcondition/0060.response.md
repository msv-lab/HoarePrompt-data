The code introduces a new variable `dy` and assigns it the value of the average of the difference between `y1` and `y2`, which is `(y1 - y2) / 2`. The values of `K`, `T`, `N`, `i`, `j`, `meats`, `d`, `cx`, `cy`, and `dx` are not changed by the code.

Output State: **`K` is a positive integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is at least 3, `i` is at most 2, `j` is 3, `meats` is a list of triples, `d` is equal to `T*(1/c2 - 1/c1)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`, and `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`**
