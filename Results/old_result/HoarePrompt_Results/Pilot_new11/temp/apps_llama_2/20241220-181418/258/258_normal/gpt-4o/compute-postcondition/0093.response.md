Postcondition: **`meats` is a list of triples with `meats[0]` potentially modified, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is a positive integer and at least 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `((x1 - x2) / 2)^2 + ((y1 - y2) / 2)^2`, `mx` is `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d)`, `my` is `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, and the current value of `count` is the number of points in `meats` where a specific condition is met, and `count` is greater than or equal to `K`**
