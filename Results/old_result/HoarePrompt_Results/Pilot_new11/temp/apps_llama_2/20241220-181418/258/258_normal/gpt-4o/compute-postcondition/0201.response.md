Postcondition: **`meats` is a list of triples with `meats[0]` potentially modified, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is greater than 5, `i` is 2, `j` is 5, if `c1 * T < c2 * T`, then the values of the triple at `meats[2]` are the original values of the triple at `meats[5]` and the values of the triple at `meats[5]` are the original values of the triple at `meats[2]`; otherwise, the state of `meats[2]` and `meats[5]` remains unchanged, `d` equals `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` equals `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` equals `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` equals `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` equals `(y1 - y2) / 2`, and `d2` equals `dx * dx + dy * dy`, and if `d * d2 > d2`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop; the program state remains unchanged in this case, as the else part is empty and no changes are applied when `d * d2 <= d2`.**
