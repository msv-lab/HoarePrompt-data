To solve this problem, let's analyze the given code and the initial state.

The given code is:
```python
c = int(data[index + 2])
```

The initial state is:
- `N` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])` and greater than 0
- `K` is an integer equal to `int(data[1])`
- `x` is an integer equal to `int(data[2])`
- `data` is a list of strings from user input
- `meats` is an empty list
- `index` is 2
- `y` is an integer equal to `int(data[3])`

Now, let's calculate the result of the given code.

Given `index` is 2, `index + 2` equals 4. So, `c` will be assigned the value of `int(data[4])`.

Since `data` is a list of strings from user input and `c` is assigned the integer value of `data[4]`, we can conclude that `c` is an integer equal to `int(data[4])`.

All the other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
- `N` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])` and greater than 0
- `K` is an integer equal to `int(data[1])`
- `x` is an integer equal to `int(data[2])`
- `data` is a list of strings from user input
- `meats` is an empty list
- `index` is 2
- `y` is an integer equal to `int(data[3])`
- `c` is an integer equal to `int(data[4])`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])` and greater than 0, `K` is an integer equal to `int(data[1])`, `x` is an integer equal to `int(data[2])`, `data` is a list of strings from user input, `meats` is an empty list, `index` is 2, `y` is an integer equal to `int(data[3])`, `c` is an integer equal to `int(data[4])`**
