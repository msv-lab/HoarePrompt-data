The given code `ans = min(ans, times[K - 1])` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum between its current value and `times[K - 1]`. 

Since `ans` is initially `times[K - 1]`, the value of `ans` remains the same, which is `times[K - 1]`. 

The states of the other variables (`K`, `N`, `x`, `y`, `times`) are not affected by this code. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a positive integer, `x` is -1000, `y` is -998, `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-1000, -998, -1000, -998)`, and `ans` is `times[K - 1]`.

Output State: **`K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a positive integer, `x` is -1000, `y` is -998, `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-1000, -998, -1000, -998)`, and `ans` is `times[K - 1]`.**
