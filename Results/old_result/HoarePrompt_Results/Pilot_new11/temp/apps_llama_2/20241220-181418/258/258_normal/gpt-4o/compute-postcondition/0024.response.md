To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

Given the code:
```python
result = func_2(N, K, meats)
```
The function `func_2` is called with arguments `N`, `K`, and `meats`, and its return value is assigned to the variable `result`.

Considering the initial state:
- `N` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`
- `K` is an integer equal to `int(data[1])`
- `meats` is a list of `N` tuples, each containing three integers extracted from the `data` list
- `index` is `2 + 3 * N`
- `data` is a list of strings from user input

The code does not modify `N`, `K`, `meats`, `index`, or `data`. It introduces a new variable `result` which is assigned the return value of `func_2(N, K, meats)`. Without the implementation details of `func_2`, we cannot determine the exact value of `result`. However, we can express the output state based on the given information.

Output State: **`N` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `K` is an integer equal to `int(data[1])`, `meats` is a list of `N` tuples, each containing three integers extracted from the `data` list, `index` is `2 + 3 * N`, `data` is a list of strings from user input, and `result` is the return value of `func_2(N, K, meats)`**
