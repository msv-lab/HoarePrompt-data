The code overwrites the `times` variable with the result of `func_2(x, y, x, y)`. The previous value of `times` was the sorted return value of `func_2(-999, 1000, -999, 1000)`, but this is now lost. The value of `x` is -998, and the value of `y` is -1000. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a positive integer, `ans` is the minimum of `times[K - 1]` for all `y` from -1000 to 1000 (but this `times` is no longer valid), `x` is -998, `y` is -1000, and `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-998, -1000, -998, -1000)`.

Output State: **`K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a positive integer, `ans` is the minimum of the old `times[K - 1]` for all `y` from -1000 to 1000, `x` is -998, `y` is -1000, and `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-998, -1000, -998, -1000)`**
