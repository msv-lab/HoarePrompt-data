The value of `x` is updated to `int(data[index])`, and since `index` is 8, `x` becomes `int(data[8])`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than 2, `K` is an integer, `x` is an integer equal to `int(data[8])`, `y` is an integer equal to `int(data[6])`, `c` is an integer equal to `int(data[7])`, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 8, and `meats` is a list containing the tuples `(int(data[5]), int(data[6]), old_c)` and `(int(data[5]), int(data[6]), int(data[7]))`**
