The code `my = cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2` updates the value of `my`. Since `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `d2` is `((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2)`, and `d` is `((c1 - c2) * T) / (c1 * c2)`, we substitute these into the equation for `my`. 

`my` becomes `(y1 + y2) / 2 - ((x1 - x2) / 2) * math.sqrt(((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2) * ((c1 - c2) * T) / (c1 * c2) - (((c1 - c2) * T) / (c1 * c2))^2) / ((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2)`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: 
`meats` is a list of triples with `meats[0]` potentially modified, 
`K` is a positive integer, 
`T` is a positive real number, 
`N` is a positive integer and at least 4, 
`i` is 1, 
if `c1 * T < c2 * T`, then `j` is 3, 
`x1` is `meats[3][0]`, 
`y1` is `meats[3][1]`, 
`c1` is `meats[3][2]`, 
`x2` is `meats[1][0]`, 
`y2` is `meats[1][1]`, 
`c2` is `meats[1][2]`, 
otherwise `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` retain their original values, 
`d` is `((c1 - c2) * T) / (c1 * c2)`, 
`cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, 
`cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, 
`dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, 
`dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, 
`d2` is `((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2)`, 
`mx` is `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, 
`my` is `(y1 + y2) / 2 - ((x1 - x2) / 2) * math.sqrt(((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2) * ((c1 - c2) * T) / (c1 * c2) - (((c1 - c2) * T) / (c1 * c2))^2) / ((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2)` and if `d * d2 > d2`, the program skips to the next iteration of the loop, otherwise the state of the variables remains unchanged.
