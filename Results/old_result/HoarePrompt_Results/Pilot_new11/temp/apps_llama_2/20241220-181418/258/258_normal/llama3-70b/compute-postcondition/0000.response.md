The code `ans = float('inf')` assigns the value of positive infinity to the variable `ans`. The initial state of `K` and `N` remains unchanged as the code snippet does not affect these variables. 

The `ans` variable now holds the value of positive infinity. 

Output State: **`K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a positive integer, `ans` is positive infinity**
