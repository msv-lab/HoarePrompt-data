The code prints the value of `result` with six decimal places. The value of `result` is the return value of `func_2(N, K, meats)`, but the code snippet does not provide the implementation of `func_2`. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that the value of `result` is printed.

Output State: **`N` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `K` is an integer equal to `int(data[1])`, `meats` is a list of `N` tuples, each containing three integers extracted from the `data` list, `index` is `2 + 3 * N`, `data` is a list of strings from user input, `result` is the return value of `func_2(N, K, meats)`, and the value of `result` is printed as a float with six decimal places.**
