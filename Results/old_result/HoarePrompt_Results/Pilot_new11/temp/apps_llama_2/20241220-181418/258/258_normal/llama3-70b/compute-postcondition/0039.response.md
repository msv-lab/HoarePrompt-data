To determine the output state, we must first understand the impact of the code on the program. The given code snippet is `times = func_2(x, y, x, y)`. This line of code is calling a function named `func_2` with the arguments `x`, `y`, `x`, and `y`, and assigning the return value of this function to the variable `times`.

Given the initial state:
- `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`.
- `N` is a positive integer.
- `ans` is the minimum of its previous minimum value and `times[K - 1]`.
- `x` is -998.
- `y` is -998.
- `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-998, -999, -998, -999)`.

However, the new assignment to `times` changes its value to be the return value of `func_2(x, y, x, y)`, where `x` is -998 and `y` is -998. Thus, the new value of `times` is `func_2(-998, -998, -998, -998)`.

The function `func_2` and its return behavior are not specified, so we can't determine the exact value of `times` after this assignment. However, we can say that `times` is now equal to the return value of `func_2(-998, -998, -998, -998)`.

The values of `K`, `N`, `ans`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged because the code snippet does not modify them.

Output State: **`K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a positive integer, `ans` is the minimum of its previous minimum value and `times[K - 1]`, `x` is -998, `y` is -998, and `times` is the return value of `func_2(-998, -998, -998, -998)`**
