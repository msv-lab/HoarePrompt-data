To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

```
times = func_2(x, y, x, y)
```

The code assigns the return value of the function `func_2(x, y, x, y)` to the variable `times`. 

Given the initial state:
- `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`
- `N` is a positive integer
- `ans` is positive infinity
- `x` is -1000
- `y` is -1000

Since we don't have the definition of `func_2`, we can't determine the exact value that `times` will hold after the execution. However, we can say that `times` will be assigned the return value of `func_2(-1000, -1000, -1000, -1000)`.

The states of `K`, `N`, `ans`, `x`, and `y` are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the output state is: 
- `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`
- `N` is a positive integer
- `ans` is positive infinity
- `x` is -1000
- `y` is -1000
- `times` is the return value of `func_2(-1000, -1000, -1000, -1000)`.

Output State: **`K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a positive integer, `ans` is positive infinity, `x` is -1000, `y` is -1000, `times` is the return value of `func_2(-1000, -1000, -1000, -1000)`**
