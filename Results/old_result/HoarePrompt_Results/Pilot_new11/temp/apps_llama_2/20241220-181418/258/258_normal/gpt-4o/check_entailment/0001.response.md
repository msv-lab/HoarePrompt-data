Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The issue lies in the way the program reads the input data. 

In the `func_3()` function, the program reads the input data using `data = input().split()`. This line of code reads all the input data at once, which is not the correct way to read the input as specified in the problem description. 

The problem description states that the input is given in the following format:
```
N K
x_1 y_1 c_1
x_2 y_2 c_2
...
x_N y_N c_N
```

However, the program reads all the input data at once and tries to parse it, which is incorrect. This will cause the program to fail for inputs where the number of pieces of meat (N) is large.

To fix this, the program should read the input data line by line, as specified in the problem description. The correct way to read the input data would be:
```python
N, K = map(int, input().split())
meats = []
for _ in range(N):
    x, y, c = map(int, input().split())
    meats.append((x, y, c))
```

This way, the program will correctly read the input data and process it as specified in the problem description. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not follow the problem description for every potential case, and it will fail for certain inputs due to the incorrect way of reading the input data.
