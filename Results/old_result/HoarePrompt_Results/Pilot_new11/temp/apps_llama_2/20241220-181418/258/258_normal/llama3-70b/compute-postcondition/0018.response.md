The provided code snippet is `times.sort()`. This line of code sorts the `times` list in ascending order. 

Since `times` is already stated to be the sorted return value of `func_2(-999, -1000, -999, -1000)`, the sorting operation does not change the fact that `times` is sorted. However, if we consider the intention behind the given initial state and the code, it seems there might be an inconsistency in the description because `times` is already described as sorted.

Considering the given information:
- `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`.
- `N` is a positive integer.
- `ans` is the minimum of all `times[K - 1]` values for `y` ranging from -1000 to 1000.
- `x` is -999.
- `y` is -1000.
- `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-999, -1000, -999, -1000)`.

Given that `times` is already sorted, the operation `times.sort()` does not change the state of `times`. It remains sorted.

Output State: **`K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a positive integer, `ans` is the minimum of all `times[K - 1]` values for `y` ranging from -1000 to 1000, `x` is -999, `y` is -1000, and `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-999, -1000, -999, -1000)`**
