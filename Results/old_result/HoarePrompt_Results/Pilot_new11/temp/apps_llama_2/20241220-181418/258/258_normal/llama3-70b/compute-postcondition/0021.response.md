The code reassigns the value of `times` to the return value of `func_2(x, y, x, y)`. Since the initial values of `x` and `y` are -999, the new value of `times` will be `func_2(-999, -999, -999, -999)`. This new value of `times` will be a sorted list.

The states of the other variables, `K`, `N`, `ans`, `x`, and `y`, are not affected by the reassignment of `times`.

Output State: **`K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a positive integer, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and the old `times[K - 1]`, `x` is -999, `y` is -999, and `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-999, -999, -999, -999)`**
