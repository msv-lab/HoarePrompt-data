To determine the output state, we need to understand the impact of the given code on the initial state.

Given the initial state:
- `meats` is a list of triples.
- `K` is a positive integer.
- `T` is a positive real number.
- `N` is at least 3.
- `i` is at most 2.
- `j` is 3.

And the code:
```python
x1, y1, c1 = meats[i]
```

This code unpacks the triple at index `i` in the `meats` list into the variables `x1`, `y1`, and `c1`.

Since `i` is at most 2, it can be 0, 1, or 2. The list index in Python starts at 0, so `i` is a valid index for the list `meats` as long as `meats` has at least 3 elements, which is implied by the initial condition that `N` is at least 3 (though `N`'s relation to the length of `meats` is not explicitly stated, we proceed with the understanding that `meats` has sufficient elements).

The values of `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` will be the values of the triple at index `i` in `meats`. The exact values cannot be determined without knowing the specific contents of `meats`.

The other variables (`K`, `T`, `N`, `i`, `j`, and the list `meats` itself, aside from the specific indexing operation) are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `K` is a positive integer.
- `T` is a positive real number.
- `N` is at least 3.
- `i` is at most 2.
- `j` is 3.
- `meats` is a list of triples.
- `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` are assigned the values of the triple at index `i` in `meats`.

Output State: **`K` is a positive integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is at least 3, `i` is at most 2, `j` is 3, `meats` is a list of triples, `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` are the values of the triple at index `i` in `meats`**
