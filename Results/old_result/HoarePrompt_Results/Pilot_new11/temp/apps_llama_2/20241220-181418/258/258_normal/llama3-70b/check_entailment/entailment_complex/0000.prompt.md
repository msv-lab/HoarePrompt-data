You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Takahashi wants to grill N pieces of meat on a grilling net, which can be seen as a two-dimensional plane. The coordinates of the i-th piece of meat are \left(x_i, y_i\right), and its hardness is c_i.
Takahashi can use one heat source to grill the meat. If he puts the heat source at coordinates \left(X, Y\right), where X and Y are real numbers, the i-th piece of meat will be ready to eat in c_i \times \sqrt{\left(X - x_i\right)^2 + \left(Y-y_i\right)^2} seconds.
Takahashi wants to eat K pieces of meat. Find the time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready if he put the heat source to minimize this time.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq N \leq 60
 - 1 \leq K \leq N
 - -1000 \leq x_i , y_i \leq 1000
 - \left(x_i, y_i\right) \neq \left(x_j, y_j\right) \left(i \neq j \right)
 - 1 \leq c_i \leq 100

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
x_1 y_1 c_1
\vdots
x_N y_N c_N

-----Output-----
Print the answer.
It will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error from our answer is at most 10^{-6}.

-----Sample Input-----
4 3
-1 0 3
0 0 3
1 0 2
1 1 40

-----Sample Output-----
2.4

If we put the heat source at \left(-0.2, 0\right), the 1-st, 2-nd, and 3-rd pieces of meat will be ready to eat within 2.4 seconds. This is the optimal place to put the heat source.
Annotated Functions:
import math

(N, K) = map(int, input().split())
meats = []
for _ in range(N):
    (x, y, c) = map(int, input().split())
    meats.append((x, y, c))
print(func_3())

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x, y, X, and Y are real numbers representing coordinates in a two-dimensional plane.
def func_1(x, y, X, Y):
    return math.sqrt((X - x) ** 2 + (Y - y) ** 2)
    #The program returns the Euclidean distance between the two points (x, y) and (X, Y) in the 2D plane, which is a real number representing the distance between these two points.
#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns the Euclidean distance between two points in a 2D plane, represented by the coordinates (x, y) and (X, Y). The function accepts four real number parameters and returns a real number value representing the distance between these points. It handles all possible real number inputs for x, y, X, and Y, including negative numbers and zero, and returns a non-negative real number as the distance. The function does not perform any error checking on the inputs, so it assumes that the inputs will always be real numbers. The function does not modify the input variables x, y, X, and Y, as they are passed by value and used only for the calculation. In cases where the input points are the same (i.e., x == X and y == Y), the function returns 0.0, representing a distance of zero between the points.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are lists of integers representing the x and y coordinates of the pieces of meat, X and Y are real numbers representing the coordinates of the heat source, c is a list of integers representing the hardness of each piece of meat, and meats is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the x and y coordinates and the hardness of a piece of meat, such that len(x) == len(y) == len(c) == len(meats) and all values are consistent across these lists.
def func_2(x, y, X, Y):
    return [(c * func_1(x, y, X, Y)) for x, y, c in meats]
    #The program returns a list of products where each product is the hardness of a piece of meat multiplied by the result of func_1 applied to the meat's coordinates and the heat source's coordinates.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts parameters x, y, X, and Y, representing the x and y coordinates of the pieces of meat and the coordinates of the heat source, respectively, and returns a list of products where each product is the hardness of a piece of meat multiplied by the result of func_1 applied to the meat's coordinates and the heat source's coordinates. However, the code has a missing functionality as it uses a variable "meats" which is not defined within the function or passed as an argument, but is referenced in the return statement. Additionally, the function does not handle any potential edge cases such as division by zero, negative hardness values, or cases where the lists x, y, or c are empty. The function will throw an error if "meats" is not defined or if the lengths of the input lists are not consistent. The actual functionality of the function depends on the definition and implementation of func_1, which is not provided in the given code snippet.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: K is a positive integer such that 1 <= K <= N, where N is a positive integer representing the total number of pieces of meat, and the functions func_2 and sorting are properly defined to process the times for each piece of meat at given coordinates (x, y).
def func_3():
    ans = float('inf')
    for x in range(-1000, 1001):
        for y in range(-1000, 1001):
            times = func_2(x, y, x, y)
            times.sort()
            ans = min(ans, times[K - 1])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a positive integer, `ans` is the minimum of all `times[K - 1]` values for all `x` and `y` ranging from -1000 to 1000, `x` is 1000, and `y` is 1000.
    return ans
    #The program returns `ans`, which is the minimum of all `times[K - 1]` values for all `x` and `y` ranging from -1000 to 1000, where `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, and `N` is a positive integer, and `x` is 1000, and `y` is 1000
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the minimum time value at index K-1 from the list of times, considering all possible coordinates (x, y) ranging from -1000 to 1000, where K is a positive integer between 1 and N. The function assumes that N is a positive integer representing the total number of pieces of meat and that the functions func_2 and sorting are properly defined to process the times for each piece of meat at given coordinates. The function iterates over all possible coordinates, calculates the times using the func_2 function, sorts the times, and keeps track of the minimum time value at index K-1. The function returns this minimum time value. The state of the program after execution includes the minimum time value stored in the variable ans, which is the minimum of all times[K-1] values for all x and y coordinates. The function does not modify any external state or input variables. Potential edge cases include the functions func_2 and sorting not being properly defined, K being outside the range of 1 to N, or N being a non-positive integer. However, these edge cases are not explicitly handled within the provided code.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
