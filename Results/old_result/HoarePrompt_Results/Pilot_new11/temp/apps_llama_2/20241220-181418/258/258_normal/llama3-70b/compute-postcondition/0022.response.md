The code `times.sort()` sorts the list `times` in-place, meaning it modifies the original list. Since `times` is already the sorted return value of `func_2(-999, -999, -999, -999)`, the sorting operation does not change the list.

Output State: **`K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a positive integer, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and the old `times[K - 1]`, `x` is -999, `y` is -999, and `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-999, -999, -999, -999)`**
