To calculate the output state, let's consider the provided code and initial state.

Initial State: 
- `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`.
- `N` is a positive integer.
- `ans` is `times[K - 1]`.
- `x` is -1000.
- `y` is -999.
- `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-1000, -999, -1000, -999)`.

Given code:
```python
ans = min(ans, times[K - 1])
```

The impact of the code is to update the value of `ans` to be the minimum between its current value (`times[K - 1]`) and `times[K - 1]`. Essentially, this operation does not change the value of `ans` because it is comparing `times[K - 1]` with itself. 

Therefore, `ans` remains equal to `times[K - 1]`. The states of the other variables (`K`, `N`, `x`, `y`, `times`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a positive integer, `ans` is `times[K - 1]`, `x` is -1000, `y` is -999, `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-1000, -999, -1000, -999)`**
