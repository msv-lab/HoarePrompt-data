The given code calculates the average of `y1` and `y2` and assigns it to `cy`. 

`cy` is assigned the value `(y1 + y2) / 2`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`meats` is a list of triples with `meats[0]` potentially modified, 
`K` is a positive integer, 
`T` is a positive real number, 
`N` is a positive integer at least 4, 
`i` is 2, 
`j` is 3, 
`x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the values of the triple at `meats[2]` or `meats[3]` based on the condition, 
`x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the values of the triple at `meats[3]` or `meats[2]` based on the condition, 
`d` is equal to `T * (1/c1 - 1/c2)`, 
`cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, 
`cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of triples with `meats[0]` potentially modified, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is a positive integer at least 4, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the values of the triple at `meats[2]` or `meats[3]` based on the condition, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the values of the triple at `meats[3]` or `meats[2]` based on the condition, `d` is equal to `T * (1/c1 - 1/c2)`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`**
