The code snippet `times.sort()` sorts the list `times` in-place, meaning it modifies the original list. 

Given that `times` is already the sorted return value of `func_2(-1000, -999, -1000, -999)`, the sorting operation will not change the list because it is already sorted.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a positive integer, `ans` is `times[K - 1]`, `x` is -1000, `y` is -999, `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-1000, -999, -1000, -999)` which is already sorted.

Output State: **`K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a positive integer, `ans` is `times[K - 1]`, `x` is -1000, `y` is -999, `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-1000, -999, -1000, -999)`**
