The code calculates `my` as `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, which can be simplified to `my = cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d^2) / d2`. 

Given that `d2` is `((x1 - x2) / 2)^2 + ((y1 - y2) / 2)^2`, `d` is `T / c2 - T / c1`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, the new variable `my` is calculated based on these existing values.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: 
`meats` is a list of triples, 
`K` is a positive integer, 
`T` is a positive real number, 
`N` is at least 3, 
`i` is 0, 
`j` is 2, 
`count` is less than `K`, 
`d` is `T / c2 - T / c1`, 
`cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, 
`cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, 
`dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, 
`dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, 
`d2` is `((x1 - x2) / 2)^2 + ((y1 - y2) / 2)^2`, 
`mx` is `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d * (d2 - d)) / d2`, 
`my` is `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`.
