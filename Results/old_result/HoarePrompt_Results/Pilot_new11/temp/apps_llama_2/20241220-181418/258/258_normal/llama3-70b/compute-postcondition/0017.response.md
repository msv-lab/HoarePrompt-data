To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given code and its impact on the variables.

Initially, `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-1000, 1000, -1000, 1000)`. However, the code updates `times` to be the return value of `func_2(x, y, x, y)`.

Given that `x` is -999 and `y` is -1000, the new value of `times` will be `func_2(-999, -1000, -999, -1000)`.

The states of the other variables (`K`, `N`, `ans`) are not affected by this update.

Therefore, the Output State is: `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a positive integer, `ans` is the minimum of all `times[K - 1]` values for `y` ranging from -1000 to 1000, `x` is -999, `y` is -1000, and `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-999, -1000, -999, -1000)`.

Output State: **`K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a positive integer, `ans` is the minimum of all `times[K - 1]` values for `y` ranging from -1000 to 1000, `x` is -999, `y` is -1000, and `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-999, -1000, -999, -1000)`**
