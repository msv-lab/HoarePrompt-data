Output State: **`meats` is a list of triples with elements possibly swapped based on the condition `c1 * T < c2 * T`, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is a positive integer at least 3, `i` remains 2, `j` is `N`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the values of the triple at `meats[i]` or another index based on the condition, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the values of the triple at `meats[j-1]` or another index based on the condition, `d` equals `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` equals `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` equals `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` equals `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` equals `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` equals `dx * dx + dy * dy`, `mx` equals `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `my` equals `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, and `count` equals the sum of all instances where `c * math.sqrt((mx - x) ** 2 + (my - y) ** 2)` is less than or equal to `T` for the last iteration of the loop; if the loop does not execute (`N` is less than 3), `meats`, `K`, `T`, and `N` remain unchanged, `i` remains 2, `j` is undefined, and the other variables are undefined. If `count` is greater than or equal to `K` at any point during the execution of the loop, the function returns `True`.**
