According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `ticket`. If `ticket` has at least one more character, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ticket` is a string of digits with a length between 2 and 100, `total_sum` is even, `target_sum` equals `total_sum // 2`, and `digit` is the second character in `ticket`. 

For the loop to execute again, `ticket` must have at least one more character after the second character. This means `ticket` must have at least 3 characters. The `digit` should be the next character in `ticket`, which is the third character.

The state of `total_sum`, `target_sum` remains unchanged because the loop only iterates over the characters in `ticket` and does not modify `ticket`. The state of `curr_sum` also remains unchanged unless `curr_sum` equals `target_sum`, but this is not specified in the given state, so we will consider the general case where `curr_sum` may or may not be equal to `target_sum`. However, `digit` will be the third character in `ticket` for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`ticket` is a string of digits such that 3 <= len(`ticket`) <= 100 and all characters in `ticket` are between '0' and '9', `total_sum` equals the sum of the Unicode code points of all characters in `ticket` and is even, `target_sum` equals `total_sum // 2`, `digit` is the third character in `ticket`**
