The value of `curr_sum` is increased by the value of `digit`. The value of `digit` is the second character in `ticket`, which is a string of digits, so `digit` is a digit between '0' and '9'. The Unicode code point of a digit character is equal to the digit's value plus 48 (because the Unicode code point of '0' is 48). Therefore, the value of `digit` is `ord(digit) - 48`, where `ord(digit)` is the Unicode code point of `digit`. 

However, since all the code does is add `digit` to `curr_sum`, and `digit` is a single character in `ticket`, the new value of `curr_sum` is the old value of `curr_sum` plus the value of the second character in `ticket`. 

The value of `ticket`, `total_sum`, `target_sum` do not change.

Output State: **`ticket` is a string of digits such that 2 <= len(`ticket`) <= 100 and all characters in `ticket` are between '0' and '9', `total_sum` equals the sum of the Unicode code points of all characters in `ticket` and is even, `target_sum` equals `total_sum // 2`, `digit` is the second character in `ticket`, `curr_sum` is increased by the value of `digit`**
