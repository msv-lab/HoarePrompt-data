The value of `current_sum` is reset to 0, regardless of its previous value. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer and greater than `i + 1`, `ticket` is a string of digits of length `n`, `segment_length` is 3, `target_sum` is the sum of the first 3 digits of `ticket`, `i` is incremented by 1, `current_sum` is 0.
