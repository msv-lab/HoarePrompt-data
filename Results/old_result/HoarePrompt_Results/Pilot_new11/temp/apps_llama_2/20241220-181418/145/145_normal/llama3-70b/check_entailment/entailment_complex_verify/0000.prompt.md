You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Recently Vasya found a golden ticket — a sequence which consists of $n$ digits $a_1a_2\dots a_n$. Vasya considers a ticket to be lucky if it can be divided into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums. For example, ticket $350178$ is lucky since it can be divided into three segments $350$, $17$ and $8$: $3+5+0=1+7=8$. Note that each digit of sequence should belong to exactly one segment.

Help Vasya! Tell him if the golden ticket he found is lucky or not.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 100$) — the number of digits in the ticket.

The second line contains $n$ digits $a_1 a_2 \dots a_n$ ($0 \le a_i \le 9$) — the golden ticket. Digits are printed without spaces.


-----Output-----

If the golden ticket is lucky then print "YES", otherwise print "NO" (both case insensitive).


-----Examples-----
Input
5
73452

Output
YES

Input
4
1248

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example the ticket can be divided into $7$, $34$ and $52$: $7=3+4=5+2$.

In the second example it is impossible to divide ticket into segments with equal sum.
Program:
```
n = int(input())
ticket = list(map(int, input()))
if func_1(ticket):
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')

def func_1(ticket):
    total_sum = sum(ticket)
    if total_sum % 2 != 0:
        return False
    target_sum = total_sum // 2
    curr_sum = 0
    segments = 0
    for digit in ticket:
        curr_sum += digit
        if curr_sum == target_sum:
            segments += 1
            curr_sum = 0
    return segments >= 2


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases because it has a narrow and wrong assumption about how to divide the ticket into segments with equal sums. The program only checks if the ticket can be divided into two segments with equal sums, but the problem statement does not restrict the number of segments to two. 

For example, consider the ticket "350178" which can be divided into three segments with equal sums: 350 (3+5+0=8), 17 (1+7=8), and 8. However, the total sum of the ticket is 3+5+0+1+7+8=24, which is not divisible by 2. Hence, the program will incorrectly return "NO" for this ticket.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider all possible segment lengths and check if the ticket can be divided into segments of that length with equal sums. 

Another example, for the ticket "1234", the total sum is 10, which is divisible by 2 (5+5), but there is no pair of digits (or single digit) in the ticket that sums to 5, so the function should return "NO". However, this case would require checking other possible segment lengths and sums, which the function does not do. 

Thus, the given program does not meet the requirements for all possible cases and is therefore incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
n = int(input())
ticket = list(map(int, input()))
if func_1(ticket):
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: ticket is a string of digits such that 2 <= len(ticket) <= 100 and all characters in ticket are between '0' and '9'.
def func_1(ticket):
    total_sum = sum(ticket)
    if (total_sum % 2 != 0) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `ticket` is a string of digits such that 2 <= len(ticket) <= 100 and all characters in `ticket` are between '0' and '9'; `total_sum` equals the sum of the Unicode code points of all characters in `ticket`, and `total_sum` is even (i.e., `total_sum` % 2 == 0)
    target_sum = total_sum // 2
    curr_sum = 0
    segments = 0
    for digit in ticket:
        curr_sum += digit
        
        if curr_sum == target_sum:
            segments += 1
            curr_sum = 0
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `ticket` is a string of digits such that 2 <= len(`ticket`) <= 100 and all characters in `ticket` are between '0' and '9', `total_sum` equals the sum of the Unicode code points of all characters in `ticket` and is even, `target_sum` equals `total_sum // 2`, `segments` equals the number of segments in `ticket` where the sum of Unicode code points equals `target_sum`, `curr_sum` is the sum of the Unicode code points of the characters in the last segment that didn't sum up to `target_sum` or 0 if the last segment sums up to `target_sum`, and `digit` is the last character in `ticket`.
    return segments >= 2
    #The program returns True if there are at least two segments in 'ticket' where the sum of Unicode code points equals 'target_sum', False otherwise
#Overall this is what the function does:This function, `func_1`, checks if a given string of digits, 'ticket', can be divided into at least two segments where the sum of the Unicode code points of the digits in each segment equals half of the total sum of the Unicode code points of all digits in 'ticket'. It returns `True` if such segments exist and `False` otherwise. The function first calculates the total sum of the Unicode code points of all characters in 'ticket' and checks if this sum is even. If the sum is not even, it immediately returns `False`. If the sum is even, it then iterates through 'ticket' to find segments that sum up to half of the total sum. The function counts the number of such segments and returns `True` if there are at least two segments, and `False` otherwise. Note that the function considers the Unicode code points of the characters, not their numeric values. For example, the character '0' has a Unicode code point of 48, not 0. The function handles strings of lengths between 2 and 100 and only considers strings consisting entirely of digits. If the input string does not meet these criteria, the function's behavior is not defined by the provided annotations or code.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
