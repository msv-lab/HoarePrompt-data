The code resets the value of `current_sum` to 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
`n` is still an integer greater than 1, `ticket` is still a string of digits of length `n`, `segment_length` is still 1, `target_sum` is still the integer value of the first digit of `ticket`, `segment_count` is still 0, and `i` is still 0.
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `ticket` is a string of digits of length `n`, `segment_length` is 1, `target_sum` is the integer value of the first digit of `ticket`, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 0, `i` is 0**
