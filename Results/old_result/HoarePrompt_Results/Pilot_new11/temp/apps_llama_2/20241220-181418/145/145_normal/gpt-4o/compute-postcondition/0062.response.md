Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer and greater than `i + 1`, `ticket` is a string of digits of length `n`, `segment_length` is 3, `target_sum` is the sum of the first 3 digits of `ticket`. If `current_sum` equals `target_sum`, then `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 2, and `i` is `i + 1`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains as in the precondition, with `current_sum` being `current_sum + int(ticket[i])`, and `i` is `i + 1`.***
