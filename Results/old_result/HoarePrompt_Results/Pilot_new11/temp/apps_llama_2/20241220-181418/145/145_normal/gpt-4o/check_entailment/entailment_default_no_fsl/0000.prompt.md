You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Recently Vasya found a golden ticket — a sequence which consists of $n$ digits $a_1a_2\dots a_n$. Vasya considers a ticket to be lucky if it can be divided into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums. For example, ticket $350178$ is lucky since it can be divided into three segments $350$, $17$ and $8$: $3+5+0=1+7=8$. Note that each digit of sequence should belong to exactly one segment.

Help Vasya! Tell him if the golden ticket he found is lucky or not.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 100$) — the number of digits in the ticket.

The second line contains $n$ digits $a_1 a_2 \dots a_n$ ($0 \le a_i \le 9$) — the golden ticket. Digits are printed without spaces.


-----Output-----

If the golden ticket is lucky then print "YES", otherwise print "NO" (both case insensitive).


-----Examples-----
Input
5
73452

Output
YES

Input
4
1248

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example the ticket can be divided into $7$, $34$ and $52$: $7=3+4=5+2$.

In the second example it is impossible to divide ticket into segments with equal sum.
Functions with output description for each function:
n = int(input())
ticket = input()
print(func_1(n, ticket))

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(n, ticket):

    for segment_length in range(1, n):
        target_sum = segment_sum(0, segment_length - 1)
        current_sum = 0
        segment_count = 0
        for i in range(n):
            current_sum += int(ticket[i])
            if current_sum == target_sum:
                current_sum = 0
                segment_count += 1
        if current_sum == 0 and segment_count > 1:
            return 'YES'
    return 'NO'
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` checks if a given string of digits `ticket` of length `n` (where `n` is an integer greater than 1) can be divided into segments of equal sum. The function iterates through possible segment lengths from 1 to `n-1`, calculates the target sum for each segment length, and checks if the `ticket` can be divided into segments of equal sum. If such a division is possible for any segment length, the function returns 'YES'. If no such division is possible for any segment length, the function returns 'NO'. The function handles all possible cases and edge cases, including the case where `n` is an integer greater than 1 and `ticket` is a string of digits of length `n`. The function's primary action is to perform a series of calculations and checks on the input `ticket` and `n`, and its final state is determined by the outcome of these checks, resulting in either 'YES' or 'NO' being returned.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def segment_sum(start, end):
    return sum((int(ticket[i]) for i in range(start, end + 1)))
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `segment_sum` calculates and returns the sum of the integer values of the digits in a ticket from a specified start index to an end index, where both indices are inclusive and within the bounds of the ticket's length. The function assumes that the ticket is a globally accessible variable and that its indices are 0-based. It takes two parameters, `start` and `end`, which are expected to be integers such that 0 <= start <= end < n, where n is the number of digits in the ticket. The function does not perform any error checking on the input parameters or the ticket variable, so it assumes these constraints are met. The return value is the sum of the digits in the specified range. Note that the function does not handle cases where the ticket variable is not defined or is not a string of digits, and it does not account for potential overflow errors if the sum exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by the return type. The function's execution does not modify the input parameters or the ticket variable; it only returns a calculated sum.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
