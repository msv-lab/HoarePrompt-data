Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The main issue is that the function `func_1` only checks if the ticket can be divided into segments with sums equal to half of the total sum of the ticket. However, the problem description allows for segments with equal sums that are not necessarily half of the total sum.

For example, consider the ticket "350178" mentioned in the problem description. This ticket can be divided into three segments "350", "17", and "8" with equal sums of 8. However, the function `func_1` would not consider this a valid division because the sum of each segment is not half of the total sum.

To meet the requirements of the problem description, the program should be modified to check for all possible segmentations with equal sums, not just those with sums equal to half of the total sum.

Here is an example of how the program could be modified:
```python
def func_1(ticket):
    total_sum = sum(ticket)
    for target_sum in range(1, total_sum // 2 + 1):
        segments = 0
        curr_sum = 0
        for digit in ticket:
            curr_sum += digit
            if curr_sum == target_sum:
                segments += 1
                curr_sum = 0
        if segments >= 2 and curr_sum == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
This modified function checks for all possible segmentations with equal sums by iterating over all possible target sums from 1 to half of the total sum. If it finds a segmentation with at least two segments and no remaining sum, it returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.
