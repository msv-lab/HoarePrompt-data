According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `ticket`. If `ticket` is not empty, the loop can execute. Since `ticket` is a string of digits with 2 <= len(`ticket`) <= 100, it already ensures that `ticket` is not empty. The other variables `total_sum`, `target_sum`, `curr_sum`, and `segments` do not affect the execution of the loop.

For the loop to execute, `digit` should be the first character in `ticket`.

State: **`ticket` is a string of digits such that 2 <= len(`ticket`) <= 100 and all characters in `ticket` are between '0' and '9', `total_sum` equals the sum of the Unicode code points of all characters in `ticket` and is even, `target_sum` equals `total_sum // 2`, `curr_sum` equals 0, `segments` equals 0, `digit` is the first character in `ticket`**
