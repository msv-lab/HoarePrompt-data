The value of `target_sum` is assigned the value of `total_sum // 2`. Since `total_sum` is even, `total_sum // 2` is an integer. The state of `ticket` is not affected. The value of `total_sum` is also not changed, it remains equal to the sum of the Unicode code points of all characters in `ticket` and remains even.

Output State: **`ticket` is a string of digits such that 2 <= len(ticket) <= 100 and all characters in `ticket` are between '0' and '9'; `total_sum` equals the sum of the Unicode code points of all characters in `ticket`, `total_sum` is even, and `target_sum` equals `total_sum // 2`**
