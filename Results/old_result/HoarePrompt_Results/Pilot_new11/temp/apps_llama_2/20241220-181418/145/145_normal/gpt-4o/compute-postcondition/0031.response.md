The given code resets the value of `current_sum` to 0. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `ticket` is a string of digits of length `n`, `segment_length` is 2, the sum of the first two digits of `ticket` equals the previous value of `target_sum`, `target_sum` is equal to the first digit of `ticket`, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 0, `i` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `ticket` is a string of digits of length `n`, `segment_length` is 2, the sum of the first two digits of `ticket` equals the previous value of `target_sum`, `target_sum` is equal to the first digit of `ticket`, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 0, `i` is 0**
