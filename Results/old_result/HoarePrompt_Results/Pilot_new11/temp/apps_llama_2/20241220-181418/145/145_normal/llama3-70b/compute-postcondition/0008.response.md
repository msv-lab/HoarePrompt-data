The value of `curr_sum` is updated by adding the Unicode code point of `digit` to it. Since `digit` is the first character in `ticket`, its Unicode code point is the code point of that digit. 

For example, if `digit` is '5', its Unicode code point is 53. 

So `curr_sum` becomes `0 + digit`, where `digit` is the Unicode code point of the first character in `ticket`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `ticket` is a string of digits such that 2 <= len(`ticket`) <= 100 and all characters in `ticket` are between '0' and '9', `total_sum` equals the sum of the Unicode code points of all characters in `ticket` and is even, `target_sum` equals `total_sum // 2`, `curr_sum` equals the Unicode code point of the first character in `ticket`, `segments` equals 0, `digit` is the first character in `ticket`.

Output State: **`ticket` is a string of digits such that 2 <= len(`ticket`) <= 100 and all characters in `ticket` are between '0' and '9', `total_sum` equals the sum of the Unicode code points of all characters in `ticket` and is even, `target_sum` equals `total_sum // 2`, `curr_sum` equals the Unicode code point of the first character in `ticket`, `segments` equals 0, `digit` is the first character in `ticket`**
