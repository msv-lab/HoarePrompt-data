Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `ticket` is a string of digits of length `n`, `segment_length` is 2, `i` is 1, `current_sum` is the old value of `current_sum` plus the integer value of `ticket[1]`. If `current_sum` equals `target_sum`, then `current_sum` is 0 and `segment_count` is the previous value of `segment_count` + 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains as it was before the if statement, with `current_sum` being the old value of `current_sum` plus the integer value of `ticket[1]`.***
