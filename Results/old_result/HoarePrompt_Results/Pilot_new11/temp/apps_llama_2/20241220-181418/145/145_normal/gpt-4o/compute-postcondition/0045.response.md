Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `ticket` is a string of digits of length `n`, `segment_length` is 2, `target_sum` is the sum of the first two digits of the original `ticket`, if `n` is 0 then the current value of `current_sum` is 0 and the current value of `segment_count` is 0, otherwise the current value of `current_sum` is the sum of the remaining digits not forming a complete segment or 0 if the last segment sums to `target_sum`, and the current value of `segment_count` is the number of complete segments whose sum equals `target_sum`. The current value of `current_sum` is 0 and the current value of `segment_count` is greater than 1.**
