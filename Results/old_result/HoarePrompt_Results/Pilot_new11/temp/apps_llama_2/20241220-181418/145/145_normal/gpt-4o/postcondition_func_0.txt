The function `func_1` checks if a given string of digits `ticket` of length `n` (where `n` is an integer greater than 1) can be divided into segments of equal sum. The function iterates through possible segment lengths from 1 to `n-1`, calculates the target sum for each segment length, and checks if the `ticket` can be divided into segments of equal sum. If such a division is possible for any segment length, the function returns 'YES'. If no such division is possible for any segment length, the function returns 'NO'. The function handles all possible cases and edge cases, including the case where `n` is an integer greater than 1 and `ticket` is a string of digits of length `n`. The function's primary action is to perform a series of calculations and checks on the input `ticket` and `n`, and its final state is determined by the outcome of these checks, resulting in either 'YES' or 'NO' being returned.
