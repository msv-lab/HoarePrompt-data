Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer and greater than `i + 1`, `ticket` is a string of digits of length `n`, `segment_length` is 3, `target_sum` is the sum of the first 3 digits of `ticket`. If `current_sum` equals `target_sum`, then `i` is incremented by 1, `current_sum` is reset to 0, and `segment_count` is incremented by 1. If `current_sum` does not equal `target_sum`, then the state of the variables remains as it was before the if statement, with `i` and `current_sum` having been previously updated.***
