The function `segment_sum` accepts two parameters, `start` and `end`, both of which are integers. The integers `start` and `end` have constraints such that 0 <= `start` <= `end` < n, where n is the number of digits in the 'ticket'. After executing the function body, the function returns the sum of the integer values of the digits in 'ticket' from index `start` to `end`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, start and end, which are integers with specific constraints, and returns the sum of the integer values of the digits in 'ticket' from index start to end.**
