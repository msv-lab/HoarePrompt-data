Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the problem description. The problem requires finding the minimum number of actions needed to turn over all `n` skewers and printing out the corresponding skewer numbers to turn over.

The program achieves this by using a simple arithmetic sequence approach. It starts from the first skewer (`i = 1`) and adds it to the `positions` list. Then, it increments `i` by `2 * k + 1`, which effectively skips over the skewers that would be turned over by the current operation, ensuring that the next operation starts from the first skewer that hasn't been turned over yet.

This process continues until `i` exceeds `n`, at which point all skewers have been accounted for. The `positions` list then contains the minimum number of skewers that need to be turned over to flip all `n` skewers.

The program correctly prints out the length of the `positions` list (i.e., the minimum number of actions needed) followed by the skewer numbers to turn over. This approach ensures that the program meets the problem description's requirements.

For example, given the input `7 2`, the program will output `2` followed by `1 6`, which matches the expected output in the problem description. Similarly, for the input `5 1`, the program will output `2` followed by `1 4`, which also matches the expected output.

Overall, the program's simple and elegant approach ensures that it correctly solves the problem for all valid inputs.
