You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Long story short, shashlik is Miroslav's favorite food. Shashlik is prepared on several skewers simultaneously. There are two states for each skewer: initial and turned over.

This time Miroslav laid out $n$ skewers parallel to each other, and enumerated them with consecutive integers from $1$ to $n$ in order from left to right. For better cooking, he puts them quite close to each other, so when he turns skewer number $i$, it leads to turning $k$ closest skewers from each side of the skewer $i$, that is, skewers number $i - k$, $i - k + 1$, ..., $i - 1$, $i + 1$, ..., $i + k - 1$, $i + k$ (if they exist). 

For example, let $n = 6$ and $k = 1$. When Miroslav turns skewer number $3$, then skewers with numbers $2$, $3$, and $4$ will come up turned over. If after that he turns skewer number $1$, then skewers number $1$, $3$, and $4$ will be turned over, while skewer number $2$ will be in the initial position (because it is turned again).

As we said before, the art of cooking requires perfect timing, so Miroslav wants to turn over all $n$ skewers with the minimal possible number of actions. For example, for the above example $n = 6$ and $k = 1$, two turnings are sufficient: he can turn over skewers number $2$ and $5$.

Help Miroslav turn over all $n$ skewers.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \leq n \leq 1000$, $0 \leq k \leq 1000$) — the number of skewers and the number of skewers from each side that are turned in one step.


-----Output-----

The first line should contain integer $l$ — the minimum number of actions needed by Miroslav to turn over all $n$ skewers. After than print $l$ integers from $1$ to $n$ denoting the number of the skewer that is to be turned over at the corresponding step.


-----Examples-----
Input
7 2

Output
2
1 6 

Input
5 1

Output
2
1 4 



-----Note-----

In the first example the first operation turns over skewers $1$, $2$ and $3$, the second operation turns over skewers $4$, $5$, $6$ and $7$.

In the second example it is also correct to turn over skewers $2$ and $5$, but turning skewers $2$ and $4$, or $1$ and $5$ are incorrect solutions because the skewer $3$ is in the initial state after these operations.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    l = (n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)
    res = []
    for i in range(l):
        res.append(i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1)
    print(l)
    print(' '.join(map(str, res)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct and meets the problem description for every potential case. 

The program works by first calculating the minimum number of actions `l` needed to turn over all `n` skewers using the formula `l = (n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)`. This formula is based on the fact that each action turns over `k * 2 + 1` skewers, and we need to turn over `n` skewers.

The program then calculates the indices of the skewers that need to be turned over in each action using the loop `for i in range(l)`. The index of the skewer to be turned over in the `i-th` action is calculated as `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1`, which ensures that the skewers are turned over in a way that covers the entire range of `n` skewers.

The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when `n` is less than or equal to `k * 2 + 1`, in which case only one action is needed. It also handles cases where `n` is not a multiple of `k * 2 + 1`, in which case the formula `l = (n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)` ensures that the minimum number of actions is calculated correctly.

I couldn't find any case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer and k is a non-negative integer, such that 1 <= n <= 1000 and 0 <= k <= 1000.
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    l = (n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)
    res = []
    for i in range(l):
        res.append(i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the given information and the loop code.
    #
    #1. **Initial State**: 
    #   - `n` is an input integer.
    #   - `k` is an input integer.
    #   - `l` is equal to `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)`.
    #   - `res` is an empty list.
    #
    #2. **Loop Code**:
    #   ```
    #   for i in range(l):
    #       res.append(i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1)
    #   ```
    #
    #3. **Output States after Executing the Loop a Few Times**:
    #   - After 1 time: `res` contains the value 1, `i` is 0.
    #   - After 2 times: `res` contains the values 1 and `2 * k + 2` (which can be calculated as `1 * (k * 2 + 1) + 1`), `i` is 1.
    #   - After 3 times: `res` contains the values 1, `2 * k + 2`, and `4 * k + 3` (which can be calculated as `2 * (k * 2 + 1) + 1`), `i` is 2.
    #
    #From the loop code, it's clear that `res` is being populated with values calculated as `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1` for each `i` in the range from 0 to `l-1`. 
    #
    #- If `l` is 0 (meaning `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)` equals 0), the loop will not execute, and `res` will remain an empty list. This happens when `n + k - 1 < k * 2 + 1`.
    #- If `l` is greater than 0, the loop will execute `l` times, appending `l` values to `res`. Each value appended is of the form `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1` for `i` ranging from 0 to `l-1`.
    #
    #**Calculating the Final State**:
    #
    #- `n` and `k` retain their original values as input integers.
    #- `l` is determined by the formula `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)`, and its value determines how many times the loop executes.
    #- `res` will contain a list of values where each value is calculated as `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1` for `i` from 0 to `l-1`. If `l` is 0, `res` remains an empty list.
    #- `i` will be `l-1` after the loop finishes, because the loop iterates over the range from 0 to `l-1`.
    #
    #**Output State**: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)`, `res` is a list containing values from 1 to `(l-1) * (k * 2 + 1) + 1` (or empty if `l` is 0), and `i` is `l-1` if `l` > 0, otherwise, `i` remains undefined as the loop doesn't execute.**
    print(l)
    print(' '.join(map(str, res)))


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
