The given code appends a value to the `res` list. This value is calculated as `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1`. 

Given that `i` is 0, the expression `i * (k * 2 + 1)` equals 0, because any number multiplied by 0 is 0. 

So, the value appended to `res` is `0 * (k * 2 + 1) + 1`, which simplifies to `1`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is greater than 0, `res` is a list containing the value 1, `i` is 0, `n + k - 1` is greater than 0.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is greater than 0, `res` is a list containing the value 1, `i` is 0, `n + k - 1` is greater than 0**
