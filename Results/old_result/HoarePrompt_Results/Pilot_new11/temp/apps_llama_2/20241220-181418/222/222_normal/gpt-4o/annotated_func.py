#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer and k is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000 and 0 <= k <= 1000.
def func_1(n, k):
    positions = []
    i = 1
    while i <= n:
        positions.append(i)
        
        i += 2 * k + 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `i` is the smallest value greater than `n` in the arithmetic sequence starting at 1 with a common difference of `2 * k + 1`, `positions` is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of `2 * k + 1` starting at 1 and ending at the largest term less than or equal to `n`, `n` and `k` retain their original values.
    print(len(positions))
    print(' '.join(map(str, positions)))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function generates and prints an arithmetic sequence of positions with a common difference of 2k + 1, starting at 1 and ending at the largest term less than or equal to n, where n is a positive integer and k is a non-negative integer. It also prints the length of this sequence. The function accepts two parameters, n and k, with constraints 1 <= n <= 1000 and 0 <= k <= 1000, and returns no value (i.e., it has a side effect of printing the results). After execution, the state of the program includes the printed sequence and its length, while the original values of n and k remain unchanged. The function handles edge cases, such as when k is 0 (resulting in a sequence of consecutive integers) or when n is less than or equal to 1 (resulting in a sequence of length 1 or 0, respectively), and it does not modify the input variables n and k.
