The code appends a new value to the list `res`. The new value is calculated as `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1`. 

Given that `i` is 1, the new value becomes `1 * (k * 2 + 1) + 1`, which simplifies to `2 * k + 2`. 

The list `res` initially contains the value 1, so after appending the new value, `res` will contain the values 1 and `2 * k + 2`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is greater than 1, `res` is a list containing the values 1 and `2 * k + 2`, `i` is 1, `n + k - 1` is greater than 0.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is greater than 1, `res` is a list containing the values 1 and `2 * k + 2`, `i` is 1, `n + k - 1` is greater than 0**
