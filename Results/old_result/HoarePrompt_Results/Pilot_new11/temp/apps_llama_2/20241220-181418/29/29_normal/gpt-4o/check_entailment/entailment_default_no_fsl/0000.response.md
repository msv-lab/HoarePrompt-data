Correctness: **False**

The provided code has several issues that affect its functionality and correctness. 

1. The line `name, type_ = file.split()` will not raise an error because `files` is indeed a list of strings, each representing a file with its type. However, the code does not handle the case where the filename is a number that could be confused with the target filename (e.g., a file named "1" that is a regular test). 

2. The variable `files_set` is defined as a set of filenames, but it is not used correctly to avoid overwriting existing files. 

3. The code does not handle potential errors, such as when `n` is outside the specified range or when `files` contains invalid data. 

4. The code does not generate the minimum number of moves. It uses a temporary filename for each file that needs to be renamed, which is not necessary. 

5. The code does not handle the case where a file with the target name already exists. In this case, it should first rename the existing file to a temporary name.

For example, consider the case where the input is:

```
5
1 0
2 1
3 0
4 1
5 0
```

The code will generate the following moves:

```
move 1 6
move 6 5
move 3 7
move 7 4
move 5 8
move 8 3
move 2 9
move 9 2
move 4 10
move 10 1
```

However, this is not the minimum number of moves. A more efficient solution would be to first rename the files with the wrong names to temporary names, and then rename the temporary files to the correct names.

A correct solution would need to handle these cases correctly, and generate the minimum number of moves to rename the files. 

In conclusion, the provided code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, so its correctness is **False**.
