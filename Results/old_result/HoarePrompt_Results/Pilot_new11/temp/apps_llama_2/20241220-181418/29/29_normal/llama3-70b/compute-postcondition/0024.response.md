The code snippet `script.append(f'move {file} {i}')` appends a new string to the `script` list. The string is in the format `f'move {file} {i}'`, where `file` is the first element in `regular` and `i` is at least `len(examples) + 1`. 

The value of `n` remains a non-negative integer, `files` remains a list of `n` tuples, `examples` remains a list of strings, `regular` remains a non-empty list of strings with `file` being the first element, and `i` remains at least `len(examples) + 1`. 

The `script` list now contains an additional string `f'move {file} {i}'`, which is appended to its existing elements.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples where each tuple contains a distinct string of digits and small English letters and an integer, sorted in descending order by the integer value, `examples` is a list of strings, `regular` is a non-empty list of strings, `script` is a list containing strings in the format `f'move {file} {i}'` for each `file` in `examples` with `i` ranging from 1 to the length of `examples` and an additional string `f'move {file} {i}'` where `file` is the first element in `regular` and `i` is at least `len(examples) + 1`, or an empty list if `examples` is empty and only contains `f'move {file} {i}'` where `file` is the first element in `regular` and `i` is at least 1, and `i` is at least `len(examples) + 1`, and `file` is the first element in `regular`**
