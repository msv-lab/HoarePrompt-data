To calculate the output state, we first note that the values of `n`, `files`, `examples`, `regulars`, `i`, and `target` remain unchanged. The value of `temp_counter` also remains unchanged as it is not modified in the given code snippet.

The given code appends a new string to the `moves` list. The string is in the format 'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}', where `{regulars[i]}` is the value at index `i` in the `regulars` list, and `{temp_counter}` is the current value of `temp_counter`.

Therefore, the `moves` list is updated with a new string representing a move operation.

Output State: **`n` remains unchanged, `files` does not change, `examples` does not change, `regulars` does not change, `i` does not change, `target` does not change, `temp_counter` is the minimum of `2 * n + 1` or the first value greater than the last `temp_counter` for which `str(temp_counter)` was in `files_set`, and `moves` is updated with the new move operation 'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}'**
