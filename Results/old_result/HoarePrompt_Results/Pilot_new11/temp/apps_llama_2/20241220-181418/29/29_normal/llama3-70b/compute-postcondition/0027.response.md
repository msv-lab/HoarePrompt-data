To determine the adjusted states for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `files` is a list of `n` tuples where each tuple contains a distinct string of digits and small English letters and an integer, sorted in descending order by the integer value.
- `examples` is a list of strings.
- `regular` is a list of strings that must have at least one more element.
- `script` is a list containing all the previous strings in the format `f'move {file} {i}'` for each `file` in `examples` with `i` ranging from 1 to the length of `examples` and an additional string `f'move {file} {i}'` where `file` is the first element in `regular` and `i` is at least `len(examples) + 1`, or an empty list if `examples` is empty and only contains `f'move {file} {i}'` where `file` is the first element in `regular` and `i` is at least 1.
- `i` is the index of the next element in `regular` which is at least `len(examples) + 1` and `file` is the next element in `regular`.
- The loop is `for (i, file) in enumerate(regular, start=len(examples) + 1)`.

Since the loop iterates over `regular` with `enumerate` starting from `len(examples) + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `regular` must have at least one more element beyond the current `i`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` remains unchanged as it's not modified within the loop.
- `files` remains unchanged for the same reason.
- `examples` remains unchanged.
- `regular` must have had at least one element to reach the end of the previous iteration.
- `script` would have been updated with the string for the current `file` and `i`.
- `i` is the current index plus one (since we're considering the next iteration), and `file` would be the next element in `regular`.

Adjusted states for the loop to execute one more time:
- `n` is still a non-negative integer.
- `files` is still a list of `n` tuples where each tuple contains a distinct string of digits and small English letters and an integer, sorted in descending order by the integer value.
- `examples` is still a list of strings.
- `regular` must have at least one more element than at the end of the previous iteration.
- `script` contains all previous strings plus the newly appended string `f'move {file} {i}'` for the next `file` and `i`.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, thus `i` is at least `len(examples) + 2` if `regular` has enough elements.
- `file` is the next element in `regular` after the one at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples where each tuple contains a distinct string of digits and small English letters and an integer, sorted in descending order by the integer value, `examples` is a list of strings, `regular` is a list of strings that must have at least one more element than previously, `script` contains all previous strings plus the new string `f'move {next_file} {next_i}'` where `next_file` is the next element in `regular` and `next_i` is at least `len(examples) + 2`, and `i` is at least `len(examples) + 2` and `file` is the next element in `regular`**
