To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to examine the conditions of the `while` loop statement, which are `temp_counter <= 2 * n` and `str(temp_counter) in files_set`.

Given the initial states:
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5.
- `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type.
- `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1' with a length of at least 2.
- `regulars` is a list of filenames not of type '1'.
- `temp_counter` is either `n + 1` or `n + 2`.
- `i` equals 1.
- `moves` contains `f'move {examples[0]} {temp_counter - 1}'` if `examples[0]` was not equal to '1' and `f'move {examples[0]} {1}'`, otherwise `moves` remains empty.

For the loop to execute, two conditions must be met:
1. `temp_counter <= 2 * n`: Given that `temp_counter` is either `n + 1` or `n + 2`, this condition will always be true because `n + 2` (the maximum value of `temp_counter`) is less than or equal to `2 * n` for all `n >= 1`. Thus, no adjustment is needed for `temp_counter` or `n` regarding this condition.

2. `str(temp_counter) in files_set`: This implies that the string representation of `temp_counter` must be present in the set `files_set`. Since `files_set` is not directly defined in the given state, we infer it's derived from `files`, which contains tuples of filenames and types. For `str(temp_counter)` to be in `files_set`, it means `files_set` must contain string representations of numbers that correspond to the `temp_counter` value. Given `temp_counter` is `n + 1` or `n + 2`, and considering the constraint on `n`, we need to ensure that at least one of these values (as a string) exists as a filename in `files`.

To guarantee the loop executes at least once, we need to ensure that `str(temp_counter)` is indeed in `files_set`, which implies that `files` must contain a tuple where the filename is either `str(n + 1)` or `str(n + 2)`. 

Therefore, the adjustment needed is that `files` must include a tuple where the filename matches the string representation of `temp_counter`, which could be either `n + 1` or `n + 2`. All other states can remain as initially described because they do not directly impact the loop's ability to execute the first iteration based on the given conditions.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type and must include a filename that is the string representation of `temp_counter`, `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1' with a length of at least 2, `regulars` is a list of filenames not of type '1', `temp_counter` is either `n + 1` or `n + 2`, `i` equals 1, and `moves` contains `f'move {examples[0]} {temp_counter - 1}'` if `examples[0]` was not equal to '1' and `f'move {examples[0]} {1}'`, otherwise `moves` remains empty**
