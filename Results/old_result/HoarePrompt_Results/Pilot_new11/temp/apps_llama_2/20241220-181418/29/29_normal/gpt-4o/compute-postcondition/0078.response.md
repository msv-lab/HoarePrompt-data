To determine the output state of the loop, let's analyze the loop's conditions and how the variables change with each iteration.

The loop condition is `temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set`. This means the loop will continue to execute as long as `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and the string representation of `temp_counter` is found in `files_set`.

From the provided output states after the loop executes 1, 2, and 3 times, we can observe the following patterns:

- `temp_counter` increases by 1 with each iteration.
- The condition for the loop to execute at least a certain number of times depends on `temp_counter` being within the range from `n + 1` (initial value) up to `2 * n`, and the presence of the string representation of `temp_counter` in `files_set` after each increment.

Given that `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, and the loop increments `temp_counter` until it exceeds `2 * n` or its string representation is no longer found in `files_set`, we can deduce the final state of the variables.

The loop will stop when either `temp_counter` exceeds `2 * n` or when `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`. Since `i` and `target` do not change within the loop, their values remain constant.

Therefore, considering the loop's termination conditions and the lack of modification to `i`, `target`, `n`, `examples`, and `regulars` within the loop, the output state after the loop has executed all its iterations will be:

Output State: **`n` remains unchanged, `files` and its associated `files_set` remain unchanged, `examples` remains unchanged, `regulars` remains unchanged, `i` is 0, `target` is `len(examples) + 1`, and `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n` or its string representation is not in `files_set`, whichever condition is met first, indicating the loop has terminated.**
