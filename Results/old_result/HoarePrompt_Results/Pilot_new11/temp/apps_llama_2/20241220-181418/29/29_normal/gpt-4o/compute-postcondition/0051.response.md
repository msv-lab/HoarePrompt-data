The code appends a new string to the `moves` list. The string is in the format 'move {examples[i]} {i + 1}'. 

Since `i` equals 1 and the current value of `examples[i]` is not equal to the string representation of `i + 1`, `examples[i]` is `examples[1]`. 

The new string appended to `moves` is 'move {examples[1]} {1 + 1}' which is 'move {examples[1]} {2}'.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type, `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1' with a length of at least 2, `regulars` is a list of filenames not of type '1', `i` equals 1, `moves` contains its initial value based on `examples[0]` and 'move {examples[1]} {temp_counter}' if `examples[1]` is not equal to `str(i + 1)`, otherwise `moves` contains `f'move {examples[0]} {temp_counter - 1}'` if `examples[0]` was not equal to '1' and `f'move {examples[0]} {1}'`, otherwise `moves` remains empty, and `moves` also contains 'move {examples[1]} {2}', `temp_counter` is one more than the smallest integer greater than its initial value (`n + 1` or `n + 2`) that exceeds `2 * n` or whose string representation is not in `files_set`, `examples[1]` is the string representation of the previous value of `temp_counter`, and the current value of `examples[i]` is not equal to the string representation of `i + 1`.
