The code `temp_counter = n + 1` assigns the value of `n + 1` to the variable `temp_counter`. The value of `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5. 

So, `temp_counter` is assigned the value `n + 1`, where `n` is in the range [1, 10^5]. Therefore, the value of `temp_counter` is in the range [2, 10^5 + 1].

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type, `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1', `regulars` is a list of filenames not of type '1', `moves` is an empty list, `temp_counter` is `n + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type, `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1', `regulars` is a list of filenames not of type '1', `moves` is an empty list, `temp_counter` is `n + 1`.**
