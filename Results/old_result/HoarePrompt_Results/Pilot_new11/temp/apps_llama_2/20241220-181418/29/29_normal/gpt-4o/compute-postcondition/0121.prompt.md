You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, files is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a string of digits and small English letters (the filename) and an integer (the type, either 0 or 1) such that the filenames are distinct and the length of each filename is from 1 to 6 characters.
def func_1(n, files):
    examples = []
    regulars = []
    for file in files:
        name, type_ = file.split()
        
        if type_ == '1':
            examples.append(name)
        else:
            regulars.append(name)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type, `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1', `regulars` is a list of filenames not of type '1'.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type, `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1' where each filename matches its expected numeric filename, `regulars` is a list of filenames not of type '1', `temp_counter` is greater than or equal to `n + 1` and has been incremented based on the updates of `examples`, `i` equals `len(examples) - 1`, and `moves` contains move commands for all filenames in `examples` that were updated.
    for i in range(len(regulars)):
        target = len(examples) + i + 1
        
        if regulars[i] != str(target):
            while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
                temp_counter += 1
            moves.append(f'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}')
            regulars[i] = str(temp_counter)
            temp_counter += 1
        
        if regulars[i] != str(target):
            moves.append(f'move {regulars[i]} {target}')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type with potential updates in filenames due to move operations, `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1' where each filename matches its expected numeric filename, `regulars` is a list of filenames not of type '1' where each filename is updated to match its target numeric filename, `temp_counter` is greater than or equal to `n + 1` and has been incremented based on the updates of `regulars`, `i` equals `len(regulars) - 1`, and `moves` contains move commands for all filenames in `regulars` that were updated.
    return moves
    #The program returns `moves`, which contains move commands for all filenames in `regulars` that were updated to match their target numeric filenames.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `n` and a list of files `files`, and returns the move commands for the updated filenames.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns `moves`, which contains move commands for all filenames in `regulars` that were updated to match their target numeric filenames.


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
