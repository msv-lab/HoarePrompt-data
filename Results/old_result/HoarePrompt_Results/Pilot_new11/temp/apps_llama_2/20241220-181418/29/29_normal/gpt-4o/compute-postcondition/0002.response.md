According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `files` list. If the list has at least 1 file, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples, `examples` is an empty list, and `regulars` is an empty list. For the loop to execute, `files` must have at least 1 file, and the `file` variable should be the first file in the list.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 file, `examples` is an empty list, `regulars` is an empty list, `file` is the first file in the `files` list**
