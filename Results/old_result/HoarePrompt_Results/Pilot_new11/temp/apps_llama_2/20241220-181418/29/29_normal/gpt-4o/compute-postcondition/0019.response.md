To calculate the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop code and the patterns observed in the output states after the first few iterations.

The loop code is:
```python
for file in files:
    name, type_ = file.split()
    if type_ == '1':
        examples.append(name)
    else:
        regulars.append(name)
```
From the given initial state and the loop code, we can deduce the following:

1. `n` remains unchanged throughout the loop as it is not modified within the loop.
2. `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type. The loop iterates over each file in the `files` list.
3. For each file, the filename (`name`) and the type (`type_`) are extracted by splitting the file tuple.
4. Based on the `type_`, the `name` is either appended to the `examples` list if `type_` is '1' or to the `regulars` list if `type_` is not '1'.

Considering the patterns from the output states after the first few iterations:

- After the loop executes once, `examples` or `regulars` will contain the name of the first file, depending on its type.
- After the loop executes twice, `examples` or `regulars` will contain the names of the first two files, each appended based on its type.
- This pattern continues, indicating that after all iterations, `examples` will contain the names of all files with `type_` == '1', and `regulars` will contain the names of all files with `type_`!= '1'.

Given that the loop iterates over all files in the `files` list, the final output state can be deduced as follows:

- `n` remains an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, as its value does not change.
- `files` is a list of tuples that has been fully iterated over.
- `examples` is a list containing the names of all files where `type_` is '1'.
- `regulars` is a list containing the names of all files where `type_` is not '1'.

If the `files` list is empty, the loop does not execute, and thus `examples` and `regulars` remain empty lists.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type, `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1', `regulars` is a list of filenames not of type '1'.**
