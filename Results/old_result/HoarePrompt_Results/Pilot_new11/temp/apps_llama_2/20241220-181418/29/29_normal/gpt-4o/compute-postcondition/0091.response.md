The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `temp_counter` is 2, so the new value of `temp_counter` is 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples where at least one tuple contains a filename '1' and '2' and potentially '3', `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1', `regulars` is a list of filenames not of type '1' with at least 2 filenames, `i` is 1, `target` is `len(examples) + 2`, `temp_counter` is 3, and '3' is in `files_set`**
