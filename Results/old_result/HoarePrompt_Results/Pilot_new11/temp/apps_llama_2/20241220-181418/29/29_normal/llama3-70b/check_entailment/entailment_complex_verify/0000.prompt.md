You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The All-Berland National Olympiad in Informatics has just ended! Now Vladimir wants to upload the contest from the Olympiad as a gym to a popular Codehorses website.

Unfortunately, the archive with Olympiad's data is a mess. For example, the files with tests are named arbitrary without any logic.

Vladimir wants to rename the files with tests so that their names are distinct integers starting from 1 without any gaps, namely, "1", "2", ..., "n', where n is the total number of tests.

Some of the files contain tests from statements (examples), while others contain regular tests. It is possible that there are no examples, and it is possible that all tests are examples. Vladimir wants to rename the files so that the examples are the first several tests, all all the next files contain regular tests only.

The only operation Vladimir can perform is the "move" command. Vladimir wants to write a script file, each of the lines in which is "move file_1 file_2", that means that the file "file_1" is to be renamed to "file_2". If there is a file "file_2" at the moment of this line being run, then this file is to be rewritten. After the line "move file_1 file_2" the file "file_1" doesn't exist, but there is a file "file_2" with content equal to the content of "file_1" before the "move" command.

Help Vladimir to write the script file with the minimum possible number of lines so that after this script is run:  all examples are the first several tests having filenames "1", "2", ..., "e", where e is the total number of examples;  all other files contain regular tests with filenames "e + 1", "e + 2", ..., "n", where n is the total number of all tests. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of files with tests.

n lines follow, each describing a file with test. Each line has a form of "name_i type_i", where "name_i" is the filename, and "type_i" equals "1", if the i-th file contains an example test, and "0" if it contains a regular test. Filenames of each file are strings of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6 characters. The filenames are guaranteed to be distinct.


-----Output-----

In the first line print the minimum number of lines in Vladimir's script file.

After that print the script file, each line should be "move file_1 file_2", where "file_1" is an existing at the moment of this line being run filename, and "file_2" — is a string of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6.


-----Examples-----

Program:

def func():
    n = int(input())
    files = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (name, type_) = input().split()
        files.append((name, int(type_)))
    files.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    examples = [file[0] for file in files if file[1] == 1]
    regular = [file[0] for file in files if file[1] == 0]
    script = []
    for (i, file) in enumerate(examples, start=1):
        script.append(f'move {file} {i}')
    for (i, file) in enumerate(regular, start=len(examples) + 1):
        script.append(f'move {file} {i}')
    print(len(script))
    for line in script:
        print(line)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The problem with the given code is that it does not handle cases where the filename of a file matches the destination filename of another file. In such cases, the code will overwrite the file with the matching filename without moving it to a new location.

For example, if the input is:

```
5
1 1
2 1
3 0
01 0
10 0
```

The expected output should be:

```
5
move 3 5
move 1 1
move 2 2
move 01 3
move 10 4
```

However, the code will produce:

```
5
move 1 1
move 2 2
move 3 3
move 01 4
move 10 5
```

This output does not meet the requirements of the problem because it does not correctly handle the case where the filename "3" matches the destination filename of the file with filename "01". The correct output should move the file with filename "3" to a new location before moving the file with filename "01" to the location "3".

To fix this issue, the code should keep track of the files that have been moved and avoid overwriting them. One way to do this is by adding a temporary file name when moving files. 

In the above example, we first move file "3" to a temporary location, say "6", then move file "1" to location "1", then move file "2" to location "2", then move file "01" to location "3", and finally move file "10" to location "4", and file "6" to location "5". 

Here is a simple fix:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    files = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (name, type_) = input().split()
        files.append((name, int(type_)))
    files.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    examples = [file[0] for file in files if file[1] == 1]
    regular = [file[0] for file in files if file[1] == 0]
    occupied = set(str(i) for i in range(1, n + 1))
    temp = "temp"
    script = []
    for (i, file) in enumerate(examples, start=1):
        if file == str(i):
            continue
        if str(i) not in occupied and str(i)!= file:
            script.append(f'move {file} {temp}')
            script.append(f'move {str(i)} {i + n}')
            script.append(f'move {temp} {i}')
            occupied.add(str(i))
            occupied.add(str(i + n))
        elif str(i) not in occupied and str(i) == file:
            occupied.add(str(i))
        else:
            if str(i) in occupied:
                new_name = n + i
                script.append(f'move {file} {temp}')
                script.append(f'move {str(i)} {new_name}')
                script.append(f'move {temp} {i}')
                occupied.add(str(new_name))
            else:
                script.append(f'move {file} {i}')
                occupied.add(str(i))
    for (i, file) in enumerate(regular, start=len(examples) + 1):
        if file == str(i):
            continue
        if str(i) not in occupied and str(i)!= file:
            script.append(f'move {file} {temp}')
            script.append(f'move {str(i)} {i + n}')
            script.append(f'move {temp} {i}')
            occupied.add(str(i))
            occupied.add(str(i + n))
        elif str(i) not in occupied and str(i) == file:
            occupied.add(str(i))
        else:
            if str(i) in occupied:
                new_name = n + i
                script.append(f'move {file} {temp}')
                script.append(f'move {str(i)} {new_name}')
                script.append(f'move {temp} {i}')
                occupied.add(str(new_name))
            else:
                script.append(f'move {file} {i}')
                occupied.add(str(i))
    i = n + 1
    for name in occupied:
        if int(name) > n:
            script.append(f'move {name} {i - n}')
            i += 1
    print(len(script))
    for line in script:
        print(line)

```

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: the input consists of a single integer n, followed by n lines, each containing a string and an integer, where the integer is either 0 or 1, the string consists of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6 characters, and all strings are distinct.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    files = []
    for _ in range(n):
        name, type_ = input().split()
        
        files.append((name, int(type_)))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains a string and an integer, the string consists of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6 characters, and all strings are distinct.
    files.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    examples = [file[0] for file in files if file[1] == 1]
    regular = [file[0] for file in files if file[1] == 0]
    script = []
    for (i, file) in enumerate(examples, start=1):
        script.append(f'move {file} {i}')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples where each tuple contains a distinct string of digits and small English letters and an integer, sorted in descending order by the integer value, `examples` is a list of strings, `regular` is a list of strings, `script` is a list containing strings in the format `f'move {file} {i}'` for each `file` in `examples` with `i` ranging from 1 to the length of `examples`, or an empty list if `examples` is empty.
    for (i, file) in enumerate(regular, start=len(examples) + 1):
        script.append(f'move {file} {i}')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples where each tuple contains a distinct string of digits and small English letters and an integer, sorted in descending order by the integer value, `examples` is a list of strings, `regular` is a list of strings, and `script` contains strings in the format `f'move {file} {i}'` for each `file` in `examples` with `i` ranging from 1 to the length of `examples`, and for each `file` in `regular` with `i` ranging from `len(examples) + 1` to `len(examples) + len(regular)` if `regular` is not empty, or remains as in the initial state if `regular` is empty.
    print(len(script))
    for line in script:
        print(line)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples where each tuple contains a distinct string of digits and small English letters and an integer, sorted in descending order by the integer value, `examples` is a list of strings, `regular` is a list of strings, `script` is a list of strings that has been fully printed, and if `script` is not empty, `line` is the last line in `script`, otherwise, the variables retain their initial values.
#Overall this is what the function does:This function processes a series of inputs consisting of a single integer `n`, followed by `n` lines, each containing a unique string and a binary integer. The function sorts these input lines based on the binary integer in descending order, categorizes them into "examples" and "regular" files, generates a script with "move" commands for each file in a specific order, and then prints the length of the script followed by each line of the script. The script assigns a unique index to each file, starting from 1 for examples and continuing from the end of examples for regular files. The function handles cases where there are no examples, no regular files, or no files at all, producing an empty script in the latter case. Upon completion, the function has printed the total number of move commands and the commands themselves, leaving the system in a state where these commands could be executed to rearrange files according to the specified order.
