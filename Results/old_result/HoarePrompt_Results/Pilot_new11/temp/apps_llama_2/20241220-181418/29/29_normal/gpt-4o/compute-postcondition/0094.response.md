To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, let's analyze the given information and the loop's condition.

The loop condition is `while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:`. This means the loop will continue as long as `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and the string representation of `temp_counter` is found in `files_set`.

Given the initial state and the output states after the loop executes some number of times, we can observe the following:

1. `temp_counter` starts at 1 (though not explicitly stated, it can be inferred from the increments and the initial output states).
2. `n` remains constant throughout the loop, as there's no operation modifying it within the loop.
3. `files`, `examples`, `regulars`, `i`, and `target` are not modified within the loop based on the provided information.
4. The loop increments `temp_counter` by 1 in each iteration.

For the loop to execute at least once, `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`, and `str(temp_counter)` (initially '1') must be in `files_set`. For subsequent iterations, the same conditions apply with `temp_counter` incremented.

The key factor determining the number of iterations is the condition `str(temp_counter) in files_set`. The loop will stop either when `temp_counter` exceeds `2 * n` or when `str(temp_counter)` is not found in `files_set`.

Given that `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, the maximum value `temp_counter` can reach is `2 * n`, which is in the range of 2 to 200,000.

The final output state will depend on which condition causes the loop to terminate:

- If `temp_counter` exceeds `2 * n` before `str(temp_counter)` is not found in `files_set`, then `temp_counter` will be `2 * n + 1` because it increments one last time before the condition fails.
- If `str(temp_counter)` is not found in `files_set` before `temp_counter` exceeds `2 * n`, then `temp_counter` will be the last value for which `str(temp_counter)` was in `files_set` plus one.

Considering the variables' dependencies on their original values and the loop's behavior:

Output State: **`n` remains unchanged, `files`, `examples`, `regulars`, `i`, and `target` do not change, and `temp_counter` is the minimum of `2 * n + 1` or the first value greater than the last `temp_counter` for which `str(temp_counter)` was in `files_set`**
