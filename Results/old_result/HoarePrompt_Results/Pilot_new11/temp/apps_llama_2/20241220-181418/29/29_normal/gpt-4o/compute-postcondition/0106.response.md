To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the condition of the `while` loop: `temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set`.

1. **Condition 1: `temp_counter <= 2 * n`**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `temp_counter` must still be less than or equal to `2 * n`. Since `temp_counter` is an integer, for it to satisfy the condition again after an iteration, it should be less than or equal to `2 * n` because if it was exactly `2 * n + 1`, it would not satisfy the condition after incrementing. Therefore, `temp_counter` needs to be adjusted to be less than or equal to `2 * n`.

2. **Condition 2: `str(temp_counter) in files_set`**
   - The state mentions that `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type and must include a tuple with a filename equal to `str(temp_counter - 1)`. However, the condition requires `str(temp_counter)` to be in `files_set`. Since `files_set` is derived from `files`, for `str(temp_counter)` to be in `files_set`, there must be a tuple in `files` with a filename equal to `str(temp_counter)`. Therefore, `files` needs to be adjusted to include a tuple with a filename equal to `str(temp_counter)`.

Given these adjustments:

- `n` remains an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, as its value does not directly affect the ability of the loop to execute again based on the given conditions.
- `files` needs to include a tuple with a filename equal to `str(temp_counter)` for `str(temp_counter)` to be in `files_set`.
- `examples` and `target` do not directly affect the loop condition.
- `temp_counter` should be less than or equal to `2 * n`.
- `i` and its updates do not affect the loop condition directly.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type and must include a tuple with a filename equal to `str(temp_counter)`, `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1' where each filename matches its expected numeric filename, `target` is equal to `len(examples) + i + 1`, `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, and `i` is as updated with `regulars`, `temp_counter - 1`, and `moves` accordingly**
