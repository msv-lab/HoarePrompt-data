To calculate the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the given information and the loop code.

1. **Loop Iterations**: The loop iterates over the `examples` list, which contains filenames of type '1'. The number of iterations is determined by the length of the `examples` list.

2. **Variables Updates**:
   - `i`: After all iterations, `i` will be equal to the last index of the `examples` list, which is `len(examples) - 1`.
   - `temp_counter`: This variable starts at `n + 1`. For each filename in `examples` that does not match its expected numeric filename (`str(i + 1)`), `temp_counter` is incremented until it finds a value that is not in `files_set` and is greater than its current value, but not exceeding `2 * n`. After finding such a value, it increments again. So, `temp_counter` ends up being the smallest integer greater than its initial value (`n + 1`) that exceeds `2 * n` or whose string representation is not in `files_set`, incremented by the number of times a filename in `examples` did not match its expected numeric filename.
   - `examples`: Each filename in `examples` that does not match its expected numeric filename is updated to the string representation of `temp_counter` before it was last incremented for that filename. If all filenames match their expected numeric filenames, no changes are made to `examples`.
   - `moves`: This list contains move commands for filenames in `examples` that did not match their expected numeric filenames. Each such filename generates two move commands: one to move the filename to the temporary filename (represented by `temp_counter`), and another to move it from the temporary filename to its expected numeric filename.
   - `files`, `regulars`, and `n`: These variables remain unchanged throughout the loop, as the loop does not update them.

**Output State**: Considering the updates of the variables, we can conclude the following:

- `n` remains an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5.
- `files` remains a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type.
- `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1', where each filename that did not initially match its expected numeric filename has been updated to its expected numeric filename.
- `regulars` remains a list of filenames not of type '1'.
- `temp_counter` ends up being the smallest integer greater than its initial value (`n + 1`) that exceeds `2 * n` or whose string representation is not in `files_set`, incremented by the number of times a filename in `examples` did not match its expected numeric filename.
- `moves` contains move commands for all filenames in `examples` that did not initially match their expected numeric filenames.
- `i` equals `len(examples) - 1`, indicating the loop has completed all iterations.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type, `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1' where each filename matches its expected numeric filename, `regulars` is a list of filenames not of type '1', `temp_counter` is greater than or equal to `n + 1` and has been incremented based on the updates of `examples`, `i` equals `len(examples) - 1`, and `moves` contains move commands for all filenames in `examples` that were updated.**
