The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `files`. `n` is an integer ranging from 1 to 10^5. `files` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a string (the filename) and an integer (the type). The filename is composed of digits and small English letters, with a length between 1 and 6 characters, and all filenames in the list are distinct. The integer type in each tuple is either 0 or 1. 

After executing the function body, the function returns `moves`, which contains move commands for all filenames in `regulars` that were updated to match their target numeric filenames. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` and a list of files `files`, and return the move commands for the updated filenames.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` and a list of files `files`, and returns the move commands for the updated filenames.**
