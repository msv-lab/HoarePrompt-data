According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on two conditions: 
1. `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`, 
2. `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`.

At the end of the last iteration, 
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, 
- `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type and must include a tuple with a filename equal to the string representation of `temp_counter - 1`, 
- `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1' where each filename matches its expected numeric filename, 
- `regulars` is a list of filenames not of type '1' that must have at least 1 filename, 
- `temp_counter` is greater than or equal to `n + 3` and less than or equal to `2 * n + 1`, 
- `i` is 0, and 
- `target` is `len(examples) + 1`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, 
- `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`, which means `temp_counter` can be at most `2 * n` and `n` does not need to be adjusted.
- `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`. Since `temp_counter` can increase by 1 for the next iteration, we need `str(temp_counter + 1)` (which is `str(temp_counter)` at the next iteration) to be in `files_set`. This implies that `files` must include a tuple with a filename equal to the string representation of `temp_counter`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type and must include a tuple with a filename equal to the string representation of `temp_counter`, `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1' where each filename matches its expected numeric filename, `regulars` is a list of filenames not of type '1' that must have at least 1 filename, `temp_counter` is greater than or equal to `n + 3` and less than or equal to `2 * n`, `i` is 0, and `target` is `len(examples) + 1**
