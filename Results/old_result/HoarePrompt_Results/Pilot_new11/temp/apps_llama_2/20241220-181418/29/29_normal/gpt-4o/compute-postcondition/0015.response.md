The given code line `name, type_ = file.split()` splits the `file` into two parts and assigns them to `name` and `type_`. The `split()` function splits a string into a list where each word is a list item, and by default, it separates the words by spaces.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples that must have at least 3 files, `file` is the third file in the `files` list, `name` is the first part of the third `file`, `type_` is the second part of the third `file`. If the second part of the third `file` is equal to '1', then `examples` is a list containing the first part of the third `file` at least twice and `regulars` is an empty list. If the second part of the third `file` is not equal to '1', then `examples` is an empty list and `regulars` is a list containing the first part of the third `file` at least twice.**
