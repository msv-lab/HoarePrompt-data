To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions of the `while` loop statement.

The loop will continue as long as two conditions are met:
1. `temp_counter <= 2 * n`
2. `str(temp_counter) in files_set`

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5
- `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type and must include a tuple with a filename equal to the string representation of `temp_counter - 1`
- `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1' where each filename matches its expected numeric filename
- `regulars` is a list of filenames not of type '1' that must have at least 1 filename
- `temp_counter` is greater than or equal to `n + 2`
- `i` is 0
- `target` is `len(examples) + 1`

For the loop to execute one more time:
- The value of `temp_counter` must be such that it is less than or equal to `2 * n`. Given that `temp_counter` is currently greater than or equal to `n + 2`, to ensure the loop can execute again, `temp_counter` should be less than or equal to `2 * n`. This implies that `n` should be large enough to accommodate this condition. Since `n` is already defined to be less than or equal to 10^5, we should ensure that `temp_counter` does not exceed `2 * n`.
- The string representation of `temp_counter` must be in `files_set`. Since `files` includes a tuple with a filename equal to the string representation of `temp_counter - 1`, for the next iteration, `files` should include a tuple with a filename equal to the string representation of `temp_counter`.

Considering these conditions, the states that need adjustments are:
- `temp_counter` should be such that it is less than or equal to `2 * n` to satisfy the first condition. Since `temp_counter` is greater than or equal to `n + 2`, we need to ensure that `n` is sufficiently large to keep `temp_counter` within the limit of `2 * n`.
- `files` should include a tuple with a filename equal to the string representation of `temp_counter` to ensure that `str(temp_counter) in files_set`.

Therefore, the adjusted state should reflect these considerations:
State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type and must include a tuple with a filename equal to the string representation of `temp_counter`, `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1' where each filename matches its expected numeric filename, `regulars` is a list of filenames not of type '1' that must have at least 1 filename, `temp_counter` is greater than or equal to `n + 2` and less than or equal to `2 * n`, `i` is 0, and `target` is `len(examples) + 1**
