The code `temp_counter += 1` increments the value of `temp_counter` by 1. Given the initial state, `temp_counter` is `n + 4`, so after the increment, `temp_counter` becomes `n + 4 + 1` which simplifies to `n + 5`.

The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, `n` remains an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is still a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type, `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1' with at least one filename, `regulars` is a list of filenames not of type '1', `moves` is a list, `i` is 0, the current value of `examples` at index `i` is not equal to the string representation of `i + 1`, and `str(n + 2)`, `str(n + 3)`, and `str(n + 4)` must be in `files_set`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type, `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1' that must have at least 1 filename, `regulars` is a list of filenames not of type '1', `moves` is a list, `temp_counter` is `n + 5`, `i` is 0, the current value of `examples` at index `i` is not equal to the string representation of `i + 1`, `str(n + 2)`, `str(n + 3)`, and `str(n + 4)` must be in `files_set`.**
