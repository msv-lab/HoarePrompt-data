The code initializes an empty list `moves`. The initial state variables `n`, `files`, `examples`, and `regulars` are not affected by this code. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type, `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1', `regulars` is a list of filenames not of type '1', `moves` is an empty list**
