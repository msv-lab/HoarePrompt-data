The `heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))` line adds a new tuple to the `heap` list. Given that `x` is 2 and `y` is 2, the new tuple will be `(-coverage(2, 2), 2, 2)`. The `heap` list initially had `m+2` tuples, so after adding this new tuple, it will have `m+3` tuples. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and greater than 2, `m` is a positive integer and greater than 2, `r` is a positive integer and less than or equal to the minimum of `n` and `m`, `k` is a positive integer and less than or equal to the minimum of the product of `n` and `m` and 10^5, `heap` is a list of `m+3` tuples, with `m` tuples of the form `(-coverage(1, y), 1, y)` where `y` ranges from 0 to `m-1`, a tuple `(-coverage(2, 0), 2, 0)`, an additional tuple `(-coverage(2, 1), 2, 1)`, and a new tuple `(-coverage(2, 2), 2, 2)`, `x` is 2, `y` is 2**
