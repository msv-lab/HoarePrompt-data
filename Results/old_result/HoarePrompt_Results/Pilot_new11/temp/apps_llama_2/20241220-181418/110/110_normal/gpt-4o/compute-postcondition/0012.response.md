According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y` and `m`. If `y` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is 0, `m` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute again, `y` must be increased by 1, so `y` is 1. The loop will execute again if `m` is greater than 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer and greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer and greater than 1, `r` is a positive integer and less than or equal to the minimum of `n` and `m`, `k` is a positive integer and less than or equal to the minimum of the product of `n` and `m` and 10^5, `heap` is a list of tuples including at least `(-coverage(1, 0), 1, 0)`, `x` is 1, `y` is 1**
