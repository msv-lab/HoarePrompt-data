Correctness: **False** 

The issue lies in the fact that there are undefined variables `n`, `m`, `r` in the function `coverage(x, y)`. This function is supposed to calculate the coverage for a given cell `(x, y)`, but it is trying to use the parameters `n`, `m`, `r` which are only defined in the function `func_1(n, m, r, k)`.

Here is an example where the program does not work: 
If you call `func_1(10, 10, 5, 50)`, the program will throw a `NameError` because `n`, `m`, `r` are not defined in the scope of `coverage(x, y)`.

Another issue is that the function `coverage(x, y)` does not correctly calculate the coverage of a cell. It seems to be trying to calculate the number of positions where the scoop-net can be placed such that the cell `(x, y)` is covered, but it does not do this correctly.

To fix this issue, we would need to redefine the `coverage(x, y)` function to correctly calculate the coverage of a cell, and also make sure that it has access to the parameters `n`, `m`, `r`. 

Here is a possible correct implementation:
```python
import heapq
import sys

def func_1(n, m, r, k):
    def coverage(x, y, n, m, r):
        return max(0, min(x + r, n) - x) * max(0, min(y + r, m) - y)

    heap = []
    for x in range(n):
        for y in range(m):
            heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y, n, m, r), x, y))
    total_coverage = 0
    for _ in range(k):
        (cov, x, y) = heapq.heappop(heap)
        total_coverage -= cov
    total_positions = (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)
    return total_coverage / total_positions

print(func_1(3, 3, 2, 3))
print(func_1(12, 17, 9, 40))
```
