Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program does not correctly calculate the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes. 

The program simply calculates the minimum between k (the number of fishes) and the number of possible sub-grids of size r x r in an n x m grid, then prints the ratio of this minimum value to the total number of possible sub-grids of size r x r. This does not accurately represent the problem description.

The problem asks to put k fishes in the pond into distinct cells in such a way that when the scoop-net is placed into a random position among (n - r + 1)Â·(m - r + 1) possible positions, the average number of caught fishes is as high as possible. 

However, the provided Python program does not consider the optimal placement of the fishes in the grid to maximize the expected number of caught fishes. 

A potential case where the program does not work correctly is when k is less than the number of possible sub-grids of size r x r. In this case, the program does not consider the optimal placement of the fishes to maximize the expected number of caught fishes. 

For example, if we have a 3x3 grid and a 2x2 scoop-net, and we want to put 3 fishes in the grid, the program simply returns 1.0, which is the ratio of the minimum between 3 and the number of possible sub-grids (4) to the total number of possible sub-grids. However, this does not accurately represent the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes, which can be achieved by placing the fishes in specific positions to maximize the overlap with the scoop-net.

This shows that the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, and therefore, the Correctness is **False**. 

Here is an alternate code to calculate the correct expected value of the number of caught fishes:

```python
def func():
    (n, m, r, k) = map(int, input().split())
    total_positions = (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)
    # For optimal placement, place k fishes in a way that each fish is in the same row/column as many other fishes as possible
    # So if k <= n or k <= m, place all fishes in the same row or column.
    if k <= n:
        fishes_per_row = 1
        rows_with_fishes = k
    else:
        fishes_per_row = m // (k // n + 1)
        rows_with_fishes = n

    # Calculate the number of times each fish will be caught
    if fishes_per_row == 1: # k <= n
        caught_count = m - r + 1
    elif k <= m:
        caught_count = n - r + 1
    else:
        caught_count = (m - r + 1) * (n - r + 1) / (n // rows_with_fishes) * (1 + 1 / (n // rows_with_fishes)) * fishes_per_row

    # The expected value is the total number of times each fish will be caught divided by the total number of positions
    expected_value = (k * caught_count) / total_positions
    print(expected_value)

func()
```
But even this solution might have its own edge cases where it won't work as expected. The best approach would be to try all possible configurations and calculate the expected value for each one.
