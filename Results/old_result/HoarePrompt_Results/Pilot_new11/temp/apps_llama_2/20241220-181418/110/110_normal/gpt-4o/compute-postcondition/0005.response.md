To calculate the output state, we first need to understand the impact of the given code on the program.

The code `heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))` pushes a new tuple onto the heap. The tuple contains the negative of the `coverage(x, y)` value and the coordinates `x` and `y`. 

Initially, `x` is 0 and `y` is 1. 

Given that `heap` initially contains the tuple `(-coverage(0, 0), 0, 0)`, after executing the code, `heap` will contain two tuples: `(-coverage(0, 0), 0, 0)` and `(-coverage(0, 1), 0, 1)`.

The values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k` are not affected by this operation, so their states remain the same.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer and greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer and greater than 1, `r` is a positive integer and less than or equal to the minimum of `n` and `m`, `k` is a positive integer and less than or equal to the minimum of the product of `n` and `m` and 10^5, `heap` is a list containing the tuples `(-coverage(0, 0), 0, 0)` and `(-coverage(0, 1), 0, 1)`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer and greater than 1, `r` is a positive integer and less than or equal to the minimum of `n` and `m`, `k` is a positive integer and less than or equal to the minimum of the product of `n` and `m` and 10^5, `heap` is a list containing the tuples `(-coverage(0, 0), 0, 0)` and `(-coverage(0, 1), 0, 1)`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1**
