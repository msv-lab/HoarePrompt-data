The function `func` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k`. `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^5, 1 <= r <= min(n, m), and 1 <= k <= min(n*m, 10^5). However, since the function definition provided is `def func():`, it does not explicitly accept any parameters. Therefore, it seems there might be an inconsistency in the problem description.

Given the likely intended function definition should be `def func(n, m, r, k):` based on the parameter constraints provided, we would describe the functionality as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, m, r, and k, where n, m, r, and k are integers within specified ranges, and returns a value based on these inputs, although the specific return value or behavior is not defined in the provided output description.**
