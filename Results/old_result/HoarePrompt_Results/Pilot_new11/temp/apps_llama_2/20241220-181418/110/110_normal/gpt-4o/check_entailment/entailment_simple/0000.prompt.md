You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: While Grisha was celebrating New Year with Ded Moroz, Misha gifted Sasha a small rectangular pond of size n × m, divided into cells of size 1 × 1, inhabited by tiny evil fishes (no more than one fish per cell, otherwise they'll strife!).

The gift bundle also includes a square scoop of size r × r, designed for fishing. If the lower-left corner of the scoop-net is located at cell (x, y), all fishes inside the square (x, y)...(x + r - 1, y + r - 1) get caught. Note that the scoop-net should lie completely inside the pond when used.

Unfortunately, Sasha is not that skilled in fishing and hence throws the scoop randomly. In order to not frustrate Sasha, Misha decided to release k fishes into the empty pond in such a way that the expected value of the number of caught fishes is as high as possible. Help Misha! In other words, put k fishes in the pond into distinct cells in such a way that when the scoop-net is placed into a random position among (n - r + 1)·(m - r + 1) possible positions, the average number of caught fishes is as high as possible.


-----Input-----

The only line contains four integers n, m, r, k (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m), 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n·m, 10^5)).


-----Output-----

Print a single number — the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes.

You answer is considered correct, is its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 9}. Namely, let your answer be a, and the jury's answer be b. Your answer is considered correct, if $\frac{|a - b|}{\operatorname{max}(1,|b|)} \leq 10^{-9}$.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3 2 3

Output
2.0000000000

Input
12 17 9 40

Output
32.8333333333



-----Note-----

In the first example you can put the fishes in cells (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3). In this case, for any of four possible positions of the scoop-net (highlighted with light green), the number of fishes inside is equal to two, and so is the expected value. [Image]
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import heapq
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
(n, m, r, k) = map(int, input().split())
print(f'{func_1(n, m, r, k):.10f}')

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers representing the dimensions of the rectangular pond, r is a positive integer representing the size of the square scoop and is less than or equal to the minimum of n and m, and k is a positive integer representing the number of fishes and is less than or equal to the minimum of the product of n and m and 10^5.
def func_1(n, m, r, k):
    heap = []
    for x in range(n):
        for y in range(m):
            heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` and `m` are the original positive integer dimensions of the rectangular pond, `r` is the original positive integer less than or equal to the minimum of `n` and `m`, `k` is the original positive integer less than or equal to the minimum of the product of `n` and `m` and 10^5, and `heap` is a list of `n*m` tuples of the form `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for all positions `(x, y)` in the pond.
    total_coverage = 0
    for _ in range(k):
        cov, x, y = heapq.heappop(heap)
        
        total_coverage -= cov
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the given information step by step.
    #
    #1. **Initial State**: 
    #   - `n` and `m` are the original positive integer dimensions of the rectangular pond.
    #   - `r` is the original positive integer less than or equal to the minimum of `n` and `m`.
    #   - `k` is the original positive integer less than or equal to the minimum of the product of `n` and `m` and 10^5.
    #   - `heap` is a list of `n*m` tuples of the form `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for all positions `(x, y)` in the pond.
    #   - `total_coverage` is 0.
    #
    #2. **Loop Code**:
    #   - The loop runs `k` times.
    #   - In each iteration, it pops the tuple with the highest coverage (due to the `-coverage(x, y)` in the tuple, the highest coverage becomes the smallest value and thus gets popped first from the heap) from the `heap`, and subtracts its coverage value from `total_coverage`.
    #
    #3. **Analysis of Loop Executions**:
    #   - After the loop executes once, `heap` has one less element, and `total_coverage` has increased by the value of the highest coverage.
    #   - This pattern continues for each execution of the loop, with `heap` losing one element and `total_coverage` increasing by the next highest coverage value each time.
    #   - The loop will execute `k` times if `k` is less than or equal to `n*m` and if `heap` initially contains at least `k` elements.
    #
    #4. **Output State After All Iterations**:
    #   - Since the loop runs `k` times, after all iterations, `heap` will have `n*m - k` elements left.
    #   - `total_coverage` will be the sum of the `k` highest coverage values (because in each iteration, we subtract the negated highest coverage value, effectively adding it to `total_coverage`).
    #   - `k` must be less than or equal to the minimum of `n*m` and 10^5 for the loop to execute `k` times.
    #   - If `k` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `total_coverage` remains 0, `heap` remains unchanged with `n*m` elements.
    #
    #5. **Variables Not Changing**:
    #   - `n`, `m`, and `r` do not change during the loop as their values are not modified within the loop.
    #
    #**Output State**: **`n` and `m` are the original positive integer dimensions of the rectangular pond, `r` is the original positive integer less than or equal to the minimum of `n` and `m`, `k` is the original positive integer less than or equal to the minimum of the product of `n` and `m` and 10^5, `heap` is a list with `n*m - k` tuples if `k` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `n*m`, otherwise `heap` remains a list of `n*m` tuples, and `total_coverage` is the sum of the `k` highest coverage values if `k` is greater than 0, otherwise `total_coverage` is 0.**
    total_positions = (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)
    return total_coverage / total_positions
    #The program returns the average coverage per position, which is the sum of the k highest coverage values divided by the total number of positions (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1) in the rectangular pond, where k is the number of highest coverage values considered, limited by the minimum of the pond's area and 10^5.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x < n and 0 <= y < m, and n, m, and r are non-negative integers where 1 <= n, m <= 10^5 and 1 <= r <= min(n, m).
def coverage(x, y):
    return (min(x + 1, n - r + 1) - max(x - r + 1 + 1, 0)) * (min(y + 1, m - r +
    1) - max(y - r + 1 + 1, 0))
    #The program returns a non-negative integer value that is the product of two calculated "window" sizes related to x, y, n, m, and r, where x and y are non-negative integers less than n and m respectively, and r is a non-negative integer less than or equal to the minimum of n and m.


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
