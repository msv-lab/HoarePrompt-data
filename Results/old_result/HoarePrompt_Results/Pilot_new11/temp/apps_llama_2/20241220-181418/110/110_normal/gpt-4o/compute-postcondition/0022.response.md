According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y` and `m`. If `y` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is 1 and `m` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute again, `y` must be increased by 1, so `y` is 2. 
State: **`n` is a positive integer and greater than 2, `m` is a positive integer, `r` is a positive integer and less than or equal to the minimum of `n` and `m`, `k` is a positive integer and less than or equal to the minimum of the product of `n` and `m` and 10^5, `heap` is a list of `m+2` tuples, with `m` tuples of the form `(-coverage(1, y), 1, y)` where `y` ranges from 0 to `m-1`, a tuple `(-coverage(2, 0), 2, 0)`, and an additional tuple `(-coverage(2, 1), 2, 1)`, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `m` must be greater than 2**
