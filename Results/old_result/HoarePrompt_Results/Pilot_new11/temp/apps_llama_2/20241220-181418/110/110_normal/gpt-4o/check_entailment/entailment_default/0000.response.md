Correctness: **True**

The code seems to correctly solve the problem described. It calculates the expected number of caught fishes by placing k fishes in the cells of the pond that have the highest coverage, which is the number of possible positions of the scoop-net that cover each cell.

The function `coverage(x, y)` correctly calculates the coverage of each cell at position `(x, y)` by taking into account the size of the scoop-net and the boundaries of the pond.

The function `func_1(n, m, r, k)` uses a heap to efficiently select the k cells with the highest coverage and then calculates the expected number of caught fishes by summing up the coverage of these cells and dividing by the total number of possible positions of the scoop-net.

The code handles the edge cases correctly, such as when k is 0 or when k is greater than the number of cells in the pond.

The examples provided also suggest that the code works correctly. For example, when the input is `3 3 2 3`, the output is `2.0000000000`, which is the expected result if the fishes are placed in the cells `(2, 1)`, `(2, 2)`, and `(2, 3)`, and the scoop-net is placed in any of the four possible positions.

Similarly, when the input is `12 17 9 40`, the output is `32.8333333333`, which is also the expected result if the fishes are placed in the cells with the highest coverage.

Overall, based on the code and the examples provided, it seems that the program correctly solves the problem described and handles all possible cases correctly.
