The given code `total_coverage -= cov` decreases the value of `total_coverage` by the value of `cov`. Since `cov` is the negated highest coverage value, subtracting `cov` from `total_coverage` is equivalent to adding the highest coverage value to `total_coverage`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are the original positive integer dimensions of the rectangular pond, `r` is the original positive integer less than or equal to the minimum of `n` and `m`, `k` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to the minimum of the product of `n` and `m` and 10^5, `heap` is a list of `n*m - 1` tuples, `total_coverage` is `total_coverage + highest coverage value` (which equals to the original `total_coverage` minus the negated highest coverage value), `cov` is the negated highest coverage value, and `x` and `y` are the coordinates of the position with the highest coverage.**
