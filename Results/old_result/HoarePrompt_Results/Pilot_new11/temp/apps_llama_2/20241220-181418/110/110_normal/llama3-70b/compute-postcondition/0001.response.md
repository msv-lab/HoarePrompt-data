`ans` is assigned the value of the minimum between `k` and the product of `(n - r + 1)` and `(m - r + 1)`. The values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k` are not changed. 

Output State: **`n` is input integer 1, `m` is input integer 2, `r` is input integer 3, `k` is input integer 4, `ans` is the minimum of `k` and `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`**
