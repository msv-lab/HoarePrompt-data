Correctness: **True**

The provided program follows the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Optimizing Fish Placement**: The problem asks to release `k` fishes in the pond to maximize the expected value of caught fishes when a scoop-net of size `r` is placed randomly. The program uses a greedy approach by prioritizing positions with the highest coverage.
2. **Coverage Calculation**: The `coverage(x, y)` function calculates the number of positions where a scoop-net can be placed with the cell `(x, y)` inside it. This is done by calculating the number of possible positions in the `x` and `y` directions where the scoop-net can be placed.
3. **Priority Queue**: The program uses a heap to store positions along with their coverage values. The heap is ordered based on the coverage values in descending order, ensuring that positions with the highest coverage are considered first.
4. **Fishing Simulation**: The program simulates the fishing process by removing the top `k` positions from the heap, which correspond to the highest coverage values. The total coverage of these positions is then calculated.
5. **Expected Value Calculation**: Finally, the program calculates the expected value of caught fishes by dividing the total coverage of the selected positions by the total number of possible positions where the scoop-net can be placed.

The program correctly implements the problem description, as it:

* Calculates the coverage of each position in the pond using the `coverage(x, y)` function.
* Prioritizes positions based on their coverage values using a heap.
* Simulates the fishing process by selecting the top `k` positions with the highest coverage values.
* Calculates the expected value of caught fishes by dividing the total coverage of the selected positions by the total number of possible positions.

The program's output, which is the expected value of caught fishes, is calculated correctly based on the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
