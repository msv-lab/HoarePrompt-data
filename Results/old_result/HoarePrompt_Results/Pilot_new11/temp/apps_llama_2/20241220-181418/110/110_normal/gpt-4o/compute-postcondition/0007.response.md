To determine the output state, let's break down the given code and initial state.

The code snippet is:
```python
heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))
```

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer and greater than 0,
- `m` is a positive integer and greater than 2,
- `r` is a positive integer and less than or equal to the minimum of `n` and `m`,
- `k` is a positive integer and less than or equal to the minimum of the product of `n` and `m` and 10^5,
- `heap` is a list containing the tuples `(-coverage(0, 0), 0, 0)` and `(-coverage(0, 1), 0, 1)`,
- `x` is 0,
- `y` is 2.

The `heapq.heappush` function pushes the item onto the heap, maintaining the heap invariant. The item being pushed is a tuple: `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)`. Given that `x` is 0 and `y` is 2, the tuple becomes `(-coverage(0, 2), 0, 2)`.

The function `coverage(x, y)` is not defined in the problem statement, so we'll leave it as is, understanding that its value will depend on the definition of `coverage(x, y)`.

The initial `heap` contains:
- `(-coverage(0, 0), 0, 0)`
- `(-coverage(0, 1), 0, 1)`

After pushing `(-coverage(0, 2), 0, 2)` onto the heap, the heap will contain:
- `(-coverage(0, 0), 0, 0)`
- `(-coverage(0, 1), 0, 1)`
- `(-coverage(0, 2), 0, 2)`

The values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k` are not changed by this operation, and `x` and `y` are used but not modified by the push operation.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is a positive integer and greater than 0,
- `m` is a positive integer and greater than 2,
- `r` is a positive integer and less than or equal to the minimum of `n` and `m`,
- `k` is a positive integer and less than or equal to the minimum of the product of `n` and `m` and 10^5,
- `heap` is a list containing the tuples `(-coverage(0, 0), 0, 0)`, `(-coverage(0, 1), 0, 1)`, and `(-coverage(0, 2), 0, 2)`,
- `x` is 0,
- `y` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer and greater than 2, `r` is a positive integer and less than or equal to the minimum of `n` and `m`, `k` is a positive integer and less than or equal to the minimum of the product of `n` and `m` and 10^5, `heap` is a list containing the tuples `(-coverage(0, 0), 0, 0)`, `(-coverage(0, 1), 0, 1)`, and `(-coverage(0, 2), 0, 2)`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2**
