The values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k` are updated based on the input. The `input().split()` function splits the input string into a list of strings separated by spaces, and `map(int,...)` converts each string in the list to an integer. 

Since the initial state constraints are still valid after the code execution (1 <= n, m <= 10^5, 1 <= r <= min(n, m), and 1 <= k <= min(n*m, 10^5)), we just need to update the values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k` to the input integers.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r`, and `k` are integers such that `n` = input integer 1, `m` = input integer 2, `r` = input integer 3, `k` = input integer 4, where 1 <= `n`, `m` <= 10^5 is not checked, 1 <= `r` <= min(`n`, `m`) is not checked, and 1 <= `k` <= min(`n`*`m`, 10^5) is not checked due to the new assignment.**
