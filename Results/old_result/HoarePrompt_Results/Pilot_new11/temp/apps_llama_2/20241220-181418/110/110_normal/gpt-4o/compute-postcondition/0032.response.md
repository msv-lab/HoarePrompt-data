The value of `total_coverage` is decreased by `cov`, which is the coverage of the popped element. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are the original positive integer dimensions of the rectangular pond, `r` is the original positive integer less than or equal to the minimum of `n` and `m`, `k` is greater than 1 and less than or equal to the minimum of the product of `n` and `m` and 10^5, `heap` is a list with one less element, `cov` is the coverage of the popped element, `x` and `y` are the coordinates of the popped element, and `total_coverage` is `total_coverage - cov`.
