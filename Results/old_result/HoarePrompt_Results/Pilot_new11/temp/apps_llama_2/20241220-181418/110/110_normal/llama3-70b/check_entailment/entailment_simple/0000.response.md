Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. The problem is asking to calculate the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes when the scoop-net is placed into a random position among `(n - r + 1)Â·(m - r + 1)` possible positions. 

However, the provided program simply calculates `min(k, (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)) / ((n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1))`. This does not accurately represent the expected value of caught fishes.

The expected value of caught fishes can be calculated by distributing `k` fishes in a way that maximizes the number of fishes caught per scoop-net placement. The correct approach would involve distributing the fishes in a uniform manner across the entire area where the scoop-net can be placed, such that the probability of catching a fish is maximized. 

One way to do this is by distributing the `k` fishes as uniformly as possible across the entire pond, so that each possible placement of the scoop-net has the highest possible number of fishes. 

For example, in the case where `n = 3`, `m = 3`, `r = 2`, and `k = 3`, placing the fishes in cells `(2, 1)`, `(2, 2)`, and `(2, 3)` results in an expected value of 2 caught fishes for any placement of the scoop-net. 

However, the provided program does not account for this distribution and instead provides a simplistic calculation that does not accurately represent the problem's requirements.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to consider how to distribute `k` fishes in the pond such that the expected value of caught fishes is maximized when the scoop-net is placed randomly. 

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n, m, r, k = map(int, input().split())
    positions = (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)
    ans = (k * r * r) / positions
    print(ans)
```
