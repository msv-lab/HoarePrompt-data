The code `t, dir = input().split()` assigns the split input values to `t` and `dir`. 

Given that `t` is the integer equivalent of the first part of the input string, we now have `t` as the first part of the input string and `dir` as the second part of the input string.

The previous values of `n` and the other variables are not affected by this code. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `n-1` pairs of values exist, `t` is the first part of the input string, `dir` is the second part of the input string.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `n-1` pairs of values exist, `t` is the first part of the input string, `dir` is the second part of the input string**
