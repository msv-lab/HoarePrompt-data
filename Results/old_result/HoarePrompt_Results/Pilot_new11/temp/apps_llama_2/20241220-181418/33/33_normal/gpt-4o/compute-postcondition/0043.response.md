Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `n-1` pairs of values exist, `t` is the integer conversion of the first part of the input string, `dir` is the second part of the input string. If `position` is less than 0 or greater than 20000, then `valid` is `False`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, but is subject to the conditions that if `dir` is 'North', then `position` is `position - t`, and if `position - t` is less than 0, then `valid` is `False`. If `dir` is 'South', then `position` is `position + t`, and if the new `position` is greater than 20000, then `valid` is `False`. If `dir` is either 'West' or 'East', then if `position` is 0 or 20000, `valid` is `False`. If `dir` is neither 'North', 'South', 'West', nor 'East', then the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
