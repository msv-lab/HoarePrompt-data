You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function has access to the input data, which is an integer n representing the number of parts in the journey and n pairs of values, where each pair consists of a non-negative integer t_i representing the distance to be traveled and a string dir_i representing the direction, which can be "North", "South", "West", or "East".
def func():
    n = int(input())
    position = 0
    valid = True
    for _ in range(n):
        t, dir = input().split()
        
        t = int(t)
        
        if dir == 'North':
            if position - t < 0:
                valid = False
            position -= t
        elif dir == 'South':
            if position + t > 20000:
                valid = False
            position += t
        elif dir in ('West', 'East'):
            if position == 0 or position == 20000:
                valid = False
        
        if position < 0 or position > 20000:
            valid = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `t` and `dir` are the last input values if the loop executed, `position` is between -n*max(t) and 20000 + n*max(t) if all movements were valid and did not exceed boundaries or is 0 if the loop did not execute, and `valid` is False if any movement or condition made it so, otherwise True.
    if (position != 0) :
        valid = False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `t` and `dir` are the last input values if the loop executed, `position` is between -n*max(t) and 20000 + n*max(t) if all movements were valid and did not exceed boundaries or is 0 if the loop did not execute. If `position` is not 0, then `valid` is `False`. If `position` is 0, the state of `valid` remains unchanged as there is no else part to alter it.
    if valid :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `t` and `dir` are the last input values if the loop executed, `position` is between -n*max(t) and 20000 + n*max(t) if all movements were valid and did not exceed boundaries or is 0 if the loop did not execute. If `position` is not 0, then `valid` is `False`. If `position` is 0, then 'YES' has been printed to the console and `valid` is `True`, otherwise 'NO' has been printed to the console and `valid` remains `False`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function calculates and returns the outcome of a journey based on the provided distances and directions, which could include the final position, the total distance traveled in each direction, or another relevant metric.

Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
