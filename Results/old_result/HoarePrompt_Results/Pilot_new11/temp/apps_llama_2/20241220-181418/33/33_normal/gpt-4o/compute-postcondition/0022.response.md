Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `t` is the integer equivalent of the first part of the input string, `dir` is not 'North' and not 'South'. If `dir` is either 'West' or 'East', then if `position` is 0 or 20000, `valid` is False, otherwise `valid` remains True and the values of `n`, `t`, `dir`, and `position` are unchanged. If `dir` is neither 'West' nor 'East', then the state of the program remains unchanged as there is no else part to handle this case.***
