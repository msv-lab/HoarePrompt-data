Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Condition 1: If Limak is at the North Pole, he can only move to the South.**
   - The program checks for this condition with the line `if curr_lat == 90 and dir!= 'South':`. If Limak is at the North Pole (`curr_lat == 90`) and the direction is not 'South', the program prints 'NO' and exits.

2. **Condition 2: If Limak is at the South Pole, he can only move to the North.**
   - The program checks for this condition with the line `if curr_lat == -90 and dir!= 'North':`. If Limak is at the South Pole (`curr_lat == -90`) and the direction is not 'North', the program prints 'NO' and exits.

3. **Condition 3: The journey must end on the North Pole.**
   - The program checks for this condition with the line `print('YES' if curr_lat == 90 else 'NO')`. After all movements have been processed, if Limak is back at the North Pole (`curr_lat == 90`), the program prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.

4. **Validity of Movements:**
   - The program processes each movement by updating `curr_lat` based on the direction and distance. It then checks if `curr_lat` is within the valid range of -90 to 90 degrees. If `curr_lat` goes outside this range, the program prints 'NO' and exits, indicating an invalid movement.

5. **Input and Loop Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of movements `n`, and then processes each movement in a loop. For each movement, it reads the distance `t` and direction `dir`, updates `curr_lat` accordingly, and checks the conditions.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description for all potential cases, assuming valid input as stated in the problem description.
