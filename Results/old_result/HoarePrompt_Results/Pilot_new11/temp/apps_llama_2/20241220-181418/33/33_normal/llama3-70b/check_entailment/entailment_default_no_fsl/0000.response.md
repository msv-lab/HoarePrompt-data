Correctness: **True**

The provided code accurately implements the problem description and handles every potential case. Here's a breakdown of why the code is correct:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**: The code correctly initializes the current latitude to 90 degrees, representing the North Pole. It also properly handles the input for each part of the journey, parsing the time and direction from the user's input.

2. **Latitude Update Based on Direction**: The code updates the current latitude based on the direction of movement. For movements towards the North or South, it correctly adjusts the latitude by the distance traveled divided by 111.195 kilometers per degree of latitude. It ignores East and West movements as per the problem statement, since these do not affect the latitude.

3. **Validation of Movements at Poles**: The code correctly enforces the rule that from the North Pole, Limak can only move South, and from the South Pole, he can only move North. It checks for these conditions after each movement and exits the program with a 'NO' output if these rules are violated.

4. **Validation of Final Position**: At the end of the journey, the code checks if the final latitude is 90 degrees, indicating that Limak has returned to the North Pole. If not, it outputs 'NO'; otherwise, it outputs 'YES'.

5. **Handling Edge Cases**: The code implicitly handles edge cases such as journeys with zero parts or movements with invalid directions by the nature of its implementation. For example, if the input for a part of the journey includes an invalid direction, the direction check will fail, but this is not considered an invalid case under the assumption that the input will always be valid as per the problem description.

6. **Examples and Test Cases**: The code correctly handles the provided examples and test cases. For instance, the first example results in 'YES' because Limak ends up back at the North Pole after the journey, while the second example results in 'NO' because Limak does not end up back at the North Pole.

In conclusion, the code accurately implements the problem description and handles all the potential cases as outlined in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
