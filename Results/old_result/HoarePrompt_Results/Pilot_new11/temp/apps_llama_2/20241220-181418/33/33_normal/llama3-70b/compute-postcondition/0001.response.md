The code assigns the value 90 to the variable `curr_lat`. The initial state variables `n`, `t_{i}`, and `dir_{i}` are not affected by this assignment. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, for each i-th part of the journey, `t_{i}` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t_{i}` ≤ 10^6), and `dir_{i}` is one of the strings: "North", "South", "West", "East", `curr_lat` is 90**
