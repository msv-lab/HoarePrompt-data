Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `t_{i}` is a positive integer, `dir_{i}` is one of the strings: "North", "South", "West", "East", `t` is an integer, `dir` is an input direction string. If `curr_lat` is within the range -90 to 90, the program continues. If `curr_lat` is less than -90 or greater than 90, 'NO' has been printed, the program has been terminated, and the current value of `curr_lat` is either less than -90 or greater than 90. Specifically, if `dir` is 'North', then `curr_lat` is `90 + t / 111.195`, if `dir` is 'South', then `curr_lat` is `-90 - t / 111.195`, otherwise `curr_lat` is -90. If `curr_lat` is -90 and `dir` is not 'North', the program has exited. Otherwise, the program state remains unchanged. The current value of `curr_lat` is 90 and the current value of `dir` is not 'South'.**
