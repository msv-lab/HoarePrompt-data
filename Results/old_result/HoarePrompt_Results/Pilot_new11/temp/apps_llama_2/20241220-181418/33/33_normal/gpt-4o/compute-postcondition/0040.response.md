Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `n-1` pairs of values exist, `t` is the integer conversion of the first part of the input string, `dir` is the second part of the input string. If `dir` is 'South', then `position` is `position + t`, and if the new `position` is greater than 20000, then `valid` is `False`. If `dir` is not 'South' and is either 'West' or 'East', then if `position` is 0 or 20000, `valid` is `False`. If `dir` is neither 'South', 'West', nor 'East', then the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
