The given code snippet is subtracting `t / 111.195` from `curr_lat`. The value of `t` is an input integer and `curr_lat` is not defined in the initial state. However, based on the context, it seems that `curr_lat` is a latitude value.

The states of the other variables are not affected. The value of `n` is still a positive integer greater than 1, `t_{i}` is still a positive integer, `dir_{i}` is still one of the strings: "North", "South", "West", "East", `t` is still an input integer, `dir` is still an input string representing a direction.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `t_{i}` is a positive integer, `dir_{i}` is one of the strings: "North", "South", "West", "East", `t` is an input integer, `dir` is an input string representing a direction, `curr_lat` is decreased by `t / 111.195`**
