To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step.

The initial state provides information about several variables:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `t` is an integer if `n` is positive.
- `dir` is a direction string if `n` is positive.
- `curr_lat` is either within the range [-90, 90] adjusted by the sum of all "North" and "South" movements divided by 111.195, or it is outside this range if the program terminated, indicating an invalid movement.

The given code is:
```python
print('YES' if curr_lat == 90 else 'NO')
```
This code prints 'YES' if `curr_lat` is exactly 90; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The print statement does not alter the values of any variables but provides output based on the value of `curr_lat`.

Considering the initial state and the impact of the code:
- `n` remains a non-negative integer.
- If `n` is positive, `t` remains an integer, and `dir` remains a direction string.
- `curr_lat` remains either within the range [-90, 90] adjusted by movements or outside this range, but its value does not change due to the print statement.

The output of the print statement (either 'YES' or 'NO') depends on whether `curr_lat` is exactly 90. Since `curr_lat` can be within the range [-90, 90] or outside it, the specific condition of `curr_lat` being exactly 90 can be met only if `curr_lat` is within this range, specifically at the upper boundary.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- If `n` is positive, `t` is an integer, and `dir` is a direction string.
- `curr_lat` is either within the range [-90, 90] adjusted by the sum of all "North" and "South" movements divided by 111.195, or it is outside this range.
- A value ('YES' or 'NO') has been printed based on whether `curr_lat` equals 90.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, if `n` is positive then `t` is an integer and `dir` is a direction string, `curr_lat` is either within the range [-90, 90] adjusted by movements or outside this range, and a value ('YES' if `curr_lat` == 90, 'NO' otherwise) has been printed.**
