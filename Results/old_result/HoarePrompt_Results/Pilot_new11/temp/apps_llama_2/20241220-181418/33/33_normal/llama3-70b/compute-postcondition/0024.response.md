The code `exit()` terminates the program. The values of the variables do not change but the program stops execution. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `t_{i}` is a positive integer, `dir_{i}` is one of the strings: "North", "South", "West", "East", `t` is an integer, `dir` is not 'South', `curr_lat` is 90, the program has printed 'NO' and has terminated, and the program execution is stopped.
