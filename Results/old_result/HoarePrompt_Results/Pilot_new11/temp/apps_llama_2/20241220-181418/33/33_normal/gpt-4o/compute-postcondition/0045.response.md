The input is split into two parts: `t` and `dir`. The `split()` function splits the input string into a list of words, and since we have two variables on the left side of the assignment operator, the first part of the input string is assigned to `t` and the second part is assigned to `dir`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `n` pairs of values must exist for the loop to execute one more time, `t` is the integer conversion of the first part of the input string, `dir` is the second part of the input string, and the state of `position` and `valid` depend on the conditions related to `dir` and `t` as specified**
