Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `t_{i}` is a positive integer, `dir_{i}` is one of the strings: "North", "South", "West", "East", `t` is an integer, `dir` is an input direction string. The current value of `curr_lat` is either less than -90 or greater than 90. Specifically, if `dir` is 'North', then the current value of `curr_lat` is `90 + t / 111.195`, if `dir` is 'South', then the current value of `curr_lat` is `90 - t / 111.195`, otherwise the current value of `curr_lat` is 90. `curr_lat` is -90 and the current value of `dir` is not 'North'.**
