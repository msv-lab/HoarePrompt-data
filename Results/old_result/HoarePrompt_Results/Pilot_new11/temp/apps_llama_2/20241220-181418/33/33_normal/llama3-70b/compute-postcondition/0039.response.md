Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `t_{i}` is a positive integer, `dir_{i}` is one of the strings: "North", "South", "West", "East", `t` is an integer, `dir` is a string representing a direction. If `curr_lat` is -90 and `dir` is not 'North', the program has terminated and `curr_lat` is either less than -90 or greater than 90. Otherwise, the execution continues with the updated or unchanged variables.***
