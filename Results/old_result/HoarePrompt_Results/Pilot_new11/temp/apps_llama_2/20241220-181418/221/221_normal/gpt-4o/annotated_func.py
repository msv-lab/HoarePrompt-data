#State of the program right berfore the function call: s and x are integers such that 2 <= s <= 10^12 and 0 <= x <= 10^12.
def func():
    a = b ^ x
    b = a ^ x
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters. It performs bitwise XOR operations between variables 'a' and 'b' with variable 'x', which is assumed to be an integer available in the scope of the function. However, since 'b' and 'x' are used before being initialized within the provided function scope, the functionality is undefined due to potential NameError exceptions for 'b' and 'x'. The final state of the program after it concludes would be an error state because the variables 'b' and 'x' are referenced before assignment. The function does not return any value.
