Correctness: **False**.

The provided code does not meet the problem description. The task is to find the number of possible ordered pairs (a, b) where a and b are positive integers with a sum of s and a bitwise XOR of x. However, the provided code is incomplete and does not perform the necessary calculations to solve the problem.

A correct approach would be to iterate over all possible values of a and check if the corresponding b satisfies the conditions. The correct program would be:

```python
def func(s, x):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, s):
        b = s - a
        if a ^ b == x:
            count += 1
    return count
```

This program works by iterating over all possible values of a, calculating the corresponding b as s - a, and checking if the bitwise XOR of a and b is equal to x. If it is, the count is incremented. The function returns the total count of such ordered pairs.

The original code does not perform these calculations, and therefore, does not meet the problem description. For example, when the input is s = 9 and x = 5, the original code does not return the correct answer, which is 4, as calculated by the correct program.
