You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Two positive integers a and b have a sum of s and a bitwise XOR of x. How many possible values are there for the ordered pair (a, b)?


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers s and x (2 ≤ s ≤ 10^12, 0 ≤ x ≤ 10^12), the sum and bitwise xor of the pair of positive integers, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer, the number of solutions to the given conditions. If no solutions exist, print 0.


-----Examples-----
Input
9 5

Output
4

Input
3 3

Output
2

Input
5 2

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first sample, we have the following solutions: (2, 7), (3, 6), (6, 3), (7, 2).

In the second sample, the only solutions are (1, 2) and (2, 1).
Program:
```
def func():
    a = b ^ x
    b = a ^ x


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The provided code does not meet the problem description. The task is to find the number of possible ordered pairs (a, b) where a and b are positive integers with a sum of s and a bitwise XOR of x. However, the provided code is incomplete and does not perform the necessary calculations to solve the problem.

A correct approach would be to iterate over all possible values of a and check if the corresponding b satisfies the conditions. The correct program would be:

```python
def func(s, x):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, s):
        b = s - a
        if a ^ b == x:
            count += 1
    return count
```

This program works by iterating over all possible values of a, calculating the corresponding b as s - a, and checking if the bitwise XOR of a and b is equal to x. If it is, the count is incremented. The function returns the total count of such ordered pairs.

The original code does not perform these calculations, and therefore, does not meet the problem description. For example, when the input is s = 9 and x = 5, the original code does not return the correct answer, which is 4, as calculated by the correct program.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function does not accept any parameters. It performs bitwise XOR operations between variables 'a' and 'b' with variable 'x', which is assumed to be an integer available in the scope of the function. However, since 'b' and 'x' are used before being initialized within the provided function scope, the functionality is undefined due to potential NameError exceptions for 'b' and 'x'. The final state of the program after it concludes would be an error state because the variables 'b' and 'x' are referenced before assignment. The function does not return any value.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
