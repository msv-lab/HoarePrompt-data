It seems like there's a misunderstanding. The function provided is `def func():`, which doesn't accept any parameters. However, the parameter constraints mention `s` and `x` as integers with specific ranges. 

Based on the parameter constraints provided, I will assume that the function should be `def func(s, x):` to accept the parameters `s` and `x`. 

The function `func` accepts two parameters, `s` and `x`, where `s` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `s` ≤ 10^12 and `x` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^12.

Unfortunately, the output cases are not provided, so I will not be able to describe the return value of the function. 

If the output cases were provided, I would describe the functionality in the following format: 
Functionality: **The function accepts parameters s and x, and based on the given output cases, it returns a specific value.** 

However, since the output cases are missing, I will provide a general description of the functionality based on the given parameter constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters s and x, where s is an integer between 2 and 10^12 (inclusive), and x is an integer between 0 and 10^12 (inclusive).**
