You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Famous Brazil city Rio de Janeiro holds a tennis tournament and Ostap Bender doesn't want to miss this event. There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.

Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.

Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.


-----Examples-----
Input
2

Output
1

Input
3

Output
2

Input
4

Output
2

Input
10

Output
4



-----Note-----

In all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.

In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.

In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. 

In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    max_games = n.bit_length() - 1
    print(max_games)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given program seems to correctly calculate the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in. The key to this problem is understanding the condition that the difference in the number of games played by two players cannot exceed 1 for them to compete against each other. This condition implies a particular structure to the tournament tree that can maximize the number of games a single player (the winner) can participate in.

The given code works by utilizing the properties of binary representation of numbers. The `bit_length()` function in Python returns the number of bits necessary to represent an integer in binary, excluding the sign and leading zeros. By calculating `n.bit_length() - 1`, the code is essentially finding the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `n`, which corresponds to the maximum depth of a binary tree that can be formed. This depth represents the maximum number of games a single player can win before the tournament ends, given the constraints.

The reason this approach works is that the number of players participating in each round of the tournament follows a pattern that can be represented as powers of 2. In an ideal scenario where `n` is a power of 2, the tournament can proceed with each player playing exactly one game per round, until only one remains. When `n` is not a power of 2, the tournament structure still tries to maximize the participation of the winner by adhering to the given rules, effectively creating a binary tree where the winner is the root and plays in each round.

The program does not explicitly construct this binary tree but leverages the mathematical properties of binary representation to directly compute the maximum number of games the winner can participate in, making it an efficient and correct solution for all cases of `n`. The provided examples in the problem description align with this logic, and without finding any counterexamples or edge cases that the program fails to handle, it can be concluded that the program works as expected.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input is a single integer n, such that n is greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 10^18, representing the number of players to participate in the tournament.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    max_games = n.bit_length() - 1
    print(max_games)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer input from the user, representing the number of players in a tournament, and returns the maximum number of games required to determine the winner, which is calculated as the bit length of the input number minus 1. The function assumes the input is a single integer n, such that n is greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 10^18. After execution, the program prints the calculated maximum number of games to the console, effectively providing the minimum number of rounds needed to complete the tournament, given the number of participants. The function does not handle cases where the input is not an integer or is outside the specified range, which could lead to potential errors or unexpected behavior.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
