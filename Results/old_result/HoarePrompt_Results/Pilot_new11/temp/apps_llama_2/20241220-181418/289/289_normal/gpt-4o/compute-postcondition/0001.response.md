To calculate the output state, we first need to understand what `n.bit_length()` does. This function returns the number of bits necessary to represent `n` in binary, excluding the sign and leading zeros.

Given that `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 10^18, we know that `n` is a positive integer.

The code `max_games = n.bit_length() - 1` assigns the value of `n.bit_length() - 1` to `max_games`. 

Since `n` can range from 2 to 10^18, `n.bit_length()` will range from 2 (for `n = 2`) to 61 (for `n = 2^60` or slightly above, up to 10^18 which is less than 2^61 but more than 2^60), because the maximum value that can be represented by 61 bits is 2^61 - 1, which is more than sufficient to cover 10^18.

However, since we subtract 1 from `n.bit_length()`, `max_games` will range from 1 to 60.

The value of `n` remains unchanged as it was only used to calculate `max_games`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 10^18, `max_games` is an integer ranging from 1 to 60, specifically equal to `n.bit_length() - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 10^18, `max_games` is equal to `n.bit_length() - 1`.**
