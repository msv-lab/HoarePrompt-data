Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `operations` is a string of length `n` with characters 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `final_x` is the difference between the counts of 'R' and 'L' in `operations`, `final_y` is the difference between the counts of 'U' and 'D' in `operations`, `dx` is `x - final_x`, `dy` is `y - final_y`, `i` is 2. If `operations[i]` is 'U', then `current_y` is increased by 1. If `operations[i]` is 'D', then `current_y` is decreased by 1. If `operations[i]` is 'L', then `current_x` is decreased by 1. If `operations[i]` is 'R', then `current_x` is increased by 1. `target_pos` is updated accordingly based on the new `current_x` and `current_y` values, and `position_map` is updated with the new position and its corresponding value. `min_length` is the minimum of its previous value and `2 - position_map[target_pos]` if `target_pos` is in `position_map`, otherwise its initial value of positive infinity.***
