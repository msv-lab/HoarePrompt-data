The value of `final_x` is incremented by 1, but the initial state does not mention `final_x`. It only mentions `x` and `y`. However, we can assume that `final_x` is related to `x`. Since `final_x` is incremented by 1, we can say that its new value is `final_x + 1`, but without the initial value of `final_x`, we cannot determine its exact value. 

However, if we assume that `final_x` is initially equal to `x`, then `final_x` becomes `x + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer and greater than or equal to the length of `operations` after one more removal, `operations` is a string of length `n-1` with characters 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' and must have at least 2 characters, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, and `final_x` is `x + 1`.
