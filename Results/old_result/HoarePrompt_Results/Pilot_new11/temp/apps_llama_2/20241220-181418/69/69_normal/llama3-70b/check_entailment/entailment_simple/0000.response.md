Correctness: **False**

The program does not do what the problem description says for every potential case. The problem description asks for the minimum length of subsegment that needs to be changed so that the robot will end up in the cell (x, y). However, the program does not calculate this minimum length correctly.

The program calculates the total number of operations that did not change dx or dy, but this is not the minimum length of subsegment that needs to be changed. The program does not consider the case where a subsegment of the operations can be changed to achieve the desired result, even if the entire sequence of operations does not lead to the desired result.

For example, consider the case where the operations are "RRRR" and the desired result is (2, 0). The program will calculate dx as 4 and dy as 0, and then it will iterate through the operations, subtracting 1 from dx for each 'R' operation. However, it will not consider the case where the first two 'R' operations can be changed to 'L' operations to achieve the desired result. Therefore, the program will return an incorrect result.

The correct approach would be to use a sliding window approach to find the minimum length of subsegment that needs to be changed. This would involve iterating through the operations and maintaining a window of operations that need to be changed to achieve the desired result. The minimum length of this window would be the minimum length of subsegment that needs to be changed.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ops = input()
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    dx, dy = 0, 0
    for op in ops:
        if op == 'U':
            dy += 1
        elif op == 'D':
            dy -= 1
        elif op == 'R':
            dx += 1
        elif op == 'L':
            dx -= 1
    if dx == x and dy == y:
        print(0)
        return
    if (dx - x) % 2!= 0 or (dy - y) % 2!= 0:
        print(-1)
        return
    min_length = float('inf')
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i, n):
            new_dx, new_dy = dx, dy
            for k in range(i, j + 1):
                if ops[k] == 'U':
                    new_dy -= 1
                elif ops[k] == 'D':
                    new_dy += 1
                elif ops[k] == 'R':
                    new_dx -= 1
                elif ops[k] == 'L':
                    new_dx += 1
            if new_dx == x and new_dy == y:
                min_length = min(min_length, j - i + 1)
    if min_length == float('inf'):
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(min_length)
```

This corrected version of the program uses a sliding window approach to find the minimum length of subsegment that needs to be changed. It iterates through all possible subsegments of the operations and checks if changing the operations in the current subsegment would achieve the desired result. If it would, it updates the minimum length of subsegment that needs to be changed. If no subsegment can be changed to achieve the desired result, it prints -1.
