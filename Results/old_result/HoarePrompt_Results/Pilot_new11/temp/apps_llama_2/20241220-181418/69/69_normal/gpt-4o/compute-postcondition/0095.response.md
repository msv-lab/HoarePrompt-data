The function `func_1` accepts parameters `n`, `operations`, `x`, and `y`. `n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a string of length `n` with characters 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', and `x` and `y` are integers. After executing the function body, the function returns either 0 or the minimum distance between revisits to the same target position, which is a positive integer, or -1 if the minimum distance is infinity, meaning there are no revisits to the same target position. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n`, a string of operations, and coordinates `x` and `y`, and return either 0 or the minimum distance between revisits to the same target position, handling cases where there are no revisits.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, operations, x, and y, and returns either 0 or the minimum distance between revisits to the same target position, or -1 if there are no revisits.**
