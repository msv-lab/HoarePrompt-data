Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `ops` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `x` and `y` are input integers. If the second character of `ops` is 'D', then `lx` is 0 and `ly` is -1. If the second character of `ops` is 'R', then `lx` is 0 and `ly` is 0. If the second character of `ops` is 'L', then `lx` is -1 and `ly` is 0. For any other second character of `ops`, `lx` and `ly` remain unchanged from their initial values of 0.***
