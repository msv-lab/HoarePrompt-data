The code decreases the value of `final_y` by 1. The initial state of `final_y` is 0, so after the code execution, `final_y` becomes -1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a string of length `n` with characters 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' and must have at least 1 character, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `final_x` is 0, `final_y` is -1, `op` is 'D'**
