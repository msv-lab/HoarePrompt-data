The variable `ux` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `ux` is not provided, but based on the context, it seems that `ux` might be related to `x`. However, without explicit information about the initial value of `ux`, we can only state that `ux` has been incremented by 1 from its previous value. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `ops` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `x` and `y` are input integers. If the first character of the remaining `ops` is 'U', then `lx` is 0 and `ly` is 1. If the first character of the remaining `ops` is 'D', then `lx` is 0 and `ly` is -1. If the first character of the remaining `ops` is 'R', then `lx` is 1 and `ly` is 0. If the first character of the remaining `ops` is 'L', then `lx` is -1 and `ly` is 0. For any other first character of the remaining `ops`, `lx` and `ly` remain unchanged from their initial values of 0. `ux` is the previous value of `ux` plus 1**
