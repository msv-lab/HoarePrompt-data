Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `ops` is a non-empty string input by the user, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, `ux` is the difference between the number of 'R' and 'L' operations in `ops`, `uy` is the difference between the number of 'U' and 'D' operations in `ops`. If `op` is 'D' and `dy` is less than 0, then `dy` is `dy + 1`. Otherwise, if `op` is 'R' and `dx` is greater than 0, then `dx` is `x - ux - 1` and `res` is 0. If `op` is 'L' and `dx` is less than 0, then `dx` is `x - ux + 1` and `res` is 0. In all other cases, `dx` remains `x - ux`, `dy` remains `y - uy`, and `res` is 1, maintaining the specific conditions regarding `op`, `dx`, and `dy` as per their initial definitions, ensuring `dx` and `dy` are greater than or equal to 0.**
