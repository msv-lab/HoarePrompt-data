To calculate the output state, we need to analyze the given Python code and its impact on the variables.

The given code is:
```python
current_y -= 1
```
This code decrements the value of `current_y` by 1.

Now, let's list the impact of the code on the program:

1. `current_y` is decremented by 1.
2. The values of other variables (`n`, `operations`, `x`, `y`, `final_x`, `final_y`, `dx`, `dy`, `min_length`, `position_map`, `i`, `target_pos`) remain unchanged.

The initial state is:
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 1
- `operations` is a string of length `n` with characters 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R'
- `x` is an integer
- `y` is an integer
- `final_x` is the difference between the counts of 'R' and 'L' in `operations`
- `final_y` is the difference between the counts of 'U' and 'D' in `operations`
- `dx` is `x - final_x`
- `dy` is `y - final_y`
- `min_length` is either its initial value of positive infinity or the minimum of its previous value and `i - position_map[target_pos]` if `target_pos` is in `position_map`
- `position_map` is a dictionary containing positions, initially {(0, 0): -1} and also includes (`current_x`, `current_y`): `i`
- `i` is 1
- `current_x` and `current_y` are determined by `operations[i]`
- `target_pos` is (`current_x + dx`, `current_y + dy`)
- Either `dx` is not equal to 0 or `dy` is not equal to 0, or both

After executing the code, `current_y` is decremented by 1, so its new value is `current_y - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `operations` is a string of length `n` with characters 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `final_x` is the difference between the counts of 'R' and 'L' in `operations`, `final_y` is the difference between the counts of 'U' and 'D' in `operations`, `dx` is `x - final_x`, `dy` is `y - final_y`, `min_length` is either its initial value of positive infinity or the minimum of its previous value and `i - position_map[target_pos]` if `target_pos` is in `position_map`, `position_map` is a dictionary containing positions, initially {(0, 0): -1} and also includes (`current_x`, `current_y`): `i`, `i` is 1, `current_x` is determined by `operations[i]`, `current_y` is `current_y - 1`, `target_pos` is (`current_x + dx`, `current_y + dy - 1`), and either `dx` is not equal to 0 or `dy` is not equal to 0, or both**
