Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `ops` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer. If the current operation `op` is 'D' and `dy` is less than 0, then `ly` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `lx` remains 0 and `ly` remains 0. Additionally, if the current operation `op` is 'R' and `dx` is greater than 0, then `dx` is decreased by 1 from its previous value. If the current operation `op` is 'L' and `dx` is less than 0, then `dx` is set to 1. In all other cases, `res` is incremented by 1. `ux` and `uy` are updated based on the last operation, and we are at the next operation in the string.**
