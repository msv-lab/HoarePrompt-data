You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has got a robot which is situated on an infinite Cartesian plane, initially in the cell $(0, 0)$. Robot can perform the following four kinds of operations:   U — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x, y + 1)$;  D — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x, y - 1)$;  L — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x - 1, y)$;  R — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x + 1, y)$. 

Vasya also has got a sequence of $n$ operations. Vasya wants to modify this sequence so after performing it the robot will end up in $(x, y)$.

Vasya wants to change the sequence so the length of changed subsegment is minimum possible. This length can be calculated as follows: $maxID - minID + 1$, where $maxID$ is the maximum index of a changed operation, and $minID$ is the minimum index of a changed operation. For example, if Vasya changes RRRRRRR to RLRRLRL, then the operations with indices $2$, $5$ and $7$ are changed, so the length of changed subsegment is $7 - 2 + 1 = 6$. Another example: if Vasya changes DDDD to DDRD, then the length of changed subsegment is $1$. 

If there are no changes, then the length of changed subsegment is $0$. Changing an operation means replacing it with some operation (possibly the same); Vasya can't insert new operations into the sequence or remove them.

Help Vasya! Tell him the minimum length of subsegment that he needs to change so that the robot will go from $(0, 0)$ to $(x, y)$, or tell him that it's impossible.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer number $n~(1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5)$ — the number of operations.

The second line contains the sequence of operations — a string of $n$ characters. Each character is either U, D, L or R.

The third line contains two integers $x, y~(-10^9 \le x, y \le 10^9)$ — the coordinates of the cell where the robot should end its path.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the minimum possible length of subsegment that can be changed so the resulting sequence of operations moves the robot from $(0, 0)$ to $(x, y)$. If this change is impossible, print $-1$.


-----Examples-----
Input
5
RURUU
-2 3

Output
3

Input
4
RULR
1 1

Output
0

Input
3
UUU
100 100

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example the sequence can be changed to LULUU. So the length of the changed subsegment is $3 - 1 + 1 = 3$.

In the second example the given sequence already leads the robot to $(x, y)$, so the length of the changed subsegment is $0$.

In the third example the robot can't end his path in the cell $(x, y)$.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ops = input()
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    (ux, uy, lx, ly) = (0, 0, 0, 0)
    for op in ops:
        if op == 'U':
            uy += 1
        elif op == 'D':
            uy -= 1
        elif op == 'R':
            ux += 1
        elif op == 'L':
            ux -= 1
    (dx, dy) = (x - ux, y - uy)
    if dx < 0 or dy < 0:
        print(-1)
    else:
        res = 0
        for op in ops:
            if op == 'U' and dy > 0:
                dy -= 1
            elif op == 'D' and dy < 0:
                dy += 1
            elif op == 'R' and dx > 0:
                dx -= 1
            elif op == 'L' and dx < 0:
                dx += 1
            else:
                res += 1
        print(res)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum length of the subsegment that needs to be changed. 

One of the cases where the program does not work as expected is when the given sequence already leads the robot to a point that is not (x, y), but it is possible to change a subsegment of the sequence to reach (x, y). 

For example, consider the following input:
Input
5
RURUU
-2 1

The program will calculate the final position of the robot as (1, 2) and then try to adjust the sequence to reach (-2, 1). However, it does not consider the possibility of changing the subsegment to move the robot to (-2, 1) in the most efficient way.

In this case, the program should output 3 (by changing the sequence to LURUU), but it will output 5 because it will try to adjust the entire sequence.

The correct approach would be to consider all possible subsegments of the sequence and calculate the minimum length of the subsegment that needs to be changed to reach the target position (x, y). 

Here is a corrected version of the program in python:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ops = input()
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    (ux, uy) = (0, 0)
    for op in ops:
        if op == 'U':
            uy += 1
        elif op == 'D':
            uy -= 1
        elif op == 'R':
            ux += 1
        elif op == 'L':
            ux -= 1
    if abs(x - ux) > n or abs(y - uy) > n:
        print(-1)
        return

    ans = n
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i, n):
            (dx, dy) = (x - ux, y - uy)
            for k in range(i, j + 1):
                if ops[k] == 'U' and dy < 0:
                    dx += 0
                    dy += 1
                elif ops[k] == 'U' and dy >= 0:
                    dx += 0
                    dy -= 1
                elif ops[k] == 'D' and dy > 0:
                    dx += 0
                    dy -= 1
                elif ops[k] == 'D' and dy <= 0:
                    dx += 0
                    dy += 1
                elif ops[k] == 'R' and dx < 0:
                    dx -= 1
                    dy += 0
                elif ops[k] == 'R' and dx >= 0:
                    dx += 1
                    dy += 0
                elif ops[k] == 'L' and dx > 0:
                    dx += 1
                    dy += 0
                elif ops[k] == 'L' and dx <= 0:
                    dx -= 1
                    dy += 0
            if dx == 0 and dy == 0:
                ans = min(ans, j - i + 1)
    if ans == n:
        print(0)
    else:
        print(ans)
```

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, the sequence is a string of n characters from 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', and x and y are integers.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ops = input()
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    ux, uy, lx, ly = 0, 0, 0, 0
    for op in ops:
        if op == 'U':
            uy += 1
        elif op == 'D':
            uy -= 1
        elif op == 'R':
            ux += 1
        elif op == 'L':
            ux -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an input integer, `ops` is a string input by the user, `x` and `y` are input integers, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, `ux` is the difference between the number of 'R' and 'L' operations in `ops`, `uy` is the difference between the number of 'U' and 'D' operations in `ops`.
    dx, dy = x - ux, y - uy
    if (dx < 0 or dy < 0) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        res = 0
        for op in ops:
            if op == 'U' and dy > 0:
                dy -= 1
            elif op == 'D' and dy < 0:
                dy += 1
            elif op == 'R' and dx > 0:
                dx -= 1
            elif op == 'L' and dx < 0:
                dx += 1
            else:
                res += 1
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an input integer, `ops` is a string input by the user, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, `ux` is the difference between the number of 'R' and 'L' operations in `ops`, `uy` is the difference between the number of 'U' and 'D' operations in `ops`, `dx` is either 0 or the difference between `x` and `ux` if all 'R' operations did not reduce `dx` to 0, `dy` is either 0 or the difference between `y` and `uy` if all 'U' operations did not reduce `dy` to 0, `res` is the total number of operations that did not change `dx` or `dy`.
        print(res)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is an input integer, `ops` is a string input by the user, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, `ux` is the difference between the number of 'R' and 'L' operations in `ops`, `uy` is the difference between the number of 'U' and 'D' operations in `ops`, `dx` is `x - ux`, `dy` is `y - uy`. If `dx` is less than 0 or `dy` is less than 0, the function returns -1. Otherwise, `dx` is either 0 or the difference between `x` and `ux` if all 'R' operations did not reduce `dx` to 0, `dy` is either 0 or the difference between `y` and `uy` if all 'U' operations did not reduce `dy` to 0, and the function returns `res`, which is the total number of operations that did not change `dx` or `dy`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts parameters n, sequence, x, and y, where n is a positive integer, sequence is a string of n characters from 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', and x and y are integers. It calculates the net movement in the x and y directions based on the sequence of operations. If the target position (x, y) is not reachable after executing all operations (i.e., x - net x movement < 0 or y - net y movement < 0), the function returns -1. Otherwise, it counts the number of operations that do not change the difference between the target position and the current position (i.e., the operations that are not necessary to reach the target position) and returns this count. The function effectively measures the number of redundant operations in the sequence with respect to reaching the target position (x, y).
