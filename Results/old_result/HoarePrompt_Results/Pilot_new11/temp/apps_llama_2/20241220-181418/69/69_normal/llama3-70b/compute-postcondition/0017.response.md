Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `ops` is a non-empty string input by the user, `x` and `y` are input integers, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0. If the first character of `ops`, denoted as `op`, is 'R', then `ux` is 1 and `uy` is 0. If `op` is 'L', then `ux` is -1 and `uy` is 0. Since `op` is not 'U' and not 'D', these are the only two possible cases for `op`, and `uy` remains 0 in both scenarios.***
