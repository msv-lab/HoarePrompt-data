The code `current_y -= 1` affects the variable `current_y` by decrementing it by 1. The previous value of `current_y` is 0. 

After executing the code, `current_y` becomes -1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a string of length `n` with characters 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' and must have at least 1 character, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `final_x` is the difference between the counts of 'R' and 'L' in `operations`, `final_y` is the difference between the counts of 'U' and 'D' in `operations`, `dx` is `x - final_x`, `dy` is `y - final_y`, `min_length` is positive infinity, `current_x` is 0, `current_y` is -1, `position_map` is {(0, 0): -1}, `i` is 0, either `dx` is not equal to 0 or `dy` is not equal to 0, or both, the character at index `i` of `operations` is not 'U', it is either 'D', 'L', or 'R', and the current value of the character at index `i` of `operations` is 'D'**
