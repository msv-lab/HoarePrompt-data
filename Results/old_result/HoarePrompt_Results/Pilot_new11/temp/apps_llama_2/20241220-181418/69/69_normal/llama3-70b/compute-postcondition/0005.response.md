Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `ops` is a string input by the user that must not be empty, `x` and `y` are input integers, initially `ux` was 0, `uy` was 0, `lx` was 0, `ly` was 0, and the current value of these variables are still 0 since there is no update. `op` is the first character in `ops` and the current value of `op` is 'U'.**
