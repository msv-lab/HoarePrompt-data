According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `ops`. If `ops` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the state of `n`, `x`, `y`, `ux`, `uy`, `lx`, `ly` does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `ops` is not empty.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `ops` is a string input by the user that must not be empty, `x` and `y` are input integers, `ux` is 0, `uy` is 0, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, `op` is the first character in `ops`**
