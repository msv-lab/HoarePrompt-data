Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `ops` is a string input by the user, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, `ux` is the difference between the number of 'R' and 'L' operations in `ops`, `uy` is the difference between the number of 'U' and 'D' operations in `ops`, `dx` is `x - ux`, `dy` is `y - uy`. If `dx` is less than 0 or `dy` is less than 0, the function returns -1. Otherwise, `dx` is either 0 or the difference between `x` and `ux` if all 'R' operations did not reduce `dx` to 0, `dy` is either 0 or the difference between `y` and `uy` if all 'U' operations did not reduce `dy` to 0, and the function returns `res`, which is the total number of operations that did not change `dx` or `dy`.**
