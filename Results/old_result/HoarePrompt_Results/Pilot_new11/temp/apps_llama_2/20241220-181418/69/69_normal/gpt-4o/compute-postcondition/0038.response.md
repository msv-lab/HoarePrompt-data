The variable `dy` is assigned the value `y - final_y`. The previous values of the variables are: `n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a string of length `n` with characters 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `final_x` is the difference between the counts of 'R' and 'L' in `operations`, `final_y` is the difference between the counts of 'U' and 'D' in `operations`, and `dx` is `x - final_x`. After executing the code, the value of `dy` becomes `y - final_y`, but the states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a string of length `n` with characters 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `final_x` is the difference between the counts of 'R' and 'L' in `operations`, `final_y` is the difference between the counts of 'U' and 'D' in `operations`, `dx` is `x - final_x`, and `dy` is `y - final_y`**
