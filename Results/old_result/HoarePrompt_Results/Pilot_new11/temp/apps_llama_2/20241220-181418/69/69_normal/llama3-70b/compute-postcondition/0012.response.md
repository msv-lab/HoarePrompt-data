The value of `ux` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `ux` was 0, so the new value of `ux` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. The value of `n` is still an input integer, `ops` is still a string input by the user that must not be empty, `x` and `y` are still input integers, `uy` is still 0, `lx` is still 0, `ly` is still 0, and the first character of `ops`, denoted as `op`, is still 'R'. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `ops` is a string input by the user that must not be empty, `x` and `y` are input integers, `ux` is 1, `uy` is 0, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, and the first character of `ops`, denoted as `op`, is 'R'.**
