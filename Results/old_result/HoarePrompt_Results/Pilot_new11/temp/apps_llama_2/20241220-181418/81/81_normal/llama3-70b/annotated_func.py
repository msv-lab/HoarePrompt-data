#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `b` is 0, `a` is the GCD of the original `a` and `b`
    return a
    #The program returns `a`, which is the original value of `a` since `b` is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two input integers `a` and `b`. It accepts two parameters and returns a single value, which is the GCD of the original `a` and `b`. The return value is determined after the function execution, and it does not return the original value of `a` as suggested by the annotation, but rather the GCD of `a` and `b` that is calculated through the Euclidean algorithm implemented in the while loop. The final state of the program is that it returns an integer value representing the GCD of the input integers `a` and `b`, handling all potential edge cases including when `b` is 0 from the start, in which case it returns `a` as the GCD.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers.
def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b // func_1(a, b)
    #The program returns the integer result of (a * b) divided by the result of func_1(a, b), where a and b are positive integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are positive integers, and returns the integer result of `(a * b)` divided by the result of `func_1(a, b)`. The function assumes that `func_1(a, b)` returns a non-zero value to avoid division by zero errors. If `func_1(a, b)` returns zero, the function will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`. The function does not modify the input parameters `a` and `b`, and only returns the calculated result. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the input parameters `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and the function returns an integer value.
