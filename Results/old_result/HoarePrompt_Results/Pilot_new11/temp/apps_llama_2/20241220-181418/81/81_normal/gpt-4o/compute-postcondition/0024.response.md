Postcondition: **`l`, `r`, `x`, and `y` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` <= 10^9 and 1 <= `x` <= `y` <= 10^9, `y` is divisible by `x`, `z` equals `y // x` and is at least 4, `i` is 2. If `z` is divisible by `i` and `l` is less than or equal to `x` and `x` is less than or equal to `r`, and `l` is less than or equal to `y` and `y` is less than or equal to `r`, and the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` equals `x`, and `x` multiplied by `y` divided by their greatest common divisor equals `y`, then `count` is 1 if `x` equals `y`, and `count` is 2 if `x` is not equal to `y`, and `a` equals `x` and `b` equals `y`. If `z` is divisible by `i`, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` <= 10^9, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 <= `x` <= `y` <= 10^9 and `y` is divisible by `x`, `z` equals `y // x` and is at least 4, `i` is 2, `a` is `2 * x`, `b` is at least `2 * x` and equals `(y // x) // 2 * x`. If `l` <= `a` <= `r` and `l` <= `b` <= `r` and `math.gcd(a, b)` equals `x` and `a * b // math.gcd(a, b)` equals `y`, then `count` is increased by 1 if `a` equals `b`, otherwise `count` is increased by 2 from its initial value based on the fulfillment of the initial conditional statements regarding divisibility, range, and GCD of `x` and `y`. Otherwise, `count` is 0 and `a` and `b` are undefined.**
