Correctness: **True**

The program follows the problem description. It calculates the number of good pairs of integers (a, b) such that l ≤ a, b ≤ r, GCD(a, b) = x, and LCM(a, b) = y.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Input and Output**: The program reads four integers l, r, x, and y from the input, and prints the number of good pairs of integers (a, b) that satisfy the conditions.

2. **GCD and LCM Relationship**: The program checks if y is divisible by x. If not, it returns 0, which is correct because if y is not divisible by x, then there are no pairs (a, b) that satisfy GCD(a, b) = x and LCM(a, b) = y.

3. **Iterating over all possible pairs (a, b)**: The program iterates over all possible factors i of z = y // x, calculates a = i * x and b = z // i * x, and checks if a and b are within the range [l, r] and if GCD(a, b) = x and LCM(a, b) = y.

4. **Counting pairs**: The program correctly counts the number of good pairs (a, b). If a = b, it counts the pair once; if a ≠ b, it counts the pair twice.

The program covers all possible cases as described in the problem description, and it correctly calculates the number of good pairs of integers (a, b) that satisfy the conditions.

The only assumption made here is that the input will be valid, which is a given condition. Therefore, the program is correct, and it will always produce the expected output for valid inputs.
