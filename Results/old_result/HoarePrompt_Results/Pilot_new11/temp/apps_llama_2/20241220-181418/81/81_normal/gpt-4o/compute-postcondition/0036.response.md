Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts four integer parameters `l`, `r`, `x`, and `y` and returns either `0` or the total count of distinct pairs of numbers `(a, b)` that satisfy the conditions: (1) both `a` and `b` are within the range `[l, r]`, (2) the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` equals `x`, and (3) the product of `a` and `b` divided by their GCD equals `y`. This count includes pairs where `a` equals `b` (counted once) and pairs where `a` is not equal to `b` (counted twice). If `y` is not divisible by `x`, the function immediately returns `0`. Upon completing its execution, the function returns the calculated count, which reflects the total number of distinct pairs satisfying these conditions within the given range and mathematical constraints. The input parameters `l`, `r`, `x`, and `y` retain their initial values throughout the function's execution.**
