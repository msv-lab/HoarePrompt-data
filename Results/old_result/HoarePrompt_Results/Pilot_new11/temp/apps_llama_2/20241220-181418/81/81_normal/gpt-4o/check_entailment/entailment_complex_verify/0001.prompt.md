You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Today on Informatics class Nastya learned about GCD and LCM (see links below). Nastya is very intelligent, so she solved all the tasks momentarily and now suggests you to solve one of them as well.

We define a pair of integers (a, b) good, if GCD(a, b) = x and LCM(a, b) = y, where GCD(a, b) denotes the greatest common divisor of a and b, and LCM(a, b) denotes the least common multiple of a and b.

You are given two integers x and y. You are to find the number of good pairs of integers (a, b) such that l ≤ a, b ≤ r. Note that pairs (a, b) and (b, a) are considered different if a ≠ b.


-----Input-----

The only line contains four integers l, r, x, y (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 10^9).


-----Output-----

In the only line print the only integer — the answer for the problem.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 2 1 2

Output
2

Input
1 12 1 12

Output
4

Input
50 100 3 30

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example there are two suitable good pairs of integers (a, b): (1, 2) and (2, 1).

In the second example there are four suitable good pairs of integers (a, b): (1, 12), (12, 1), (3, 4) and (4, 3).

In the third example there are good pairs of integers, for example, (3, 30), but none of them fits the condition l ≤ a, b ≤ r.
Program:
```
import math

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    (l, r, x, y) = map(int, input().strip().split())
    print(func_1(l, r, x, y))

def func_1(l, r, x, y):
    if y % x != 0:
        return 0
    z = y // x
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(z)) + 1):
        if z % i == 0:
            a = i * x
            b = z // i * x
            if l <= a <= r and l <= b <= r and (math.gcd(a, b) == x) and (a * b // math.gcd(a, b) == y):
                if a == b:
                    count += 1
                else:
                    count += 2
    return count


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of why it's correct:

1. **Checking for valid GCD and LCM**: The program first checks if `y` is divisible by `x`. If not, it immediately returns 0 because `x` cannot be the GCD of `a` and `b` if `y` is not a multiple of `x`.

2. **Finding factors of `z`**: The program then finds all factors of `z` (where `z = y / x`), which represents the possible ratios of `a` and `b` to their GCD `x`. For each factor `i`, it calculates `a = i * x` and `b = z / i * x`.

3. **Checking the conditions**: For each pair `(a, b)`, the program checks if `a` and `b` are within the given range `[l, r]`, if their GCD is indeed `x`, and if their LCM is indeed `y`. If all conditions are met, it increments the count. If `a` is not equal to `b`, it increments the count by 2 because `(a, b)` and `(b, a)` are considered different pairs.

4. **Handling edge cases**: The program correctly handles the case where `a` equals `b` by only incrementing the count by 1 in such cases.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly counts the number of good pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the given conditions. The examples provided also demonstrate the program's correctness. Therefore, the program accurately implements the problem description, and its correctness is verified.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import math

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    (l, r, x, y) = map(int, input().strip().split())
    print(func_1(l, r, x, y))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: l, r, x, and y are integers such that 1 <= l <= r <= 10^9 and 1 <= x <= y <= 10^9.
def func_1(l, r, x, y):
    if (y % x != 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: l, r, x, and y are integers such that 1 <= l <= r <= 10^9 and 1 <= x <= y <= 10^9, and y is divisible by x (i.e., y % x == 0)
    z = y // x
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(z)) + 1):
        if z % i == 0:
            a = i * x
            b = z // i * x
            if l <= a <= r and l <= b <= r and math.gcd(a, b
                ) == x and a * b // math.gcd(a, b) == y:
                if a == b:
                    count += 1
                else:
                    count += 2
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `l`, `r`, `x`, and `y` retain their initial values; `z` is equal to `y // x`; `i` equals the square root of `z`; `a` and `b` are the last pair of values satisfying the loop conditions or undefined if no such pair exists; and `count` is the total number of distinct pairs of numbers `(a, b)` that satisfy the conditions within the loop, accumulated over all iterations.
    return count
    #The program returns the total number of distinct pairs of numbers (a, b) that satisfy the conditions within the loop, accumulated over all iterations
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts four integer parameters `l`, `r`, `x`, and `y` and returns either `0` or the total count of distinct pairs of numbers `(a, b)` that satisfy the conditions: (1) both `a` and `b` are within the range `[l, r]`, (2) the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` equals `x`, and (3) the product of `a` and `b` divided by their GCD equals `y`. This count includes pairs where `a` equals `b` (counted once) and pairs where `a` is not equal to `b` (counted twice). If `y` is not divisible by `x`, the function immediately returns `0`. Upon completing its execution, the function returns the calculated count, which reflects the total number of distinct pairs satisfying these conditions within the given range and mathematical constraints. The input parameters `l`, `r`, `x`, and `y` retain their initial values throughout the function's execution.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
