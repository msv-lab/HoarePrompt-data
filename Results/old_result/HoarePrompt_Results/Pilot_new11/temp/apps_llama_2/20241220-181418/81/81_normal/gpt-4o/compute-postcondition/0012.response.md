Postcondition: **`l`, `r`, `x`, and `y` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` <= 10^9 and 1 <= `x` <= `y` <= 10^9, `y` is divisible by `x`, `z` is an integer equal to `y // x` and is at least 1, `z` is divisible by `i`, `i` is 1, `count` is 0, the current value of `a` is equal to `x`, the current value of `b` is equal to `y`, `l` is less than or equal to `a` and `a` is less than or equal to `r`, `l` is less than or equal to `b` and `b` is less than or equal to `r`, the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b` equals `x`, and `a` multiplied by `b` divided by their greatest common divisor equals `y`, and `a` is not equal to `b`**
