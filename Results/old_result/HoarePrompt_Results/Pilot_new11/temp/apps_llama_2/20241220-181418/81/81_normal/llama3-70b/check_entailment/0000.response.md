Correctness: **False**.

The program provided does not match the problem description because it does not attempt to solve the problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are implementations of GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) and LCM (Least Common Multiple) calculations, respectively, but they are not used to solve the given problem. The problem requires finding the number of good pairs of integers (a, b) such that the GCD of a and b equals x, the LCM of a and b equals y, and both a and b are within the range [l, r]. The provided code does not contain any logic to find these pairs within the given constraints.

To solve the problem, one would need to iterate over all possible pairs (a, b) within the range [l, r], calculate the GCD and LCM of each pair, and count the pairs where GCD equals x and LCM equals y. The given code does not perform these steps, making it incorrect according to the problem description. 

A correct approach would involve using the given functions to calculate GCD and LCM for each pair of numbers in the range and then comparing these values with x and y. However, this is not implemented in the provided program. 

For example, with inputs l = 1, r = 2, x = 1, y = 2, the program should return 2 because (1, 2) and (2, 1) are both valid pairs. However, the provided code does not contain any logic to find or count such pairs, making it incorrect.
