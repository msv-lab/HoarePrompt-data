Postcondition: **`l`, `r`, `x`, and `y` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` <= 10^9 and 1 <= `x` <= `y` <= 10^9, `y` is divisible by `x`, `z` is an integer equal to `y // x` and is at least 1, `i` is 1. If `z` is divisible by `i` and `l` is less than or equal to `x` and `x` is less than or equal to `r`, and `l` is less than or equal to `y` and `y` is less than or equal to `r`, and the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` equals `x`, and `x` multiplied by `y` divided by their greatest common divisor equals `y`, then `count` is 1 if `x` equals `y`, and `count` is 2 if `x` is not equal to `y`, and `a` equals `x` and `b` equals `y`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, with `count` being 0 and `a` and `b` being undefined.**
