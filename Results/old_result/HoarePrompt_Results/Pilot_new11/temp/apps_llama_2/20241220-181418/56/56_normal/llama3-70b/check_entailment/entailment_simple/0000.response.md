Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. 

One of the major issues with the program is that it does not correctly handle the case where the input `n` can be represented as a sum of powers of 2 with a minimum maximum value (y), but the representation has more than `k` terms. In this case, the program should output "No", but the program currently checks if the length of `a` is less than `k` after the while loop and appends the `x` value to `a` without considering whether this will result in a `y` value that is minimum.

Another issue with the program is that it does not correctly handle the case where `n` cannot be represented as a sum of `k` powers of 2. The program currently checks if `n` is less than `k`, but this is not sufficient. The program should check if `n` can be represented as a sum of `k` powers of 2, and if not, output "No".

The program also does not correctly find the lexicographically largest sequence with the minimum `y` value. The program currently sorts `a` in descending order, but this is not sufficient to find the lexicographically largest sequence.

Here is a correct approach to solve this problem:

1. Initialize an empty list `a` to store the powers of 2.
2. While `n` is greater than 0, find the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `n` and append it to `a`. Subtract this power of 2 from `n`.
3. If the length of `a` is less than `k`, output "No".
4. Otherwise, find the maximum value in `a` and store it in `y`.
5. Initialize an empty list `result` to store the final result.
6. For each power of 2 in `a`, if the power of 2 is less than or equal to `y`, append it to `result`.
7. If the length of `result` is less than `k`, fill the rest of `result` with the smallest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `y`.
8. Output "Yes" and the elements of `result` in descending order.

This approach correctly finds the lexicographically largest sequence with the minimum `y` value and handles the case where `n` cannot be represented as a sum of `k` powers of 2.
