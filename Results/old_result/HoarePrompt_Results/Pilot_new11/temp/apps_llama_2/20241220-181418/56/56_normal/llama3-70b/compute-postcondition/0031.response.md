Postcondition: **`n` is the remaining value after subtracting the largest powers of 2 that can be represented by the bits in the original value of `n`, `i` is the number of times the most significant bit in `n` can be removed until `x` is less than or equal to `i`, `a` contains the positions of the most significant bits in `n` at each iteration, until the loop breaks, and the length of `a` is greater than or equal to `k`**
