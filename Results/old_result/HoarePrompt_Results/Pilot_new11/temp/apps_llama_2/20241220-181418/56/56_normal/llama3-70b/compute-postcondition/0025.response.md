The code `a.append(x)` adds the value of `x` to the end of the list `a`. The value of `x` is `floor(log2(n))`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is increased by 1, `x` is equal to `floor(log2(n))`, `a` contains the value `floor(log2(n))`, If `x` is less than or equal to `i`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues execution.**
