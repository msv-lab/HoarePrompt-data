Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as stated in the problem description. 

One potential case where the program does not work correctly is when it encounters a negative number or zero. According to the problem description, negative numbers and zero are valid inputs for the sequence (a_1, a_2,..., a_{k}). However, the current program does not handle negative numbers or zero correctly.

Another case is when the input number `n` can be represented as a sum of powers of 2 with multiple sequences of the same length `k`. In such cases, the program should return the lexicographically largest sequence among all sequences that have the minimum `y` value. However, the current program does not consider this condition.

For example, if the input is `23 5`, the program should return `3 3 2 1 0` because it is the lexicographically largest sequence among all sequences with the minimum `y` value. However, if the input is `7 3`, the program should return `2 1 1` because it is the lexicographically largest sequence among all sequences with the minimum `y` value.

To fix these issues, the program needs to be modified to handle negative numbers and zero correctly and to find the lexicographically largest sequence among all sequences with the minimum `y` value.

Here is an example of how the program could be modified to handle these cases:

```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    if n < k:
        print('No')
    else:
        a = []
        i = -1
        while n > 0:
            x = n.bit_length() - 1
            if x <= i:
                break
            a.append(x)
            n -= 2 ** x
            i += 1
        if len(a) < k:
            for _ in range(k - len(a)):
                a.append(-1)
        else:
            a = a[:k]
        a.sort(reverse=True)
        y = max(a)
        while len(a) > 0 and a[0] == y:
            a.pop(0)
        if len(a) > 0:
            a.append(y)
        if sum([2**x for x in a]) == n and len(a) == k:
            print('Yes')
            print(' '.join(map(str, a)))
        else:
            print('No')
```
This modified program still does not solve the problem correctly in all cases, because it does not consider all possible sequences of powers of 2. To correctly solve the problem, a more complex algorithm is needed that considers all possible sequences of powers of 2 and finds the lexicographically largest sequence among all sequences with the minimum `y` value. 

However, without further modification, the original program does not work correctly in all cases.
