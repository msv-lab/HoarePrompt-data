This function takes two non-negative integers `n` and `k` as input, where `n` is less than or equal to 10^18 and `k` is less than or equal to 10^5. It checks if `n` is less than `k` and prints 'No' if true. Otherwise, it calculates the positions of the most significant bits in `n` by iteratively subtracting the largest power of 2 that can be represented by the bits in `n`. The function stores these positions in a list `a`. If the length of `a` is less than `k`, it prints 'No'. Otherwise, it sorts the first `k` elements of `a` in descending order and prints 'Yes' along with the sorted positions. The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the results directly to the console. After execution, the state of the program will be one of two possible outcomes: either 'No' will have been printed if `n` is less than `k` or if the number of most significant bits in `n` is less than `k`, or 'Yes' will have been printed along with the first `k` positions of the most significant bits in `n` in descending order if the conditions are met.
