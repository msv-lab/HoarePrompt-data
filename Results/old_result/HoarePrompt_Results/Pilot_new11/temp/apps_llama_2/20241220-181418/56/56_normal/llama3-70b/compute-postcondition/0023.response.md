The code `break` does not change the values of the variables but breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. 
The value of `n` is still greater than 0, `i` is increased by 1, and `x` is equal to `floor(log2(n))`.
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is increased by 1, `x` is equal to `floor(log2(n))`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is increased by 1, `x` is equal to `floor(log2(n))`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
