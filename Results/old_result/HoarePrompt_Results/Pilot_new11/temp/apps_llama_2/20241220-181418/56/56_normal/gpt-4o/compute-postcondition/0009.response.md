The value of `i` is appended to the list `bits`. The previous value of `i` is 59. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer of up to 18 digits, `k` is a positive integer of up to 5 digits, `k` is less than or equal to `n`, `bits` is a list that may or may not contain 60 and must contain 59, `i` is 59.
