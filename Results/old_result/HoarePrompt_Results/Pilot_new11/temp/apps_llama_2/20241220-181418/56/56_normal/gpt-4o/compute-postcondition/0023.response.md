The code `smallest = bits.pop()` removes the last element from the list `bits` and assigns it to the variable `smallest`. 

The value of `n` is still a non-negative integer of up to 18 digits. 
The value of `k` is still a positive integer of up to 5 digits and is less than or equal to the original value of `n`. 
The value of `i` is still -1. 
The list `bits` now has one less element than before, since the last element has been removed. 
The new value of `smallest` is the last element that was removed from `bits`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer of up to 18 digits, `k` is a positive integer of up to 5 digits and is less than or equal to the original value of `n`, `i` is -1, `bits` is a list of indices representing the positions of bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `n` plus the index `smallest - 1` with the last element removed, `smallest` is the last index of a bit set to 1 in the binary representation of `n` which was the last element in `bits` before it was removed, and the number of bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `n` plus one is less than `k`.**
