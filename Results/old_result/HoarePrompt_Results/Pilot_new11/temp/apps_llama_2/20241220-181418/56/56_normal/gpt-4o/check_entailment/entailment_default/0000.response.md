Correctness: **False**.

The code does not work correctly for all potential cases. The main issue with the code is that it does not correctly implement the requirement of minimizing the maximum value in the sequence. The code simply shifts the rightmost set bit to the right and duplicates it until `k` bits are set, but this approach does not guarantee that the maximum value in the sequence will be minimized.

For example, consider the case where `n = 11` and `k = 3`. The binary representation of `11` is `1011`, which has two bits set to `1`. The code will shift the rightmost set bit to the right and duplicate it to get `101 1 1`, which corresponds to the sequence `(2, 0, 0)`. However, a better sequence would be `(2, 1, 1)`, which also sums up to `11` but has a smaller maximum value.

Another issue with the code is that it does not handle cases where `n` has a large number of bits set to `1`. In such cases, the code may not be able to shift the bits to the right and duplicate them to get exactly `k` bits set to `1`, leading to incorrect results.

The output hints also agree with the code and help to prove that the code is incorrect. They mention that the function returns 'No' if `k` is greater than `n` or if the number of bits set to `1` in `n` is greater than `k`, but they do not guarantee that the function will return the correct sequence in all cases.

Overall, the code does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem, and there are cases where it will produce incorrect results. Therefore, the correctness of the code is **False**.
