Postcondition: **`n` is an integer and `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is an integer and `1 <= k <= 45`, `M` is an integer and `0 <= M <= 2*10^9`, `t` is a list of `k` integers where `1 <= t_j <= 1000000` for all `j` and `t` must have at least 2 subtask times for the loop to execute again, `total_time_per_task` is an integer and `k <= total_time_per_task <= k * 1000000`, `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`. If `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`, then `max_subtasks_for_this_task` equals `new_remaining_time // subtask_time` where `new_remaining_time` is the remainder of `remaining_time` divided by `subtask_time`, and `subtasks_solved` is equal to its previous value plus `max_subtasks_for_this_task` and `remaining_time` equals `remaining_time % subtask_time`.**
