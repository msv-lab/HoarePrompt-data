The value of `max_points` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `points + subtasks_solved`. The previous value of `max_points` is unknown, but it is based on `n`, `k`, `complete_tasks`, and its original value. The value of `points` is `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, and the value of `subtasks_solved` is the minimum of its previous value and `(n - complete_tasks) * k`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer and `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is an integer and `1 <= k <= 45`, `M` is an integer and `0 <= M <= 2*10^9`, `t` is a list of `k` integers where `1 <= t_j <= 1000000` for all `j`, `total_time_per_task` is an integer and `k <= total_time_per_task <= k * 1000000`, `subtasks_solved` is the minimum of its previous value and `(n - complete_tasks) * k`, `remaining_time` is `M - (complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) - (total time used to solve subtasks)`, `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `time_used` is equal to `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `complete_tasks` remains the same, and `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `points + subtasks_solved`, which is the maximum of its previous value and `complete_tasks * (k + 1) + subtasks_solved`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer and `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is an integer and `1 <= k <= 45`, `M` is an integer and `0 <= M <= 2*10^9`, `t` is a list of `k` integers where `1 <= t_j <= 1000000` for all `j`, `total_time_per_task` is an integer and `k <= total_time_per_task <= k * 1000000`, `subtasks_solved` is the minimum of its previous value and `(n - complete_tasks) * k`, `remaining_time` is `M - (complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) - (total time used to solve subtasks)`, `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `time_used` is equal to `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `complete_tasks` remains the same, and `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `complete_tasks * (k + 1) + subtasks_solved`**
