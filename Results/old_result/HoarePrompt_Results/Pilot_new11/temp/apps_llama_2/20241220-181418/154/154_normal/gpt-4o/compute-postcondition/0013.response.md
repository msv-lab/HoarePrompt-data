The value of `subtasks_solved` is incremented by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`. The value of `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `remaining_time // subtask_time`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

The new value of `subtasks_solved` is `subtasks_solved + max_subtasks_for_this_task`, which equals `0 + max_subtasks_for_this_task`, so it equals `max_subtasks_for_this_task`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer and `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is an integer and `1 <= k <= 45`, `M` is an integer and `0 <= M <= 2*10^9`, `t` is a list of `k` integers where `1 <= t_j <= 1000000` for all `j` and `t` must have at least 1 subtask time, `total_time_per_task` is an integer and `k <= total_time_per_task <= k * 1000000`, `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `subtasks_solved` is `remaining_time // subtask_time`, `subtask_time` is the first subtask time in the list `t`, `remaining_time` is `M - time_used` and `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `remaining_time // subtask_time`**
