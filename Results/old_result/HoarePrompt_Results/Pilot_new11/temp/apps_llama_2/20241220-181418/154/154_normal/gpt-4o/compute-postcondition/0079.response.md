To solve this problem, we need to consider the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet.

Given Initial State:
- `n` is an integer and `1 <= n <= 45`
- `k` is an integer and `1 <= k <= 45`
- `M` is an integer and `0 <= M <= 2*10^9`
- `t` is a list of `k` integers where `1 <= t_j <= 1000000` for all `j`
- `total_time_per_task` is an integer and `k <= total_time_per_task <= k * 1000000`
- `subtasks_solved` is the sum of the maximum subtasks solvable for each subtask time given the remaining time
- `remaining_time` is the remaining time after solving all possible subtasks

Python Code Snippet:
```python
subtasks_solved = min(subtasks_solved, (n - complete_tasks) * k)
```

Let's break down the code's impact:
- The code updates the value of `subtasks_solved`.
- It uses the `min` function to choose the smaller value between the current `subtasks_solved` and the product of `(n - complete_tasks)` and `k`.
- The variable `complete_tasks` is not defined in the initial state, so we will consider it as a given or previously defined value in the context of this problem.

Given the lack of information about `complete_tasks`, we can only express the update in terms of the variables provided. 

The value of `subtasks_solved` is now the minimum of its previous value and `(n - complete_tasks) * k`.

Since we do not know the exact value of `complete_tasks`, we cannot calculate an exact numerical value for `subtasks_solved`. However, we can express the relationship as shown in the code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an integer and `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is an integer and `1 <= k <= 45`, `M` is an integer and `0 <= M <= 2*10^9`, `t` is a list of `k` integers where `1 <= t_j <= 1000000` for all `j`, `total_time_per_task` is an integer and `k <= total_time_per_task <= k * 1000000`, `subtasks_solved` is the minimum of its previous value and `(n - complete_tasks) * k`, `remaining_time` is the remaining time after solving all possible subtasks**
