The given code initializes a 2D list `dp` with dimensions `(k + 1) x (M + 1)`, where all elements are set to 0. This operation does not change the values of `n`, `k`, `M`, `t_j`, or `t`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 45, `k` is an input integer such that 1 <= k <= 45, `M` is an input integer such that 0 <= M <= 2 * 10^9, `t_j` are integers such that 1 <= t_j <= 1000000 for 1 <= j <= k, `t` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, and `dp` is a 2D list of size (k + 1) x (M + 1) initialized with all zeros**.
