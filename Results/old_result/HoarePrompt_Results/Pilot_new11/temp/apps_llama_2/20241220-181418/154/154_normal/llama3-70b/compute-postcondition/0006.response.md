The given Python code snippet is `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]`. 

`dp` is a 2D list of size (k + 1) x (M + 1) and it is initialized with all zeros. `i` is 1 and `j` is 1.

When `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]` is executed, `dp[1][1]` will be assigned the value of `dp[1][0]`. 

Since `dp` is initialized with all zeros, `dp[1][0]` is 0. 

Therefore, `dp[1][1]` will be 0.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 45, `k` is an input integer such that `k` is at least 1 and 1 <= k <= 45, `M` is an input integer such that 1 <= M <= 2 * 10^9, `t_j` are integers such that 1 <= t_j <= 1000000 for 1 <= j <= k, `t` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `dp` is a 2D list of size (k + 1) x (M + 1) where `dp[1][1]` is 0 and all other values are initialized with zeros, `i` is 1, `j` is 1**
