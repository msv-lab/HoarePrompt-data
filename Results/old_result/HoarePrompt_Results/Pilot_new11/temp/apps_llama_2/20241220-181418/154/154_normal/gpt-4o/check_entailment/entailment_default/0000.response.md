Correctness: **False**

The code provided seems to be solving the problem correctly most of the time, but there's an issue with how it calculates the maximum points achievable when some tasks are completed and some subtasks are solved from the remaining incomplete tasks.

The problem arises in the way the code tries to solve remaining subtasks within the remaining time. It iterates through all subtask times and tries to solve as many subtasks of that time as possible, but it doesn't necessarily choose the subtasks that would maximize the total points.

A specific case where the code might fail is when there are multiple subtasks with the same time requirement but varying point contributions, or more subtly, when the subtasks that can be solved next contribute less points than others that could be solved if the remaining time was allocated differently.

For instance, consider a scenario where `n = 2`, `k = 3`, `M = 6`, and `t = [1, 2, 3]`. If Polycarp decides to complete one task (`k+1 = 4` points, `1+2+3 = 6` minutes), the code correctly calculates this scenario. However, the issue arises in how it considers solving partial tasks with the remaining time, which in this scenario is 0 since all time was used to complete one task. In more complex scenarios, this can lead to suboptimal solutions.

A correct approach should consider all possible combinations of tasks and subtasks, ensuring that the most valuable subtasks (in terms of time efficiency and point contribution) are solved first within the given time limit.

In summary, while the code attempts to solve the problem, its approach to maximizing points by completing tasks and subtasks within the time limit does not always lead to the optimal solution, particularly when considering the allocation of remaining time to solve subtasks from incomplete tasks.
