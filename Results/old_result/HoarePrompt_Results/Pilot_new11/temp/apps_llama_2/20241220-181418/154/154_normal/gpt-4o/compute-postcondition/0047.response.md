To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the given for loop statement and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The for loop statement is `for subtask_time in t:`. This means that the loop will iterate over each element in the list `t`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` must have at least 2 elements and `subtask_time` is the second element in `t`. For the loop to execute again, `t` must have at least 3 elements, and `subtask_time` should be the third element in `t`. 

The other variables (`n`, `k`, `M`, `total_time_per_task`, `subtasks_solved`, `remaining_time`) are not directly related to the loop condition, so their states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is an integer and `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is an integer and `1 <= k <= 45`, `M` is an integer and `0 <= M <= 2*10^9`, `t` is a list of `k` integers where `1 <= t_j <= 1000000` for all `j` and `t` must have at least 3 elements, `total_time_per_task` is an integer and `k <= total_time_per_task <= k * 1000000`, `subtask_time` is the third element in `t`**
