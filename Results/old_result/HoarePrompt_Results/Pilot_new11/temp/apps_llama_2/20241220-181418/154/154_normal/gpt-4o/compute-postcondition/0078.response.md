To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the loop code and the given output states for the first few iterations.

The loop iterates over each `subtask_time` in the list `t`. For each iteration, it checks if `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`. If the condition is true, it calculates `max_subtasks_for_this_task` as the integer division of `remaining_time` by `subtask_time`, adds this value to `subtasks_solved`, and subtracts the product of `max_subtasks_for_this_task` and `subtask_time` from `remaining_time`.

From the given output states, we can observe the following patterns:

- `n` and `k` remain unchanged throughout the loop as they are not modified within the loop.
- `M` also remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- `t` is a list of `k` integers, and the loop iterates over each element in this list.
- `total_time_per_task` is not changed within the loop.
- `subtasks_solved` is incremented by `max_subtasks_for_this_task` in each iteration where `remaining_time` is sufficient.
- `remaining_time` is reduced by the amount used for the subtasks in each iteration.
- `points`, `time_used`, `complete_tasks`, and `max_points` are not directly modified within the loop provided, but their values before the loop started and any changes to them would have been based on conditions and calculations not shown in this snippet. Given the provided code, we focus on `subtasks_solved` and `remaining_time`.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, the values of the variables can be summarized as follows:

- `n` is an integer and `1 <= n <= 45`.
- `k` is an integer and `1 <= k <= 45`.
- `M` is an integer and `0 <= M <= 2*10^9`.
- `t` is a list of `k` integers where `1 <= t_j <= 1000000` for all `j`.
- `total_time_per_task` is an integer and `k <= total_time_per_task <= k * 1000000`.
- `subtasks_solved` will be the sum of `max_subtasks_for_this_task` for each `subtask_time` in `t` where `remaining_time` was sufficient, starting from its initial value of 0.
- `remaining_time` will be the initial `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task` minus the total time used for all subtasks that were solved.

Given that `points`, `time_used`, `complete_tasks`, and `max_points` are not modified within the provided loop snippet, their values after the loop would depend on their initial values and any changes made outside this loop snippet, which are not detailed in the provided information.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer and `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is an integer and `1 <= k <= 45`, `M` is an integer and `0 <= M <= 2*10^9`, `t` is a list of `k` integers where `1 <= t_j <= 1000000` for all `j`, `total_time_per_task` is an integer and `k <= total_time_per_task <= k * 1000000`, `subtasks_solved` is the sum of the maximum subtasks solvable for each subtask time given the remaining time, `remaining_time` is the remaining time after solving all possible subtasks.**
