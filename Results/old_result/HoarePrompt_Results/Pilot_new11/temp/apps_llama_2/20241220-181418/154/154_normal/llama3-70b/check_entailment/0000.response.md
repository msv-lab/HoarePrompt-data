Correctness: **False**

The given program does not accurately solve the problem. The issue lies in the way it uses dynamic programming to calculate the maximum points Polycarp can earn. 

The program tries to find the maximum number of subtasks that can be completed within the given time limit `M`, but it does not consider the fact that Polycarp can earn extra points by completing all subtasks of a task. 

The line `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1)` only considers the subtasks of one task, and does not take into account the possibility of completing multiple tasks.

Additionally, the line `print(sum((dp[i][M] for i in range(k + 1))) + sum((1 for i in range(k + 1) if dp[i][M] == i)))` tries to calculate the total points by summing up the points from each subtask and adding 1 for each task that is completed. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not consider the fact that Polycarp can earn points by completing subtasks from multiple tasks.

A correct approach would be to use a more complex dynamic programming algorithm that considers all possible combinations of tasks and subtasks, and calculates the maximum points that can be earned within the given time limit. 

For example, if we have `n = 2`, `k = 2`, `M = 5`, and `t = [1, 4]`, the program will output `3`, but the correct output should be `4` because Polycarp can complete the first subtask of both tasks (earning 2 points) and then complete the second subtask of one task (earning 2 points).
