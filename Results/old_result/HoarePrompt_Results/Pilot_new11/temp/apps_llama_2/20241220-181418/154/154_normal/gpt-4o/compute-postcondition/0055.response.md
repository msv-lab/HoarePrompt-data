According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `complete_tasks` and `n`. If `complete_tasks` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer and `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is an integer and `1 <= k <= 45`, `M` is an integer and `0 <= M <= 2*10^9`, `t` is a list of `k` integers where `1 <= t_j <= 1000000` for all `j`, `total_time_per_task` is an integer and `k <= total_time_per_task <= k * 1000000`, `subtasks_solved` is the minimum of its previous value and `(n - complete_tasks) * k`, `remaining_time` is `M - (complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) - (total time used to solve subtasks)`, `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `time_used` is equal to `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `complete_tasks` is the current task number, and `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `complete_tasks * (k + 1) + subtasks_solved`. 

For the loop to execute again, `complete_tasks` must be increased by 1. Also, `subtasks_solved` must be updated based on the new value of `complete_tasks`, `points` must be updated based on the new value of `complete_tasks`, `time_used` must be updated based on the new value of `complete_tasks`, and `max_points` must be updated based on the new value of `complete_tasks` and `subtasks_solved`. The remaining states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer and `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is an integer and `1 <= k <= 45`, `M` is an integer and `0 <= M <= 2*10^9`, `t` is a list of `k` integers where `1 <= t_j <= 1000000` for all `j`, `total_time_per_task` is an integer and `k <= total_time_per_task <= k * 1000000`, `subtasks_solved` is the minimum of its previous value and `(n - (complete_tasks + 1)) * k`, `remaining_time` is `M - ((complete_tasks + 1) * total_time_per_task) - (total time used to solve subtasks)`, `points` is equal to `(complete_tasks + 1) * (k + 1)`, `time_used` is equal to `(complete_tasks + 1) * total_time_per_task`, `complete_tasks` is increased by 1, and `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `(complete_tasks + 1) * (k + 1) + subtasks_solved`**
