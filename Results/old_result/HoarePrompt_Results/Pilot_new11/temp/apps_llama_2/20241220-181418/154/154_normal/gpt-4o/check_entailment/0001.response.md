Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the way it attempts to solve the subtasks with the remaining time after completing some tasks. The program simply tries to solve as many subtasks as possible with the remaining time, without considering the optimal order of subtasks.

One potential case where the program fails is when there are multiple tasks, each with a mix of short and long subtasks. In such a case, the program might not choose the optimal set of subtasks to solve with the remaining time, leading to a suboptimal solution.

For example, consider the input:

5 5 20
1 2 4 8 16

In this case, the program might choose to complete some tasks and then solve some subtasks with the remaining time. However, it might not choose the optimal combination of tasks and subtasks to solve, leading to a suboptimal solution.

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to consider all possible combinations of tasks and subtasks, and choose the combination that maximizes the total points earned. This can be achieved by using a more complex algorithm, such as dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm with a more sophisticated strategy for choosing the next subtask to solve.

One possible solution is to use a 2D array to store the maximum points that can be earned with a given amount of time and a given number of tasks. The program can then fill in this array using dynamic programming, considering all possible combinations of tasks and subtasks.

Here is a high-level outline of the corrected algorithm:

1. Initialize a 2D array `dp` with dimensions `(M + 1) x (n + 1)`, where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum points that can be earned with `i` minutes of time and `j` tasks.
2. Fill in the `dp` array using dynamic programming, considering all possible combinations of tasks and subtasks.
3. The final answer is stored in `dp[M][n]`.

Here is a sample code to demonstrate this approach:
```python
def func_1(n, k, M, t):
    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(M + 1)]
    for i in range(M + 1):
        for j in range(n + 1):
            for complete_tasks in range(min(j, i // sum(t)) + 1):
                time_used = complete_tasks * sum(t)
                if time_used > i:
                    break
                points = complete_tasks * (k + 1)
                remaining_time = i - time_used
                subtasks_solved = 0
                for subtask_time in sorted(t):
                    if remaining_time >= subtask_time:
                        max_subtasks_for_this_task = remaining_time // subtask_time
                        subtasks_solved += max_subtasks_for_this_task
                        remaining_time -= max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time
                subtasks_solved = min(subtasks_solved, (n - complete_tasks) * k)
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], points + subtasks_solved)
    return dp[M][n]
```
This corrected algorithm should work correctly for all potential cases, considering all possible combinations of tasks and subtasks to maximize the total points earned.
