The code `t.sort()` sorts the list `t` in-place, meaning it modifies the original list. 

Given the initial state, we know that `t` is a list of input integers. After sorting, the list `t` will be in ascending order.

The values of `n`, `k`, `M`, and `t_j` are not affected by the sorting operation.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 45, `k` is an input integer such that 1 <= k <= 45, `M` is an input integer such that 0 <= M <= 2 * 10^9, `t_j` are integers such that 1 <= t_j <= 1000000 for 1 <= j <= k, and `t` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order.**
