Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer and `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is an integer and `1 <= k <= 45`, `M` is an integer and `0 <= M <= 2*10^9`, `t` is a list of `k` integers where `1 <= t_j <= 1000000` for all `j`, `total_time_per_task` is an integer and `k <= total_time_per_task <= k * 1000000`, if `time_used` is greater than `M`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement with `max_points` as `0`, `complete_tasks` as `0`, and the given `time_used`. Otherwise, the execution continues with the given `n`, `k`, `M`, `t`, `total_time_per_task`, `max_points`, `complete_tasks`, and `time_used`.***
