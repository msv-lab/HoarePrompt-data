Postcondition: **`n` is an integer and `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is an integer and `1 <= k <= 45`, `M` is an integer and `0 <= M <= 2*10^9`, `t` is a list of `k` integers where `1 <= t_j <= 1000000` for all `j` and `t` must have at least 1 subtask time, `total_time_per_task` is an integer and `k <= total_time_per_task <= k * 1000000`, `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`. If `remaining_time >= subtask_time`, then `subtasks_solved` is the new `remaining_time // subtask_time` and `remaining_time` is the remainder of the old `M - time_used` divided by `subtask_time`, and `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is the new `remaining_time // subtask_time`. If `remaining_time < subtask_time`, then the state remains unchanged as there is no else part.**
