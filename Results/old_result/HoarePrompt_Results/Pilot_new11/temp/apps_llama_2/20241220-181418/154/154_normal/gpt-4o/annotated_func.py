#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, k, and M are integers, 1 <= n <= 45, 1 <= k <= 45, 0 <= M <= 2*10^9, and t is a list of k integers where 1 <= t_j <= 1000000 for all j.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer and `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is an integer and `1 <= k <= 45`, `M` is an integer and `0 <= M <= 2*10^9`, `t` is a list of `k` integers where `1 <= t_j <= 1000000` for all `j`, `total_time_per_task` is an integer and `k <= total_time_per_task <= k * 1000000`, and `max_points` is the maximum value of `points + subtasks_solved` for all iterations, or 0 if the loop does not execute.
    return max_points
    #The program returns max_points, which is the maximum value of points + subtasks_solved for all iterations, or 0 if the loop does not execute, where the initial state is constrained by the given conditions: `n` is an integer between 1 and 45, `k` is an integer between 1 and 45, `M` is an integer between 0 and 2*10^9, `t` is a list of `k` integers where each integer is between 1 and 1000000, and `total_time_per_task` is an integer between `k` and `k * 1000000`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the maximum points that can be achieved by completing tasks and subtasks within a given time limit M. It takes into account the number of tasks n, the number of subtasks k per task, and the time required for each subtask t. The function iterates over all possible numbers of complete tasks, calculates the points achieved by completing these tasks and the remaining subtasks that can be solved within the remaining time, and returns the maximum points achievable. The function considers all possible edge cases, including when no tasks can be completed within the given time limit, and returns 0 in such cases. It also ensures that the number of subtasks solved does not exceed the number of remaining tasks multiplied by the number of subtasks per task. The function operates within the given constraints: 1 <= n <= 45, 1 <= k <= 45, 0 <= M <= 2*10^9, and 1 <= t_j <= 1000000 for all j.
