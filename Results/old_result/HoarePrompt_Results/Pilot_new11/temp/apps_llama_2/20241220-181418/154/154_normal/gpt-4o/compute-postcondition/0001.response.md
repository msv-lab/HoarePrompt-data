The code introduces a new variable `max_points` and assigns it the value `0`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

The value of `n` is still an integer and `1 <= n <= 45`, 
the value of `k` is still an integer and `1 <= k <= 45`, 
the value of `M` is still an integer and `0 <= M <= 2*10^9`, 
the value of `t` is still a list of `k` integers where `1 <= t_j <= 1000000` for all `j`, 
and the value of `total_time_per_task` is still an integer and `k <= total_time_per_task <= k * 1000000`.

The new variable `max_points` is an integer and equals `0`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer and `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is an integer and `1 <= k <= 45`, `M` is an integer and `0 <= M <= 2*10^9`, `t` is a list of `k` integers where `1 <= t_j <= 1000000` for all `j`, `total_time_per_task` is an integer and `k <= total_time_per_task <= k * 1000000`, and `max_points` is an integer and equals `0`**
