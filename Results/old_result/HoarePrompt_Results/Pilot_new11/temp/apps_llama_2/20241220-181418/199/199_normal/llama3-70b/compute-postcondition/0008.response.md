Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer that must be at least 3, `a` is 1, `b` is 2. If `a` is not equal to `b` and 2 times the sum of `a` and `b` equals `n`, then if `n` equals 6, `ways` is 2, otherwise `ways` is 1. If the condition is not met, the state remains the same as the initial state: if `n` equals 6, then `ways` is 1, otherwise `ways` is 0.***
