Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 6, `a` is 1, `b` is 1. If `rem` (which is `n - 4`) is an even number greater than 0 and `a` is not equal to half of the current value of `rem`, then `count` is 1. If `rem` is an even number greater than 0 and `a` is equal to half of the current value of `rem`, or if `rem` is not an even number greater than 0, then the values of `n`, `count`, `a`, `b`, and `rem` remain unchanged from their initial values, with `count` remaining 0.**
