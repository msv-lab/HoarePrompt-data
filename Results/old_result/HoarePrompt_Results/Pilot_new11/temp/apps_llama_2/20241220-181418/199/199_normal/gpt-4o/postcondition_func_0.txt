The function accepts a positive integer parameter `n` and returns either 0 if `n` is less than 6, or the number of valid combinations where `n - 4a` is positive, even, and not equal to `2a`, for `a` in the range from 1 to `n // 4`, where `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 6. The function considers all potential edge cases, including the case where `n` is less than 6, in which case it returns 0, and the case where `n` is greater than or equal to 6, in which case it returns the count of valid combinations. The function does not modify the input parameter `n` and only returns a count of valid combinations or 0, depending on the input value of `n`.
