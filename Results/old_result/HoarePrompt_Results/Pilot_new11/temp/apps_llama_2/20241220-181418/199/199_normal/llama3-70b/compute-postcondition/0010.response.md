The code increments the value of `ways` by 1. The initial value of `ways` is 2 if `n` equals 6, otherwise it is 1. 

So, if `n` equals 6, `ways` becomes 3, otherwise `ways` becomes 2. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer that must be at least 3, `a` is 1, `b` is 3, if `n` equals 6, `ways` is 3, otherwise `ways` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer that must be at least 3, `a` is 1, `b` is 3, if `n` equals 6, `ways` is 3, otherwise `ways` is 2**
