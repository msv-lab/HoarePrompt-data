The code calculates the remainder `rem` by subtracting twice the sum of `a` and `b` from `n`. Given that `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 6, `count` is 0, `a` is 1, and `b` is 1, we can substitute these values into the equation.

`rem = n - 2 * (a + b)`
`rem = n - 2 * (1 + 1)`
`rem = n - 2 * 2`
`rem = n - 4`

Since `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 6, the value of `rem` will be `n - 4`, which will be greater than or equal to 2.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 6, `count` is 0, `a` is 1, `b` is 1, and `rem` is `n - 4`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 6, `count` is 0, `a` is 1, `b` is 1, and `rem` is `n - 4`.**
