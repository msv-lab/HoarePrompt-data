Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is designed to count the number of ways a stick of length `n` can be split into four parts such that it's possible to form a rectangle using these parts, but impossible to form a square. The program iterates over all possible pairs of lengths `(a, b)` where `a <= b` and checks if the condition `2 * (a + b) == n` is met, which ensures that the lengths can be rearranged to form a rectangle. Additionally, the condition `a!= b` ensures that it's impossible to form a square.

The program correctly counts the number of such ways and handles all possible cases. The loops iterate over all possible values of `a` and `b` that satisfy the conditions, and the `if` statement ensures that only valid combinations are counted.

The program also handles edge cases correctly. For example, when `n` is odd, the program will not count any ways, which is correct because it's impossible to split an odd-length stick into four parts that form a rectangle. When `n` is even, the program will count the correct number of ways, as demonstrated by the provided examples.

Overall, the program is correct and will produce the expected output for all possible inputs.
