The code `ways += 1` increments the value of `ways` by 1. Initially, if `n` equals 6, then `ways` is 1, otherwise `ways` is 0. 

After the increment, if `n` equals 6, then `ways` becomes 1 + 1 = 2, otherwise `ways` becomes 0 + 1 = 1.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer that must be at least 3, `a` is 1, `b` is 2, if `n` equals 6, then `ways` is 2, otherwise `ways` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer that must be at least 3, `a` is 1, `b` is 2, if `n` equals 6, then `ways` is 2, otherwise `ways` is 1**
