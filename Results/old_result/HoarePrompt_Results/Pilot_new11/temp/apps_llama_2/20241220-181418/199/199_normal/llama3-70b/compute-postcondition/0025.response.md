According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a` and `n`. If `a` is less than `n // 2 + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `b` is `(n - 2) // 2 + 1`, and `ways` is the total number of distinct `b` values in the given ranges. For the loop to execute again, `a` must be increased by 1. So, `a` becomes 3. 
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is 3, `b` is `(n - 3) // 2 + 1`, and `ways` is the total number of distinct `b` values in the range from 1 to `(n - 1) // 2` where `2 * (1 + b) == n` and `b!= 1`, plus the number of `b` values in the range from 2 to `(n - 3) // 2 + 1` where `2 * (3 + b) == n` and `3!= b`.**
