To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given `for` loop statement and the initial state.

Given loop:
```python
for b in range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `a` is 3.
- `b` is `(n - 3) // 2 + 1`.
- `ways` is the total number of distinct `b` values in two specific ranges with certain conditions.

To execute the loop, we need `n` to be such that `(n - a) // 2 + 1` is greater than `a` because the `range` function in Python generates numbers up to but not including the stop value. Given `a` is 3, we need `(n - 3) // 2 + 1 > 3` for the loop to have at least one iteration.

Solving the inequality `(n - 3) // 2 + 1 > 3`:
- `(n - 3) // 2 > 2`
- `n - 3 > 4` (since we're dealing with integers and the division is integer division)
- `n > 7`

So, `n` must be greater than 7 for the loop to execute.

At the start of the loop, `b` will be equal to `a` (which is 3), because the `range` function starts from the first argument.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 7, `a` is 3, `b` is 3, `ways` is the total number of distinct `b` values in the specified ranges and conditions**
