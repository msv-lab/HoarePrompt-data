According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 2 (since the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n // 2 + 1`), the loop can execute at least once. Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer and `ways` is 0. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2, and `a` must be initialized to the start of the range, which is 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer that must be at least 2, `ways` is 0, `a` is 1**
