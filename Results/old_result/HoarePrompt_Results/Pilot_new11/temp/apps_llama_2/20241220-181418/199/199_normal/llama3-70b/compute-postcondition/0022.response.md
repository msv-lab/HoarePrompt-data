The value of `ways` is incremented by 1. The initial state mentions that if `a` is not equal to `b` and 2 times the sum of `a` and `b` equals `n`, then `ways` is increased by 1. However, this condition is not directly affected by the given code. The given code simply increments `ways` by 1.

Given `a` is 2, `b` is 4, and `n` is a positive integer greater than 4, we can check if the condition 2 * (`a` + `b`) equals `n` is met. Since `a` is 2 and `b` is 4, 2 * (`a` + `b`) equals 2 * (2 + 4) equals 2 * 6 equals 12. For `n` to be equal to 12, `n` must be 12, which satisfies the condition that `n` is greater than 4. However, the code `ways += 1` increments `ways` regardless of the condition.

Since `a` is not equal to `b` (2 is not equal to 4), and if we consider the case where `n` equals 12 (which meets the 2 * (`a` + `b`) equals `n` condition), `ways` would have been increased by 1 initially due to the condition being met, and then again by the code `ways += 1`.

Thus, if we initially consider `n` to be 12 (to meet the specific condition related to `a`, `b`, and `n`), `a` is 2, `b` is 4, and assuming `ways` was initially 1 due to the condition being met (since 2 * (`a` + `b`) equals `n` and `a` is not equal to `b`), then after executing `ways += 1`, `ways` becomes 2.

However, since the problem statement does not explicitly set `n` to 12 or any other value, but rather gives a condition involving `n`, `a`, and `b`, and `ways` is incremented by 1 regardless of the condition, we consider the general case where `n` is any positive integer greater than 4, `a` is 2, `b` is 4, and if the condition involving `a`, `b`, and `n` is met, `ways` would be increased accordingly before the code `ways += 1` is executed.

The states of `n`, `a`, and `b` are not changed by the code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 4, `a` is 2, `b` is 4, and `ways` is increased by 1 from its previous state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 4, `a` is 2, `b` is 4, and if `a` is not equal to `b` and 2 times the sum of `a` and `b` equals `n`, then `ways` was increased by 1 before, and `ways` is now increased by 1**
