To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration: 
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `a` is 1.
- `ways` equals the number of distinct `b` values in the range from 1 to `(n - 1) // 2` where `2 * (1 + b) == n` and `b!= 1`.

The loop statement is: `for a in range(1, n // 2 + 1):`

For the loop to execute again, `a` needs to be incremented by 1, since the loop iterates over a range of values. Thus, at the start of the next iteration, `a` should be 2.

The conditions and values of `n` and `ways` do not directly affect the iteration process in terms of whether the loop will execute again, but they are part of the program state. The value of `n` remains the same since it's not modified by the loop counter directly, and `ways` would be recalculated based on the new value of `a` if it's used within the loop body (which is not shown).

Therefore, considering the increment of `a` for the next iteration:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is 2, `ways` equals the number of distinct `b` values in the range from 1 to `(n - 1) // 2` where `2 * (1 + b) == n` and `b!= 1`**
