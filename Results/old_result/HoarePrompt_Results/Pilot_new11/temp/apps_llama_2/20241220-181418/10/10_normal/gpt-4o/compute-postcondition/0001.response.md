The code assigns the values of `n` and `m` from the input, where the input is a string of two space-separated integers. `n` and `m` are now input integers. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`d` is an input integer between 1 and 10^5, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are integers greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `n` and `m` respectively, `cntl`, `cntr`, `cntt`, `cntb` are integers greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to `d` - 1, and all the given constraints about the sofas and cells are still valid**
