The code reads new input values for `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`. The previous values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are replaced by these new input integer values. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. The new values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are input integers.

The list `sofas` still contains one tuple element, but its values are now the new input values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`.

Output State: **`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `x1` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer, `x2` is an input integer, `y2` is an input integer, `cntl`, `cntr`, `cntt`, `cntb` are integers greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to `d` - 1, `sofas` is a list containing one tuple element: `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`**
