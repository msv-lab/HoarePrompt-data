Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly calculate the number of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of each sofa. 

The issue lies in the conditions used to increment the left, right, top, and bottom counts. The current conditions only check if one sofa is completely to the left, right, top, or bottom of another sofa, without considering the case where two sofas overlap in the x or y direction but not completely.

For example, if we have two sofas (x1, y1, x2, y2) and (x1_j, y1_j, x2_j, y2_j) where x1 < x1_j < x2 and y1 = y1_j = y2_j = y2, the current code will not count (x1_j, y1_j, x2_j, y2_j) as being to the right of (x1, y1, x2, y2), which is incorrect.

A correct implementation would need to check if any part of one sofa is to the left, right, top, or bottom of another sofa, not just if one sofa is completely to the left, right, top, or bottom of the other. 

Here is a modified version of the code that should work correctly:

```python
def func():
    d = int(input().strip())
    (n, m) = map(int, input().strip().split())
    sofas = []
    for _ in range(d):
        (x1, y1, x2, y2) = map(int, input().strip().split())
        sofas.append((min(x1, x2), min(y1, y2), max(x1, x2), max(y1, y2)))
    (cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b) = map(int, input().strip().split())
    left_count = [0] * d
    right_count = [0] * d
    top_count = [0] * d
    bottom_count = [0] * d
    for i in range(d):
        (x1, y1, x2, y2) = sofas[i]
        for j in range(d):
            if i == j:
                continue
            (x1_j, y1_j, x2_j, y2_j) = sofas[j]
            if x1_j > x2:
                right_count[i] += 1
            if x2_j < x1:
                left_count[i] += 1
            if y1_j > y2:
                bottom_count[i] += 1
            if y2_j < y1:
                top_count[i] += 1
    target_sofa = -1
    for i in range(d):
        if left_count[i] == cnt_l and right_count[i] == cnt_r and (top_count[i] == cnt_t) and (bottom_count[i] == cnt_b):
            target_sofa = i + 1
            break
    print(target_sofa)
```
