The value of `right_count[i]` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `right_count[i]` is unknown. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `j` is at most `d-1`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the coordinates of the sofa at index `j` in the `sofas` list, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the coordinates of the sofa at index `j+1` in the `sofas` list, `cntl`, `cntr`, `cntt`, `cntb` are input integers, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuple elements, `right_count[i]` is incremented by 1, and if `i` equals `j`, the program proceeds to the next iteration of the loop**
