The values of `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are updated to the corresponding elements of the tuple at index `j` in the list `sofas`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Since `j` is 1, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned the values of the second tuple element in the list `sofas`.

Output State: **`d` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^5, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `x1` is the first coordinate of the first input, `y1` is the second coordinate of the first input, `x2` is the third coordinate of the first input, `y2` is the fourth coordinate of the first input, `cntl` is the first input integer, `cntr` is the second input integer, `cntt` is the third input integer, `cntb` is the fourth input integer, `sofas` is a list containing at least one tuple element, each representing the input coordinates from each iteration, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `x1_j` is the first coordinate of the second input, `y1_j` is the second coordinate of the second input, `x2_j` is the third coordinate of the second input, `y2_j` is the fourth coordinate of the second input, `top_count`, `left_count`, `right_count`, `bottom_count` may be updated**
