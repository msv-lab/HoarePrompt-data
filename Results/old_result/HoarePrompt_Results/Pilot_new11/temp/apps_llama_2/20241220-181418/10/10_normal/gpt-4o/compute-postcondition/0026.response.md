The code `right_count[i] += 1` increments the value of `right_count` at index `i` by 1. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, so `right_count[0]` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `right_count[0]` is 0, so the new value of `right_count[0]` is 1.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: 
`d` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^5, 
`n` is an input integer, 
`m` is an input integer, 
`x1` is the first coordinate of the first input, 
`y1` is the second coordinate of the first input, 
`x2` is the third coordinate of the first input, 
`y2` is the fourth coordinate of the first input, 
`cntl` is the first input integer, 
`cntr` is the second input integer, 
`cntt` is the third input integer, 
`cntb` is the fourth input integer, 
`sofas` is a list containing at least one tuple element, each representing the input coordinates from each iteration, 
`left_count` is a list of at least one zero, 
`right_count` is a list where the first element is 1 and the rest are zeros, 
`top_count` is a list of at least one zero, 
`bottom_count` is a list of at least one zero, 
`i` is 0, 
`j` is 0, 
`x1_j` is `x1_0`, 
`y1_j` is `y1_0`, 
`x2_j` is `x2_0`, 
`y2_j` is `y2_0`, 
and the current values of `x1` and `x2` are both less than the current value of `x1_j`.
