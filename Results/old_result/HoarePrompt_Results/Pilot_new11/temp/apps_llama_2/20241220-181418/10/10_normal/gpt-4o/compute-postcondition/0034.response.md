Postcondition: **`d` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^5, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `x1` is the first coordinate of the first input, `y1` is the second coordinate of the first input, `x2` is the third coordinate of the first input, `y2` is the fourth coordinate of the first input, `cntl` is the first input integer, `cntr` is the second input integer, `cntt` is the third input integer, `cntb` is the fourth input integer, `sofas` is a list containing at least one tuple element, each representing the input coordinates from each iteration, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, initially `x1_j` was `x1_0`, `y1_j` was `y1_0`, `x2_j` was `x2_0`, `y2_j` was `y2_0`, if `x1` is greater than the current value of `x2_j` and `x2` is greater than the current value of `x2_j`, then the current values of `x1` and `x2` are updated based on the condition, and if `x1` is less than the initial `x1_j` and `x2` is less than the initial `x1_j`, then `left_count` is a list where the first element is the initial first element of `left_count` plus 1 and the rest are the same as the initial `left_count`, and `right_count` is a list where the first element is 1 and the rest are zeros, otherwise `left_count[0]` is the initial `left_count[0]` plus 1 and `right_count` retains its original values, `top_count` is a list of at least one zero, if `y1` and `y2` are both less than the initial value of `y1_j`, then `bottom_count` is a list where the first element is the initial `bottom_count[0]` plus 1 and the rest are the same as the initial `bottom_count`, otherwise `bottom_count` retains its original values, and the variables retain their original values if none of the conditions are met, the current value of `y1` is greater than the current value of `y2_j` and the current value of `y2` is greater than the current value of `y2_j`.**
