The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code in the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration in the loop. Since there's no loop provided in the initial state, we assume it's part of a larger loop structure that is not shown. 

Given this, the variables and their states remain unchanged because `continue` does not modify any variable values; it merely controls the flow of the program.

Output State: **`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `j` is at most `d-1`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the coordinates of the sofa at index `j+1` in the `sofas` list, `cntl`, `cntr`, `cntt`, `cntb` are input integers, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuple elements, and we proceed to the next iteration of the loop.**
