Postcondition: **`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the coordinates of the sofa at index 1 in the `sofas` list, `cntl` is the first input integer, `cntr` is the second input integer, `cntt` is the third input integer, `cntb` is the fourth input integer, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuple elements, `left_count` is a list where each element is the number of sofas to the right of the corresponding sofa, `right_count` is a list where each element is the number of sofas to the left of the corresponding sofa, `top_count` is a list where each element is the number of sofas below the corresponding sofa, `bottom_count` is a list where each element is the number of sofas above the corresponding sofa, initially `i` is 1 and `j` is 0, but currently `i` equals `j`, meaning both `i` and `j` are equal to 1 or another value that makes the condition true, however since `j` is initially 0, for `i` to be equal to `j`, both must be 0 or `j` must have been changed to 1, given the if condition `i` must have been changed to 0.**
