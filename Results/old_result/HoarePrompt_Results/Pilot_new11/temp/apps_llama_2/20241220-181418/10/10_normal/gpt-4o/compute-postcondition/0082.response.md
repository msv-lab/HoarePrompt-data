The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration only and moves on to the next iteration. 

The values of the variables do not change but we move to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. 

Output State: **`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `x1` is the first coordinate of the third sofa, `y1` is the second coordinate of the third sofa, `x2` is the third coordinate of the third sofa, `y2` is the fourth coordinate of the third sofa, `cntl` is the first input integer, `cntr` is the second input integer, `cntt` is the third input integer, `cntb` is the fourth input integer, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuple elements, `left_count` may be updated, `top_count` may be updated, `bottom_count` may be updated, `x1_j` is the first coordinate of the next sofa, `y1_j` is the second coordinate of the next sofa, `x2_j` is the third coordinate of the next sofa, `y2_j` is the fourth coordinate of the next sofa, `j` is at the next iteration and we move to the next iteration of the loop.**
