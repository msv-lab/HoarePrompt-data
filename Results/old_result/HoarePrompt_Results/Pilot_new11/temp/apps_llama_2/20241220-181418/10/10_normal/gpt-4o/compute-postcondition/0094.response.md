The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. Since there's no loop provided in the given code snippet, we assume it's part of a larger loop structure. The `continue` statement itself does not modify any variable values; it merely controls the flow of the program.

Given the Initial State:
- `d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5
- `n` is an input integer
- `m` is an input integer
- `x1` is the first coordinate of the third sofa
- `y1` is the second coordinate of the third sofa
- `x2` is the third coordinate of the third sofa
- `y2` is the fourth coordinate of the third sofa
- `cntl` is the first input integer
- `cntr` is the second input integer
- `cntt` is the third input integer
- `cntb` is the fourth input integer
- `sofas` is a list of `d` tuple elements
- `j` is the next index in the sofas list

The `continue` statement doesn't alter the values of any variables. It simply moves the control to the next iteration of the loop, if any.

Output State: **`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `x1` is the first coordinate of the third sofa, `y1` is the second coordinate of the third sofa, `x2` is the third coordinate of the third sofa, `y2` is the fourth coordinate of the third sofa, `cntl` is the first input integer, `cntr` is the second input integer, `cntt` is the third input integer, `cntb` is the fourth input integer, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuple elements, `j` is the next index in the sofas list, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
