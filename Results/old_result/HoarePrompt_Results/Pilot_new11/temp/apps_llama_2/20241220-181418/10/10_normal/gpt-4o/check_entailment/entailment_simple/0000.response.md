Correctness: **False**

The program does not accurately follow the problem description. The issue lies in the way it counts the sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of a given sofa.

In the problem description, a sofa A is considered to be to the left of sofa B if there exist two cells a and b such that a is covered by sofa A, b is covered by sofa B, and the x-coordinate of a is less than the x-coordinate of b. However, in the provided program, the condition for counting a sofa to the left is `x1 < x1_j and x2 < x1_j`, which means both x1 and x2 of sofa i must be less than x1 of sofa j. This is not the correct interpretation of the problem description.

Similarly, the conditions for counting sofas to the right, top, and bottom are also incorrect. The program uses `x1 > x2_j and x2 > x2_j` for counting a sofa to the left, `y1 < y1_j and y2 < y1_j` for counting a sofa to the bottom, and `y1 > y2_j and y2 > y2_j` for counting a sofa to the top. These conditions do not accurately represent the problem description.

To fix this issue, the program should be modified to correctly implement the conditions for counting sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom based on the problem description. For example, to count a sofa to the left, the program should check if the x-coordinate of any cell covered by sofa i is less than the x-coordinate of any cell covered by sofa j.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    d = int(input().strip())
    n, m = map(int, input().strip().split())
    sofas = []
    for _ in range(d):
        x1, y1, x2, y2 = map(int, input().strip().split())
        sofas.append((min(x1, x2), min(y1, y2), max(x1, x2), max(y1, y2)))

    cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b = map(int, input().strip().split())
    left_count = [0] * d
    right_count = [0] * d
    top_count = [0] * d
    bottom_count = [0] * d
    for i in range(d):
        x1, y1, x2, y2 = sofas[i]
        for j in range(d):
            if i == j:
                continue
            x1_j, y1_j, x2_j, y2_j = sofas[j]
            if (x1 < x2_j and x1_j > x1) or (x2 < x2_j and x1_j > x2):
                right_count[i] += 1
            if (x1_j < x2 and x1 > x1_j) or (x1_j < x1 and x2 > x1_j):
                left_count[i] += 1
            if (y1 < y2_j and y1_j > y1) or (y2 < y2_j and y1_j > y2):
                bottom_count[i] += 1
            if (y1_j < y2 and y1 > y1_j) or (y1_j < y1 and y2 > y1_j):
                top_count[i] += 1

    target_sofa = -1
    for i in range(d):
        if left_count[i] == cnt_l and right_count[i] == cnt_r and top_count[i] == cnt_t and bottom_count[i] == cnt_b:
            target_sofa = i + 1
            break

    print(target_sofa)
