The given code snippet is `print(max_erase)`. This statement prints the value of `max_erase` but does not change the values of any variables. 

The value of `max_erase` is the maximum gap between any two consecutive numbers in the sequence starting from `n` and considering elements in `a[1:]`. The values of `n`, `a`, `i` are not changed by this code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers where `a[0]` equals the original value of `n` and `a[1:]` holds the array elements `a_i` where 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^3, `max_erase` is the maximum gap between any two consecutive numbers in the sequence starting from `n` and considering elements in `a[1:]`, `i` is `n-1`, and `max_erase` has been returned at the output.**
