According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute at least once. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers where `a[0]` equals `n` and `a[1:]` holds the array elements `a_i` where 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^3, and `max_erase` is 0. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2, because the loop starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`. Therefore, `i` must be 1 at the start of the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer and must be at least 2, `a` is a list of integers where `a[0]` equals `n` and `a[1:]` holds the array elements `a_i` where 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^3, `max_erase` is 0, `i` is 1**
