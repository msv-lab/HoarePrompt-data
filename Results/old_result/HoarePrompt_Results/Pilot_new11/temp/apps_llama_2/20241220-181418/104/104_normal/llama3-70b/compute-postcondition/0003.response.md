According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `n` is already given to be between 1 and 100 (inclusive), it satisfies this condition. Additionally, `i` needs to be initialized to 0 for the loop to start executing.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= `a_1` < `a_2` <... < `a_n` <= 10^3, `max_erase` is 0, `i` is 0**
