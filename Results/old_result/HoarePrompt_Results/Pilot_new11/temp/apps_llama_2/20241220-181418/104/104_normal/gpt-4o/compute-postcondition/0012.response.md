Functionality: **The function calculates and prints the maximum gap between any two consecutive numbers in a given sequence of integers. It accepts input from the user, where the first input is the number of elements (n) and the second input is a list of integers (a_i) representing the sequence. The function assumes the input sequence is valid, with 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a_1 < a_2 <... < a_n <= 10^3. However, it does not perform any error checking on the input, so it does not handle potential edge cases such as invalid or out-of-range input values. After execution, the program state includes the printed maximum gap between any two consecutive numbers in the sequence, but the original input sequence and variables (n, a, max_erase) are not returned or preserved. The function has no explicit return value, as it prints the result directly to the console.**
