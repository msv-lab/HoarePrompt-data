Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_1 < a_2 < \ldots < a_n \leq 10^3\), `max_erase` is the length of the longest consecutive subsequence in `a` minus one, the current value of `i` is `n-1`, and the current value of `j` is `n`. Additionally, the elements in the list `a` from index `i` to `j-1` form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 1, meaning that for all `k` in the range from `i` to `j-1`, the difference between `a[k]` and `a[i]` is equal to `k - i`.**
