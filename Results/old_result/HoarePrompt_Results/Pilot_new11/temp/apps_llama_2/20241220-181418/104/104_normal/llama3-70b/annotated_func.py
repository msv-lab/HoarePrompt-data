#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no explicit arguments, but it is implied that it will read from standard input, where the first line is a single integer n (1 <= n <= 100) and the second line contains n integers a_i (1 <= a_1 < a_2 <... < a_n <= 10^3).
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max_erase = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
            if all(a[k] - a[i] == k - i for k in range(i, j)):
                max_erase = max(max_erase, j - i - 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_1 < a_2 < \ldots < a_n \leq 10^3\), `max_erase` is the length of the longest consecutive subsequence in `a` minus one.
    print(max_erase)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two lines from standard input, where the first line contains a single integer `n` and the second line contains `n` integers. It then calculates and prints the length of the longest consecutive arithmetic subsequence in the input list minus one, effectively determining the maximum number of elements that can be removed from the list while maintaining an arithmetic sequence. The function handles lists of up to 100 integers, with each integer between 1 and 10^3. If the input list is not already sorted or does not contain unique integers, the function still processes it as is, but the result may not be meaningful unless the input list is sorted and contains unique integers. The function does not perform any error checking on the input values, so it assumes that the input will be a positive integer `n` followed by `n` integers. After the function executes, the program state is such that the maximum number of removable elements from the longest consecutive arithmetic subsequence has been printed to standard output, and no changes have been made to the input list or any other external state.
