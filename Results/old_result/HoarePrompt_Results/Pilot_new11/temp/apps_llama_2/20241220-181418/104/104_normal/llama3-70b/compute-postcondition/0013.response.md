Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= `a_1` < `a_2` <... < `a_n` <= 10^3, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, and `n` is greater than or equal to 3. If the difference between consecutive elements in the list `a` from index `i` to `j` is constant (i.e., `a[k] - a[i] == k - i` for all `k` in range `i` to `j`), then `max_erase` is the maximum of its previous value and 2.***
