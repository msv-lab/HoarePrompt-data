The code `max_erase = max(max_erase, j - i - 1)` calculates the maximum of the current `max_erase` value and the difference between `j` and `i` minus 1, and assigns this maximum value back to `max_erase`. 

Given the initial state: 
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive),
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= `a_1` < `a_2` <... < `a_n` <= 10^3,
- `i` is 0,
- `j` is 3,
- and `n` is greater than or equal to 3,

The value of `j - i - 1` is `3 - 0 - 1 = 2`. 

However, the initial value of `max_erase` is not specified. Since we do not know the initial value of `max_erase`, we can only express the new value of `max_erase` as the maximum of its previous value and 2.

Therefore, after running the code, `max_erase` is the maximum of its previous value and 2. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= `a_1` < `a_2` <... < `a_n` <= 10^3, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, and `max_erase` is the maximum of its previous value and 2.**
