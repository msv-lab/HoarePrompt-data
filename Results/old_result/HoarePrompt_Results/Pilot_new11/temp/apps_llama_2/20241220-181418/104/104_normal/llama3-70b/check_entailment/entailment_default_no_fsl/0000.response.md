Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case. The issue lies in the fact that the program only checks for consecutive arithmetic subsequences, but the problem statement allows for any consecutive elements to be erased, not just those that form an arithmetic sequence. 

For example, if the input is `[1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9]`, the program will correctly output `2`, but this is because it happens to find an arithmetic sequence `[3, 4, 5]` that can be erased. However, the program's approach is not the correct way to solve the problem. 

A correct solution would involve checking for each possible subarray whether it can be erased and the remaining elements can still be restored. The program does not consider this and instead relies on the presence of an arithmetic sequence, which is not a requirement of the problem. 

In the case of the input `[998, 999, 1000]`, the program outputs `2` which seems correct, but this is just a coincidence. The program does not actually check if the erased elements can be restored, it simply checks if the remaining elements form an arithmetic sequence. 

To correctly solve the problem, the program should check all possible subarrays and verify if the remaining elements can still be restored to the original array, considering the constraints that all elements are integers in the range `[1, 10^3]` and the array is increasing. 

The given program does not handle this correctly and therefore its correctness is **False**.
