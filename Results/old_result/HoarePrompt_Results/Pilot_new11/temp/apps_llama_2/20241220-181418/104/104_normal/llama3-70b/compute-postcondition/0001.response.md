The code reads a line from the standard input, splits it into strings using whitespace as a delimiter, maps each string to an integer using the `int` function, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `a`. 

Given the initial state that `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and the second line of the standard input contains `n` integers `a_i` (1 <= `a_1` < `a_2` <... < `a_n` <= 10^3), we can conclude that the list `a` will contain `n` integers `a_i`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= `a_1` < `a_2` <... < `a_n` <= 10^3**
