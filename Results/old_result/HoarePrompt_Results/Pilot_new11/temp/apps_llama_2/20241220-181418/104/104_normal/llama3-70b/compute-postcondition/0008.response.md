According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= `a_1` < `a_2` <... < `a_n` <= 10^3, `max_erase` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `n` is greater than `i`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. So, `j` becomes 2.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= `a_1` < `a_2` <... < `a_n` <= 10^3, `max_erase` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `n` is greater than `i` and `j` must be less than or equal to `n`**
