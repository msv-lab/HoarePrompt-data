The code snippet `x, y = map(int, input().split())` assigns the input integers to `x` and `y`. Since `x` and `y` are initially integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, and new values of `x` and `y` are input, the constraints 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000 may or may not hold for the new values. However, the new values of `x` and `y` are integers.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are input integers**
