According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n // 2 + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is at least 4. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 3, and `n` must be at least 6 (since `i` is now 3, and the loop condition is `i` less than `n // 2 + 1`, implying `3 < n // 2 + 1`, thus `n` must be at least 6 for the loop to continue).
State: **`n` is an input integer that must be at least 6, `i` is 3**
