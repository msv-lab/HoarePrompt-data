To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

Initial State: `n` is 9 less than the next multiple of 10 after the previous iteration's value, `max_9s` is 3.

Given that `n` is 9 less than the next multiple of 10, we can express `n` as `n = 10k - 9` for some integer `k`. However, without knowing the previous iteration's value, we cannot determine the exact value of `n`. 

The operation `n //= 10` performs integer division of `n` by 10, effectively removing the last digit of `n`.

For `n = 10k - 9`, performing `n //= 10` results in `n = k - 0` (since the `-9` would be in the last digit and gets removed), but considering `n` was specifically defined in relation to being 9 less than a multiple of 10, let's re-examine this with a concrete example to understand the pattern.

If we consider `n` being 9 less than the next multiple of 10 after some previous value, for instance, if the previous value led to `n` being 9 (which is 9 less than 10, the next multiple of 10), `n //= 10` would result in `n = 0`. If `n` was 19 (9 less than 20, the next multiple of 10), `n //= 10` would result in `n = 1`. 

However, since `n` is specifically defined as being 9 less than the next multiple of 10 after the previous iteration, and considering the operation `n //= 10`, `n` will essentially be the quotient of the division of its original value by 10, which aligns with moving to the next lower multiple of 10 minus 9, but in a reduced scale.

Given `n`'s definition and operation, we see that `max_9s` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it.

Thus, considering `n`'s transformation and `max_9s` remaining constant:

Output State: **`n` is the result of the integer division of its original value by 10, `max_9s` is 3**.
