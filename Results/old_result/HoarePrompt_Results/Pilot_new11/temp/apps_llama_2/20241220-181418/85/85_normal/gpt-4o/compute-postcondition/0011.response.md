To determine the output state of the loop, let's analyze the given information and the code of the loop. The loop continues as long as `(n + 1)` is a multiple of 10, which means it ends when `(n + 1)` is not a multiple of 10.

The loop increments `max_9s` by 1 and performs integer division of `n` by 10 in each iteration. This essentially removes the last digit of `n` in each iteration.

From the given output states after the loop executes a certain number of times, we can infer the following:

- `max_9s` keeps track of how many times the loop executes, which corresponds to the number of trailing 9s in the original number `n` (since a number ending in 9 becomes a multiple of 10 when incremented by 1).
- `n` is updated by removing its last digit in each iteration.

The loop stops when `(n + 1)` is not a multiple of 10, which means `n` is no longer a number that ends in 9 (or is a number that when incremented by 1 does not result in a multiple of 10).

Given these insights, let's determine the final output state of the loop:

- `max_9s` will be equal to the number of times the loop executes, which is equivalent to the number of trailing 9s in the original number `n`.
- `n` will be the result of removing all the trailing 9s from the original number `n`, which means it will be the integer part of `n` after dividing by 10 as many times as there are trailing 9s.

Therefore, the output state after the loop has finished executing will be that `max_9s` is the count of trailing 9s in the original `n`, and `n` will be the original `n` with all trailing 9s removed.

Output State: **`max_9s` is the number of trailing 9s in the original `n`, `n` is the original `n` with all trailing 9s removed**
