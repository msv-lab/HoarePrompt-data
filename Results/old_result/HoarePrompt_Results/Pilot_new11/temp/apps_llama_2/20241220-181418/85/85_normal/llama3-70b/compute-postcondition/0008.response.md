Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer that must be at least 4, `i` is 2. If `(i + (n - i))` is a multiple of 10 to the power of the number of digits in `(i + (n - i))` minus one, then if `n` is a multiple of 10, `ans` is 2, otherwise, `ans` is 1. If `(i + (n - i))` is not a multiple of 10 to the power of the number of digits in `(i + (n - i))` minus one, then if `n` is a multiple of 10, `ans` is 1, otherwise, `ans` is 0.**
