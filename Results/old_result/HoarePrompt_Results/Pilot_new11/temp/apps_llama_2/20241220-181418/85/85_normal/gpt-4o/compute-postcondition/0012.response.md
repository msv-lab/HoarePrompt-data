The code calculates `pairs` as `(n + 1)` multiplied by `max_9s`. The initial state provides that `max_9s` is the number of trailing 9s in the original `n`, and `n` is the original `n` with all trailing 9s removed. 

Given this, `pairs` will be assigned the value of `(n + 1) * max_9s`, which means it will hold the product of the number of trailing 9s in the original `n` and the value of `n` (with trailing 9s removed) incremented by 1.

Therefore, the Output State is: `max_9s` is the number of trailing 9s in the original `n`, `n` is the original `n` with all trailing 9s removed, `pairs` is equal to `(n + 1) * max_9s`.

Output State: **`max_9s` is the number of trailing 9s in the original `n`, `n` is the original `n` with all trailing 9s removed, `pairs` is equal to `(n + 1) * max_9s`**
