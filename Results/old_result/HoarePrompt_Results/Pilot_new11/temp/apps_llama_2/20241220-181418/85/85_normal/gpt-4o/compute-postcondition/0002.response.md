According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `(n + 1) % 10 == 0`. This condition is true if `n + 1` is a multiple of 10, which means `n` must be one less than a multiple of 10. Right before the loop, `n` is an input integer and `max_9s` is 0. For the loop to execute at least one time, `n` needs to be adjusted to be one less than a multiple of 10.

State: **`n` is one less than a multiple of 10, `max_9s` is 0**
