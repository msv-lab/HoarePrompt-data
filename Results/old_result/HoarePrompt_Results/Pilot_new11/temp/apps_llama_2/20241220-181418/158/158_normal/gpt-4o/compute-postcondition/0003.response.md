To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer.

The code is: `max_lemons = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`

This line of code calculates the minimum value among `a`, half of `b`, and a quarter of `c`, and assigns this minimum value to `max_lemons`.

Since `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers, their values are unchanged by this operation. The new variable `max_lemons` is introduced, and its value is determined by the minimum of the three expressions: `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.

So, the output state is: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, and `max_lemons` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`**
