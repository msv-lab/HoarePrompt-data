Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program seems to correctly implement the logic to calculate the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears from which Nikolay can cook the compote, given the constraints of the 1:2:4 ratio. 

Here's a breakdown of why the code is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three positive integers from the user, representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears. We are assuming that the user will always provide a valid input, so there is no need to add error checking for invalid inputs.

2. **Ratio Calculation**: The program calculates the minimum quantity of lemons that can be used based on the available lemons, apples, and pears, using the formula `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`. This ensures that the 1:2:4 ratio is maintained for the selected fruits.

3. **Total Quantity Calculation**: The program then calculates the total quantity of fruits that can be used, by multiplying the minimum quantity of lemons by 1 (for lemons), 2 (for apples), and 4 (for pears), and summing these quantities. This correctly implements the logic to calculate the total quantity of fruits based on the selected minimum quantity of lemons.

4. **Example Verification**: The provided examples demonstrate that the program produces the correct output for different input scenarios. For example, when the input is `2`, `5`, `7`, the program correctly outputs `7`, which corresponds to using 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears.

Overall, the program seems to be logically correct and produces the expected output for the given examples. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct for every potential case, assuming valid input is provided.
