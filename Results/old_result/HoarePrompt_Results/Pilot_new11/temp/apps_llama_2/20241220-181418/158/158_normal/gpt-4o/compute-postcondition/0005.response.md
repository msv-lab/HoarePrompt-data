The code simply prints the value of `total_fruits`, which does not modify any variables. Therefore, the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `max_lemons`, and `total_fruits` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, `total_fruits` is `7 * min(a, b // 2, c // 4)` and `total_fruits` has been printed**
