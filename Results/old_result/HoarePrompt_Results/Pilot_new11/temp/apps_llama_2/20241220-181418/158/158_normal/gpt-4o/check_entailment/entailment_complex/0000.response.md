To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's analyze it based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code.

The problem requires finding the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears that can be used to cook a compote, given the constraint that the fruits should be in the ratio 1:2:4 (lemons:apples:pears).

Here's the annotated program's logic:

1. It takes three inputs: `a` (number of lemons), `b` (number of apples), and `c` (number of pears).
2. It calculates `max_lemons` as the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. This ensures that the number of lemons used does not exceed the available lemons, and that for each lemon, there are at least 2 apples and 4 pears available.
3. It calculates `total_fruits` as `max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4`, which represents the total number of fruits (lemons, apples, and pears) that can be used to cook the compote.
4. Finally, it prints `total_fruits`.

Based on this analysis, we can conclude that the program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. The key step is the calculation of `max_lemons`, which ensures that the ratio of lemons, apples, and pears is maintained while maximizing the total number of fruits used.

Here's why the program is correct for every potential case:

* The calculation of `max_lemons` using the `min` function guarantees that the program does not try to use more fruits than are available.
* The use of integer division (`//`) ensures that the program only considers whole fruits, as required by the problem statement.
* The calculation of `total_fruits` accurately reflects the total number of fruits that can be used to cook the compote, based on the calculated `max_lemons`.

Since the program correctly implements the required logic and does not have any obvious flaws, we can conclude that it meets the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
