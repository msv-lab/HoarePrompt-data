Correctness: **False**

The program does not cover all the potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, it only checks if `n * m % k` equals 0 and then attempts to find a solution using the GCD of `n` and `m`. However, it does not consider all possible cases where the area of the triangle can be equal to `n * m / k`. 

For example, the program does not handle cases where `n` and `m` are both even and `k` is odd, or where `n` and `m` have common factors that can be used to construct a triangle with the desired area.

Additionally, the program relies on the `func_3` function to calculate the GCD of `n` and `m`, but it does not guarantee that the resulting GCD will lead to a valid solution for the problem. The program may output "YES" and provide a set of points, but these points may not necessarily form a triangle with the correct area.

The given examples in the problem statement show that the program can produce correct output for certain cases, but they do not cover all possible scenarios. Therefore, the program cannot be considered correct for every potential case.
