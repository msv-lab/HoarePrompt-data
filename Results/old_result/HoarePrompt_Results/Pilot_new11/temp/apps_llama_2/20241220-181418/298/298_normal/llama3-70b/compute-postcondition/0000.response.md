To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is that `a` and `b` are integers. 

The code `x, y = func_2(a, b)` assigns the return values of `func_2(a, b)` to `x` and `y`. 

Since the specifics of `func_2(a, b)` are not provided, we can only infer that `x` and `y` will be assigned values that are the result of the function `func_2` when given `a` and `b` as arguments.

Thus, the output state will include that `a` and `b` are integers (as their values don't change), and `x` and `y` are the results of `func_2(a, b)`, but without knowing what `func_2` does, we can't simplify `x` and `y` further than saying they are the returned values from `func_2(a, b)`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers, `x` and `y` are the returned values from `func_2(a, b)`**
