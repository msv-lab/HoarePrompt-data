The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, both of which are integers. 

After executing the function body, there are two possible return cases: 
Case_1: The function returns two values: `1` and `0`, where `0` is the current value of `b`. 
Case_2: The function returns two values: `y` and the result of the expression `x - a // b * y`, where `x` and `y` are return values from a recursive call to `func_2(b, a % b)`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two integer parameters, `a` and `b`, and return values based on the conditions described, involving recursive calculations and integer division.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integer parameters, a and b, and returns either (1, 0) or the results of recursive calculations involving integer division and modulo operations, based on the conditions specified in the return cases.**
