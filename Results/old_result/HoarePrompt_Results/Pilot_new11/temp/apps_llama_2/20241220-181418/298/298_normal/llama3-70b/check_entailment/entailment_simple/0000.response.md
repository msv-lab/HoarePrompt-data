Correctness: **True**

The given program meets the problem description. It correctly determines whether three integer points can be found such that the area of the triangle formed by these points equals `nm/k`, where `n`, `m`, and `k` are the given integers. Here's why:

1. **Input Validation**: The program first checks if `n*m` is divisible by `k`. If not, it prints "NO" and exits because the area of the triangle must be an integer.

2. **GCD Calculation**: The `func_1` function calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm. Although this function is not directly used in the provided code snippet, `func_2` (which is used) relies on a similar principle to find the coefficients of Bézout's identity.

3. **Bézout's Identity**: `func_2` implements the extended Euclidean algorithm to find integers `x` and `y` such that `a*x + b*y = gcd(a, b)`, which is essential for solving the problem.

4. **Finding the Points**: The program then uses `func_3` to find `n1`, `m1`, and `g` (where `g` is the GCD of `n` and `m`), which are used to construct the points of the triangle. If the condition `abs(n1 * m) >= g` is met, it prints "YES" and the coordinates of the points. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

5. **Correctness of the Construction**: The construction of the points `(0, 0)`, `(0, n1*m//g)`, and `(m1*m//g, 0)` ensures that the area of the triangle formed by these points is indeed `nm/k`. This is because the base of the triangle is `m1*m//g` and the height is `n1*m//g`, so the area (which is half the product of the base and height) is `(m1*m//g)*(n1*m//g)/2 = nm/k` when simplified using the relation `n1*m + m1*n = g` (from Bézout's identity), which is derived from the GCD calculation.

The program handles all potential cases correctly according to the problem description, assuming valid inputs are provided as per the problem statement. It determines the existence of suitable points based on the divisibility of `n*m` by `k` and constructs the points using the GCD and Bézout's identity.
