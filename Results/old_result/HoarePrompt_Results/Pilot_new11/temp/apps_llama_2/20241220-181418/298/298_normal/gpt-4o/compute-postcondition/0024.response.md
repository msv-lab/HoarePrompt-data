Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `area` is equal to `n * m / k`. If `area` is not an integer, 'NO' has been printed to the console. If `area` is an integer, then 'NO' has been printed if `area` is 0. If `area` is not 0, 'YES' and '0 0' have been printed. Additionally, if `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`, then `2 * area` and `1` have been printed, and '0 1' has been printed. If `2 * area` is larger than `n` but less than or equal to `m`, then '1 {2 * `area`}' has been printed and '1 0' has been printed. If `2 * area` is larger than both `n` and `m`, then '0 ' and `m // 2` have been printed, and `n` and `m // 2` have been printed.***
