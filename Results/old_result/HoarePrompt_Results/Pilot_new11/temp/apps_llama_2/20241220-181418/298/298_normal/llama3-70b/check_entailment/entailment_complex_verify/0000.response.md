Based on the problem description and the provided code, I have evaluated the program's correctness. 

The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it does not correctly solve the problem. The assessor claims that the program appears to be implementing functions for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) and Extended Euclidean Algorithm, but it does not use these functions to find the points that satisfy the condition for the area of the triangle.

However, upon reviewing the annotated version of the code, I found that the program actually attempts to solve the problem by using the functions to find the points that satisfy the condition for the area of the triangle.

The function `func_3` calculates the GCD of `n` and `m` and returns the coefficients `x` and `y` such that `nx + my = gcd(n, m)`. The program then checks if `abs(n1 * m)` is greater than or equal to the GCD `g`. If this condition is true, it prints the points `(0, 0)`, `(0, n1 * m // g)`, and `(m1 * m // g, 0)`.

The condition `if n * m % k:` checks if the area `(n * m) / k` is an integer. If it is not, the program prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it proceeds to calculate the points.

The annotated version of the code provides a clear explanation of the program's behavior and shows that it attempts to solve the problem by finding the points that satisfy the condition for the area of the triangle.

Based on this analysis, I believe that the original assessment is not accurate. The program does attempt to solve the problem, and the annotated version provides a clear explanation of its behavior.

However, upon further analysis of the program's logic, I found that the program's approach to solving the problem is correct. It checks if the area is an integer and then attempts to find the points that satisfy the condition for the area of the triangle.

Therefore, based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
