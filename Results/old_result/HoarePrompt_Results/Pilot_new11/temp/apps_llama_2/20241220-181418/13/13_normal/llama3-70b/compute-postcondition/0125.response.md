According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, so `i` must be less than `n - 1` (or equals to `n - 2`), and `i` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1. 
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `i` is greater than or equal to 2, `n` is greater than `i + 1`**
