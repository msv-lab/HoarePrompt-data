To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state provides the following information:
- `n` equals its original value
- `trophies` remains unchanged
- `i` is 2
- `segments` contains tuples of start and end indices for all sequences of 'G' in the original `trophies` string and must have at least 3 elements
- `prev_start` equals `segments[1][0]`
- `prev_end` equals `segments[1][1]`
- `curr_start` equals `segments[2][0]`
- `curr_end` equals `segments[2][1]`

The code is:
```python
max_length = max(max_length, curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end - prev_start + 1) + 1)
```

Given the initial state, the code updates the `max_length` variable to be the maximum of its current value and the expression `curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end - prev_start + 1) + 1`. 

The expression `curr_end - curr_start + 1` calculates the length of the current sequence of 'G', and `prev_end - prev_start + 1` calculates the length of the previous sequence of 'G'. The `+ 1` in the middle adds an extra character (likely representing a separation or an element between the sequences), and the outer `+ 1` seems to account for an additional character or condition.

However, since the initial value of `max_length` is not provided, we can only express the new value of `max_length` in terms of the given variables. Therefore, `max_length` is updated to be the maximum of its original value and the calculated length of the combined sequences plus the additional elements.

The output state, considering the updates and the information provided, is:
Output State: **`n` equals its original value, `trophies` remains unchanged, `i` is 2, `segments` contains tuples of start and end indices for all sequences of 'G' in the original `trophies` string, `prev_start` equals `segments[1][0]`, `prev_end` equals `segments[1][1]`, `curr_start` equals `segments[2][0]`, `curr_end` equals `segments[2][1]`, `max_length` is the maximum of its original value and `curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end - prev_start + 1) + 1`**
