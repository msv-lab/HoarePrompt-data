Postcondition: **`n` equals its original value, `trophies` remains unchanged, `i` equals `n`, `segments` contains tuples of start and end indices for all sequences of 'G' in the original `trophies` string, `max_length` equals `max(end - start + 1 for start, end in segments)`, and the current value of `segments` contains exactly one tuple of start and end indices, indicating there is only one sequence of 'G' in the `trophies` string**
