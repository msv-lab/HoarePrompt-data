Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `i` is greater than or equal to 2, `n` is greater than `i + 1`. If `s[i]` is 'G' and `s[i + 1]` is 'S', then `j` is the index of the first 'S' encountered after `i + 1` or `n` if all characters from `i + 2` to `n` are 'G', and `max_beauty_one_swap` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `beauty`, where `beauty` is 1 plus the number of consecutive 'G's found when moving backwards from `i - 1` until an 'S' is encountered or the beginning of the string is reached, plus the number of consecutive 'G' characters found from `i + 2` to the first 'S' character encountered after `i + 1` or the end of the string. If `s[i]` is not 'G' or `s[i + 1]` is not 'S', no updates are made.***
