The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` was 0, so the new value of `i` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. The current value of `trophies` at index `i` was 'G', but since `i` has been incremented, the current value of `trophies` at index `i` is now `trophies[1]`. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting only of characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `start` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting only of characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `start` is 0**
