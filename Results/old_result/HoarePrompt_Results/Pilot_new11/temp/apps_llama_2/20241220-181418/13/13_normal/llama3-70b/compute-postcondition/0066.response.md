The code increments the `beauty` variable by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
The value of `n` remains an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` remains a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` remains a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` remains the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`, `max_beauty_one_swap` remains 0, `i` remains greater than 0, the current value of `s` at index `i` remains 'G' and the current value of `s` at index `i + 1` remains 'S', `j` remains `i - 2`. The `beauty` is now increased by 1.
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0, `i` is greater than 0, the current value of `s` at index `i` is 'G' and the current value of `s` at index `i + 1` is 'S', `j` is `i - 2` and `beauty` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0, `i` is greater than 0, the current value of `s` at index `i` is 'G' and the current value of `s` at index `i + 1` is 'S', `j` is `i - 2` and `beauty` is increased by 1**
