The `break` statement terminates the loop it is inside, but does not directly alter the values of any variables. Given the initial state, we have all the constraints on `n`, `s`, `golden`, `i`, and `j`, and none of these are altered by the `break` statement.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than `i + 4`, `j` is `i + 4`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
