According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than `i + 3`, `j` is `i + 3`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes `i + 4`. Since `j` is now `i + 4`, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than `i + 4`. The other variables `n`, `s`, and `golden` do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than `i + 4`, `j` is `i + 4**
