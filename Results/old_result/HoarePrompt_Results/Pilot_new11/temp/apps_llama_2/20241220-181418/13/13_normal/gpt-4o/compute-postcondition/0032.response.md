The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `i` is `i + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting only of characters 'G' and 'S' with at least one 'G' at a position reachable by `start`, `start` is equal to `i + 1`, if `trophies[0]` is 'G', then `start` is less than `n`, if `trophies[0]` is 'S', then `start` is either 2 or 3 and `n` is greater than 1.
