The value of `max_length` is calculated as the maximum length of all sequences of 'G' in the `trophies` string. Since `segments` contains exactly one tuple of start and end indices, there is only one sequence of 'G'. The length of this sequence is calculated as `end - start + 1`, where `start` and `end` are the start and end indices of the sequence.

Output State: **The program returns the length of the only sequence of 'G' in the `trophies` string, which is max_length = end - start + 1, where start and end are the start and end indices of the sequence in the unchanged `trophies` string**
