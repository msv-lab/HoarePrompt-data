The value of `left` is incremented by 1, so `left` is now greater than its initial value by 1 and is less than or equal to the initial value of `right`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `left` is equal to its initial value plus 1, `left` is less than or equal to the initial value of `right` and `left` is not in `golden` unless the increment made it equal to a value in `golden`, `right` is incremented by 1, `curr_beauty` is 0, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and 0.
