The value of `beauty` is incremented by 1. The initial values of the other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, `n` remains an integer between 3 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` remains a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` remains a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `i` remains greater than or equal to 1, `n` remains greater than `i + 3`, and `j` remains equal to `i + 3`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than `i + 3`, `j` is `i + 3`, and `beauty` is incremented by 1**
