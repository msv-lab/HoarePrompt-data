Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The issue lies in the way it checks for the maximum beauty after a single swap. The current implementation only checks for swaps where a golden trophy is immediately followed by a silver trophy, and it only checks for this pattern in the order from left to right. 

However, the problem statement does not impose these constraints. A single swap can be performed between any two trophies, regardless of their positions or the characters that follow them. 

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider all possible swaps between golden and silver trophies, not just the ones where a golden trophy is immediately followed by a silver trophy.

For example, consider the input "SGGS". The current program will not be able to find the optimal solution, which is to swap the first and third trophies, resulting in "GGSS". 

To fix this issue, we need to modify the program to check all possible swaps between golden and silver trophies, and then calculate the maximum beauty achievable after each swap. 

Here is a simplified example of how the corrected code could look:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = list(input())
    max_beauty = 0

    # Function to calculate the maximum beauty of the arrangement
    def calculate_beauty(arr):
        max_beauty = 0
        curr_beauty = 0
        for char in arr:
            if char == 'G':
                curr_beauty += 1
                max_beauty = max(max_beauty, curr_beauty)
            else:
                curr_beauty = 0
        return max_beauty

    # Calculate the maximum beauty without any swaps
    max_beauty = max(max_beauty, calculate_beauty(s))

    # Check all possible swaps
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if s[i]!= s[j]:
                s[i], s[j] = s[j], s[i]
                max_beauty = max(max_beauty, calculate_beauty(s))
                s[i], s[j] = s[j], s[i]

    print(max_beauty)

func()
```
In this corrected code, we first calculate the maximum beauty without any swaps. Then, we check all possible swaps between different characters and calculate the maximum beauty after each swap. The maximum beauty achievable after any swap is then compared to the maximum beauty without any swaps, and the larger value is printed as the result.
