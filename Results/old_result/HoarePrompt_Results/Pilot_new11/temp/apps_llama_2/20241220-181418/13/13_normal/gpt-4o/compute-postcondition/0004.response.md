The code `start = i` assigns the current value of `i` to a new variable `start`. 

Given the initial state, we have `n` as an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting only of characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is an empty list, `i` is 0, and the current value of `trophies` at index `i` is 'G'. 

Since `i` is 0, `start` will also be 0. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting only of characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `start` is 0, and the current value of `trophies` at index `i` is 'G'**
