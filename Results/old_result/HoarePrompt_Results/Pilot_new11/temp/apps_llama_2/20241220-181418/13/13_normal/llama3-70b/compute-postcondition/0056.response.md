According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Since `n` is already defined as an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), the loop is guaranteed to execute. However, the initial state of `i` should be considered. At the start of the loop, `i` should be initialized to 0, as the `range` function starts from 0 by default.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0, `i` is 0**
