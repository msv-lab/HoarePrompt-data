The value of `beauty` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected, so `n` is still an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is still a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is still a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is still the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is still 0, `i` is still greater than 2, the current value of `s` at index `i` is still 'G', the current value of `s` at index `i + 1` is still 'S', and `j` is still `i - 3`.
