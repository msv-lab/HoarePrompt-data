The given code is a `break` statement, which means it will exit the most internal loop or conditional statement it is directly inside. 

Given the initial state, we know that:
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive) and must be at least `i + 4`.
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'.
- `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`.
- `i` is greater than or equal to 2.
- `j` is `i + 4`.

The `break` statement does not modify any variables, so their values remain the same. The only effect is that it breaks out of the most internal loop or conditional statement.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive) and must be at least `i + 4`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `i` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is `i + 4`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive) and must be at least `i + 4`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `i` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is `i + 4`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
