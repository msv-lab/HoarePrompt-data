The given code `prev_start, prev_end = segments[i - 1]` updates the values of `prev_start` and `prev_end` based on the current value of `i`. 

Given that `i` is 3, `i - 1` equals 2. Therefore, `prev_start` and `prev_end` will be updated to `segments[2][0]` and `segments[2][1]` respectively.

However, it is given that `prev_start` equals `segments[2][0]` and `prev_end` equals `segments[2][1]`. So, `prev_start` and `prev_end` will still be equal to `segments[2][0]` and `segments[2][1]` respectively.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` equals its original value, `trophies` remains unchanged, `i` is 3, `segments` contains tuples of start and end indices for all sequences of 'G' in the original `trophies` string, `prev_start` equals `segments[2][0]`, `prev_end` equals `segments[2][1]`, `curr_start` equals `segments[3][0]`, `curr_end` equals `segments[3][1]`, and `segments` must have at least 4 elements.

Output State: **`n` equals its original value, `trophies` remains unchanged, `i` is 3, `segments` contains tuples of start and end indices for all sequences of 'G' in the original `trophies` string, `prev_start` equals `segments[2][0]`, `prev_end` equals `segments[2][1]`, `curr_start` equals `segments[3][0]`, `curr_end` equals `segments[3][1]`, and `segments` must have at least 4 elements**
