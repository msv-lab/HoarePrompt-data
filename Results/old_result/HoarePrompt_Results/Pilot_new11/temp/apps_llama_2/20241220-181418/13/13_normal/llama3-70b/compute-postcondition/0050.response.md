The code increments the value of `curr_beauty` by 1. The previous value of `curr_beauty` was 0. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 
So, `n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, the current value of `left` is the index of the first 'G' character in `s` starting from the initial value of `left`, or the current value of `left` is equal to the current value of `right` if no 'G' character is found, `right` is incremented by the number of iterations, `curr_beauty` is 1, and `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value (which is the maximum of its previous value and 0) and 1, and the current value of `left` is less than the current value of `right`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, the current value of `left` is the index of the first 'G' character in `s` starting from the initial value of `left`, or the current value of `left` is equal to the current value of `right` if no 'G' character is found, `right` is incremented by the number of iterations, `curr_beauty` is 1, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and 1, and the current value of `left` is less than the current value of `right`.**
