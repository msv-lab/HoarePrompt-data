You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vova has won $n$ trophies in different competitions. Each trophy is either golden or silver. The trophies are arranged in a row.

The beauty of the arrangement is the length of the longest subsegment consisting of golden trophies. Vova wants to swap two trophies (not necessarily adjacent ones) to make the arrangement as beautiful as possible — that means, to maximize the length of the longest such subsegment.

Help Vova! Tell him the maximum possible beauty of the arrangement if he is allowed to do at most one swap.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^5$) — the number of trophies.

The second line contains $n$ characters, each of them is either G or S. If the $i$-th character is G, then the $i$-th trophy is a golden one, otherwise it's a silver trophy. 


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible length of a subsegment of golden trophies, if Vova is allowed to do at most one swap.


-----Examples-----
Input
10
GGGSGGGSGG

Output
7

Input
4
GGGG

Output
4

Input
3
SSS

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example Vova has to swap trophies with indices $4$ and $10$. Thus he will obtain the sequence "GGGGGGGSGS", the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies is $7$. 

In the second example Vova can make no swaps at all. The length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence is $4$. 

In the third example Vova cannot do anything to make the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence greater than $0$.
Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
trophies = data[1]
print(func_1(n, trophies))

def func_1(n, trophies):
    segments = []
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if trophies[i] == 'G':
            start = i
            while i < n and trophies[i] == 'G':
                i += 1
            segments.append((start, i - 1))
        else:
            i += 1
    if not segments:
        return 0
    max_length = max((end - start + 1 for (start, end) in segments))
    if len(segments) == 1:
        return max_length
    for i in range(1, len(segments)):
        (prev_start, prev_end) = segments[i - 1]
        (curr_start, curr_end) = segments[i]
        if curr_start - prev_end == 2:
            max_length = max(max_length, curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end - prev_start + 1) + 1)
    return min(max_length + 1, n)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue with the program is that it only checks for sequences of 'G' that are separated by a single 'S' when deciding whether to swap. However, this is not the only case where swapping can increase the length of the longest subsegment of 'G's. 

For example, if the input is "GGGS" and "SGGG", the program will not correctly identify that swapping the 'S' with the 'G' in the second position will create a longer sequence of 'G's. 

Also, the program doesn't handle the case when there are multiple silvers between golden trophy sequences correctly. 

Another issue with the program is that it returns `min(max_length + 1, n)` which is incorrect because it doesn't take into account the actual maximum length that can be achieved after the swap. 

A correct solution would involve checking all possible swaps of 'G' and 'S' and calculating the maximum length of 'G' sequence that can be achieved after each swap. 

For example, a correct solution could involve iterating over all pairs of 'G' and 'S' characters, swapping them, and then calculating the maximum length of 'G' sequence in the resulting string. The maximum length across all swaps would be the answer. 

Here is a simple example where the code fails:

Input: 
10
GGGGSSSSGG

The program will return 4, but the correct answer is 6 because we can swap one of the 'S' characters with one of the 'G' characters in the second group of 'G's to get "GGGGGGSSGG", which has a longer sequence of 'G's. 

So the given code doesn't correctly handle all possible cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, and trophies is a string of length n consisting only of characters 'G' and 'S'.
def func_1(n, trophies):
    segments = []
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if trophies[i] == 'G':
            start = i
            while i < n and trophies[i] == 'G':
                i += 1

    if (not segments) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` equals its original value, `trophies` remains unchanged, `i` equals `n`, and `segments` contains tuples of start and end indices for all sequences of 'G' in the original `trophies` string, and `segments` is not empty
    max_length = max(end - start + 1 for start, end in segments)
    if (len(segments) == 1) :
        return max_length
        #The program returns the length of the only sequence of 'G' in the `trophies` string, which is max_length = end - start + 1, where start and end are the start and end indices of the sequence in the unchanged `trophies` string
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` equals its original value, `trophies` remains unchanged, `i` equals `n`, `segments` contains tuples of start and end indices for all sequences of 'G' in the original `trophies` string, `max_length` equals `max(end - start + 1 for start, end in segments)`, and the number of segments is more than 1
    for i in range(1, len(segments)):
        prev_start, prev_end = segments[i - 1]
        
        curr_start, curr_end = segments[i]
        
        if curr_start - prev_end == 2:
            max_length = max(max_length, curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end -
                prev_start + 1) + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the given information and the loop code step by step.
    #
    #1. **Initial State**: 
    #   - `n` equals its original value.
    #   - `trophies` remains unchanged.
    #   - `i` equals `n`.
    #   - `segments` contains tuples of start and end indices for all sequences of 'G' in the original `trophies` string.
    #   - `max_length` equals `max(end - start + 1 for start, end in segments)`, which is the maximum length of a sequence of 'G' in `trophies`.
    #   - The number of segments is more than 1.
    #
    #2. **Loop Code**:
    #   ```python
    #   for i in range(1, len(segments)):
    #       prev_start, prev_end = segments[i - 1]
    #       curr_start, curr_end = segments[i]
    #       if curr_start - prev_end == 2:
    #           max_length = max(max_length, curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end - prev_start + 1) + 1)
    #   ```
    #   This loop compares each pair of consecutive segments of 'G' in `trophies`. If the start of the current segment is exactly 2 positions after the end of the previous segment, it calculates the combined length of these two segments plus 1 (for the single character in between) and updates `max_length` if this combined length is greater than the current `max_length`.
    #
    #3. **Output State after Loop Executes**:
    #   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
    #   - `trophies` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
    #   - `i` will be equal to the length of `segments` after the loop finishes, since the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `len(segments)`.
    #   - `segments` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop; it still contains tuples of start and end indices for all sequences of 'G' in `trophies`.
    #   - `max_length` will be the maximum length of any sequence of 'G' in `trophies`, considering both individual segments and combinations of segments that are separated by a single character. This is because the loop checks for segments that are close enough to potentially form a longer sequence when combined with the single character in between.
    #
    #4. **Case When Loop Does Not Execute**:
    #   - If `segments` has 1 or fewer elements, the loop will not execute because `range(1, len(segments))` will be empty. In this case, `max_length` remains as initially calculated (the maximum length of a segment of 'G'), and other variables (`n`, `trophies`, `i`) retain their original values.
    #
    #**Output State**: **`n` equals its original value, `trophies` remains unchanged, `i` equals the number of segments, `segments` contains tuples of start and end indices for all sequences of 'G' in `trophies`, and `max_length` is the maximum length of any sequence of 'G' considering both individual and combinable segments.**
    return min(max_length + 1, n)
    #The program returns the minimum value between the maximum length of any sequence of 'G' in `trophies` (considering individual and combinable segments) plus one, and the original value of `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `trophies`, where `n` is the length of the `trophies` string, and returns an integer value based on the sequences of 'G' in the `trophies` string and the value of `n`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
