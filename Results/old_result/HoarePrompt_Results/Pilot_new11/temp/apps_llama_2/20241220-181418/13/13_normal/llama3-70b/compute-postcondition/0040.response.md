The given code snippet updates the `max_beauty` variable to be the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`. 

The initial state provides information about `n`, `s`, `golden`, and `right`, but the code snippet only affects `max_beauty`. The values of `n`, `s`, `golden`, and `right` remain unchanged. 

Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty`, we cannot determine their exact values after the update. However, we can express the new value of `max_beauty` as the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` is incremented by 1, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` is incremented by 1, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`**
