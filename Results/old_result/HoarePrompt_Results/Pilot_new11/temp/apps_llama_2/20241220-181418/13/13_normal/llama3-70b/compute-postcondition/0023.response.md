To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration: 
- `n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive),
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S',
- `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`.
- The character at index `right` in `s` is 'G', then `curr_beauty` is 1.
- Otherwise, `n`, `s`, `golden`, and `max_beauty` retain their initial values, `right` retains its value, and `left` is either the index of the first 'G' in `s` or equals `right`.
- If `left` is less than `right`, `curr_beauty` is increased by 1, otherwise `curr_beauty` retains its initial value of 0.

The loop statement is `for right in range(n):`. This means the loop will iterate over the range of `n`, incrementing `right` by 1 at each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `right` would have been some value `i`. For the loop to execute again, `right` needs to be incremented to `i + 1`. Since the loop condition is `right in range(n)`, for the loop to continue, `i + 1` must still be within the range of `n`, meaning `i + 1 < n`.

Thus, adjusting the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- `n` remains the same as it's the loop boundary.
- `s` remains unchanged as it's not modified by the loop counter.
- `golden` remains the same for the same reason as `s`.
- `right` is incremented by 1.
- The values of `left`, `curr_beauty`, and `max_beauty` could potentially change based on the new value of `right` and the content of `s` at that index, but their exact new values depend on the specific implementation of the loop body which is not provided.

State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` is incremented by 1**
