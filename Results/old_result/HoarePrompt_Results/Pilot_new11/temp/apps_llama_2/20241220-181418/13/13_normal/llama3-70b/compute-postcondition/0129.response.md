The code increments the value of `beauty` by 1. The initial value of `beauty` is 1, so the new value of `beauty` is 2. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. `n` is still an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is still a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is still a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `i` is still greater than or equal to 2, `n` is still greater than `i + 1`, and `j` is still `i - 1`. The character at the position `j` in string `s` is still 'G'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `i` is greater than or equal to 2, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `j` is `i - 1`, the character at the position `j` in string `s` is 'G', and `beauty` is 2**
