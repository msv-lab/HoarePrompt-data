According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `i`. If `j` is greater than -1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `i - 1`, and the character at index `j` in `s` is 'S'. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be decremented by 1. So, `j` becomes `i - 2`. The value of `i` remains the same because the loop is based on `j`. 
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0, `i` is greater than 0, the current value of `s` at index `i` is 'G' and the current value of `s` at index `i + 1` is 'S', `j` is `i - 2`**
