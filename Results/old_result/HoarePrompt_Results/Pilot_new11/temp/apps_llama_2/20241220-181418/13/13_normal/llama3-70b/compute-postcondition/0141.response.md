To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop code and the pattern observed from the output states after the loop executes a few times.

The loop code is:
```python
for j in range(i - 1, -1, -1):
    if s[j] == 'G':
        beauty += 1
    else:
        break
```
From the output states after the loop executes a few times, we can observe the following pattern:

- The variable `j` takes on the values from `i - 1` down to `0` in reverse order.
- The variable `beauty` is incremented by 1 each time a character 'G' is found in the string `s` at the current index `j`.
- The loop breaks as soon as a character 'S' is encountered.

Based on this pattern, we can infer the following about the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished:

- The variable `j` will be the index of the last character checked in the string `s`, which will be the index of the first 'S' encountered when moving backwards from `i - 1`, or `-1` if no 'S' is found (i.e., all characters from `i - 1` to `0` are 'G').
- The variable `beauty` will be incremented by the number of consecutive 'G's found when moving backwards from `i - 1` until an 'S' is encountered or the beginning of the string is reached.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `i` is greater than or equal to 2, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `j` is the index of the first 'S' encountered when moving backwards from `i - 1` or `-1` if all characters are 'G', and `beauty` is 1 plus the number of consecutive 'G's found when moving backwards from `i - 1` until an 'S' is encountered or the beginning of the string is reached.**
