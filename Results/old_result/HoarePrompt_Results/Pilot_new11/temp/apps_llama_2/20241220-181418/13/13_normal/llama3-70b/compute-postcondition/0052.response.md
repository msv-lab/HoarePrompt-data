Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`. If `s[right]` is 'G', then `right` is incremented by 1 and `curr_beauty` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `left` is less than `right`, then `left` is the index of the first 'G' character in `s` starting from the initial value of `left`, or `left` is equal to `right` if no 'G' character is found, `right` is incremented by the number of iterations, `curr_beauty` is 1, and `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and 1. If `left` is not less than `right`, then the values of `left`, `right`, `curr_beauty`, and `max_beauty` remain unchanged, with `curr_beauty` being 0 and `max_beauty` being the maximum of its previous value and 0.**
