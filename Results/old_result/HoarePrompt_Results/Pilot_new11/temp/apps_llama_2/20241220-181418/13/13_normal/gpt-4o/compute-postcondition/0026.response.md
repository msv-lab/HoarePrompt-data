Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting only of characters 'G' and 'S', if `trophies[0]` is 'G', then `i` must be less than `n` (implying at least one 'S' in `trophies` within its bounds), and if `trophies[0]` is 'S', then `i` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 1, and `trophies[i]` is 'S'**
