Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for several reasons:

1. The program only checks for swapping a 'G' trophy followed by an 'S' trophy, but the problem description allows for swapping any two trophies, not necessarily adjacent ones.

2. The program does not consider the case where swapping two 'S' trophies could result in a longer consecutive sequence of 'G' trophies.

3. The program only checks for swaps that involve a 'G' trophy immediately followed by an 'S' trophy, but the problem description allows for any two trophies to be swapped.

A correct implementation would involve checking all possible swaps of two trophies and calculating the maximum achievable beauty for each swap.

For example, consider the input "SGGGGGS". The program would only check for swapping the 'S' at the beginning with the 'S' at the end, but it would not consider swapping the 'S' at the beginning with the 'G' that is second from the end, which would result in a longer consecutive sequence of 'G' trophies.

To fix this, the program would need to be modified to check all possible swaps of two trophies and calculate the maximum achievable beauty for each swap. 

Here is an example of how the corrected program could look like:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = list(input())
    max_beauty = 0

    # Calculate the maximum beauty without any swaps
    curr_beauty = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'G':
            curr_beauty += 1
            max_beauty = max(max_beauty, curr_beauty)
        else:
            curr_beauty = 0

    # Calculate the maximum beauty with one swap
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            # Swap two trophies
            s[i], s[j] = s[j], s[i]
            curr_beauty = 0
            for k in range(n):
                if s[k] == 'G':
                    curr_beauty += 1
                    max_beauty = max(max_beauty, curr_beauty)
                else:
                    curr_beauty = 0
            # Swap the trophies back
            s[i], s[j] = s[j], s[i]

    print(max_beauty)
```

This corrected program checks all possible swaps of two trophies and calculates the maximum achievable beauty for each swap, ensuring that it always follows the problem description.
