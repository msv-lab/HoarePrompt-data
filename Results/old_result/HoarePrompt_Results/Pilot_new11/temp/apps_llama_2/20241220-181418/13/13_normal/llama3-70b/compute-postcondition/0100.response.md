The value of `beauty` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. The value of `n` is still between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is still a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is still a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `i` is still at least 2, `n` is still greater than `i + 1`, and `j` is still `i - 2`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `i` is at least 2, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `j` is `i - 2`, and `beauty` is increased by 1**
