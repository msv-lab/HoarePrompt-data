The code `start = i` assigns the value of `i` to a new variable `start`. 

Given the initial state conditions:

- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5.
- `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting only of characters 'G' and 'S'.
- If `trophies[0]` is 'G', then `i` must be less than `n`.
- If `trophies[0]` is 'S', then `i` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 1.

The introduction of `start` equals `i` adds a new variable to the state without altering the existing conditions related to `n`, `trophies`, or `i`. 

Thus, the new state includes all previous conditions and the new assignment: `start` equals `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting only of characters 'G' and 'S', if `trophies[0]` is 'G', then `i` and `start` are less than `n`, if `trophies[0]` is 'S', then `i` and `start` are 1 and `n` must be greater than 1**
