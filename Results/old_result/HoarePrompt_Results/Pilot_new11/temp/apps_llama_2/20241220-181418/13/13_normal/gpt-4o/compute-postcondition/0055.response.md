Postcondition: **`n` equals its original value, `trophies` remains unchanged, `i` is 1, `segments` contains tuples of start and end indices for all sequences of 'G' in the original `trophies` string, `prev_start` equals `segments[0][0]`, `prev_end` equals `segments[0][1]`, `curr_start` equals `segments[1][0]`, `curr_end` equals `segments[1][1]`, and if `curr_start - prev_end` equals 2, then `max_length` equals the maximum of its original value and `curr_end - curr_start + 1 + prev_end - prev_start + 2`, otherwise `max_length` remains unchanged as its original value.**
