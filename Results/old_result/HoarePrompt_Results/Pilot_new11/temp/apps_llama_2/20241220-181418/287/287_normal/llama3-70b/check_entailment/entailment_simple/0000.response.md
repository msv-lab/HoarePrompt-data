Correctness: **False**

The program does not accurately calculate the number of different weights of splits of a given number `n`. 

The problem description requires finding the number of different weights of splits of `n`, where the weight of a split is the number of elements in the split that are equal to the first element. The provided program, however, calculates the total number of divisors of `n`, which is not equivalent to the number of different weights of splits.

For instance, when `n = 7`, the possible weights of splits are 1, 2, 3, and 7, which correspond to the splits `[7]`, `[3, 3, 1]`, `[2, 2, 2, 1]`, and `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, respectively. The provided program, on the other hand, will calculate the number of divisors of `7`, which is 2 (1 and 7).

To correctly solve the problem, we need to generate all possible splits of `n`, calculate their weights, and count the number of distinct weights. The provided program does not accomplish this task.

Here is an example of a correct Python program to solve the problem:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    weights = set()
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        weight = 0
        remaining = n
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if j > i:
                break
            if remaining < j:
                break
            remaining -= j
            weight += 1
        if remaining == 0:
            weights.add(weight)
    print(len(weights))

func()
```

This program correctly generates all possible splits of `n` and counts the number of distinct weights, as required by the problem description.
