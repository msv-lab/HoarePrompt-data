You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Let's define a split of $n$ as a nonincreasing sequence of positive integers, the sum of which is $n$. 

For example, the following sequences are splits of $8$: $[4, 4]$, $[3, 3, 2]$, $[2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1]$, $[5, 2, 1]$.

The following sequences aren't splits of $8$: $[1, 7]$, $[5, 4]$, $[11, -3]$, $[1, 1, 4, 1, 1]$.

The weight of a split is the number of elements in the split that are equal to the first element. For example, the weight of the split $[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]$ is $5$, the weight of the split $[5, 5, 3, 3, 3]$ is $2$ and the weight of the split $[9]$ equals $1$.

For a given $n$, find out the number of different weights of its splits.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 10^9$).


-----Output-----

Output one integer — the answer to the problem.

-----Note-----

In the first sample, there are following possible weights of splits of $7$:

Weight 1: [$\textbf 7$] 

Weight 2: [$\textbf 3$, $\textbf 3$, 1] 

Weight 3: [$\textbf 2$, $\textbf 2$, $\textbf 2$, 1] 

Weight 7: [$\textbf 1$, $\textbf 1$, $\textbf 1$, $\textbf 1$, $\textbf 1$, $\textbf 1$, $\textbf 1$]
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: the input is an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 10^9.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    res = 0
    for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            res += 2
        
        if i * i == n:
            res -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the loop code and the given output states for the first few iterations.
    #
    #The loop code is:
    #```python
    #for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
    #    if n % i == 0:
    #        res += 2
    #    if i * i == n:
    #        res -= 1
    #```
    #From the given output states, we can observe the following patterns:
    #
    #- The loop will execute at least once if `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
    #- If `n` is 1, `res` will be 1 after the first iteration because `n` is a square of `i` and `n` is a multiple of `i`.
    #- If `n` is not 1 but is a multiple of `i`, `res` will be incremented by 2 for each multiple found.
    #- If `n` is a perfect square (i.e., `i * i == n`), `res` will be decremented by 1 after being incremented by 2, effectively incrementing `res` by 1 for that `i`.
    #
    #Let's break down the loop's behavior:
    #
    #1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will run for `i` values from 1 to the square root of `n` (inclusive). This means the loop will execute at least once if `n` is 1 or more, because the range will include at least the value 1.
    #
    #2. **Update of `res`**:
    #    - For every `i` where `n` is divisible by `i`, `res` is incremented by 2. This counts both `i` and its corresponding factor `n/i` as divisors of `n`, except when `i` equals `n/i` (which happens when `n` is a perfect square).
    #    - If `n` is a perfect square, the condition `i * i == n` will be true for the `i` that is the square root of `n`. In this case, after incrementing `res` by 2 (for the square root and itself), it then decrements `res` by 1 to avoid double-counting the square root.
    #
    #3. **Final State of `res`**:
    #    - If `n` is not a perfect square, `res` will be twice the number of divisors of `n` that are less than or equal to the square root of `n`, because each divisor `i` has a corresponding divisor `n/i`, and these pairs are counted together.
    #    - If `n` is a perfect square, `res` will be twice the number of divisors less than the square root of `n`, plus one for the square root itself (since it doesn't have a separate pair).
    #
    #4. **Edge Case**: If `n` is less than 1, the loop will not execute, and `res` will remain 0, reflecting that there are no divisors to count in this scenario.
    #
    #Given these observations, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished can be generalized as follows:
    #
    #- `n` retains its original value as it's not modified within the loop.
    #- `res` equals the total number of divisors of `n`, considering that each pair of divisors (`i` and `n/i`) contributes 2 to `res`, except when `n` is a perfect square, in which case its square root contributes 1.
    #
    #**Output State: `n` is an integer, `res` is the total number of divisors of `n`.**
    print(res)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the total number of divisors of a given integer `n`, where `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9. The function first takes an integer input from the user, then iterates through all numbers from 1 to the square root of `n` to find its divisors. For each divisor found, it increments a counter `res` by 2, except when `n` is a perfect square, in which case it decrements `res` by 1 after the increment to avoid double-counting the square root. The function handles edge cases such as `n` being 1 (in which case it has only 1 divisor) and perfect squares, where the square root is counted only once. After executing the loop, the function prints the total number of divisors found, stored in `res`. The state of the program after the function concludes includes the user-inputted integer `n` and the calculated total number of divisors of `n`, which is printed as output.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
