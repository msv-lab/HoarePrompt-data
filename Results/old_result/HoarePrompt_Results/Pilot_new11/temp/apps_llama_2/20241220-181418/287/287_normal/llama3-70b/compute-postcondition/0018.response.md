Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n + 1`. If `n` is a perfect square, then `res` is `n + 2`. If `n` is not a perfect square, the state of `res` would follow the previous conditions and updates, and since there is no else part in the code, no additional updates are made for non-perfect squares, thus the previous conditions regarding divisibility by `i` and updates to `n` and `res` remain in effect, guiding the final state of `res` based on whether `n` was previously updated and its divisibility by `i`.***
