The code increments the value of `count` by 1. The initial value of `count` is 0, so the new value of `count` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `num` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `count` is 1, `i` is 1, and the current value of `num` is divisible by the current value of `i`, which is 1.

Output State: **`num` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `count` is 1, `i` is 1, and `num` is divisible by `i`**
