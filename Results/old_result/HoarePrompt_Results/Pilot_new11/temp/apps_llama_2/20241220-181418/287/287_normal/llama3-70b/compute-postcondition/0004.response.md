The value of `res` is increased by 2. The previous value of `res` is 0, so the new value of `res` is 0 + 2 = 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `res` is 2, `i` is 1, and the current value of `n` is a multiple of `i`, meaning `n` can be divided by `i` without leaving a remainder.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `res` is 2, `i` is 1, and `n` is a multiple of `i`.**
