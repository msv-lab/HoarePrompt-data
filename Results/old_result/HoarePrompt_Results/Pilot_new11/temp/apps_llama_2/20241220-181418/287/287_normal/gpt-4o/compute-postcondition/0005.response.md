Postcondition: **`num` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `count` is 1, the initial value of `i` is 1, and `num` is divisible by the initial value of `i`. The current value of `i` is such that `i` is not equal to `num` divided by `i`, meaning `i` is a divisor of `num` but not its square root.**
