Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1. If `n` is a perfect square (i.e., `i * i == n`), then `res` is an integer equal to `n + 1`. If `n` is not a perfect square but is divisible by `i`, then `res` is an integer equal to `n + 2`. If `n` is neither a perfect square nor divisible by `i`, the state of `res` is not updated.***
