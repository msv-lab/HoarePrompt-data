Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly solve the problem described. It calculates the total number of divisors for a given number, which is not the same as finding the number of different weights of its splits.

For example, when the input is 7, the code will calculate the divisors of 7, which are 1 and 7, resulting in a count of 2. However, the correct output should be 4, as explained in the problem description: the possible weights of splits of 7 are 1, 2, 3, and 7, corresponding to the splits [7], [3, 3, 1], [2, 2, 2, 1], and [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], respectively.

This discrepancy indicates that the code is not correctly implementing the logic to calculate the number of different weights of splits for a given number. The output hints, which describe the code as calculating the total number of divisors, further support this conclusion. Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
