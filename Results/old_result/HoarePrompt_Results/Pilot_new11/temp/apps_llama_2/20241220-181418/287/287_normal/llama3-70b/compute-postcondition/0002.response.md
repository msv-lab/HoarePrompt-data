According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop iterates over a range from 1 to the square root of `n` (inclusive). For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, because the square root of a number less than 1 would result in a range with no elements (since the start of the range is 1) or would be undefined for negative numbers. At the start of the loop, `i` is 1, which is the first number in the range. 

State: **`n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `res` is 0, `i` is 1**
