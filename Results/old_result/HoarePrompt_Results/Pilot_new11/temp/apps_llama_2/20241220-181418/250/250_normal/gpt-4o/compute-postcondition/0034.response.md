According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `mark` and `marks`. If `marks` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the given conditions do not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `marks` is not empty, `mark` is the first mark in `marks`, and the rest of the variables maintain their properties.

State: **`n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l` is an input integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is an input integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is an input integer (x < y ≤ l), `marks` is a list of n input integers representing the sequence on the ruler (0 = marks[0] < marks[1] <... < marks[n-1] = l) that must have at least 1 mark, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `x_found` indicates whether a mark plus or minus `x` exists in `marks_set`, `y_found` indicates whether a mark plus or minus `y` exists in `marks_set`, `new_marks` is an empty set, Either `x_found` is False or `y_found` is False (or both), `mark` is the first mark in `marks`**
