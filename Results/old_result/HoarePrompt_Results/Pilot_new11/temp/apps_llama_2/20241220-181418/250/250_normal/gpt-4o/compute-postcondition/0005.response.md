According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `marks` list. If the list has at least 1 mark, the loop can execute. Since `n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and `marks` is a list of n input integers, we know that `marks` is not empty.

At the start of the loop, `n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l` is an input integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is an input integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is an input integer (x < y ≤ l), `marks` is a list of n input integers representing the sequence on the ruler (0 = marks[0] < marks[1] <... < marks[n-1] = l), `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `x_found` is False, and `y_found` is False.

For the loop to execute, `marks` must have at least 1 mark, and since `n` is between 2 and 10^5, `marks` must have at least 2 marks (including 0 and `l`). The loop will iterate over each mark in the `marks` list.

State: **`n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l` is an input integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is an input integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is an input integer (x < y ≤ l), `marks` is a list of n input integers representing the sequence on the ruler (0 = marks[0] < marks[1] <... < marks[n-1] = l) with at least 2 marks, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `x_found` is False, `y_found` is False, mark is the first mark in the list (which is 0)**
