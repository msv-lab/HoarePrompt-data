The given code simply assigns `True` to the variable `need_x`. This does not depend on any other variable, so the values of other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `marks` is a set of input integers, `i` is 2, `need_x` is `True`, and `need_y` is `True` if there exists a `j` where `marks[j] - marks[0] == y` or `marks[j] - marks[i] == y`**
