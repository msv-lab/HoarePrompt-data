Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `marks` is a set of input integers, `i` is 0, `j` is 1. If `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `x`, then `need_x` is True. Otherwise, no additional changes are made to the variables.***
