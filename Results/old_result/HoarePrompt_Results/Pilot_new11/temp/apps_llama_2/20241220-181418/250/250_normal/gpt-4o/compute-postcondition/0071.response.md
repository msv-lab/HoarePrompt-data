The value of `new_marks` is updated by adding `mark - y` to it. The states of the other variables are not affected. `n` is still an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l` is still an input integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is still an input integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is still an input integer (x < y ≤ l), `marks` is still a list of n input integers representing the sequence on the ruler (0 = marks[0] < marks[1] <... < marks[n-1] = l), `marks_set` is still a set of unique integers from `marks`, and `mark` is still the third mark in `marks`. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l` is an input integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is an input integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is an input integer (x < y ≤ l), `marks` is a list of n input integers representing the sequence on the ruler (0 = marks[0] < marks[1] <... < marks[n-1] = l), `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `mark` is the third mark in `marks`, and `new_marks` contains at least `mark - y`.**
