Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `marks` is a set of input integers with at least one more element to process, `i` is the next element in `marks`, `need_x` is False, `need_y` is either True or False, `additional_marks` is a set of integers that must have at least 1 element, `j` is the first element in `additional_marks`. The current value of `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and the sum of `i + j` is not an element in the set `marks`.**
