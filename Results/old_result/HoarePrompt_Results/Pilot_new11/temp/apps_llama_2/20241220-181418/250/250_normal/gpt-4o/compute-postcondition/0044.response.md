Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l` is an input integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is an input integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is an input integer (x < y ≤ l), `marks` is a list of n input integers representing the sequence on the ruler (0 = marks[0] < marks[1] <... < marks[n-1] = l) that must have at least 1 mark, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`. The current value of `y_found` is False, indicating that a mark plus or minus `y` does not exist in `marks_set`. The state of `x_found` is unchanged as it is not affected by the if condition. If `x_found` is False, then the current value of `y_found` being False implies that none of the conditions for `new_marks` related to `x` and `y` are met, thus the state of `new_marks` is an empty set if no other conditions are met before this point. The overall state of the program variables is that `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `marks`, and `marks_set` retain their initial properties, with the additional condition that `y_found` is False, meaning no mark plus or minus `y` exists in `marks_set`.**
