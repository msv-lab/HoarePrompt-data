Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `marks` is a set of input integers, `i` is 2, if there exists a `j` where `marks[j] - marks[i] == x`, then the conditions for `need_x` and `need_y` are met. Otherwise, `need_x` and `need_y` remain unchanged. `need_y` is `True` if there exists a `j` where `marks[j] - marks[0] == y` or `marks[j] - marks[i] == y`.***
