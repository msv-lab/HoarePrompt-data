The code simply sets the value of `y_found` to True. This does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l` is an input integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is an input integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is an input integer (x < y ≤ l), `marks` is a list of n input integers representing the sequence on the ruler (0 = marks[0] < marks[1] <... < marks[n-1] = l) with at least 2 marks, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `y_found` is True. 
If there exists a mark in `marks_set` such that the difference between the mark and another mark is `x`, then `x_found` is True. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables, so `x_found` might still be True or not changed.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l` is an input integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is an input integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is an input integer (x < y ≤ l), `marks` is a list of n input integers representing the sequence on the ruler (0 = marks[0] < marks[1] <... < marks[n-1] = l) with at least 2 marks, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `y_found` is True, and `x_found` remains unchanged.**
