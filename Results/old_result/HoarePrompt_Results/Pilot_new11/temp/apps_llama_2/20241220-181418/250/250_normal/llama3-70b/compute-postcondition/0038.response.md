The value of `need_y` is set to `True`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `marks` is a set of input integers, `i` is 2, `need_y` is `True`, if there exists a `j` where `marks[j] - marks[i] == x`, then the conditions for `need_x` are met. Otherwise, `need_x` remains unchanged.**
