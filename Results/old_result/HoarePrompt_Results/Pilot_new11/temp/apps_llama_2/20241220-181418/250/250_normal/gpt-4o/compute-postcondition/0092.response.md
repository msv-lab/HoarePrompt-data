Functionality: **The function calculates and prints a value or a list of values based on the input of a ruler's markings and dimensions, specifically integers `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y`, where `n` is the number of markings on the ruler, `l` is the length of the ruler, and `x` and `y` are two distinct markings. The function first checks if there are any markings that are `x` or `y` units away from each other. If such markings exist for both `x` and `y`, it prints `0`. If not, it then calculates and prints either a single marking that is `x` or `y` units away from an existing marking, or a list of `x` and `y` if no such markings can be added. The function does not handle any exceptions that may occur due to invalid input and does not modify the input values.**
