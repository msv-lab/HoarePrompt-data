To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the loop code and the given output states for the first few iterations.

The loop iterates over `additional_marks`, and for each element `j` in `additional_marks`, it checks if `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and not in `marks`. If this condition is true, it appends `i + j` to `additional_marks`.

From the output states after the loop executes 1, 2, and 3 times, we can see that:

* `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, and `need_y` remain unchanged.
* `marks` remains unchanged, but it is mentioned that it has at least one more element to process, which implies that `i` is the next element in `marks`.
* `i` remains the next element in `marks`.
* `need_x` remains False.
* `additional_marks` is updated by appending new elements `i + j` if the condition is true.
* `j` is the next element in `additional_marks`.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, we can conclude that:

* `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, and `need_y` will remain unchanged.
* `marks` will remain unchanged, and `i` will still be the next element in `marks`.
* `need_x` will remain False.
* `additional_marks` will contain all possible sums of elements from the original `marks` and the initial `additional_marks` that do not exceed `l` and are not in `marks`. This is because the loop will continue to append new elements `i + j` to `additional_marks` until no more new elements can be appended.
* `j` will be the last element in `additional_marks`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `marks` is a set of input integers, `i` is the next element in `marks`, `need_x` is False, `need_y` is either True or False, and `additional_marks` contains all possible sums of elements from the original `marks` and the initial `additional_marks` that do not exceed `l` and are not in `marks`.**
