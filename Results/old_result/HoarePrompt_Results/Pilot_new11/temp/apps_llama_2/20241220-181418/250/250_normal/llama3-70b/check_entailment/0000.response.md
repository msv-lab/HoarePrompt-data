Correctness: **False**.

The program provided does not always generate the minimum number of additional marks required to measure the distances x and y. 

One potential issue with this program is that it does not consider the case when adding a mark at distance x or y would allow the measurement of both distances. For example, if the ruler already has a mark at x + y, then adding a mark at x would allow the measurement of both x and y.

Another issue is that the program adds new marks based on the sum of the existing marks and the additional marks, but it does not check whether these new marks would actually be useful for measuring x or y. This could lead to the addition of unnecessary marks.

However, the main problem with the program is that it checks all pairs of existing marks, which results in a time complexity of O(n^2). But when adding new marks, it should also consider all possible pairs of existing and new marks, not just the sum of existing marks and new marks.

Here's an example where the program does not work correctly:

Input:
```
5 1000 200 800
0 200 400 600 1000
```
Output:
```
0
```
The program should output 1 and the mark 800, because we can already measure 200 and we need to add a mark at 800 to measure 800. 

To fix this program, we would need to rethink the approach and possibly use a more efficient algorithm to find the minimum number of additional marks required. 

One possible approach would be to use a set to store the differences between all pairs of existing marks, and then check if x and y are in this set. If not, we would need to add new marks. We could iterate over all possible distances from 1 to l, and check if adding a mark at this distance would allow us to measure x or y. If it would, we could add this mark to the list of additional marks. 

The program should also be able to handle the case when adding a mark at distance x or y would allow the measurement of both distances. 

This would require a more complex algorithm, possibly involving recursive function calls or dynamic programming. 

The time complexity of such an algorithm would likely be higher than the current O(n^2) complexity of the provided program. 

However, without a correct implementation, it's hard to give an exact time complexity. 

The main point is that the provided program does not always generate the minimum number of additional marks required to measure the distances x and y, and it needs to be modified or replaced with a more efficient and correct algorithm.
