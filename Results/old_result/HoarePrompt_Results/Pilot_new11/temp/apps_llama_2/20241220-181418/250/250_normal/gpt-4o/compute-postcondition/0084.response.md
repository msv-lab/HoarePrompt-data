Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l` is an input integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is an input integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is an input integer (x < y ≤ l), `marks` is a list of n input integers representing the sequence on the ruler (0 = marks[0] < marks[1] <... < marks[n-1] = l), `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `new_marks` is an empty set, the current value of `x_found` is False, and if `x_found` is False, then the current value of `result` is a list containing the value of `x` ([x]), and the current value of `y_found` is False**
