To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the given information and the loop code step by step.

1. **Initial Conditions**: 
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `l` is an input integer.
   - `x` is an input integer.
   - `y` is an input integer.
   - `marks` is a set of input integers.
   - `i` is `n-1` if `n` is greater than 0.
   - `need_x` is False.
   - If `need_y` is False, then `additional_marks` is a list containing the values of `x` and `y`.
   - If `need_y` is True, then `additional_marks` contains the value of `x` if `need_x` is False; otherwise, `additional_marks` remains an empty list.

2. **Loop Code Analysis**:
   - The loop iterates over each element `i` in `marks`.
   - For each `i`, it iterates over each element `j` in `additional_marks`.
   - For each `j`, it checks if `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and if `i + j` is not in `marks`.
   - If both conditions are met, `i + j` is appended to `additional_marks`.

Given the loop's behavior and the conditions under which elements are added to `additional_marks`, we can infer the following about the output state:

- `n`, `l`, `x`, `y` retain their original input values.
- `marks` originally is a set of integers and does not change due to the loop's execution.
- `i` will have iterated over all elements in `marks` by the end of the loop.
- `need_x` remains False.
- `need_y` could be either True or False but remains constant.
- `additional_marks` will contain all possible sums of elements from `marks` and initial elements in `additional_marks` that do not exceed `l` and are not already in `marks`. Its final state depends on the initial values of `x`, `y`, `need_x`, `need_y`, and the elements in `marks`.

Considering the scenario where the loop does not execute (which would happen if `marks` is empty), `additional_marks` would remain as initially defined based on the values of `x`, `y`, `need_x`, and `need_y`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `marks` is a set of input integers, `i` has iterated over all elements in `marks`, `need_x` is False, `need_y` is either True or False, and `additional_marks` contains all possible sums of elements from `marks` and the initial `additional_marks` that do not exceed `l` and are not in `marks`.**
