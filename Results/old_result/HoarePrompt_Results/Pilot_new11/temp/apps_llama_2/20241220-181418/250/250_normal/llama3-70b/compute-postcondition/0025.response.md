The value of `need_x` is set to `True`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `marks` is a set of input integers, initially `i` was 1, initially `j` was 1, `need_x` is `True`, `need_y` is True if there exists a `j` where `marks[j] - marks[0] == y`, the current value of `i` is 1, the current value of `j` is such that `marks[j] - marks[i] == x`, implying `marks[j] - marks[1] == x` since `i` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `marks` is a set of input integers, initially `i` was 1, initially `j` was 1, `need_x` is `True`, `need_y` is True if there exists a `j` where `marks[j] - marks[0] == y`, the current value of `i` is 1, the current value of `j` is such that `marks[j] - marks[1] == x`**
