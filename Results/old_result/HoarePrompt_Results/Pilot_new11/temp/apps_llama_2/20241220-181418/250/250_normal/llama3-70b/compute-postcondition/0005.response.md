Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `marks` is a set of input integers, `need_x` is False, `need_y` is False, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and the difference between the value of `marks` at index `j` and the value of `marks` at index `i` is equal to `x`**
