Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `marks` is a non-empty set of input integers, `i` is an element in `marks`, `need_x` is False, `need_y` is either False or True but if True then `need_x` must be False. If there exists an element `j` in `additional_marks` such that `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and `i + j` is not in `marks`, then `i + j` is included in `additional_marks` and the state of `additional_marks` is updated. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
