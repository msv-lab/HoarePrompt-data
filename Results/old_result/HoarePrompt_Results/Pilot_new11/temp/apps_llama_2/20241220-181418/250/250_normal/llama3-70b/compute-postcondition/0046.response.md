Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `marks` is a set of input integers, initially `i` is 2 and `j` is 2. The current value of `i` is 2 and the current value of `j` is 2. If `marks[j] - marks[i] == x`, then the current value of `need_x` is True and the current value of `need_y` is True if there exists a `j` in `marks` where `marks[j] - marks[1] == y`. Additionally, the difference between `marks[j]` and `marks[i]` is equal to `y`.**
