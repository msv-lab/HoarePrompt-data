Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l` is an input integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is an input integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is an input integer (x < y ≤ l), `marks` is a list of n input integers representing the sequence on the ruler (0 = marks[0] < marks[1] <... < marks[n-1] = l) with at least 2 marks, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`. If `mark + y` or `mark - y` is in `marks_set`, then `y_found` is `True`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
