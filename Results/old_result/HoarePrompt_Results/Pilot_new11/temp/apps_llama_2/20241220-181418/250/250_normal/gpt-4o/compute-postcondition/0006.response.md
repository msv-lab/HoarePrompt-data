Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l` is an input integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is an input integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is an input integer (x < y ≤ l), `marks` is a list of n input integers representing the sequence on the ruler (0 = marks[0] < marks[1] <... < marks[n-1] = l) with at least 2 marks, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, the current value of `x_found` is False, the current value of `y_found` is False, `mark` is the first mark in the list which is 0. The current value of `mark` plus `x` is in `marks_set` or the current value of `mark` minus `x` is in `marks_set`.**
