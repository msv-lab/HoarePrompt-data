To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop code and the provided output states for the first few iterations.

The loop code checks for two conditions: if `x_found` is False and if `y_found` is False. For each condition, it checks if certain values are present in the `marks_set`. If they are, it adds specific values to the `new_marks` set.

From the provided output states, we can see that:

- `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` retain their initial properties throughout the loop.
- `marks` is a list of `n` input integers representing the sequence on the ruler, and it must have at least as many marks as the number of iterations.
- `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`.
- `new_marks` is a set that contains values added based on the conditions checked in the loop.

After all iterations, `new_marks` will contain values that are either `mark + x` or `mark - x` if `x_found` is False, and either `mark + y` or `mark - y` if `y_found` is False. These values are added based on the presence of certain values in `marks_set`.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `n` is 0 or `marks` is empty), then `new_marks` will remain an empty set, as there are no marks to process.

Based on this analysis, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l` is an input integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is an input integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is an input integer (x < y ≤ l), `marks` is a list of n input integers representing the sequence on the ruler (0 = marks[0] < marks[1] <... < marks[n-1] = l), `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `new_marks` is a set containing values that are either `mark + x` or `mark - x` if `x_found` is False, and either `mark + y` or `mark - y` if `y_found` is False, for each mark in `marks` that meets the conditions in the loop.**
