The code initializes an empty list `result`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
The value of `n` is still an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), 
the value of `l` is still an input integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), 
the value of `x` is still an input integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), 
the value of `y` is still an input integer (x < y ≤ l), 
`marks` is still a list of n input integers representing the sequence on the ruler (0 = marks[0] < marks[1] <... < marks[n-1] = l), 
`marks_set` is still a set of unique integers from `marks`, 
`new_marks` is still an empty set. 
`result` is now an empty list. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l` is an input integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is an input integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is an input integer (x < y ≤ l), `marks` is a list of n input integers representing the sequence on the ruler (0 = marks[0] < marks[1] <... < marks[n-1] = l), `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `new_marks` is an empty set, `result` is an empty list.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l` is an input integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is an input integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is an input integer (x < y ≤ l), `marks` is a list of n input integers representing the sequence on the ruler (0 = marks[0] < marks[1] <... < marks[n-1] = l), `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `new_marks` is an empty set, `result` is an empty list**
