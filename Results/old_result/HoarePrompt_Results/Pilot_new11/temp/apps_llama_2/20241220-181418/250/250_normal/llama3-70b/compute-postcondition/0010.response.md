Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `marks` is a set of input integers, `i` is 0, `j` is 0. If the difference between the value of `marks` at index `j` and the value of `marks` at index `i` is equal to `y`, then `need_x` is False and `need_y` is True. If the difference between the value of `marks` at index `j` and the value of `marks` at index `i` is equal to `x`, then `need_x` is True and `need_y` is True. Otherwise, `need_x` remains False and `need_y` remains False.***
