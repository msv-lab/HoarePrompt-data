The code `additional_marks.append(i + j)` appends the sum of `i` and `j` to the `additional_marks` list. 

The value of `n` is still an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer. The value of `i` is the next element in `marks`, and `j` is the next element in `additional_marks`. The value of `need_x` is False, and `need_y` is either True or False.

`marks` is a set of input integers with at least one more element to process, but its elements do not change. 

`additional_marks` has at least one more element to process and now also includes the sum `i + j`.

The output state, therefore, reflects the updated `additional_marks` list with the additional element `i + j`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `marks` is a set of input integers with at least one more element to process, `i` is the next element in `marks`, `j` is the next element in `additional_marks`, `need_x` is False, `need_y` is either True or False, `additional_marks` has at least one more element to process and includes `i + j`**
