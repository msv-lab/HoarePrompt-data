The value of `new_marks` is updated by adding `mark + x` to it. The value of `mark` is `marks[2]`, which is the third mark in `marks`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l` is an input integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is an input integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is an input integer (x < y ≤ l), `marks` is a list of n input integers representing the sequence on the ruler (0 = marks[0] < marks[1] <... < marks[n-1] = l), `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `mark` is the third mark in `marks`, `new_marks` contains at least `marks[2] + x`.**
