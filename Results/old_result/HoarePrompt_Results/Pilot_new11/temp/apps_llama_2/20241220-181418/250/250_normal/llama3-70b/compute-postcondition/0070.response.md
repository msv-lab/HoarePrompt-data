Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `marks` is a non-empty set of input integers, `i` is an element in `marks`, `need_x` is False, `need_y` is either False or True but if True then `need_x` must be False, `additional_marks` is a non-empty list, `j` is an element in `additional_marks`. The current value of `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and the current value of `i + j` is not an element in `marks`.**
