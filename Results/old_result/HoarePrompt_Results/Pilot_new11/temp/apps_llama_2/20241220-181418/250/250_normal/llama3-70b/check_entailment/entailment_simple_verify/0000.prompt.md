You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Valery is a PE teacher at a school in Berland. Soon the students are going to take a test in long jumps, and Valery has lost his favorite ruler! 

However, there is no reason for disappointment, as Valery has found another ruler, its length is l centimeters. The ruler already has n marks, with which he can make measurements. We assume that the marks are numbered from 1 to n in the order they appear from the beginning of the ruler to its end. The first point coincides with the beginning of the ruler and represents the origin. The last mark coincides with the end of the ruler, at distance l from the origin. This ruler can be repesented by an increasing sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}, where a_{i} denotes the distance of the i-th mark from the origin (a_1 = 0, a_{n} = l).

Valery believes that with a ruler he can measure the distance of d centimeters, if there is a pair of integers i and j (1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n), such that the distance between the i-th and the j-th mark is exactly equal to d (in other words, a_{j} - a_{i} = d). 

Under the rules, the girls should be able to jump at least x centimeters, and the boys should be able to jump at least y (x < y) centimeters. To test the children's abilities, Valery needs a ruler to measure each of the distances x and y. 

Your task is to determine what is the minimum number of additional marks you need to add on the ruler so that they can be used to measure the distances x and y. Valery can add the marks at any integer non-negative distance from the origin not exceeding the length of the ruler.


-----Input-----

The first line contains four positive space-separated integers n, l, x, y (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l) — the number of marks, the length of the ruler and the jump norms for girls and boys, correspondingly.

The second line contains a sequence of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (0 = a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_{n} = l), where a_{i} shows the distance from the i-th mark to the origin.


-----Output-----

In the first line print a single non-negative integer v — the minimum number of marks that you need to add on the ruler.

In the second line print v space-separated integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{v} (0 ≤ p_{i} ≤ l). Number p_{i} means that the i-th mark should be at the distance of p_{i} centimeters from the origin. Print the marks in any order. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 250 185 230
0 185 250

Output
1
230

Input
4 250 185 230
0 20 185 250

Output
0

Input
2 300 185 230
0 300

Output
2
185 230



-----Note-----

In the first sample it is impossible to initially measure the distance of 230 centimeters. For that it is enough to add a 20 centimeter mark or a 230 centimeter mark.

In the second sample you already can use the ruler to measure the distances of 185 and 230 centimeters, so you don't have to add new marks.

In the third sample the ruler only contains the initial and the final marks. We will need to add two marks to be able to test the children's skills.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, l, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    marks = set(map(int, input().split()))
    (need_x, need_y) = (False, False)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i, n):
            if marks[j] - marks[i] == x:
                need_x = True
            if marks[j] - marks[i] == y:
                need_y = True
    additional_marks = []
    if not need_x:
        additional_marks.append(x)
    if not need_y:
        additional_marks.append(y)
    for i in marks:
        for j in additional_marks:
            if i + j <= l and i + j not in marks:
                additional_marks.append(i + j)
    print(len(additional_marks))
    print(' '.join(map(str, additional_marks)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The program provided does not always generate the minimum number of additional marks required to measure the distances x and y. 

One potential issue with this program is that it does not consider the case when adding a mark at distance x or y would allow the measurement of both distances. For example, if the ruler already has a mark at x + y, then adding a mark at x would allow the measurement of both x and y.

Another issue is that the program adds new marks based on the sum of the existing marks and the additional marks, but it does not check whether these new marks would actually be useful for measuring x or y. This could lead to the addition of unnecessary marks.

However, the main problem with the program is that it checks all pairs of existing marks, which results in a time complexity of O(n^2). But when adding new marks, it should also consider all possible pairs of existing and new marks, not just the sum of existing marks and new marks.

Here's an example where the program does not work correctly:

Input:
```
5 1000 200 800
0 200 400 600 1000
```
Output:
```
0
```
The program should output 1 and the mark 800, because we can already measure 200 and we need to add a mark at 800 to measure 800. 

To fix this program, we would need to rethink the approach and possibly use a more efficient algorithm to find the minimum number of additional marks required. 

One possible approach would be to use a set to store the differences between all pairs of existing marks, and then check if x and y are in this set. If not, we would need to add new marks. We could iterate over all possible distances from 1 to l, and check if adding a mark at this distance would allow us to measure x or y. If it would, we could add this mark to the list of additional marks. 

The program should also be able to handle the case when adding a mark at distance x or y would allow the measurement of both distances. 

This would require a more complex algorithm, possibly involving recursive function calls or dynamic programming. 

The time complexity of such an algorithm would likely be higher than the current O(n^2) complexity of the provided program. 

However, without a correct implementation, it's hard to give an exact time complexity. 

The main point is that the provided program does not always generate the minimum number of additional marks required to measure the distances x and y, and it needs to be modified or replaced with a more efficient and correct algorithm.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
