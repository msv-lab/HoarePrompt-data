Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `marks` is a set of input integers that must have at least one more element, `i` is the next element in `marks` after the current one, `need_x` is False, `need_y` is either True or False. If `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and `i + j` is not in `marks`, then `additional_marks` contains all possible sums of elements from the original `marks` and the initial `additional_marks` that do not exceed `l` and are not in `marks`, plus `i + j`, and has at least one more element, and `j` is the next element in the updated `additional_marks`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
