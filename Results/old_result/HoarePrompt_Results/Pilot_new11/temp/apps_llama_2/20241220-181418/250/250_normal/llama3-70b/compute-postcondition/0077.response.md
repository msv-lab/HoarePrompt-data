The given code snippet is appending the sum of `i` and `j` to the `additional_marks` list. However, the initial state does not define `j`. Assuming `j` is some integer (since it's being added to `i`), the impact of this operation is that `additional_marks` will have one more element than it did initially.

Given that `additional_marks` had at least one more element initially and now it gets appended with `i + j`, the new length of `additional_marks` will increase by 1. The values of `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `need_x`, `need_y`, and the state of `marks` are not directly affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `marks` may have been updated with new elements, `i` may refer to a different element in the updated `marks`, `need_x` is False, `need_y` is either False or True but if True then `need_x` must be False, `additional_marks` has at least two more elements and its last element is `i + j`.**
