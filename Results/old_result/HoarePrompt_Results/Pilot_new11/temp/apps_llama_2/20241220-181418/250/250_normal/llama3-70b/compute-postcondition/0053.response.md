Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `marks` is a set of input integers, `i` is 2, `j` is 3. If `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `y`, then `need_y` is True. Additionally, if `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `x`, then `need_x` is True.**
