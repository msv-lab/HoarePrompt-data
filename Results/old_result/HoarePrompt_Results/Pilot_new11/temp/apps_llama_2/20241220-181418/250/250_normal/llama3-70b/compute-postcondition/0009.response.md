The code only changes the value of `need_y` to True. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
The value of `n` is still an input integer that must be greater than 0, `l` is still an input integer, `x` is still an input integer, `y` is still an input integer, `marks` is still a set of input integers, `i` is still 0, `j` is still 0. 
The difference between the value of `marks` at index `j` and the value of `marks` at index `i` is equal to `x`, then the current value of `need_x` is True and the current value of `need_y` is now True, otherwise the current value of `need_x` is False and the current value of `need_y` is now True.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `marks` is a set of input integers, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, if the difference between the value of `marks` at index `j` and the value of `marks` at index `i` is equal to `x`, then `need_x` is True and `need_y` is True, otherwise `need_x` is False and `need_y` is True**
