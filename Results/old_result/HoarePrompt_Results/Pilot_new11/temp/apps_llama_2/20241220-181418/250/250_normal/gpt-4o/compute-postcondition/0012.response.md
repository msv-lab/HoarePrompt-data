Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l` is an input integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is an input integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is an input integer (x < y ≤ l), `marks` is a list of n input integers representing the sequence on the ruler (0 = marks[0] < marks[1] <... < marks[n-1] = l) with at least 2 marks, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`. The current values of `x_found` and `y_found` are both `True`, meaning that for at least one `mark` in `marks`, `mark + x` or `mark - x` is in `marks_set`, and `mark + y` or `mark - y` is in `marks_set`. The values of `x` and `y` have been checked against all marks in `marks_set`, resulting in both `x_found` and `y_found` being `True`. The state of the variables `x`, `y`, `marks`, and `marks_set` remains unchanged from the precondition, but the condition `x_found and y_found` being `True` indicates that both `x` and `y` have been found to have corresponding marks in `marks_set` as per their definitions.**
