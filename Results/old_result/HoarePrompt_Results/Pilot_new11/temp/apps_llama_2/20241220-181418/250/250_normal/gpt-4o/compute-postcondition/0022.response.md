According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `marks` list. If the list has at least one more mark, the loop executes again for the next mark. At the end of the last iteration, `marks` has at least 2 marks. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least one more mark. 

Since we are iterating over the list `marks`, the next iteration will start with the next mark in the list. If the last iteration was for the first mark, the next iteration will be for the second mark. If the last iteration was for the second mark, the next iteration will be for the third mark, and so on.

State: **`n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l` is an input integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is an input integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is an input integer (x < y ≤ l), `marks` is a list of n input integers representing the sequence on the ruler (0 = marks[0] < marks[1] <... < marks[n-1] = l) with at least 2 marks, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`**
