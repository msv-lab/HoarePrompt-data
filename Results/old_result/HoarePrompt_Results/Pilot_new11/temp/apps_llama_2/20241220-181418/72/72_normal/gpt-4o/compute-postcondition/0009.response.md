The value of `min_questions` is updated to `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)`. The previous value of `full_cycles` is `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)`, so the new value of `min_questions` is `(k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)) // (2 * n - 2)`. This can be simplified to `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m * (2 * n - 2))` or `k // ((2 * n - 2)^2 * m)`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer input, `k` is a non-negative integer input less than or equal to 10^18, `x` is `x - 1`, `y` is an integer input minus 1, `full_cycle_length` is `(2 * n - 2) * m`, `full_cycles` is `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)`, `remaining_questions` is `k % ((2 * n - 2) * m)`, `min_questions` is `k // ((2 * n - 2)^2 * m)`, `max_questions` is `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)`**
