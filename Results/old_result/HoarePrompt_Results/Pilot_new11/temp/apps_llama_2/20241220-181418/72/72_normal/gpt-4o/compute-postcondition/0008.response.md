Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer input, `k` is a non-negative integer input less than or equal to 10^18, `x` is initially `x` and then `x - 1`, so the current value of `x` is `x - 1`, `y` is an integer input minus 1, `full_cycle_length` is `(2 * n - 2) * m`, `full_cycles` is `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)`, `remaining_questions` is `k % ((2 * n - 2) * m)`, `min_questions` is `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)`, `max_questions` is `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)`**
