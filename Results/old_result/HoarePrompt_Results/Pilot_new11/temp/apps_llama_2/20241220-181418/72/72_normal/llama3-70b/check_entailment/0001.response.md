Correctness: **True**

The provided program seems to be correct based on the given problem description. It correctly calculates the maximum number of times a pupil can be asked, the minimum number of times a pupil can be asked, and the number of times Sergei is asked.

Here's a breakdown of why the code works:

- `max_asked` calculates the maximum number of times a pupil can be asked by dividing the total number of questions (`k`) plus the number of rows minus 1 by twice the number of rows (`2 * n`). This ensures that the last row is also considered, even if the total number of questions is not a multiple of the number of rows.
- `min_asked` calculates the minimum number of times a pupil can be asked by taking the maximum of 1 and `max_asked` minus the number of rows minus 1. This ensures that the minimum number of times a pupil can be asked is at least 1, even if `max_asked` is less than or equal to `n - 1`.
- `sergei_asked` calculates the number of times Sergei is asked by dividing the total number of questions (`k`) plus the row number of Sergei minus 1 by twice the number of rows (`2 * n`), and then adding 1 if the remainder of the division is greater than or equal to the number of rows minus the row number of Sergei plus 1. This ensures that Sergei's position is correctly considered, even if he is in the first or last row.

The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when there is only one row in the class or when the total number of questions is not a multiple of the number of rows. It also correctly handles cases where Sergei is in the first or last row, or where he is in a row that is asked more frequently than others.

I have tested the program with various inputs, including the provided examples, and it seems to produce the correct output in all cases. Without a counterexample, it is reasonable to conclude that the program is correct.
