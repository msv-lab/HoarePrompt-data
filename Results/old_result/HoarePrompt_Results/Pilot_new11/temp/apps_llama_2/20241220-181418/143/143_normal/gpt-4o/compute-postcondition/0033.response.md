Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, `L` is either less than `1 << 28` or updated to `L - (1 << 28)` if initially greater than or equal to `1 << 28`, `costs` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `max_cost` is 10^18, `dp` is a list where `dp[i]` is the minimum of `costs[i]` and `2^i * costs[0]` for `i < n`, and `2^i * costs[0]` for `i >= n`, `c` is a list of 31 integers where the first `n` elements are the elements of `costs` and the remaining `31 - n` elements are `max_cost`, `i` is 28, and `answer` is the minimum of its previous value and `current_cost + (L > 0) * 2^29 * costs[0]`, with `current_cost` being either `2^30 * costs[0] + min(costs[29], 2^29 * costs[0]) + min(costs[28], 2^28 * costs[0])` for `n` greater than 29 or `2^30 * costs[0] + 2^29 * costs[0] + 2^28 * costs[0]` for `n` less than or equal to 29 if `L` is initially greater than or equal to `1 << 28`, otherwise `answer` remains the same as before the if statement***
