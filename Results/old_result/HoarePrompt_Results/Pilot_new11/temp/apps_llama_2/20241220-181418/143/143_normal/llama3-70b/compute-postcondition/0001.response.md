The code `costs = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into substrings separated by whitespace, converts each substring to an integer, and stores the resulting integers in a list called `costs`.

Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive) and `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), these variables are not directly affected by the code. However, the code introduces a new variable `costs` which is a list of integers.

The number of integers in the `costs` list is not specified, but it is likely that the input is expected to contain `n` integers, given the context of the problem.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of input integers**
