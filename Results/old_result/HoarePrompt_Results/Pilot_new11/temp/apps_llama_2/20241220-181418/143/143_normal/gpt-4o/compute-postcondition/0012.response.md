To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the condition under which the loop will execute again. This condition is based on the loop statement `for i in range(1, 31):`, which means `i` must be less than 31 for the loop to execute again.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30,
- `L` is an integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9,
- `costs` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive),
- `max_cost` is 10^18,
- `dp` is a list of 31 integers where the first element is `min(costs[0], costs[0] * 2)` and the second element is `min(costs[1], costs[0] * 2)` if n is greater than 1 and `dp[0]` is `costs[0]`, and the remaining elements are the same as before,
- `c` is a list of 31 integers where the first `n` elements are the elements of `costs` and the remaining `31 - n` elements are `max_cost` (10^18),
- `i` is 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Thus, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 2. The loop condition does not directly depend on the values of `n`, `L`, `costs`, `max_cost`, `dp`, or `c`, but rather on `i` being within the range specified by the loop statement.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, `L` is an integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9, `costs` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `max_cost` is 10^18, `dp` is a list of 31 integers where the first element is `min(costs[0], costs[0] * 2)` and the second element is `min(costs[1], costs[0] * 2)` if n is greater than 1 and `dp[0]` is `costs[0]`, and the remaining elements are the same as before, `c` is a list of 31 integers where the first `n` elements are the elements of `costs` and the remaining `31 - n` elements are `max_cost` (10^18), and `i` is 2**
