Correctness: **False**

The program provided does not correctly solve the problem described. The problem asks for the minimum cost to buy at least L liters of lemonade, where each bottle has a volume of 2^i - 1 liters and costs c_i roubles.

The program tries to solve this problem by maintaining a dynamic programming (DP) table `dp` where `dp[i]` is the minimum cost to buy 2^i liters of lemonade. However, the program's approach to filling the `dp` table is incorrect.

The program first initializes the `dp` table by setting `dp[i]` to `c[i]` for `i < n`, and `max_cost` (a large value) for `i >= n`. Then, it updates the `dp` table by setting `dp[i]` to the minimum of `dp[i]` and `dp[i-1] * 2`. This is incorrect because it assumes that buying 2^i liters of lemonade is equivalent to buying two 2^(i-1) liters of lemonade, which is not the case.

Moreover, the program's approach to calculating the minimum cost to buy at least L liters of lemonade is also incorrect. It iterates over the `dp` table from 30 to 0, and for each `i`, it checks if `L >= 2^i`. If it is, it adds `dp[i]` to the current cost and subtracts `2^i` from `L`. This approach is incorrect because it does not consider the actual volume of the bottles (2^i - 1 liters) and does not ensure that the minimum cost is achieved.

To correctly solve the problem, a dynamic programming approach can be used, where `dp[i]` represents the minimum cost to buy `i` liters of lemonade. The `dp` table can be filled by iterating over each bottle type and updating the `dp` table accordingly. The final answer would be `dp[L]`.

Here's a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func_1(n, L, costs):
    dp = [float('inf')] * (L + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(1, L + 1):
        for j in range(n):
            volume = 2**j - 1
            if volume <= i:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - volume] + costs[j])
    return dp[L]
```
This program correctly solves the problem by maintaining a `dp` table where `dp[i]` represents the minimum cost to buy `i` liters of lemonade. It fills the `dp` table by iterating over each bottle type and updating the `dp` table accordingly. The final answer is `dp[L]`, which represents the minimum cost to buy at least `L` liters of lemonade.
