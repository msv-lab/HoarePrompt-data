To calculate the output state, we first need to understand the given initial state and then apply the changes made by the code snippet.

Given Initial State:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30
- `L` is an integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9
- `costs` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive)
- `max_cost` is 10^18
- `dp` is a list where `dp[i]` is the minimum of `costs[i]` and `2^i * costs[0]` for `i < n`, and `2^i * costs[0]` for `i >= n`
- `c` is a list of 31 integers where the first `n` elements are the elements of `costs` and the remaining `31 - n` elements are `max_cost` (10^18)
- `answer` is `10^18`
- `current_cost` is `2^30 * costs[0]`
- `i` is 30
- The current value of `L` is greater than or equal to `2` raised to the power of `i`

Code Snippet:
```python
L -= 1 << i
```
This code decreases `L` by `2` raised to the power of `i`, since `1 << i` is equivalent to `2^i`.

Applying this change:
- `n` remains unchanged, still an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive).
- `L` decreases by `2^i`, which in this case is `2^30`, because `i` is 30. So, `L` becomes `L - 2^30`.
- `costs`, `max_cost`, `dp`, `c`, `answer`, `current_cost`, and `i` do not change.

Therefore, the Output State is:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30
- `L` is `L - 2^30`
- `costs` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive)
- `max_cost` is 10^18
- `dp` is a list where `dp[i]` is the minimum of `costs[i]` and `2^i * costs[0]` for `i < n`, and `2^i * costs[0]` for `i >= n`
- `c` is a list of 31 integers where the first `n` elements are the elements of `costs` and the remaining `31 - n` elements are `max_cost` (10^18)
- `answer` is `10^18`
- `current_cost` is `2^30 * costs[0]`
- `i` is 30

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, `L` is `L - 2^30`, `costs` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `max_cost` is 10^18, `dp` is a list where `dp[i]` is the minimum of `costs[i]` and `2^i * costs[0]` for `i < n`, and `2^i * costs[0]` for `i >= n`, `c` is a list of 31 integers where the first `n` elements are the elements of `costs` and the remaining `31 - n` elements are `max_cost` (10^18), `answer` is `10^18`, `current_cost` is `2^30 * costs[0]`, and `i` is 30**
