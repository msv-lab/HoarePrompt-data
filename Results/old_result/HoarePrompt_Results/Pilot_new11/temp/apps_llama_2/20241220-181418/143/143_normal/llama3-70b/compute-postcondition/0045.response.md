To calculate the output state, we need to consider the impact of the given code on the variables.

The given code is:
```python
vol = 2 ** j - 1
```
Given that `j` is 2, we can substitute this value into the equation:
```python
vol = 2 ** 2 - 1
vol = 4 - 1
vol = 3
```
So, the variable `vol` is assigned the value 3.

The other variables are not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is an integer and at least 3
- `L` is an integer between 3 and 10^9 (inclusive) and at least 3
- `costs` is a list of input integers
- `i` is 3
- `dp[0]` is 0
- `dp[1]` is the minimum between its initial value and `costs[1]`
- `dp[2]` is the minimum between its initial value and `dp[1] + costs[0]`
- `dp[3]` is the minimum between its previous value and `dp[2] + costs[1]`
- `j` is 2
- `vol` is 3

Output State: **`n` is an integer and at least 3, `L` is an integer between 3 and 10^9 (inclusive) and at least 3, `costs` is a list of input integers, `i` is 3, `dp[0]` is 0, `dp[1]` is the minimum between its initial value and `costs[1]`, `dp[2]` is the minimum between its initial value and `dp[1] + costs[0]`, `dp[3]` is the minimum between its previous value and `dp[2] + costs[1]`, `j` is 2, `vol` is 3**
