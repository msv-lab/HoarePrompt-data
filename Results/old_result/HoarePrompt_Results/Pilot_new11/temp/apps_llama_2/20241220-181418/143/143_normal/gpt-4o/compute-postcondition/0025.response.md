To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given for loop statement and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The for loop is defined as `for i in range(30, -1, -1)`, which means it starts from `i = 30` and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `i = 0`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30.
- `L` is an integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9, potentially reduced if initially L ≥ 1 << 30.
- `costs` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive).
- `max_cost` is 10^18.
- `dp` is a list where `dp[i]` is the minimum of `costs[i]` and `2^i * costs[0]` for `i < n`, and `2^i * costs[0]` for `i >= n`.
- `c` is a list of 31 integers where the first `n` elements are the elements of `costs` and the remaining `31 - n` elements are `max_cost`.
- `answer` is the minimum of `10^18` and `current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[i]`, with `current_cost` being `2^30 * costs[0]` if `L >= 1 << 30` and `i` being 30 in such cases.

Since the loop has just finished an iteration, the value of `i` has decremented by 1. Thus, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be one less than its current value.

If we are at the end of the iteration where `i` was 30 (the starting point of the loop), the next iteration will have `i` as 29, because the loop decrements `i` by 1 in each step.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `n` remains the same, as it is not directly affected by the loop iteration.
- `L` remains the same, unless it was reduced in the previous iteration, in which case its new value is already reflected.
- `costs` remains unchanged.
- `max_cost` remains the same.
- `dp` remains unchanged, as it is not directly modified by the loop iteration.
- `c` remains the same.
- `answer` may need to be recalculated based on the new value of `i`, considering `current_cost` and `dp[i]`.

Considering these adjustments, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, `L` is an integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9, potentially reduced if initially L ≥ 1 << 30, `costs` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `max_cost` is 10^18, `dp` is a list where `dp[i]` is the minimum of `costs[i]` and `2^i * costs[0]` for `i < n`, and `2^i * costs[0]` for `i >= n`, `c` is a list of 31 integers where the first `n` elements are the elements of `costs` and the remaining `31 - n` elements are `max_cost`, `i` is 29, `answer` is the minimum of `10^18` and `current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[i]`, with `current_cost` being `2^30 * costs[0]` if `L >= 1 << 30`**.
