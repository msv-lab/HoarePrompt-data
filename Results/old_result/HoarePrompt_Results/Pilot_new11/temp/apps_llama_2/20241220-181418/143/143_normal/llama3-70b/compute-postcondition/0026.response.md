To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet: `vol = 2 ** j - 1`. 

Given that `j` is 1, we substitute `j` with 1 in the equation: `vol = 2 ** 1 - 1`. 

Calculating `2 ** 1` gives us 2, and subtracting 1 from that result gives us `vol = 1`.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state remains the same for all variables except `vol`, which is now 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) and must be at least 2, `costs` is a list of input integers, `i` is 2, `dp[0]` is 0, `dp[1]` is `min(float('inf'), costs[1])`, `dp[2]` is the minimum of its previous value and the minimum of `dp[1] + costs[0]` and `costs[0]`, `j` is 1, and `vol` is 1**
