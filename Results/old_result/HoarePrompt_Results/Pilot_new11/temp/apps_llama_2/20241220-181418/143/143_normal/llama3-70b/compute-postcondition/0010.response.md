According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `j` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 1, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of input integers, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, if `vol` is less than or equal to `i`, then `dp` is a list where `dp[0]` is 0 and `dp[1]` is the minimum between `float('inf')` and `float('inf') + costs[0]`, and `vol` is 0. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains as in the precondition.**
