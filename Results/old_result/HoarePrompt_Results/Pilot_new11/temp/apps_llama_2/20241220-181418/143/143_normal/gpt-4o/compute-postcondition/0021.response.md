The code `current_cost += dp[i]` increments the `current_cost` by the value of `dp[i]`. 

Since `i` is 30, and `dp[i]` is `2^i * costs[0]` for `i >= n`, `dp[30]` is `2^30 * costs[0]`.

The value of `current_cost` becomes `current_cost + 2^30 * costs[0]`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, `L` is an integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9, `costs` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `max_cost` is 10^18, `dp` is a list where `dp[i]` is the minimum of `costs[i]` and `2^i * costs[0]` for `i < n`, and `2^i * costs[0]` for `i >= n`, `c` is a list of 31 integers where the first `n` elements are the elements of `costs` and the remaining `31 - n` elements are `max_cost` (10^18), `answer` is `10^18`, `current_cost` is `2^30 * costs[0]`, `i` is 30, and the current value of `L` is greater than or equal to `2` raised to the power of `i`.
