The value of `vol` is assigned as `2` to the power of `j` minus `1`. Given that `j` is `1`, the value of `vol` becomes `2 ** 1 - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 3 and 10^9 (inclusive) and at least 3, `costs` is a list of input integers, `i` is 3, `dp[0]` is 0, `dp[1]` is the minimum between its initial value and `costs[1]`, `dp[2]` is the minimum between its initial value and `dp[1] + costs[0]`, `j` is 1, `vol` is 1, and if `vol` (which is 1) is less than or equal to `i` (which is 3), then `dp[3]` is the minimum between its previous value (if any) and `dp[3 - vol] + costs[0]`, which simplifies to the minimum between its previous value and `dp[2] + costs[0]`.**
