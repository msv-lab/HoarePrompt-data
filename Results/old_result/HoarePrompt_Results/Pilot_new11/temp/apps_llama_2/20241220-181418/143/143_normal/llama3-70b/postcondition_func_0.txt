The function calculates and returns the minimum cost to produce a required amount of lemonade, in liters, using bottles of different volumes and costs. It accepts two lines of input: the first line contains two integers, `n` (the number of bottle types) and `L` (the required amount of lemonade), and the second line contains `n` integers representing the costs of each bottle type. The function returns the minimum cost to achieve the required volume of lemonade, or -1 if it's not possible to achieve the required volume with the given bottle types. The function considers all possible combinations of bottle types to find the minimum cost, taking into account the volume of each bottle type, which is calculated as 2^i - 1 liters for the i-th bottle type. If the required volume cannot be achieved with the given bottle types, the function returns -1, indicating that it's not possible to produce the required amount of lemonade with the available bottles.
