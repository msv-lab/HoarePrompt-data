Output State: **The program returns the minimum achievable cost, stored in the variable `answer`, which is the result of iteratively subtracting the largest possible powers of 2 from `L` and maintaining a running total of these costs in `current_cost`, considering the initial value of `L` and the costs defined in `dp`.**
