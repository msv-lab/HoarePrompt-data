The given code line updates the value of `dp[i]` to be the minimum of its current value and twice the value of `dp[i - 1]`. 

Since `i` is 3, `dp[3]` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and twice the value of `dp[2]`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, `L` is an integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9, `costs` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `max_cost` is 10^18, `dp` is a list where `dp[3]` is the minimum of its previous value and `2 * dp[2]`, `c` is a list of 31 integers where the first `n` elements are the elements of `costs` and the remaining `31 - n` elements are `max_cost` (10^18), and `i` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, `L` is an integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9, `costs` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `max_cost` is 10^18, `dp` is a list where `dp[3]` is the minimum of its previous value and `2 * dp[2]`, `c` is a list of 31 integers where the first `n` elements are the elements of `costs` and the remaining `31 - n` elements are `max_cost` (10^18), and `i` is 3**
