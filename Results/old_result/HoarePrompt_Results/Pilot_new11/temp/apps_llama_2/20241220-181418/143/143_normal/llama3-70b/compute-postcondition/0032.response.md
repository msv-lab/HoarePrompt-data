Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) and must be at least 2, `costs` is a list of input integers, `i` is 2, `dp[0]` is 0, `dp[1]` is `min(float('inf'), costs[1])`, if `vol` is less than or equal to `i`, then an attempt to update `dp[2]` is made but encounters an issue due to indexing, `j` is 2, and `vol` is 3, otherwise, no changes are made**
