According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 3 and 10^9 (inclusive) and must be at least 3, `costs` is a list of input integers, `i` is 3, `dp[0]` is 0, `dp[1]` is the minimum between its initial value and `costs[1]`, `dp[2]` is the minimum between its initial value and `dp[1] + costs[0]`, and `j` is `n-1`. However, for the loop to execute, `j` should be initialized to 0 (the starting point of the range), not `n-1`. 

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 3 and 10^9 (inclusive) and must be at least 3, `costs` is a list of input integers, `i` is 3, `dp[0]` is 0, `dp[1]` is the minimum between its initial value and `costs[1]`, `dp[2]` is the minimum between its initial value and `dp[1] + costs[0]`, and `j` is 0**
