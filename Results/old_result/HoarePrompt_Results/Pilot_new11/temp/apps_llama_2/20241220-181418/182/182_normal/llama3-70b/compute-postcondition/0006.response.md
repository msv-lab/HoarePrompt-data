Postcondition: **The camera angle in degrees is an integer between -10^18 and 10^18 (inclusive), `x` is an integer between -359 and 359 (inclusive). If `x` is 0, the value 0 has been printed and returned. If `x` is not equal to 0, the printed value is an integer between 0 and 3 (inclusive) equal to `(x + 89) // 90 % 4`.**
