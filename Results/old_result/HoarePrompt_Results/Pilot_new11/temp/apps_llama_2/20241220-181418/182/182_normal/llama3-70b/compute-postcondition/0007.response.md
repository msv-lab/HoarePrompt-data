The function `func` does not accept any parameters. However, the problem statement describes a parameter constraint for the camera angle in degrees, which is an integer between -10^18 and 10^18 (inclusive). Since the function does not explicitly accept this parameter, we will assume that the camera angle is the return value of the function.


However, the problem statement doesn't provide information about the output of the function. We can't determine the return value without additional information.


To correctly determine the functionality, more information is required about the output. For now, based on the given constraints:


Functionality: **The functionality of the function cannot be determined due to lack of information about the return value.**
