Postcondition: ***`d` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` and `m` are input integers, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, each containing four integers, `cntl`, `cntr`, `cntt`, `cntb` are input integers, `right_count`, `left_count`, `top_count`, `bottom_count` are lists of `d` integers. If the current value of `left_count` at index `i` equals `cntl`, the current value of `right_count` at index `i` equals `cntr`, the current value of `top_count` at index `i` equals `cntt`, and the current value of `bottom_count` at index `i` equals `cntb`, then `target_sofa` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `target_sofa` remains -1***
