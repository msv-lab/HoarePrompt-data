The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. In this case, since we are not inside a loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement will have no effect on the variables. The states of the variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is a positive integer and must be greater than `j`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, each containing four integers, `j` is incremented by 1.
