Postcondition: **`d` is at least 3, `n` and `m` are input integers, `sofas` is a list of at least `d+1` tuples, `x1_j` = `sofas[j][0]`, `y1_j` = `sofas[j][1]`, `x2_j` = `sofas[j][2]`, `y2_j` = `sofas[j][3]`. If `y1` is less than `y1_j` and `y2` is less than `y1_j`, then `bottom_count[i]` is increased by 1, and `left_count[i]` and `right_count[i]` keep their previous values which were updated based on the conditions `x1` > `x2_j` and `x2` > `x2_j` and `x1` < `x1_j` and `x2` < `x1_j` respectively. If `y1` is not less than `y1_j` or `y2` is not less than `y1_j`, then `bottom_count[i]` remains unchanged, and `left_count[i]` and `right_count[i]` keep their previous values which were updated based on the conditions `x1` > `x2_j` and `x2` > `x2_j` and `x1` < `x1_j` and `x2` < `x1_j` respectively. Additionally, if `y1` > `y2_j` and `y2` > `y2_j`, then `top_count[i]` is increased by 1.**
