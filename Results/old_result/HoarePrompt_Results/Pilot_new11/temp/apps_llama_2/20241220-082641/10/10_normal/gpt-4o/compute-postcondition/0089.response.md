To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

Given the initial state:
- `d` is a positive integer
- `n` and `m` are input integers
- `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples
- `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the elements of the last tuple in `sofas`
- `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the elements of the second tuple in `sofas`
- `i` is `d`
- `j` is 1
- Conditions related to `left_count[d]` and `right_count[d]` are as specified

The code to execute is:
```python
bottom_count[i] += 1
```

This code increments the value of `bottom_count[i]` by 1. Since `i` is equal to `d`, this means `bottom_count[d]` is increased by 1.

The other variables' states are not directly affected by this operation. The conditions and values related to `left_count[d]`, `right_count[d]`, and the comparisons between elements of tuples in `sofas` remain as they were, waiting for their respective conditions to be evaluated or changed by subsequent code.

Therefore, the output state, considering the increment of `bottom_count[d]` and retaining all other conditions and variable states, is:

Output State: **`d` is a positive integer, `n` and `m` are input integers, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the elements of the last tuple in `sofas`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the elements of the second tuple in `sofas`, `i` is `d`, `j` is 1, `bottom_count[d]` is increased by 1, if `x1` > `x2_j` and `x2` > `x2_j`, then `left_count[d]` is increased by 1, if `x1` is less than `x1_j` and `x2` is less than `x1_j`, then `right_count[d]` is increased by 1, otherwise `right_count[d]` remains unchanged**
