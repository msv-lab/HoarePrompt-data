The value of `left_count[i]` is incremented by 1. Since `i` is `d`, the value of `left_count[d]` is increased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is a positive integer, `n` and `m` are input integers, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the elements of the last tuple in `sofas`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the elements of the first tuple in `sofas`, `i` is `d`, `j` is 0. If previously `x1` was less than `x1_j` and `x2` was less than `x1_j`, then the current value of `right_count[d]` is `right_count[d] + 1`. The current value of `x1` is greater than `x2_j` and the current value of `x2` is greater than `x2_j`. `a` is a list of integers, `left_count[d]` is `left_count[d] + 1`.
Output State: **`d` is a positive integer, `n` and `m` are input integers, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the elements of the last tuple in `sofas`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the elements of the first tuple in `sofas`, `i` is `d`, `j` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `left_count[d]` is `left_count[d] + 1`, if previously `x1` was less than `x1_j` and `x2` was less than `x1_j`, then the current value of `right_count[d]` is `right_count[d] + 1`, `x1` is greater than `x2_j`, `x2` is greater than `x2_j`**
