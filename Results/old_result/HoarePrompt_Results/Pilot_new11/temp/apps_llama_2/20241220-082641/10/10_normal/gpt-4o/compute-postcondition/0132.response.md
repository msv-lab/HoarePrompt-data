Postcondition: ***`d` is at least 2, `n` and `m` are input integers, `sofas` is a list of at least `d+1` tuples, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the elements of the `j-th` tuple in `sofas`, `left_count[d+1]`, `bottom_count[d+1]`, `top_count[d+1]` contain the respective updated counts of sofas relative to the new last sofa. If `x1` is greater than `x2_j` and `x2` is greater than `x2_j`, then `left_count[i]` is incremented by 1. If `x1` is less than `x1_j` and `x2` is less than `x1_j`, then `right_count[i]` is incremented by 1, and if `i` equals `j`, then we move to the next iteration of the loop, otherwise the state remains unchanged. If the condition `x1 > x2_j` and `x2 > x2_j` is not met, the state remains unchanged.***
