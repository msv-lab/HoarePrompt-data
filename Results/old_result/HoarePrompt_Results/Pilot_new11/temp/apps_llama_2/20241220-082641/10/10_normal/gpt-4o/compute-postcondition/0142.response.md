Postcondition: **`d` is at least 3, `n` and `m` are input integers, `sofas` is a list of at least `d+1` tuples, `x1_j` = `sofas[j][0]`, `y1_j` = `sofas[j][1]`, `x2_j` = `sofas[j][2]`, `y2_j` = `sofas[j][3]`, if `x1` is less than `x1_j` and `x2` is less than `x1_j`, then `right_count[i]` is increased by 1, and if `i` equals `j`, the program skips to the next iteration of the most internal loop, otherwise the program continues with the next statements, regardless of the condition `x1` is less than `x1_j` and `x2` is less than `x1_j`.**
