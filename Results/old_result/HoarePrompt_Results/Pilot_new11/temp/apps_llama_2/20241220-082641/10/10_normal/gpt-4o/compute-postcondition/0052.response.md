The given code assigns the values from the `(j)th` tuple in `sofas` to the variables `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j`. 

Since `j` is the initial value of `j` plus 2 and `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the four integers from the `(j+1)th` tuple in `sofas`, 
the new values are `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the four integers from the `(j)th` tuple in `sofas`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`d` is a positive integer greater than `(j+1)+1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, each containing four integers, `j` is the initial value of `j` plus 2, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the four integers from the `(j)th` tuple in `sofas`**
