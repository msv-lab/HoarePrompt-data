Postcondition: ***`d` is a positive integer, `n` and `m` are input integers, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the elements of the last tuple in `sofas`. If `i` equals `j`, which is 0, we continue to the next iteration of the loop if it exists. In all cases, `i` is `d` and `j` is 0.***
