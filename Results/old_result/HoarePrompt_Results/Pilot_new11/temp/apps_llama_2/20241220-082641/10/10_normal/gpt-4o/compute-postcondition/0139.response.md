Postcondition: ***`d` is at least 3, `n` and `m` are input integers, `sofas` is a list of at least `d+1` tuples, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the elements of the `j-th` tuple in `sofas` where `j` is `d-1`. If `i` equals `j`, the program skips to the next iteration of the most internal loop, otherwise the program continues with the next statements***
