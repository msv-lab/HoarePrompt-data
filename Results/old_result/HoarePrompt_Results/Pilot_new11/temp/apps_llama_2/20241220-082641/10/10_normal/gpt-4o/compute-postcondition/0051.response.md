Postcondition: **`d` is a positive integer greater than `(j+1)+1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, each containing four integers, `j` is the initial value of `j` plus 2, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the four integers from the `(j+1)th` tuple in `sofas`, and the state of the program variables does not change because there is no else part and no operations are performed in the if part.**
