Postcondition: **`d` is a positive integer and must be greater than `j+1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, each containing four integers, `j` is the initial value of `j` plus 1, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the four integers from the `jth` tuple in `sofas`. If `x1` is less than `x1_j` and `x2` is less than `x1_j`, then `right_count[i]` is incremented by 1, and if `i` equals the initial value of `j`, then `i` equals the initial value of `j`, otherwise `i` remains unchanged. If the condition is not met, the state of the variables remains unchanged, with `j` still being the initial value of `j` plus 1.**
