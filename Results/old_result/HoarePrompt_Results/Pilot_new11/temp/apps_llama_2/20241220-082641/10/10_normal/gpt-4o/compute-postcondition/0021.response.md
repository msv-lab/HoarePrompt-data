Postcondition: **`d` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, each containing four integers, `cntl` = `cnt_l`, `cntr` = `cnt_r`, `cntt` = `cnt_t`, `cntb` = `cnt_b`, `left_count` is a list of `d` zeros, `right_count` is a list of `d` zeros, `top_count` is a list of `d` zeros, `bottom_count` is a list of `d` zeros, `i` and `j` are both 0, and `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the four integers in the first tuple of `sofas`. The current values of `i` and `j` are equal.**
