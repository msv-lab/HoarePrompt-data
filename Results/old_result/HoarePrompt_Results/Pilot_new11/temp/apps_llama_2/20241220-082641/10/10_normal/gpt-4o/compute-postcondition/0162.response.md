The value of `target_sofa` is assigned the value of `i + 1`, where `i` is 2. So, `target_sofa` is assigned the value 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`d` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` and `m` are input integers, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, each containing four integers, `cntl`, `cntr`, `cntt`, `cntb` are input integers, `right_count`, `left_count`, `top_count`, `bottom_count` are lists of `d` integers, `target_sofa` is 3**
