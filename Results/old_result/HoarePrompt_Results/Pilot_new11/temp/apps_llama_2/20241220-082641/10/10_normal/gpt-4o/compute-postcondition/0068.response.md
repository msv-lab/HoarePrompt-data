The given Python code snippet is unpacking the first tuple in the `sofas` list into the variables `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j`. 

Given that `i` equals `d` and `j` equals 0, and considering that `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the elements of the last tuple in `sofas`, we need to determine the values of `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` after executing the given code.

Since `j` is 0, the code will unpack the first tuple in `sofas`, not the last one. Therefore, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` will be the elements of the first tuple in `sofas`, not the same as `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`, which are the elements of the last tuple.

Output State: **`d` is a positive integer, `n` and `m` are input integers, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the elements of the last tuple in `sofas`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the elements of the first tuple in `sofas`, `i` is `d`, `j` is 0**
