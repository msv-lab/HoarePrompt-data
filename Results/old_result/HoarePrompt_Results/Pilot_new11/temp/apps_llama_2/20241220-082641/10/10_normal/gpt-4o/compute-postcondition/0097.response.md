The code `right_count[i] += 1` increments the value at the `i`-th index in the list `right_count` by 1. Given the initial state, `i` equals `d`, so the value at the `d`-th index in `right_count` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

The initial state also specifies that `d` is a positive integer, `n` and `m` are input integers, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the elements of the last tuple in `sofas`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the elements of the second tuple in `sofas`, `i` equals `d`, and `j` equals 1. These conditions remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by the code.

Output State: **`d` is a positive integer, `n` and `m` are input integers, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the elements of the last tuple in `sofas`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the elements of the second tuple in `sofas`, `i` equals `d`, `j` equals 1, and `right_count[d]` is incremented by 1**
