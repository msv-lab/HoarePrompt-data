Postcondition: **`d` is a positive integer and must be greater than `j+1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, each containing four integers, if `i` equals `j`, then `j` is incremented by 1, otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, with `j` still incremented by 1 initially as per the precondition.**
