The value of `left_count[i]` is incremented by 1. Since `i` is `d`, the value of `left_count[d]` is increased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is a positive integer, `n` and `m` are input integers, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the elements of the last tuple in `sofas`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the elements of the second tuple in `sofas`, `i` is `d`, `j` is 1, `left_count[d]` is increased by 1. If `x1` is less than `x1_j` and `x2` is less than `x1_j`, then `right_count[d]` is unchanged. Otherwise, the state of `right_count[d]` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`d` is a positive integer, `n` and `m` are input integers, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the elements of the last tuple in `sofas`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the elements of the second tuple in `sofas`, `i` is `d`, `j` is 1, `left_count[d]` is increased by 1, if `x1` is less than `x1_j` and `x2` is less than `x1_j`, then `right_count[d]` is unchanged, otherwise `right_count[d]` is unchanged**
