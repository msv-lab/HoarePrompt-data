To solve this, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

Given Initial State: 
- `d` is a positive integer.
- `n` and `m` are input integers.
- `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples.
- `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the elements of the last tuple in `sofas`.
- `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the elements of the first tuple in `sofas`.
- `i` is `d`.
- `j` is 0.
- `x1` is less than `x1_j`.
- `x2` is less than `x1_j`.

Given Code Snippet:
```python
right_count[i] += 1
```

Impact of the Code:
- The code increments the value of `right_count` at index `i` by 1.
- Since `i` is equal to `d`, this means `right_count[d]` is incremented by 1.

Considering the initial state and the impact of the code:
- `d` remains a positive integer.
- `n` and `m` remain input integers.
- `sofas` remains a list of `d` tuples.
- `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` remain the elements of the last tuple in `sofas`.
- `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` remain the elements of the first tuple in `sofas`.
- `i` remains `d`.
- `j` remains 0.
- The conditions `x1` is less than `x1_j` and `x2` is less than `x1_j` are unaffected.
- `right_count[d]` is incremented by 1, meaning its new value is `right_count[d] + 1`.

Output State: **`d` is a positive integer, `n` and `m` are input integers, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the elements of the last tuple in `sofas`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the elements of the first tuple in `sofas`, `i` is `d`, `j` is 0, `x1` is less than `x1_j`, `x2` is less than `x1_j`, and `right_count[d]` is `right_count[d] + 1`.**
