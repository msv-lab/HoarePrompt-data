Postcondition: **`d` is at least 2, `n` and `m` are input integers, `sofas` is a list of at least `d+1` tuples, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the elements of the 0th tuple in `sofas`, `right_count[d+1]`, `left_count[d+1]`, `bottom_count[d+1]`, `top_count[d+1]` contain the respective updated counts of sofas relative to the new last sofa, `j` is 0, and if `i` is 0, then we continue to the next iteration of the loop if there are more iterations, otherwise the state of the variables remains unchanged. The current values of `x1` and `x2` are such that `x1` is less than `x1_j` and `x2` is less than `x1_j`.**
