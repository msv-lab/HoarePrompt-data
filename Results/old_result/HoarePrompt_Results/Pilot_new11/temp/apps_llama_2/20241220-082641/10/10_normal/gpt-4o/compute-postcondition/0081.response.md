According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `d`. If `j` is less than `d`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `d` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1. So, `j` becomes 1. 

State: **`d` is a positive integer, `n` and `m` are input integers, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the elements of the last tuple in `sofas`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the elements of the second tuple in `sofas` (as `j` is now 1), `i` is `d`, `j` is 1**
