The given code `sofas.append((x1, y1, x2, y2))` appends a new tuple `(x1, y1, x2, y2)` to the list `sofas`. 

Initially, `sofas` is a list containing two tuples `[(x1, y1, x2, y2), (x1, y1, x2, y2)]`. After executing the given code, `sofas` becomes a list containing three tuples `[(x1, y1, x2, y2), (x1, y1, x2, y2), (x1, y1, x2, y2)]`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`d` is an input integer greater than 1, 
`n` is an input integer, 
`m` is an input integer, 
`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are input integers, 
`sofas` is a list containing three tuples `[(x1, y1, x2, y2), (x1, y1, x2, y2), (x1, y1, x2, y2)]`, 
`cntl`, `cntr`, `cntt`, `cntb` are integers with 0 ≤ `cntl`, `cntr`, `cntt`, `cntb` ≤ `d` - 1.

Output State: **`d` is an input integer greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are input integers, `sofas` is a list containing three tuples `[(x1, y1, x2, y2), (x1, y1, x2, y2), (x1, y1, x2, y2)]`, `cntl`, `cntr`, `cntt`, `cntb` are integers with 0 ≤ `cntl`, `cntr`, `cntt`, `cntb` ≤ `d` - 1**
