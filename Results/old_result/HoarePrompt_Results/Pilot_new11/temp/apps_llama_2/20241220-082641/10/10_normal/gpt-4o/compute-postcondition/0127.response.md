Postcondition: ***`d` is at least 2, `n` and `m` are input integers, `sofas` is a list of at least `d+1` tuples, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the elements of the 1st tuple in `sofas`, `left_count[d+1]`, `bottom_count[d+1]`, `top_count[d+1]` contain the respective updated counts of sofas relative to the new last sofa, and if `i` equals `j`, then we move to the next iteration of the loop, otherwise the state remains unchanged as there is no else part***
