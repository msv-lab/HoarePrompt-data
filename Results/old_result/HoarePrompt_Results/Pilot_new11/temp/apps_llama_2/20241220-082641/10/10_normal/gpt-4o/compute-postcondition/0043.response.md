To calculate the output state after running the given Python code, let's consider the impact of the code on the program and check the previous values of the affected variables.

The code provided is:
```python
left_count[i] += 1
```

This line of code increments the value of `left_count` at index `i` by 1.

Given the initial state:
- `d` is a positive integer and must be greater than `j+1`.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, each containing four integers.
- `j` is the initial value of `j` plus 1.
- `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the four integers from the `jth` tuple in `sofas`.
- The conditions related to `x1`, `x2`, and their comparison with `x1_j`, and the conditional update of `i` and `right_count[i]`.

Since the provided code snippet only increments `left_count[i]`, the other variables remain unchanged. 

The updated state includes:
- `d` remains a positive integer greater than `j+1`.
- `n` remains an input integer.
- `m` remains an input integer.
- `sofas` remains a list of `d` tuples, each containing four integers.
- `j` remains the initial value of `j` plus 1.
- `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` remain the four integers from the `jth` tuple in `sofas`.
- The conditionals regarding `x1`, `x2`, `x1_j`, and updates to `i` and `right_count[i]` are not directly affected by the code snippet.
- `left_count[i]` has been incremented by 1.

Therefore, considering all the given and unchanged conditions, the output state after running the code is:
Output State: **`d` is a positive integer greater than `j+1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, each containing four integers, `j` is the initial value of `j` plus 1, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the four integers from the `jth` tuple in `sofas`, and `left_count[i]` has been incremented by 1.**
