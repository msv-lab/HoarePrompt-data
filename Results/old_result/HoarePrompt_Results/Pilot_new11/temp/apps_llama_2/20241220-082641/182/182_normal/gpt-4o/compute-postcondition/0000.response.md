The code takes an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `x`. The input represents the camera angle in degrees, where positive values denote clockwise camera rotation and negative values denote counter-clockwise rotation. The range of the input is -10^18 ≤ x ≤ 10^18.

Given this information, we can conclude that `x` is now an integer representing the camera angle in degrees, within the specified range.

Output State: **`x` is an integer representing the camera angle in degrees, where -10^18 ≤ x ≤ 10^18, with positive values denoting clockwise camera rotation and negative values denoting counter-clockwise rotation.**
