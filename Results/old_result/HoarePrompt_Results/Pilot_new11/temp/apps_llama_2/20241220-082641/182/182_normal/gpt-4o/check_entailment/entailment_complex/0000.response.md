Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the problem description. 

The issue lies in the line `turns = (360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4`. This line calculates the minimum number of clockwise turns needed to align the camera with the 0-degree position. However, it does not consider the case where the normalized angle is negative.

When the normalized angle is negative, the camera is rotated counter-clockwise. In this case, we need to find the minimum number of clockwise turns to rotate the camera to a position where the deviation from the vertical is minimal. 

To fix this issue, we need to calculate the normalized angle considering the counter-clockwise rotation as well. We can do this by adding 360 to the normalized angle if it is negative, and then calculating the turns needed.

Here's a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    x = int(input())
    normalized_angle = x % 360
    if normalized_angle < 0:
        normalized_angle += 360
    # For each possible number of turns, calculate the resulting deviation from the vertical
    resulting_deviations = [(normalized_angle + 90 * i) % 360 if (normalized_angle + 90 * i) % 360 <= 180 else 360 - (normalized_angle + 90 * i) % 360 for i in range(4)]
    # Find the number of turns that results in the smallest deviation
    turns = resulting_deviations.index(min(resulting_deviations))
    print(turns)
```

This corrected version of the code calculates the resulting deviation for each possible number of turns and finds the number of turns that results in the smallest deviation, which is the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns required to align the camera with the 0-degree position. 

In the given code, the line `turns = (360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4` does not consider all the cases and does not calculate the minimum number of turns correctly, hence the correctness is False.
