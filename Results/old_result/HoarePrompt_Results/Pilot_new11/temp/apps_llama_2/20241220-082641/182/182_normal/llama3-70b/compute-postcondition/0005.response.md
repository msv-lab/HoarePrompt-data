To determine the output state, let's analyze the given Python code snippet and the initial state.

The initial state is:
- The camera angle is an integer in the range -10^18 to 10^18, with positive values denoting clockwise camera rotation and negative values denoting counter-clockwise rotation.
- `x` is an integer in the range -359 to 359, and `x` is not equal to 0.

The code snippet is:
```python
print((x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4)
```

This code calculates and prints the value of the expression `(x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4`, but it does not assign this value to any variable or change the state of any existing variables directly. The expression `(x + 90 - 1)` adjusts the value of `x` by adding 89 to it, then `// 90` performs integer division by 90, effectively grouping the result into quarters of 90 degrees, and `% 4` takes the remainder when divided by 4, mapping the quarters to a cyclic pattern of 0, 1, 2, 3.

Since `x` is an integer in the range -359 to 359 (excluding 0), adding 89 to `x` shifts its range to -270 to 448. Dividing this range by 90 and taking the integer part (`// 90`) gives a range of -3 to 4 (since -270 // 90 = -3 and 448 // 90 = 4, considering integer division). Finally, taking the remainder modulo 4 (`% 4`) maps the possible integer division results to 0, 1, 2, or 3, depending on the original value of `x`.

However, since `x` cannot be 0, and the expression `(x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4` does not modify `x` or the camera angle, the output state remains essentially the same in terms of variable values, but we've calculated the output of the expression which depends on `x`.

The camera angle and `x` retain their initial constraints and values, but we've determined that the expression will output an integer in the range 0 to 3, based on the transformation of `x`. 

Thus, the output state is:
- The camera angle remains an integer in the range -10^18 to 10^18, denoting clockwise or counter-clockwise rotation, respectively.
- `x` is still an integer in the range -359 to 359, excluding 0.
- The expression `(x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4` has been evaluated and its result printed, which will be one of the integers 0, 1, 2, or 3, depending on `x`.

Output State: **The camera angle is an integer in the range -10^18 to 10^18, `x` is an integer in the range -359 to 359 excluding 0, and the expression `(x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4` has been printed with a value of 0, 1, 2, or 3.**
