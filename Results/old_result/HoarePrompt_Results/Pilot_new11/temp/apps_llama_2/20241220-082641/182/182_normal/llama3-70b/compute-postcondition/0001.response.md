The code `x = x % 360` calculates the remainder of `x` divided by 360. This operation does not affect the camera angle. The value of `x` is now an integer in the range -359 to 359, because the remainder of any integer divided by 360 must be between -359 and 359.

Output State: **the camera angle is an integer in the range -10^18 to 10^18, with positive values denoting clockwise camera rotation and negative values denoting counter-clockwise rotation, `x` is an integer in the range -359 to 359**
