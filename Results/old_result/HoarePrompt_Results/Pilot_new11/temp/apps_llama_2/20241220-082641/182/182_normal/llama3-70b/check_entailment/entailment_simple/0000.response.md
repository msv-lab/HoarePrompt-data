Correctness: **True**

The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Input handling**: The program reads an integer `x` from the input, which represents the camera angle in degrees. The problem description specifies that the input will be an integer in the range -10^18 to 10^18, with positive values denoting clockwise camera rotation and negative values denoting counter-clockwise rotation.

2. **Normalization**: The program normalizes the input angle `x` by taking the remainder modulo 360 using `x = x % 360`. This is a valid operation because rotating the camera by 360 degrees is equivalent to not rotating it at all.

3. **Handling zero angle**: The program checks if the normalized angle `x` is 0 and prints 0 if it is. This is correct because if the camera is not rotated, no turns are needed to minimize the deviation from the vertical direction.

4. **Calculating minimum turns**: For non-zero angles, the program calculates the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns required using the expression `(x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4`. This expression works as follows:
   - `x + 90 - 1` shifts the angle `x` to the range [89, 449] and subtracts 1 to make the division by 90 work correctly for angles in the range [90, 179].
   - `(x + 90 - 1) // 90` calculates the number of 90-degree turns needed to rotate the camera to an angle closest to a multiple of 90 degrees.
   - `% 4` ensures that the result is in the range [0, 3], which corresponds to the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed to minimize the deviation from the vertical direction.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all possible input cases. The use of integer arithmetic and modulo operations ensures that the program produces the correct output for any valid input angle. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
