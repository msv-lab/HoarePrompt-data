Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided code seems to correctly implement the required functionality. It first normalizes the input angle to a value between 0 and 359 by taking the modulus of the input with 360. If the normalized angle is 0, it prints 0, indicating no rotation is needed.

For non-zero normalized angles, the code calculates the minimum number of 90 degrees clockwise turns required to minimize the deviation from the vertical. The expression `(x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4` effectively calculates the minimum number of turns needed.

To understand the expression, let's break it down:

- `x + 90 - 1` is equivalent to `x + 89`. This is done to make the division by 90 work correctly.
- `(x + 89) // 90` calculates the number of 90-degree intervals that `x + 89` covers. This gives the minimum number of turns required to rotate the image to a position closest to the vertical.
- `% 4` is used because the minimum number of turns will always be between 0 and 3, given that a full rotation (360 degrees) can be achieved with 4 turns of 90 degrees each.

The provided examples, such as inputs 60 and -60, produce the expected outputs of 1 and 3, respectively, according to the problem description. The logic behind the calculation seems sound, considering the constraints of rotating only by 90 degrees clockwise and aiming to minimize the deviation from the vertical.

Given the assumption that the input will always be valid and considering the logic and examples provided, the code appears to correctly implement the required functionality for all potential cases within the problem's constraints.
