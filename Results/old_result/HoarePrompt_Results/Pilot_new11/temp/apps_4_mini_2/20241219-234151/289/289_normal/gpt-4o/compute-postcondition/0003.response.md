The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), representing the number of players participating in the tournament. Since there are no specific return values provided in the output section, we conclude that the functionality based on the given constraints is that the function will operate with the integer `n` without specifying its return behavior. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to accept an integer `n` that corresponds to the number of players in the tournament, within the defined range.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer representing the number of players in the tournament, constrained between 2 and \(10^{18}\).**
