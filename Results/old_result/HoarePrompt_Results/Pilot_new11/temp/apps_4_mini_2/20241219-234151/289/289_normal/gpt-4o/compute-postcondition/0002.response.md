The value of `max_games` is printed, which is calculated as `n.bit_length() - 1`. The variable `max_games` will take on a specific value based on the binary representation of the input integer `n`. Since `n` is within the range of 2 to \(10^{18}\), its binary representation will yield a `max_games` value of between 1 and 58 inclusive. The other variable states are unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `max_games` is an integer between 1 and 58 (calculated as `n.bit_length() - 1`), and `max_games` is printed.**
