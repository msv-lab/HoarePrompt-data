According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n`. The loop is set to iterate while `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 2`, which is still less than `n - 1`. Therefore, the loop can execute one more time.

To adjust the states for the next iteration:
- The value of `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become `n - 1`.
- The condition to allow the loop to execute again is that `n` remains unchanged (which it does) and `m` must be greater than 1.
  
Thus, the states need to reflect the increment in `i` while maintaining the other conditions.

State: **`n` is unchanged, `m` is greater than 1, `A` is unchanged; `B` will have `B[n - 2][0]` through `B[n - 2][m - 2]` set to 1, `B[n - 1][0]` through `B[n - 1][m - 2]` set to 1 if the conditions for each relevant j across the iterations are satisfied, otherwise they remain unchanged; `i` is `n - 1`; `operations` contains tuples `(n - 1, j + 1)` for every j where the conditions have been satisfied, and is unchanged otherwise.**
