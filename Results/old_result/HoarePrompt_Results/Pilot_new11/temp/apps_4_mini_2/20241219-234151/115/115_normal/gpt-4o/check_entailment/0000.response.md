Correctness: **False**.

The program attempts to perform operations to turn matrix B into matrix A by setting values in B to 1 based on the values in A. However, the program fails to ensure that it can generate any possible configuration of 1s in A, specifically when there are isolated 1s in the matrix that do not belong to a larger 2x2 block.

For example, consider the following input:

```
2 2
1 0
0 0
```

In this case, the expected output is `-1` since the 1 at position (0, 0) cannot be part of a 2x2 block with the other elements of A (which are 0). The program, however, will not detect this situation correctly, as it only checks for complete 2x2 blocks of 1s and does not address isolated 1s that cannot be reached through the allowed operations.

Thus, the program is incorrect because it does not handle the case of isolated 1s properly and may produce false results in such scenarios.
