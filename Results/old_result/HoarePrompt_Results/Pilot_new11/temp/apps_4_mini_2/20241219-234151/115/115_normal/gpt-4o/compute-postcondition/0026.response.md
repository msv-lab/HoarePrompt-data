Postcondition: ***`n` is unchanged, `m` is greater than 1, `A` is unchanged, `B[n - 2][0] = 1`, `B[n - 2][1] = 1`, `B[n - 1][0] = 1`, `B[n - 1][1] = 1`; `i` is `n - 2`, `j` is 1, and if the conditions `A[i][j] == 1`, `A[i][j + 1] == 1`, `A[i + 1][j] == 1`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1` are satisfied, then `operations` includes the tuple `(n - 1, 2)`; otherwise, `operations` remains unchanged.***
