The code snippet `ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))` adds a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `ops`. The values of `i` and `j` are not given explicitly, but we know from the initial state that `j` is 0. Therefore, `j + 1` becomes `1`. The value of `i + 1` is simply `i + 1`, which remains a variable as we do not have an explicit value for `i`.

After executing the code, only the `ops` list is affected. The initial state specifies that `n` and `m` remain unchanged (as they were not modified), and `j` is still `0`. 

Therefore, we can summarize the output state with the updated conditions.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `j` is 0, `ops` has a new tuple `(i + 1, 1)` appended to it.**
