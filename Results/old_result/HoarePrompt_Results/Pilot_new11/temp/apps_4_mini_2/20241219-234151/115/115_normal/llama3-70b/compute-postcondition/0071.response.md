Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `ops` contains all valid tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` where at least one of `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is equal to 1, and the printed output consists of all `op[0], op[1]` pairs from every tuple in `ops`.**
