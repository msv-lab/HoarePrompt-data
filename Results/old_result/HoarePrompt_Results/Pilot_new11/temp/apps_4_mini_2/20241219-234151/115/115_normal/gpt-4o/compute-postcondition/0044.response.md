The code `operations.append((i + 1, j + 1))` appends a tuple containing the values `i + 1` and `j + 1` to the list `operations`. The previous values of `j` is 2. Therefore, `j + 1` will equal 3. The value of `i` is unknown, so `i + 1` remains as is.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is unchanged, `m` must be greater than 3, `A` is unchanged, `j` is 2, and `operations` contains the tuple `(i + 1, 3)` appended to it.**
