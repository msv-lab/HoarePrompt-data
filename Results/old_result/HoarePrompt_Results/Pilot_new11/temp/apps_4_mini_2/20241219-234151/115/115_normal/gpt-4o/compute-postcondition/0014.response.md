The operation `operations.append((i + 1, j + 1))` appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `operations`. The values of `i` and `j` have not been provided in the initial conditions, but we know that `j` is equal to `m - 1`. Therefore, `j` can take values from 1 to 49, depending on the value of `m`.

Since `i` remains unchanged, we rename it as `i` for clarity. Consequently, after this operation, we have:

- `n` is still an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50.
- `m` is still an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50.
- `j` is still `m - 1`.
- `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` are still set to 1, unchanged.
- `A` is unchanged.
- `operations` now contains an additional entry, which is the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50; `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50; `j` is `m - 1`; `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` are all set to 1; `A` is unchanged; `operations` now includes `(i + 1, j + 1)`**.
