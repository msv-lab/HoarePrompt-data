The code appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `operations`. The values of `i` and `j` are used directly, with `j` being `1`, hence the tuple will evaluate to `(i + 1, 2)`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is unchanged, `m` must be greater than 2, `A` is unchanged, `j` is 1, and `operations` includes the tuple `(i + 1, 2)` added to it, while `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, `B[i + 1][j + 1]` are all equal to 1.**
