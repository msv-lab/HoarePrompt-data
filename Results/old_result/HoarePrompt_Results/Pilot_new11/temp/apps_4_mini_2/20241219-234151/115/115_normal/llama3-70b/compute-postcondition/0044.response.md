The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration in a loop and proceed to the next iteration. In this case, we do not have information about the surrounding loop, but the values of the variables `n`, `m`, `j`, and the 2D array `A` remain unchanged. Therefore, only the control flow is affected, not the values of the variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `j` is 0. The value of `A[i][j]` is 1, `A[i + 1][j]` is 1, `A[i][j + 1]` is 1, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1. No changes occurred, but we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
