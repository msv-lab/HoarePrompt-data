The variable `A` is assigned a new value, which is a 2D list created by taking `n` inputs, each of which is a space-separated string of integers. The values in `A` depend on the specific integers entered by the user.

The previous values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged, but `A` now references a 2D list filled with integers from the input. Since the specific integers are not known in this scenario, we simply represent `A` as a 2D list holding input integers of dimensions `n` x `m`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers based on input such that 2 <= `n`, `m` <= 50; `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n` x `m`, where `A` is populated with integers from user input.**
