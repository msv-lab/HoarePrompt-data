According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `m`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `m - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `m` is greater than 1, which means that `m - 1` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, we increment `j` by 1, making `j` equal to 1. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `m` must remain greater than 1.

State: **`n` is unchanged, `m` is greater than 1, `A` is unchanged, `B` has `B[n - 2][0] = 1`, `B[n - 2][1] = 1`, `B[n - 1][0] = 1`, `B[n - 1][1] = 1`; `i` is `n - 2`, `j` is 1, and `operations` includes the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` if `A[i][j] == 1`, `A[i][j + 1] == 1`, `A[i + 1][j] == 1`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1` hold true.
