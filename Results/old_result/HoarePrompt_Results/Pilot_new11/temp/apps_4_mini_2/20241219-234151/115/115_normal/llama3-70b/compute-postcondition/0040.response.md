Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n` x `m`, `ops` contains tuples for each position `(i + 1, j + 1)` where at least one of `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` equals 1, and `j` is `m - 1`. If none of these conditions are met for any `(j)` from `0` to `m - 2`, `ops` remains unchanged from its original state.**
