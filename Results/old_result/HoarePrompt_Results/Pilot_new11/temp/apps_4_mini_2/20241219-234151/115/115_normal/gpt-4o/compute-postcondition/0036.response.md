The code appends a new tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the `operations` list. Given that `i` is `n - 1` and `j` is `0`, the tuple becomes `(n, 1)`. The other variables remain unchanged and unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is unchanged, `m` is greater than 1, `A` is unchanged; `B[n - 2][0]` through `B[n - 2][m - 2]` set to 1, `B[n - 1][0]` through `B[n - 1][m - 2]` set to 1 if conditions are satisfied, otherwise remain unchanged; `i` is `n - 1`; `operations` now includes the tuple `(n, 1)`; `j` is 0; `A[i][j]` is 1, `A[i][j + 1]` is 1, `A[i + 1][j]` is 1, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1; `B[n - 1][0]` is 1, `B[n - 1][1]` is 1, `B[n][0]` is 1, `B[n][1]` is 1**
