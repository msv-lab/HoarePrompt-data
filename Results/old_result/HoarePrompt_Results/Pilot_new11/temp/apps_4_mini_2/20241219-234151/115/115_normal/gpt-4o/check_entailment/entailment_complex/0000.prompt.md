You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given two matrices $A$ and $B$. Each matrix contains exactly $n$ rows and $m$ columns. Each element of $A$ is either $0$ or $1$; each element of $B$ is initially $0$.

You may perform some operations with matrix $B$. During each operation, you choose any submatrix of $B$ having size $2 \times 2$, and replace every element in the chosen submatrix with $1$. In other words, you choose two integers $x$ and $y$ such that $1 \le x < n$ and $1 \le y < m$, and then set $B_{x, y}$, $B_{x, y + 1}$, $B_{x + 1, y}$ and $B_{x + 1, y + 1}$ to $1$.

Your goal is to make matrix $B$ equal to matrix $A$. Two matrices $A$ and $B$ are equal if and only if every element of matrix $A$ is equal to the corresponding element of matrix $B$.

Is it possible to make these matrices equal? If it is, you have to come up with a sequence of operations that makes $B$ equal to $A$. Note that you don't have to minimize the number of operations.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($2 \le n, m \le 50$).

Then $n$ lines follow, each containing $m$ integers. The $j$-th integer in the $i$-th line is $A_{i, j}$. Each integer is either $0$ or $1$.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible to make $B$ equal to $A$, print one integer $-1$.

Otherwise, print any sequence of operations that transforms $B$ into $A$ in the following format: the first line should contain one integer $k$ â€” the number of operations, and then $k$ lines should follow, each line containing two integers $x$ and $y$ for the corresponding operation (set $B_{x, y}$, $B_{x, y + 1}$, $B_{x + 1, y}$ and $B_{x + 1, y + 1}$ to $1$). The condition $0 \le k \le 2500$ should hold.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3
1 1 1
1 1 1
0 1 1

Output
3
1 1
1 2
2 2

Input
3 3
1 0 1
1 0 1
0 0 0

Output
-1

Input
3 2
0 0
0 0
0 0

Output
0



-----Note-----

The sequence of operations in the first example: $\begin{matrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & & 1 & 1 & 0 & & 1 & 1 & 1 & & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \rightarrow & 1 & 1 & 0 & \rightarrow & 1 & 1 & 1 & \rightarrow & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & & 0 & 0 & 0 & & 0 & 0 & 0 & & 0 & 1 & 1 \end{matrix}$
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    m = int(data[1])
    A = []
    index = 2
    for i in range(n):
        row = []
        for j in range(m):
            row.append(int(data[index]))
            index += 1
        A.append(row)
    func_1(n, m, A)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 2 <= n, m <= 50, and A is a list of n lists, each containing m integers where each integer is either 0 or 1.
def func_1(n, m, A):
    operations = []
    B = [([0] * m) for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n - 1):
        for j in range(m - 1):
            if A[i][j] == 1 and A[i][j + 1] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][
                j + 1] == 1:
                B[i][j] = B[i][j + 1] = B[i + 1][j] = B[i + 1][j + 1] = 1
                operations.append((i + 1, j + 1))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is unchanged, `m` is unchanged; `A` is unchanged; `B` will have elements `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` set to 1 wherever the corresponding elements in `A` satisfy the condition of being all equal to 1 for the indices accessed in the loop; `operations` contains tuples representing the 1-based indices of those updates; if no updates occur, then `B` remains unchanged for those positions and `operations` is still an empty list if no such conditions were ever met.
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if A[i][j] != B[i][j]:
                return -1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is non-negative, `m` is non-negative, all elements A[i][j] are equal to B[i][j] for all valid indices i and j (if n > 0 and m > 0), otherwise A and B remain unchanged if n = 0 or m = 0.
    print(len(operations))
    for op in operations:
        print(op[0], op[1])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is non-negative, `m` is non-negative, all elements A[i][j] are equal to B[i][j] for all valid indices i and j if n > 0 and m > 0, `operations` is a list of printed operations, and the output of each `op[0]` and `op[1]` has been printed corresponding to all elements of the list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer), `m` (an integer), and `A` (a list of n lists, where each inner list contains m integers that are either 0 or 1). It processes the input matrix `A` to create a new matrix `B` of the same dimensions, initially filled with zeros. The function searches for 2x2 blocks of ones in `A` and marks the corresponding positions in `B` as ones. It accumulates the positions of each successful block found in a list called `operations`. The function then verifies if all elements of `A` match with those in `B`. If they do not match, it immediately returns -1.

If all elements match, it prints the number of operations performed and the 1-based indices of each block found. The function does not handle cases where `n` or `m` are less than 2 explicitly; thus, if either is less than 2, it won't process any blocks but will still check for element equality between `A` and `B`. The final state after the program concludes is: If no blocks are found, `B` remains a zero matrix and `operations` is empty; if blocks are found, `B` will contain ones where the blocks are identified, and the operation indices will be printed accordingly, but it will still return -1 if there is any mismatch. The function effectively only returns -1 and does not return any other value, regardless of successful operations or matches.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
