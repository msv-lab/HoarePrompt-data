The code `ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))` adds a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `ops`. The variables `i` and `j` have specific relationships based on the initial state: `j` is equal to `m - 1`. Therefore, the new tuple appended to `ops` will reflect the values of `i + 1` and `m`. The conditions about the elements of the 2D list `A` being equal to 1 are given as prior information but do not affect the output state after this operation.

The previous states of the variables remain unchanged, except for the addition of a new tuple to `ops`. 

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n` x `m`, `j` is `m - 1`, `ops` now contains the last tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`, which has been appended.**
