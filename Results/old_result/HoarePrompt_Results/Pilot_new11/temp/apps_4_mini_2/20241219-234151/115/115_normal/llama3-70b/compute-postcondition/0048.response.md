Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, and `j` is 0. If any of the conditions in the if statement hold true (i.e., if `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` equals 1), then the iteration will skip with no changes made to the variables. Otherwise, `ops` has a new tuple `(i + 1, 1)` appended to it.***
