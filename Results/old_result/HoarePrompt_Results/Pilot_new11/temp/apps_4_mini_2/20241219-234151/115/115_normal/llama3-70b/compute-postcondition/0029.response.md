Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, and `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n` x `m`. If `A[i][j]` is 1, or `A[i + 1][j]` is 1, or `A[i][j + 1]` is 1, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1, `ops` now contains an additional tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`.***
