The provided Python program aims to determine whether it is possible to convert a zero matrix `B` into matrix `A` by performing operations that can convert a 2x2 submatrix of `B` into ones, corresponding to the ones present in matrix `A`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads matrix dimensions and elements correctly from the input. The matrix `A` is constructed as a list of lists.
2. **Operations**: 
   - The program iterates through potential top-left corners of 2x2 submatrices within `A`. It checks if the current 2x2 submatrix in `A` consists entirely of ones.
   - If it finds such a submatrix, it marks the equivalent positions in `B` to ones and records the operation (1-based indices of the top-left corner).
3. **Validation**: 
   - After processing potential operations, the program checks if the two matrices `A` and `B` are equal. If they are not equal, it returns `-1`.
4. **Output**: If `A` and `B` match, the program prints the number of operations and all recorded operations.

### Correctness Evaluation:
The program correctly implements the logic of the problem description. It checks for 2x2 blocks of ones in `A`, applies operations accordingly, and verifies if the transformations allow matrix `B` to match with `A`.

1. **Complete Coverage of Operations**: The program checks all possible positions for 2x2 submatrices in `A` and always uses the defined operation when the conditions are satisfied.
2. **Final Validation**: The verification step effectively ensures that matrix `B` matches matrix `A` after all operations. If mismatches are found, it correctly outputs `-1`.
3. **Edge Cases**: The program assumes a valid input as per the problem description (with `n` and `m` being at least `2`), therefore it naturally handles all specified conditions without needing additional checks for edge cases involving invalid inputs.

### Conclusion:
The program meets the requirements of the problem description in every aspect. Thus, the correctness of the provided program can be confirmed.

Correctness: **True**
