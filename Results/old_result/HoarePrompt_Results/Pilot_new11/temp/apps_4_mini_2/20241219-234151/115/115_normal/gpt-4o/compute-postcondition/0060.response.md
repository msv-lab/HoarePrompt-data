According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is non-negative. So for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 0 and `i` will be increased by 1 to 1.

State: **`n` is non-negative, `i` is 1**
