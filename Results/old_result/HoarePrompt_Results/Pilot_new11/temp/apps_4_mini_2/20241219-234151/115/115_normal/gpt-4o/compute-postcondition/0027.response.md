According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `m`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `m - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `m` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be greater than 2. 

Thus, `j` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 2 for the next iteration.

State: **`n` is unchanged, `m` must be greater than 2, `A` is unchanged, `B[n - 2][0] = 1`, `B[n - 2][1] = 1`, `B[n - 1][0] = 1`, `B[n - 1][1] = 1`; `i` is `n - 2`, `j` is 2**
