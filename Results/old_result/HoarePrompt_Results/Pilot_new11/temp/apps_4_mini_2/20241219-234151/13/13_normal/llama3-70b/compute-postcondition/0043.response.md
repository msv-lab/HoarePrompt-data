The variable `left` is incremented by 1. The other variables' states remain unchanged. Since `left` must be less than `right` and `s[left]` must not be 'G', this increment assumes the preconditions still hold.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `s` is a string of length `n`, `max_beauty` is updated to max(`max_beauty`, `curr_beauty`), `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is `left + 1`, `right` is unchanged, and `s[left]` must still not be 'G'**.
