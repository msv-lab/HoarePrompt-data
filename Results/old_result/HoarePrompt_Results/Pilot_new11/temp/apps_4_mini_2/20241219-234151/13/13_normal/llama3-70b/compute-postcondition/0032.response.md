The value of `left` is incremented by 1. The initial state indicates that `left` has already been incremented and is less than `n` while also meeting the condition that `s[left]` is 'S'. Therefore, after executing `left += 1`, the new value of `left` will be its previous value + 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S'; `curr_beauty` is 0; `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and 0; `left` is its previous value + 2 (after increment), which must still be less than `n`, and `right` must still be greater than `left`.**
