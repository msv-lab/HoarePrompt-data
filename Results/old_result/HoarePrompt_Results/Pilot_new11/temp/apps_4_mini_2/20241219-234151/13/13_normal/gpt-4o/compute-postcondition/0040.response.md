The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Initially, `i` is 2, so after the operation, `i` becomes 3. The value of `n` remains greater than 2, and the condition regarding the `trophies` array remains unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 3, and the element at index `i` of the `trophies` array is not 'G'.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 3, and the element at index `i` of the `trophies` array is not 'G'**.
