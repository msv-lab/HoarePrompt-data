Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S', if `s[right]` is 'G', `curr_beauty` is increased by 1, `max_beauty` remains unchanged, `left` remains unchanged, and `right` is equal to `n`. Otherwise, `left` is either equal to the index of the first 'G' in the string `s` or `n` if there are no 'G's; `right` remains equal to `n`; `curr_beauty` is increased by 1; `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and 0; and the current value of `left` is less than the current value of `right`.***
