The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `i` is 1. Thus, after the increment, `i` becomes 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` remains an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `trophies[1]` must be 'G'; `trophies` is a string of length `n` containing only 'G' and 'S'; `segments` contains the tuple (start, i - 1) where `start` is 1; `i` is now 2.

Output State: **`n` remains an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `trophies[1]` must be 'G'; `trophies` is a string of length `n` containing only 'G' and 'S'; `segments` contains the tuple (1, 1); `i` is 2; `start` is 1.**
