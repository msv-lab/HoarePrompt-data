To calculate the changes caused by the code, we need to analyze the `max_length` variable based on the values of `curr_start`, `curr_end`, `prev_start`, and `prev_end`.

1. **Understanding the Calculation**: 
   - `curr_end - curr_start + 1` gives the length of the current segment.
   - `prev_end - prev_start + 1` gives the length of the previous segment.
   - The `+ 1` at the end likely accounts for some separator or connection between the two segments.

2. **Modifying `max_length`**: 
   - The new value for `max_length` will be the maximum of its current value and the calculated total length from the segments.

Given that:
- The initial variables are as stated: `n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 100000`, `i` is 2, and `segments` contains more than one tuple.
- `prev_start` is known to equal the first element of the second tuple in `segments`.
- `prev_end` is known to equal the second element of the second tuple in `segments`.
- `curr_start` is known to equal the first element of the tuple at index 2 in `segments`.
- `curr_end` is known to equal the second element of the tuple at index 2 in `segments`.

The output state must reflect the updated value of `max_length`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `i` is 2; `segments` contains more than one tuple; `prev_start` is the first element of the second tuple in `segments`; `prev_end` is the second element of the second tuple in `segments`; `curr_start` is the first element of the tuple at index 2 in `segments`; `curr_end` is the second element of the tuple at index 2 in `segments`; `max_length` is updated to max(`max_length`, `curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end - prev_start + 1) + 1`)**.
