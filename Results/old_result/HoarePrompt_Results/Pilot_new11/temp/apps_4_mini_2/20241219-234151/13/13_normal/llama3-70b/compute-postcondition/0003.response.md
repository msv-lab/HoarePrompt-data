The variable `max_beauty` is initialized to 0. This variable will hold the maximum beauty value, but since no calculations or operations are performed concerning the other variables (`n`, `s`, `golden`), their states remain unchanged, while `max_beauty` is simply set to 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'; `golden` is a list of integers representing the indices of 'G' in `s`; `max_beauty` is 0**
