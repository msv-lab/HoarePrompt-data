The value of `beauty` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `beauty` was 1, so the new value of `beauty` is 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 100000`, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `n - 2`, `beauty` is 2, and the current value of `s[j]` is 'G'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 100000`, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `n - 2`, `beauty` is 2, and the current value of `s[j]` is 'G'**.
