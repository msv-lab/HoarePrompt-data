In the given code snippet, `left` is incremented by 1. The variable `left` must previously have a valid value such that it is less than `n` and `s[left]` must be 'S'. After the code is executed, the value of `left` increases by 1. The values of `n`, `s`, `curr_beauty`, and `max_beauty` remain unchanged. This means that the updated value of `left` is now within the range [0, n-1] (given that it started as a valid index for the string `s`).

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S'; `curr_beauty` is 0; `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and 0; `left` has been incremented by 1 and remains less than `n` and `s[left]` is 'S'**.
