According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is set to 2, and `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 2. 

Currently, `n` is at its minimum possible value of 2, which does not allow for further increment of `i`. So `n` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 2 in order for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2**
