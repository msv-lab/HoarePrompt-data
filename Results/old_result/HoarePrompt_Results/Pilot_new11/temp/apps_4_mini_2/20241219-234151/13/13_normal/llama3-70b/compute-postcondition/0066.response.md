The variable `beauty` is incremented by 1, but we do not have a previous value for `beauty` mentioned in the initial state. The values of `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged, and the condition related to the character of string `s` remains relevant. Therefore, the output state reflects the change to `beauty`:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and `beauty` is increased by 1.**
