The variable `beauty` is incremented by 1. The previous state of the other variables is unaffected, so `n`, `i`, `j`, and `s[j]` remain the same. The state of `j` remains valid as it continues to exceed `n` and `s[j]` still refers to 'G'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 100000`, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `-1`, `j` exceeds `n`, and the current value of `s[j]` is 'G'; `beauty` is increased by 1.**
