The line `prev_start, prev_end = segments[i - 1]` unpacks the values from the tuple at index `i - 1` of the list `segments` into the variables `prev_start` and `prev_end`. 

Initially, `i` is `2`, so `i - 1` evaluates to `1`. Therefore, this line accesses the second tuple in `segments` (considering zero-based indexing) and assigns its first element to `prev_start` and its second element to `prev_end`.

The values of variables `prev_start` and `prev_end` will be updated based on the content of `segments[1]`. The other variables such as `n`, `i`, and `curr_start`, `curr_end` remain unaffected.

Thus, the output will reflect the new values for `prev_start` and `prev_end` while preserving the other variables' states.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `i` is 2; `segments` contains more than one tuple; `prev_start` is the first element of the second tuple in `segments`; `prev_end` is the second element of the second tuple in `segments`; `curr_start` is the first element of the third tuple from `segments`; `curr_end` is the second element of the third tuple from `segments`.**
