According to the code, the loop iterates in reverse from `i - 1` to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, so the loop would have executed for `j = 0` (since it goes from `i - 1` (which is 0) to -1, where it stops). 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` would need to be incremented, as the current value of `i` (which is 1) has already been processed. The next iteration would be starting from the current value of `j`, which doesn't apply in this context since the loop will terminate once `j` is decremented. 

Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be increased to 2, and for the inner loop to run again, `j` would need to be at 1 (which would correspond to `i - 1` being 1). 

However, we also need to consider if breaking out of the loop occurs based on the condition of the character encountered. Given that the last executed `j` was 0, it's possible that the loop didn't break early due to the character at that index in string `s`.

To summarize for the loop to execute one more time:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 2, and if the character at index `j` of string `s` is 'G', `beauty` is increased by 1**.
