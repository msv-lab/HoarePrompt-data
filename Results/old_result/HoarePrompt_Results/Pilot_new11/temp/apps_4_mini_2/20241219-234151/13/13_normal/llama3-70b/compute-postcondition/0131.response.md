The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 100000`, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `n - 2`, `beauty` is 1, and the character at index `j` of string `s` is not 'G', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
