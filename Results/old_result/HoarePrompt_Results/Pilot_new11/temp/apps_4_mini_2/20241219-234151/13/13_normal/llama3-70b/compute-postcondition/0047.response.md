The statement `left += 1` increments the value of `left` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged, which means that `right` stays the same, `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty` remain unaffected, and the conditions on `n`, `s`, and `right` are still valid. The variable `left` will now be `left + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `s` is a string of length `n`, `max_beauty` is updated to max(`max_beauty`, `curr_beauty`), `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is `left + 1`, `right` remains unchanged, `right` is greater than or equal to `left + 1`, and `s[left]` must not be 'G'**.
