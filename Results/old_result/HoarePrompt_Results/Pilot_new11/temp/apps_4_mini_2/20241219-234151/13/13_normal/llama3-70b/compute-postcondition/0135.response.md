The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 100000`, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `n - 3`, and `beauty` can be either 1 or 2 depending on the character at index `j` of string `s`.
