The variable `curr_beauty` is incremented by 1. The values of `left`, `right`, `max_beauty`, and `s` remain unchanged. The conditions state that `left` is less than `right`, which is still valid post-execution. 

Since `curr_beauty` is updated, the output state reflects this change.

Output State: **`left` is equal to the index of the first 'G' in the string `s`, or `left` is equal to `n` if there are no 'G's; `right` remains equal to `n`; `curr_beauty` is increased by 1; `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and 0; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S'; the current value of `left` is less than the current value of `right`.**
