Postcondition: ***`n` remains an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; after all iterations, `i` is equal to `n`, indicating the entirety of the `trophies` string has been processed, and `segments` contains at least one tuple for a contiguous segment of 'G' characters found in the `trophies` string. If `segments` is not empty, the original string contains at least one 'G' character.***
