According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. The range of the for loop is defined as starting from `i - 1` and going down to `-1` (inclusive), which means the loop will execute if `i - 1` is greater than or equal to `0`. 

Given that `i` is `n - 2`, we can determine the minimum value of `n` that will allow the loop to run:

- Since `i` must be at least `1` for `i - 1` to be `0` or greater, this means `n` must be at least `3`, which fits within the constraint `2 <= n <= 100000`.

At the start of the loop, the values of `j` will be `i - 1` (which is `n - 3`), and `beauty` remains 1. 

To summarize, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that:
- `n` should be at least `3` (ensuring that `i - 1 >= 0`).
- Initially, `j` will be initialized to `n - 3`.

Thus, the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute are:

State: **`n` is an integer such that `n` >= 3; `i` is `n - 2`; `j` is `n - 3`; `max_beauty_one_swap` will continue to be updated; `beauty` is 1**
