You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Vova has won $n$ trophies in different competitions. Each trophy is either golden or silver. The trophies are arranged in a row.

The beauty of the arrangement is the length of the longest subsegment consisting of golden trophies. Vova wants to swap two trophies (not necessarily adjacent ones) to make the arrangement as beautiful as possible — that means, to maximize the length of the longest such subsegment.

Help Vova! Tell him the maximum possible beauty of the arrangement if he is allowed to do at most one swap.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^5$) — the number of trophies.

The second line contains $n$ characters, each of them is either G or S. If the $i$-th character is G, then the $i$-th trophy is a golden one, otherwise it's a silver trophy. 


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible length of a subsegment of golden trophies, if Vova is allowed to do at most one swap.


-----Examples-----
Input
10
GGGSGGGSGG

Output
7

Input
4
GGGG

Output
4

Input
3
SSS

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example Vova has to swap trophies with indices $4$ and $10$. Thus he will obtain the sequence "GGGGGGGSGS", the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies is $7$. 

In the second example Vova can make no swaps at all. The length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence is $4$. 

In the third example Vova cannot do anything to make the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence greater than $0$.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
trophies = data[1]
print(func_1(n, trophies))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000, and trophies is a string of length n containing only the characters 'G' and 'S'.
def func_1(n, trophies):
    segments = []
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if trophies[i] == 'G':
            start = i
            while i < n and trophies[i] == 'G':
                i += 1
            segments.append((start, i - 1))
        else:
            i += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` remains an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; after all iterations, `i` is equal to `n` (indicating the entirety of the `trophies` string has been processed), and `segments` contains tuples for each contiguous segment of 'G' characters found in the `trophies` string. If there are no 'G' characters, `segments` will be empty. The original string can have any combination of 'G' and 'S'.
    if (not segments) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0, indicating that there are no segments of 'G' characters found in the trophies string since segments is empty.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` remains an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; after all iterations, `i` is equal to `n`, indicating the entirety of the `trophies` string has been processed, and `segments` contains at least one tuple for a contiguous segment of 'G' characters found in the `trophies` string. If `segments` is not empty, the original string contains at least one 'G' character.
    max_length = max(end - start + 1 for start, end in segments)
    if (len(segments) == 1) :
        return max_length
        #The program returns the maximum length of contiguous 'G' segments in the string 'trophies'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` remains an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; after all iterations, `i` is equal to `n`, indicating the entirety of the `trophies` string has been processed, `segments` contains at least one tuple, `max_length` is the maximum length of contiguous 'G' segments in `trophies`, and `segments` contains more than one tuple.
    for i in range(1, len(segments)):
        prev_start, prev_end = segments[i - 1]
        
        curr_start, curr_end = segments[i]
        
        if curr_start - prev_end == 2:
            max_length = max(max_length, curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end -
                prev_start + 1) + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `i` is equal to `n - 1`; `segments` contains more than one tuple; `prev_start` and `prev_end` are the first and second elements of the tuple at index `n-2` in `segments`; `curr_start` and `curr_end` are the first and second elements of the tuple at index `n-1` in `segments`; `max_length` is the maximum length of contiguous 'G' segments in `trophies`, which may have been updated based on the conditions of the loop. If `segments` has no valid pairs where `curr_start - prev_end == 2`, then `max_length` remains as the maximum length calculated through the iterations.
    return min(max_length + 1, n)
    #The program returns the minimum value between max_length + 1 and n, where max_length is the maximum length of contiguous 'G' segments in trophies, and n is the integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n`, which represents the length of a string `trophies` containing characters 'G' and 'S'. It identifies all contiguous segments of 'G' characters in the string. If no 'G' segments are found, it returns 0. If there is at least one segment of 'G', it calculates the maximum length of these segments. If there is only one segment, it returns its length. If there are multiple segments, it checks for valid gaps (exactly one 'S') between segments of 'G' and may extend the maximum found segment length by including these gaps. Finally, it returns the minimum value between the maximum length found plus one (to account for a potential additional contiguous character) and `n`. This function effectively examines the structure of 'G' characters within the string and assesses how they can be combined, handling cases of no segments, a single segment, and multiple segments with gaps correctly.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
