The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 100000`, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `j` is `i + 3`, and `n` must be greater than `i + 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
