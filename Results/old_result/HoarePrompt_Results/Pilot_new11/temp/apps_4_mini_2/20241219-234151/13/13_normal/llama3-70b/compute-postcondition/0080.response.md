To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the provided information carefully:

1. The loop is constructed with the range determined by `i + 2` to `n`, which indicates that `j` will take values starting from `i + 2` up to `n - 1`.
2. The current value of `i` is such that `0 <= i < n - 2`. This means that `i + 2` must be less than `n`, allowing the loop to execute.
3. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to understand that `j` will increment by 1 starting from `i + 2`. The first value of `j` will be `i + 2`, and the subsequent execution will increment `j` to `i + 3`.

Thus, in order to execute the loop one more time, the following conditions hold:
- Since `j` starts at `i + 2`, for the loop to execute again, it must be that when `j` is `i + 2`, it holds that `i + 2 < n`. The next value of `j` will then be `i + 3`.
- Consequently, for the next execution, we need to ensure that `n` is at least `i + 3`, meaning `n` must be greater than `i + 2`.

Summarizing the adjustments:
- `j` should be set to `i + 2` for the next iteration of the loop,
- The condition on `n` must be `n` must be greater than `i + 2`.

Therefore, the modified state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000 and `i` is an index such that 0 <= `i` < `n - 2`, `j` is `i + 2`, and `n` must be greater than `i + 2`**.
