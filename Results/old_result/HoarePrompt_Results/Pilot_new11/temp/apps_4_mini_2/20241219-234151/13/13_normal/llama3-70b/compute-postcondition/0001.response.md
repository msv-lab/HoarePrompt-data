The value of `s` is assigned the input string, which consists of characters 'G' and 'S' and has a length of `n`, where `n` is an integer that satisfies the condition 2 <= n <= 100000. The state of the variable `n` remains unchanged as an integer within the defined bounds. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'**
