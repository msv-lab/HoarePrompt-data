To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we must analyze the initialization and conditions of the loop.

1. The loop is defined as `for j in range(i - 1, -1, -1):`. The starting value for `j` is `i - 1`, and the loop continues as long as `j` is greater than or equal to `-1`, decrementing `j` by 1 with each iteration.
2. From the provided state, `i` is `n - 1`. Therefore, the initial value of `j` would be `n - 2` (since `j` starts at `i - 1` which is `n - 1 - 1`).
3. For the loop to execute at least once, the starting value of `j` must be greater than or equal to 0. This leads us to the condition that `n - 2` must be greater than or equal to 0.
4. Thus, we derive the condition `n >= 2`, which is already met as per the specified range (`2 <= n <= 100000`).
5. The loop will start with `j` initialized to `n - 2`, which is the last valid index before counting down to -1.

Considering the information above, the `beauty` variable's initial value does not affect the loopâ€™s ability to run but we state it for completeness.

Thus, the adjusted states reflecting the necessary conditions for the loop to run are as follows:

State: **`n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 100000`, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `n - 2`, `beauty` is 1**
