According to the code, the loop executes in reverse starting from index `i - 1`, which is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, the loop needs to process index `j` equal to 0. The loop iterates as long as `j` is greater than or equal to 0. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, so `j` will be set to `0` for the next iteration. The current value of `n` remains unaffected as it is outside the loopâ€™s main purpose.

We also have to consider the character at index `j` of string `s`. If `j` is 0, we need to analyze that character according to the given conditions regarding the variable `beauty`. If the character is 'G', then `beauty` will be updated to 2, otherwise, it will remain 1.

Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, the adjustments would be:
- `j` is 0.
- We need to specify the character at index `0` of string `s`.

Thus the final state will be:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, the character at index `j` of string `s` is the character at index 0, resulting in a potential update to `beauty` based on that character.**
