According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `n`. In the provided state, `i` is such that `0 <= i < n - 2`, meaning that `i + 2` will always result in an index that is at least 2 less than `n`. 

After the last iteration of the loop, the index `j` will have been set to `i + 2` at the start of that iteration. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n`. Since `j` is calculated as `i + 2`, it must satisfy the condition `i + 2 < n`. This means that `i` must be less than `n - 2`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is currently at `i + 2`. To prepare for the next iteration, we need to increment `j` by 1. Thus, the next value of `j` will be `i + 3`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `j < n` must hold: 
- Since `j` will now be `i + 3`, we require `i + 3 < n`, or in other words, `i` must be less than `n - 3`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is an index such that 0 <= `i` < `n - 3`, and `j` is `i + 3`.**
