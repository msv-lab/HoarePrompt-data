Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, and `i` is 2. If the character at index `j` of string `s` is 'G', `beauty` is increased by 1. If the character at index `j` is not 'G', `beauty` is still increased by 1, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
