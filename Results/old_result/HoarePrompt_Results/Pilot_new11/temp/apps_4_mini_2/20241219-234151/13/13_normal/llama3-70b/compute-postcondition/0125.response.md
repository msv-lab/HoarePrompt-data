According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the limit defined by `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 2`, which means that it has reached its maximum value for this loop since the loop iterates until `i` is less than `n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to `n - 1`, but since this is the maximum value that `i` can take, the loop will terminate at this point.

Thus, to allow the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented to `n - 1`, and for it not to execute again (since `n - 1` is the end of the range), `n` must still fall within the determined limits. 

After that iteration:
- `i` will be `n - 1`
- The loop will not be able to execute if `i` equals `n - 1` (last valid index).

Therefore, the required conditions are:
- `n` remains an integer such that `2 <= n <= 100000`.
- `i` must be updated to `n - 1`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 100000`, `i` is `n - 1`**
