In this case, the provided code snippet is printing the maximum value between `max_beauty` and `max_beauty_one_swap`. However, no values for `max_beauty` or `max_beauty_one_swap` are given in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact output of the `print()` function since it depends on these two variables.

The execution of the print statement does not modify any variable values. It only outputs the maximum of the two variables, which are assumed to be defined previously in the code.

Thus, the output state consists of the unchanged initial state and the fact that a value reflecting the maximum of `max_beauty` and `max_beauty_one_swap` is printed, but since their individual values are not known, we can only describe it generally.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 100000`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum beauty obtainable with one swap of a 'G' and adjacent 'S', and a value equal to max(max_beauty, max_beauty_one_swap) is printed.**
