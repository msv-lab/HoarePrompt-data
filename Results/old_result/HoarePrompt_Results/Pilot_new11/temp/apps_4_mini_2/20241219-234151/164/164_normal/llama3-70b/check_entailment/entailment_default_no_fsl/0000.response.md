Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Specifically, there is an issue with the way the code checks for obstacles while hopping. It uses the modulus operator to check for valid cells but does not correctly account for boundaries of the string. 

For example, consider the following input:

```
7 3
G.#.T..
```

In this case, the grasshopper starts at index 0 (`G`), and the insect is at index 4 (`T`). The grasshopper can only jump to indices 3 (`#` - an obstacle) and 6 (which is an empty cell, but is not relevant since it cannot jump to a blocked cell). The expected output here should be "NO" since the path is blocked.

However, since the code uses a modular approach for checking whether the path is valid using `s[(g + i * k) % n]`, it completely ignores the obstacles that may prevent hopping directly to the target.

Similarly, for the input:

```
6 2
..GT..
```

The grasshopper can only jump to even indices, and since `T` (the insect) is at index 3 (an odd index), it will also output "NO", which is correct. But in previously mentioned test cases, it would output "YES" or not handle the error condition correctly due to bypassing bounds checking of obstacles.

Thus, there are situations where the code fails to identify the presence of obstacles correctly, leading to an incorrect output. Therefore, the overall correctness of the program, as it stands, is inaccurate and does not meet the specifications of the problem statement.
