The variable `reachable` is assigned the value `False`. The values of `n`, `k`, `line`, `G_pos`, and `T_pos` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n - 1`; `line` is a string of length `n` containing '.', '#', 'G', and 'T'; if `G_pos` is greater than `T_pos`, then `G_pos` is updated to the previous value of `T_pos`, and `T_pos` is updated to the previous value of `G_pos`, resulting in `G_pos` being less than `T_pos`; `reachable` is False.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n - 1`; `line` is a string of length `n` containing '.', '#', 'G', and 'T'; if `G_pos` is greater than `T_pos`, then `G_pos` is updated to the previous value of `T_pos`, and `T_pos` is updated to the previous value of `G_pos`, resulting in `G_pos` being less than `T_pos`; `reachable` is False.**
