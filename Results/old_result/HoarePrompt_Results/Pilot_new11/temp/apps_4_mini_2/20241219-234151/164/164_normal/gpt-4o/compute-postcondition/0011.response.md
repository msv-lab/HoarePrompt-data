Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n - 1`, `line` is a string of length `n` containing '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos`, and `reachable` is False. If `line[pos]` is a '#' character, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
