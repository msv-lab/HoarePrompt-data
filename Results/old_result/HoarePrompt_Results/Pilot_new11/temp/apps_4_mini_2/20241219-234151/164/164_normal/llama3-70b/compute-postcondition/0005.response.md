The variable `g` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the first input integer satisfying 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `k` is the second input integer satisfying 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1, `s` is an input string, `g` is 0, `t` is -1, `i` is 0. 

Output State: **`n` is the first input integer satisfying 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `k` is the second input integer satisfying 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1, `s` is an input string, `g` is 0, `t` is -1, `i` is 0**
