The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Since `reachable` is initialized as False and there are no updates to any other variables or states, we retain their values. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n - 1, `line` is a string of length `n` containing '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', `G_pos` is the position of 'G', `T_pos` is the position of 'T', `pos` is `G_pos + k`, and `reachable` is False. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n - 1, `line` is a string of length `n` containing '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', `G_pos` is the position of 'G', `T_pos` is the position of 'T', `pos` is `G_pos + k`, and `reachable` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
