The code initializes the values of `g` and `t` to -1. The initial values of `n`, `k`, and `s` are not affected by this code snippet, but they remain defined by their respective input conditions.

Output State: **`n` is the first input integer satisfying 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `k` is the second input integer satisfying 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1; `s` is an input string; `g` is -1; `t` is -1.**
