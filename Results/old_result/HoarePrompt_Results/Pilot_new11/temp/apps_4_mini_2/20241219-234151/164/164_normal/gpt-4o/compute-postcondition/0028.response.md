In analyzing the given code and the structure of the loop, we can determine the output state after all iterations of the loop.

The loop iterates from `G_pos` to `T_pos` with a step of `k`. The loop continues until one of the following occurs:
1. A '#' character is encountered, at which point the loop breaks.
2. The position `pos` equals `T_pos`, which sets `reachable` to `True` and breaks the loop.

The loop will execute as long as there are valid positions starting from `G_pos`, which is less than or equal to `T_pos`, and will stop executing based on the mentioned conditions. 

Considering the constraints provided (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n - 1;`, `G_pos` must be less than or equal to `T_pos` and the characters under evaluation), the output state after all iterations of the loop finishes would be:

- `reachable` will be `True` if `G_pos` can reach `T_pos` without encountering a '#' character in those positions. 
- If `T_pos` is encountered during the iterations, `reachable` will be set to `True`. 
- If a '#' character is encountered before reaching `T_pos`, `reachable` will remain `False`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n - 1;` `line` is a string of length `n` containing '.', '#', 'G', and 'T'; `G_pos` is the position of 'G'; `T_pos` is the position of 'T'; if `G_pos` can reach `T_pos` without hitting a '#', then `reachable` is True; otherwise, `reachable` is False.**
