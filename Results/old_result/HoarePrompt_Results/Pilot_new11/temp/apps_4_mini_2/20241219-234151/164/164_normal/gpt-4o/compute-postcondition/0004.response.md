Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n - 1; `line` is a string of length `n` containing '.', '#', 'G', and 'T'; `G_pos` is the index of 'G' in `line`; `T_pos` is the index of 'T' in `line`. The current value of `G_pos` is greater than the current value of `T_pos`.***
