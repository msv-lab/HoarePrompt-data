The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or conditional statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State remains the same, with the information indicating that a break occurred. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n - 1`, `line` is a string of length `n` containing '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos`, `reachable` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
