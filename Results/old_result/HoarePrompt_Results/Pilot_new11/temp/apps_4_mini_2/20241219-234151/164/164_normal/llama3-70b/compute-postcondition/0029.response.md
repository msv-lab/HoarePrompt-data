Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer satisfying 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `k` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` - 1; `s` is a string of length `n`; `g` is the index of the last occurrence of 'G' in `s`, and `g` is not equal to -1; `t` is the index of the last occurrence of 'T' in `s`, and `t` is not equal to -1. If the absolute difference `abs(t - g)` is divisible by `k` and there are no '#' characters in the positions `s[(g + i * k) % n]` for `i` in the range from 0 to `abs(t - g) // k`, then "YES" has been printed; otherwise, the output is 'NO'.***
