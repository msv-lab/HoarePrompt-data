According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `i`, which starts at 2 and goes up to `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`. For the loop to execute, `int(num ** 0.5)` must be at least 2, which means `num` must be at least 4. Since we have the condition that `num` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ num ≤ 1000 and num is greater than or equal to 2, we need to ensure that `num` is at least 4. 

If `num` is 4 or greater, then `i` will start at 2. At the beginning of the loop, the necessary conditions will be met. 

Thus, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure `num` is at least 4, and `i` will be initialized to 2.

State: **`num` is a positive integer such that 4 ≤ `num` ≤ 1000, `i` is 2**
