Correctness: **False**

The program aims to disprove PolandBall's hypothesis by finding a value of `m` such that the expression `n*m + 1` is not a prime number. However, a critical failure occurs due to the prime-checking function `func_1`, specifically in its handling of the input value `1`.

According to the program:
- For `n = 1`, when `m = 1`, we calculate `1*1 + 1 = 2`, which is a prime number. However, the function would only return `False` for values less than or equal to `1`, but yields `True` for `2`. The next value, `m = 2`, would produce `1*2 + 1 = 3`, again a prime number. This leads to a situation where the program fails to find a non-prime value for `m` and could get stuck in an infinite loop if it were only searching for a counterexample.

The output hints indicate that the prime-checking logic is mostly sound, but due to the failure to handle this specific case appropriately when `n = 1`, it shows that the program does not meet the overall requirements to always succeed in disproving the hypothesis for all permissible values of `n`. Therefore, there exist values of `m` for which `n*m + 1` will always yield a prime number.

Overall, since even one scenario exists where the program does not fulfill the requirements, the result is `Correctness: False`.
