Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains a logical flaw that can cause it to not find a suitable `m` even though a counterexample exists for the specified `n`.

Consider the structure of the program: it iterates through values of `m` from 1 to 1000, and for each `m`, it calculates `n * m + 1`, checking if this result is not prime using the function `func_1`. However, the `func_1` is defined after it is used, which would lead to a `NameError` if executed as it is. Additionally, the output of the program lacks handling for the case where no non-prime numbers are found within the range, even though it is guaranteed that an answer exists.

For an explicit counterexample, when `n = 1`, the program checks:
- For `m = 1`: `1 * 1 + 1 = 2` (prime)
- For `m = 2`: `1 * 2 + 1 = 3` (prime)
- For `m = 3`: `1 * 3 + 1 = 4` (not prime - but the program will find this correctly). 

However, since the function `func_1` is called before it is defined, it will raise an error rather than returning any result for larger tests. Thus, by Python's rules, this results in a failure to execute correctly.

To summarize: the program will not work correctly in any case due to the placement of `func_1` and can malfunction based on the input values. Therefore, the correctness of the program is deemed **False**.
