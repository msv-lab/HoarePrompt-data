Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly find a counterexample for the hypothesis presented by PolandBall. Here are the reasons why it fails to meet the requirements of the problem description:

1. **Counterexample Requirement**: The requirement is to find a positive integer \( m \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is **not** a prime number. The program starts with \( m = 1 \) and checks \( n \cdot m + 1 \) using the function `func_1`. This function will return `True` if the number is prime, and the program continues the loop until it finds a number that is not prime (returns `False`).

2. **Range of \( m \)**: The loop is set to iterate from 1 to 1000, which is in line with the requirement (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000). However, not every suitable \( m \) value leads to a valid counterexample as the program incorrectly outputs the first instance where \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not prime. 

3. **Output Uncertainty**: The program relies on evaluating only the first \( m \) that meets the condition. There might be larger integer values satisfying the condition that are not being checked. While it is likely that the program will find a non-prime candidate at some point, this does not guarantee that it properly fulfills the requirement of "finding a counterexample for any n".

4. **Implementation Issue**: The check for primality in the function `func_1` is logically correct, but due to the structure of the main loop with `break`, it might prematurely end the search for a larger \( m \) that could yield more counterexamples.

5. **Counterexample Guarantee**: The problem states that a counterexample exists for any given \( n \) but does not assure that the first found will always meet the counterexample requirements, especially if the output is required to be diverse across multiple runs with different \( n \) values.

In summary, while the program does return an \( m \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not prime for some values of \( n \), it does not guarantee correctness across all tests nor does it effectively illustrate how it can counter PolandBall's hypothesis in all cases. Thus, it fails to meet the strict requirements outlined in the problem description.
