The provided program attempts to find an integer `m` such that `n * m + 1` is not a prime number, while `n` is given as input within the specified range. 

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n` from input. The input is guaranteed to be within the range of 1 to 1000, as stated in the problem description.
  
2. **Looping through `m`**: The program iterates `m` from 1 to 1000. For each `m`, it computes `n * m + 1` and passes the result to the function `func_1`, which checks if the number is prime.

3. **Prime Checking Function**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly determines whether the number is prime or not:
     - It returns `False` for numbers less than or equal to 1 (which would not affect the valid input range given in the problem description).
     - It correctly identifies 2 and 3 as prime.
     - For numbers greater than 3, it checks if the number is divisible by 2 or 3, and if not, it checks further divisibility using the 6k Â± 1 rule.
  
4. **Finding a Counterexample**: If `func_1` identifies that `n * m + 1` is not prime, it will print `m` and break the loop. The problem guarantees that there exists at least one suitable `m` in the range.

### Conclusion:
The program follows the problem description by effectively finding and reporting an integer `m` that makes `n * m + 1` a non-prime number. The function for checking primality operates correctly according to the established definitions of prime numbers. Given that the input is validated (as per the problem constraints), the program does not have edge case handling issues.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the requirements as specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
