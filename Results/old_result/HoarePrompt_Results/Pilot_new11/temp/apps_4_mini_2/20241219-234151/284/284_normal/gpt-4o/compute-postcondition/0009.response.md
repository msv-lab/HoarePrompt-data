`i` is assigned the value 5. The variable `x` remains as a positive integer with the constraints that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 1000, `x` is greater than 3, and `x` is neither divisible by 2 nor divisible by 3. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 1000, `x` is greater than 3, and `x` is neither divisible by 2 nor divisible by 3; `i` is 5.

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 1000, `x` is greater than 3, and `x` is neither divisible by 2 nor divisible by 3; `i` is 5.**
