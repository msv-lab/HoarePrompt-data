According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. The loop continues to execute as long as \( i \times i \) is less than or equal to \( x \). 

At the end of the last iteration, \( i \) is 17. Therefore, \( i \times i = 17 \times 17 = 289 \). For the loop to execute one more time, \( x \) must be at least 289. 

Currently, we know that \( x \) is at least 121, and there is no upper bound provided, but it must be adjusted to ensure \( x \geq 289 \) so that \( i \times i \leq x \) holds true. As such, the state that can be modified is \( x \), which should now be at least 289.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`x` must be at least 289, `i` is 17**
