To verify the correctness of the provided program that seeks a counterexample for the hypothesis given by PolandBall, we need to analyze the program in detail.

The program intends to find a positive integer \( m \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number. It iterates through values of \( m \) from 1 to 1000 and uses a helper function `func_1` to determine if the computed value \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is prime.

### Key points to analyze:

1. **Functional Definition of Prime**: The function `func_1` checks if a number \( x \) is prime:
    - It returns `False` for numbers less than or equal to 1.
    - For numbers 2 and 3, it returns `True`.
    - It then checks divisibility by 2 and 3, returning `False` for multiples.
    - For larger numbers, it checks divisibility against potential factors from 5 up to the square root of \( x \).

2. **Finding a Non-Prime \( n \cdot m + 1 \)**:
    - The program loops through \( m \) from 1 to 1000, checking if \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not prime.
    - Once it finds such \( m \), it outputs and breaks from the loop.

### Edge Cases:
- We need to consider both small values and large values of \( n \) as well as edge cases when \( m \) is 1 or primes in specific ranges.
- The guarantees state that there always exists an \( m \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not prime for \( n \) values between 1 and 1000.

### Potential Case:
Letâ€™s run through a few examples to ensure the logic is correct:

- **Example n = 1**:
    - \( m = 1 \) gives \( 1 \cdot 1 + 1 = 2 \) (prime).
    - \( m = 2 \) gives \( 1 \cdot 2 + 1 = 3 \) (prime).
    - \( m = 3 \) gives \( 1 \cdot 3 + 1 = 4 \) (not prime).
    - Program will output `3`.

- **Example n = 2**:
    - \( m = 1 \) gives \( 2 \cdot 1 + 1 = 3 \) (prime).
    - \( m = 2 \) gives \( 2 \cdot 2 + 1 = 5 \) (prime).
    - \( m = 3 \) gives \( 2 \cdot 3 + 1 = 7 \) (prime).
    - \( m = 4 \) gives \( 2 \cdot 4 + 1 = 9 \) (not prime).
    - Program will output `4`.

- **Example n = 1000**:
    - Directly checking for \( m = 1 \): \( 1000 \cdot 1 + 1 = 1001 \) (not prime).
    - Program will output `1`.

### Conclusion:
The correctness of the program holds as it identifies a suitable \( m \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is non-prime. The algorithm effectively explores probable \( m \) values while leveraging proper prime-checking standards.

After thorough consideration of various \( n \) and \( m \), I find no inputs where the program fails to meet the premise specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
