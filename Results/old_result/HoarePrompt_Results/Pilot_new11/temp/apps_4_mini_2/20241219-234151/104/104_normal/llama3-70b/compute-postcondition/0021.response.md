To determine the output state after executing the given code, we analyze the impact on the variables based on the initial state.

- The value of `max_erase` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `j - i - 1`.
- We know that `j` is 3 and `i` is 1. Therefore, we calculate `j - i - 1`:
  - `j - i - 1` = `3 - 1 - 1` = `1`.
- This means that we are comparing the previous value of `max_erase` with `1`.

The updated value of `max_erase` becomes the maximum between its previous value (unknown, but can be represented as `max_erase_prev`) and `1`:
- `max_erase = max(max_erase_prev, 1)`.

Since `n` must be at least 3, it does not affect the output.

Now we summarize the unchanged variables and the updated `max_erase`:

Output State: **`max_erase` is updated to the maximum value between its previous value and 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, and `n` must be at least 3**.
