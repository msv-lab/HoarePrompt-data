According to the code, the loop will repeat while the index `i` is in the range from 1 to `n-1` (as `range(1, n)` generates values from 1 to `n-1`). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and since `n` is greater than 1, `i` can be incremented to 2 for the next iteration. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` must become 2. With `i` set to 2, the loop will check if it is still within the bounds imposed by `n`, and since `n` is greater than 1, `i` is less than `n`.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000, `max_erase` is the maximum value between 0 and (a[1] - a[0] - 1), `i` is 2**
