Postcondition: ***`max_erase` remains unchanged or is updated to the maximum of its current value or 1; `i` is 2; `j` is 4; and `n` is greater than or equal to 3. If the condition holds true where for all k in the range from i to j, the difference `a[k] - a[i]` equals `k - i`, `max_erase` might be updated, otherwise it remains unchanged.***
