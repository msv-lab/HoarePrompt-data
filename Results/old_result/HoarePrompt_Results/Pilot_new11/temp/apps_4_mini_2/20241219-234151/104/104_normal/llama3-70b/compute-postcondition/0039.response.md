Output State: **`max_erase` is the maximum value of `j - i - 1` for all valid indices `i` and `j` such that the condition `all(a[k] - a[i] == k - i for k in range(i, j))` holds true, where `n` is the length of the list `a` and `a` is a list of integers satisfying `1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000`. If the loop does not execute, `max_erase` remains 0.**
