The variable `max_erase` is updated to the maximum value between its previous value and `j - i - 1`. Here, `i` is 1 and `j` is 4, so `j - i - 1` evaluates to `4 - 1 - 1`, which is `2`. 

The condition states that `max_erase` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `2`. Since we do not have the previous value of `max_erase`, we simply state that it is updated according to this comparison. 

The state of other variables, `i`, `j`, and `n`, remains the same.

Output State: **`max_erase` updated to the maximum value between its previous value and 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, `n` must be at least 4**
