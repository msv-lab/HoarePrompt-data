The line of code updates the value of `max_erase` using `max()`, which compares the current value of `max_erase` to the result of the expression `j - i - 1`. The current values are `i` = 2 and `j` = 4, so the expression evaluates as follows:

- `j - i - 1` = `4 - 2 - 1` = `1`.

Since `max_erase` is compared to the calculated value of `1`, `max_erase` will be updated to the maximum of its current value and `1`. If `max_erase` is previously less than or equal to `1`, it’s updated to `1`; if it’s greater than `1`, it remains unchanged.

No other variables change state.

Output State: **`max_erase` remains unchanged or is updated to the maximum of its current value or 1; `i` is 2; `j` is 4; `n` is greater than or equal to 3.**
