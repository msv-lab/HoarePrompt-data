#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer between 1 and 45, k is an integer between 1 and 45, M is a non-negative integer up to 2·10^9, and t is a list of k integers where each integer is between 1 and 1,000,000.
def func():
    n, k, M = map(int, input().split())
    t = list(map(int, input().split()))
    t.sort()
    dp = [([0] * (M + 1)) for _ in range(k + 1)]
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        for j in range(1, M + 1):
            dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]
            if j >= t[i - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is between 1 and 45, `k` is between 1 and 45, `M` is up to 2·10^9; `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers inputted by the user; `dp[k][j]` contains the maximum number of times the items can be used to reach each value from 0 to `M`, reflecting all combinations of the first `k` items.
    print(sum(dp[i][M] for i in range(k + 1)) + sum(1 for i in range(k + 1) if 
    dp[i][M] == i))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four parameters: n (an integer between 1 and 45), k (an integer between 1 and 45), M (a non-negative integer up to 2·10^9), and t (a list of k integers where each integer is between 1 and 1,000,000). It computes the maximum number of combinations of the elements in the list t that can sum to different values up to M, using dynamic programming to account for all possible ways to select the items. After executing, the function outputs an integer representing the total number of ways to achieve exactly M using the elements of t, along with an additional count of how many times these combinations include all available items. Since the input to t is sorted, the function efficiently utilizes this property while determining its output. The function does not return a value but directly prints the computed result. Edge cases such as when k or M are zero would need explicit handling to avoid erroneous calculations, but as per the code, there is no explicit check for such scenarios.
