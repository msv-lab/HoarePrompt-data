Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 45, `k` is between 1 and 45, `M` is at least 1, and `dp[k + 1][j]` contains the maximum number of times the items can be used to reach each value from 1 to `M`, with earlier items considered. If `j` is less than `t[i - 1]`, then `dp[k + 1][j]` will reflect the values from the previous row, while for values `j` greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`, it will take the maximum of its current value and the corresponding value from the previous row adjusted for the current item's value.**
