According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `k`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has reached a value of either `1` to `k` inclusive. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be increased to the next integer, meaning `i` will become `i + 1`. 

For the loop to run again, the new value of `i` must still be less than or equal to `k`. Therefore, at the starting of the next iteration, `i` should be increased by 1 and the condition should hold that `i + 1` is less than or equal to `k`. Given that `k` is between 1 and 45, the new value of `i` must be such that after incrementing it, it remains in the range, specifically `i` should become `2` if it was `1`, or up to `k` depending on its current value.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 45, `k` is between 1 and 45, `M` is at least 1, and `dp[k + 1][j]` contains the maximum number of times the items can be used to reach each value from 1 to `M`, for the loop to execute again `i` must be incremented by 1, and thus `i` is currently `2` if it were `1`, or up to `k` if it were at maximum.**
