The code `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]` assigns the value of `dp[i][j - 1]` to `dp[i][j]`. In the initial state, `i` is 1 and `j` is 1. Therefore, `dp[1][1]` will be assigned the value of `dp[1][0]`. 

Since `dp` was initialized to be a list of lists with dimensions `(k + 1) x (M + 1)` all set to 0, it follows that `dp[1][0]` is 0. Thus, `dp[1][1]` will also become 0 after this assignment.

No other variables are affected. So, the output state reflects that `dp[1][1]` is now 0.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 45, `k` is between 1 and 45, `M` is up to 2Â·10^9 (must be greater than 0), `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers inputted by the user, `dp` has `dp[1][1]` equal to 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 1**.
