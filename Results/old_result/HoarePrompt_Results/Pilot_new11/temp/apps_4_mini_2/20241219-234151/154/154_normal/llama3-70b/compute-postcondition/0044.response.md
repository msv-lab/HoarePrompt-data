According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `M` and `j`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `M`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and `M` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, which makes `j` equal to 3. For the loop to continue executing, `M` must be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 45, `k` is between 1 and 45, `M` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 3**
