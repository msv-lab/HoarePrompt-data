Postcondition: ***`n` is such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45, `k` is such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45, `M` is between 0 and 2·10^9, `t` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of `t`, `max_points` is equal to `max(0, max_subtasks_for_this_task)`, `complete_tasks` is 1, `time_used` is equal to `total_time_per_task`, `points` is equal to `k + 1`, `subtasks_solved` is equal to `2 * max_subtasks_for_this_task`, `subtask_time` is the third element in the list `t`, and `remaining_time` is reduced by `max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time` if `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`.***
