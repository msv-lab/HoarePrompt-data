The variable `points` is assigned the value of `complete_tasks` multiplied by `k + 1`. Given that `complete_tasks` is 2 and `points` is equal to `k + 1`, we can calculate that `points` will become `2 * (k + 1)`. 

Therefore, after the execution of the code, the updated value of `points` is `2 * (k + 1)`, while all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 45, `k` is such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45, `M` is between 0 and 2·10^9, `t` is a list of integers with `k` elements, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of `t`, `max_points` is equal to `k + 1`, `complete_tasks` is 2, `points` is equal to 2 * (k + 1), `remaining_time` is less than 0, and `subtasks_solved` remains 0.**
