The line of code initializes a two-dimensional list `dp` with dimensions `(k + 1)` by `(M + 1)`. Each element is initially set to `0`. The initial values of `n`, `k`, and `M` provide the boundaries for constructing the `dp` list, but these values do not change. The variable `t` remains unaffected as well since the code does not manipulate it. Therefore, `dp` becomes a list of lists with all values initialized to `0`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 45; `k` is an integer between 1 and 45; `M` is a non-negative integer up to 2Â·10^9; `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers inputted by the user; `dp` is a list of lists with dimensions `(k + 1) x (M + 1)`, initialized to `0`.**
