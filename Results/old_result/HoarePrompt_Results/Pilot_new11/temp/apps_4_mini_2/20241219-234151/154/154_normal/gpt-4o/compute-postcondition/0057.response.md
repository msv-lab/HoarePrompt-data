The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 45, `k` is such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45, `M` is between 0 and 2·10^9, `t` is a list of integers with `k` elements, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of `t`, `max_points` is equal to `k + 1`, `complete_tasks` is 2, `time_used` is equal to `2 * total_time_per_task`, `points` is equal to `k + 1`, `remaining_time` is less than 0, `subtasks_solved` remains 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
