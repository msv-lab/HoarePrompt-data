The code snippet `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]` is assigning the value from the previous column in the same row of the 2D list `dp` to the current position in that same row. 

The variable `j` is currently equal to 2. This means that `dp[i][j]` (i.e., `dp[i][2]`) will take its value from `dp[i][1]`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `M` are not directly affected, but the state of `dp` changes for the specific indices mentioned.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 45, `k` is between 1 and 45, `M` must be at least 2, `j` is 2, `dp[i][2]` is equal to `dp[i][1]`.**
