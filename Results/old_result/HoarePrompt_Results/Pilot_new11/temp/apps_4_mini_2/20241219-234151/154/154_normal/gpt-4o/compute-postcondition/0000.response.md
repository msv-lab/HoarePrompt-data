The variable `total_time_per_task` is assigned the value of the sum of the elements in the list `t`. Since `t` contains `k` integers, and this operation calculates the total time required for all tasks represented in the list. The initial state includes the bounds on `n`, `k`, and `M`, and ensures that the validity of the list `t` remains intact. Therefore, the state of the other variables is not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45; `M` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `M` ≤ 2·10^9; `t` is a list of `k` integers where each integer `t[j]` (1 ≤ `j` ≤ `k`) is in the range 1 ≤ `t[j]` ≤ 1000000; `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the elements in the list `t`.**
