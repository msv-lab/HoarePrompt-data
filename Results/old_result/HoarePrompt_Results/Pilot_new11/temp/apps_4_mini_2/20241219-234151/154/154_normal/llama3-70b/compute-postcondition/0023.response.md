The variable `dp[i][j]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the value `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `M`, `j`, `dp[i][j - 1]`, `t[i - 1]`, etc.) remain unchanged. The operation implies that `j` is sufficient to allow indexing into `t` and `dp`.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 45, `k` is between 1 and 45, `M` must be at least 1, `j` is 1, `dp[i][j]` is equal to max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1)**
