Postcondition: ***`n` is such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45, `k` is such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45, `M` is between 0 and 2·10^9, `t` is a list of `k` integers in the range 1 ≤ `t[j]` ≤ 1000000, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the elements in the list `t`, `max_points` is 0, `complete_tasks` is 0, `time_used` is greater than `M`, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
