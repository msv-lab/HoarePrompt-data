Postcondition: ***`n` is such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45, `k` is such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45, `M` is between 0 and 2·10^9, `t` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of `t`, `max_points` is equal to `max(0, max_subtasks_for_this_task)`, `complete_tasks` is 1, `time_used` is equal to `total_time_per_task`, `points` is equal to `k + 1`, `subtasks_solved` is equal to `max_subtasks_for_this_task`, and if `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`, then `remaining_time` is increased by a positive value `(-max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time)` where `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is a negative integer.***
