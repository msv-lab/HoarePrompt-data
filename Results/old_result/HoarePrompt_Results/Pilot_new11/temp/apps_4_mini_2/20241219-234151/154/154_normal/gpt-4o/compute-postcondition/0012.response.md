`max_subtasks_for_this_task` is assigned the value of `remaining_time // subtask_time`. Given that `remaining_time` is less than 0 and `subtask_time` is the first element in `t`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` will be 0 since the integer division of a negative number by a positive number results in 0. All other variables retain their previous states. 

Output State: **`n` is such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45, `k` is such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45, `M` is between 0 and 2·10^9, `t` is a list of at least 1 integer, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the elements in `t`, `max_points` is 0, `complete_tasks` is 0, `time_used` is greater than `M`, `points` is 0, `remaining_time` is less than 0, `subtasks_solved` is 0, `subtask_time` is the first element in `t`, and `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is 0.**
