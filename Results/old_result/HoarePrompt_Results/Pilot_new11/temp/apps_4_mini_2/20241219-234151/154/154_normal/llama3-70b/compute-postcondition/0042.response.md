The value of `dp[i][j]` is updated based on the maximum of its current value and the expression `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`. Given that `i` is `2` and `j` is `2`, we evaluate this for the specific values:

- Since `dp[2][2]` is being assigned a value based on `max(dp[2][2], dp[1][2 - t[1]] + 1)`, we need to know the following:
  - `dp[2][2]` is initially equal to `dp[2][1]`.
  - The value of `t[i - 1]` where `i` is `2`, means we will be using `t[1]`.

Now, since `dp[2][2]` will compare its current value with `dp[1][2 - t[1]] + 1`, we have to examine the potential change based on the given conditions.

However, since the exact values of `t` and `dp` other than `dp[2][2] = dp[2][1]` are not specified, the best illustrative output state would describe this comparison without specific numerical results.

Since `dp[2][j]` will potentially be updated to a higher value based on this comparison, and no specific previous value for `dp[2][1]` or `t[1]` is defined, we acknowledge the comparative relationship.

Thus, the output state can be summarized as follows:
Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 45, `k` is between 1 and 45, `M` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `dp[2][2]` will be updated based on `max(dp[2][1], dp[1][2 - t[1]] + 1)`**
