Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements as per the problem description. The task requires the function to calculate the maximum number of points Polycarp can earn from solving subtasks, which not only counts the solved subtasks but also adds an extra point for completely solving each task.

1. The current implementation uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate how many subtasks can be completed with the available time \( M \), but it lacks a clear separation of tasks and does not correctly account for the additional points awarded for fully completing any tasks.
   
2. The line `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1)` counts the number of subtasks solved but does not handle how points are accumulated based on the number of entirely completed tasks.

3. Later, the program attempts to add an extra point for completed tasks with `sum(1 for i in range(k + 1) if dp[i][M] == i)`, but this doesn't accurately reflect all scenarios, particularly when it comes to the combination of subtasks completed and multiple total tasks. 

4. The solution must independently evaluate maximum points considering additional points for solved tasks, which the current implementation fails to do.

Thus, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description correctly.
