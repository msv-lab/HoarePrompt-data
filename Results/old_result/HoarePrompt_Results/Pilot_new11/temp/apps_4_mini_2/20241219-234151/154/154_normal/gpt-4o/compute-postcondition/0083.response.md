The function `func_1` accepts parameters `n`, `k`, `M`, and `t`. The parameter `n` is an integer in the range 1 to 45, `k` is an integer in the range 1 to 45, `M` is a non-negative integer in the range 0 to 2Â·10^9, and `t` is a list of `k` integers where each integer is in the range 1 to 1,000,000. After executing the function body, it returns the maximum possible points achievable based on the number of complete tasks (`n`) and the maximum points calculated from the relevant parameters. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `k`, `M`, and `t`, then returns the maximum possible points achievable based on the number of complete tasks `n` and related calculations.**
