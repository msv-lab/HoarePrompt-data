    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is between 1 and 45, `k` is between 1 and 45, `M` is between 0 and 2·10^9, `t` is a list of `k` integers, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the elements in `t`, `max_points` is the maximum possible points achievable based on complete_tasks and subtasks solved, `complete_tasks` is `n`, `time_used` is equal to `n * total_time_per_task`, `points` is equal to `(n * (k + 1))`, `remaining_time` is non-negative or zero (if the total time used is less than or equal to M), and `subtasks_solved` is equal to the maximum number of subtasks that can be solved within the remaining time.
    return max_points
    #The program returns the maximum possible points achievable based on complete_tasks and subtasks solved, where complete_tasks is `n` and `max_points` is calculated based on the relevant parameters.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `n` (the number of complete tasks), `k` (the number of subtasks per task), `M` (the maximum available time), and `t` (a list of integers representing the time needed for each subtask). It calculates and returns the maximum possible points that can be achieved based on completing the specified number of tasks and solving as many subtasks as time allows within `M`. The function iterates through all possible numbers of complete tasks (from 0 to `n`), checking the time required for those tasks against `M`. If the time used exceeds `M`, it stops further calculations. For each possible complete task count, it calculates points and subsequently evaluates how many subtasks can be solved with the remaining time, ultimately determining the maximum points obtainable. The function also handles edge cases such as when no time is available for subtasks or when the total time for complete tasks exceeds `M` from the start, allowing it to return 0 points in those scenarios. It ensures the number of subtasks solved does not exceed feasible limits based on the remaining capacity.
