Postcondition: ***`n` is such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 45, `k` is such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45, `M` is between 0 and 2·10^9, `t` is a list of integers with `k` elements, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of `t`, `max_points` is equal to `k + 1`, `complete_tasks` is 2, `points` is equal to `k + 1`, `remaining_time` is less than 0, and `subtasks_solved` remains 0. If `time_used` is greater than `M`, the program will break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the variables remain unchanged as there is no else part.***
