Final: **False** 

The program fails to properly account for the total number of tasks `n` when calculating points, which is a critical aspect of the problem description. The original assessment correctly identifies this flaw. The output hints suggest that the function computes combinations to maximize subtasks but do not remedy the oversight regarding the limited number of tasks Polycarp can utilize within the allotted time `M`. Thus, the program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description, validating the conclusion that it is incorrect.
