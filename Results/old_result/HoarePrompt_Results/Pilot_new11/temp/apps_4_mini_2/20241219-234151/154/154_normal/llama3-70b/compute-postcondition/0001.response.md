The `t` list is assigned the values from the input, which are converted to integers. Since `k` indicates the number of integers to read, `t` will consist of `k` integers from the user input. The variables `n`, `k`, and `M` remain valid based on their initial conditions, and their values might impact the user input but are not directly modified by the code. Therefore, we only update the `t` list according to the input size `k`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 45, `k` is an integer between 1 and 45, `M` is a non-negative integer up to 2Â·10^9, `t` is a list of k integers inputted by the user.**
