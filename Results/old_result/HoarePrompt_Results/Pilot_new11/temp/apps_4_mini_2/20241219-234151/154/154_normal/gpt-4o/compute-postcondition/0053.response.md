The value of `subtasks_solved` is updated to be the minimum of its current value (which is 0) and the product of `(n - complete_tasks)` and `k`. Since `complete_tasks` is 1, the expression `(n - complete_tasks)` evaluates to `(n - 1)`, and `subtasks_solved` will be computed as `min(0, (n - 1) * k)`. Given that `subtasks_solved` is already 0, it remains unchanged regardless of the values of `n` and `k`.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45, `k` is such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45, `M` is between 0 and 2·10^9, `t` is a list of integers with `k` elements, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of `t`, `max_points` is equal to 0, `complete_tasks` is 1, `time_used` is equal to `total_time_per_task`, `points` is equal to `k + 1`, `remaining_time` is equal to `M - total_time_per_task` and remains less than 0, and `subtasks_solved` remains 0.**
