The code `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]` assigns the value of `dp[i][j - 1]` to `dp[i][j]`. This means that `dp[i][j]` is set to the value it previously held from the column immediately to the left (j-1). The initial conditions state that for `j` equals 2, the existing values of `dp` are based on its previous row or the maximum condition mentioned.

As nothing else is specified for the values in the `dp` table besides what was stated in the initial conditions, and since we're setting `dp[i][j]` to `dp[i][j - 1]`, all other variable values remain unchanged.

The valid context remains the constraints on `n`, `k`, `M`, and `t`, as well as the specific initialization of certain `dp` values. 

Thus, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 45; `k` is between 1 and 45; `M` is up to 2Â·10^9 (must be greater than or equal to 2); `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers inputted by the user; `dp[1][1]` is equal to 0; `dp[i][2]` is equal to dp[i][1]**.
