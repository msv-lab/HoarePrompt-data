Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the case when Polycarp can complete more tasks but still has remaining time to solve additional subtasks from already completed tasks.

For example, consider the input:
```
n = 3
k = 4
M = 10
t = [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

According to the problem statement, Polycarp can complete all subtasks of one task in 10 minutes and will earn 5 points (4 from the subtasks and 1 additional for completing the task). However, the maximum points he can actually earn should also consider how he can utilize the remaining time on available subtasks of the remaining tasks.

The program only computes points based on complete tasks and does not account for the situation when solving the maximum number of subtasks for the remaining tasks after completely solving a task. If it had implemented that correctly, it could recognize that he could also solve 1 subtask of the second task after completing the first one.

This can lead to scenarios where the actual maximum points are greater than what the program calculates. Therefore, the logic in the function is flawed because it does not fully explore the potential scoring through subtasks after calculating complete tasks.

For the mentioned input, we could expect an output of 6 as he completes one entire task and solves 1 subtask from the second task. However, the program might generate a suboptimal result if it's unable to account for such overlapping subtasks effectively due to the incorrect handling of available remaining time after solving complete tasks. 

Hence, the program does not meet the requirements in every potential case, leading to determining its correctness as incorrect (False).
