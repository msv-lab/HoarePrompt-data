You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp takes part in a math show. He is given n tasks, each consists of k subtasks, numbered 1 through k. It takes him t_{j} minutes to solve the j-th subtask of any task. Thus, time required to solve a subtask depends only on its index, but not on the task itself. Polycarp can solve subtasks in any order.

By solving subtask of arbitrary problem he earns one point. Thus, the number of points for task is equal to the number of solved subtasks in it. Moreover, if Polycarp completely solves the task (solves all k of its subtasks), he recieves one extra point. Thus, total number of points he recieves for the complete solution of the task is k + 1.

Polycarp has M minutes of time. What is the maximum number of points he can earn?


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integer numbers n, k and M (1 ≤ n ≤ 45, 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9).

The second line contains k integer numbers, values t_{j} (1 ≤ t_{j} ≤ 1000000), where t_{j} is the time in minutes required to solve j-th subtask of any task.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum amount of points Polycarp can earn in M minutes.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4 11
1 2 3 4

Output
6

Input
5 5 10
1 2 4 8 16

Output
7



-----Note-----

In the first example Polycarp can complete the first task and spend 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 minutes. He also has the time to solve one subtask of the second task in one minute.

In the second example Polycarp can solve the first subtask of all five tasks and spend 5·1 = 5 minutes. Also he can solve the second subtasks of two tasks and spend 2·2 = 4 minutes. Thus, he earns 5 + 2 = 7 points in total.
Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
k = int(data[1])
M = int(data[2])
t = list(map(int, data[3:3 + k]))
result = func_1(n, k, M, t)
print(result)

def func_1(n, k, M, t):
    total_time_per_task = sum(t)
    max_points = 0
    for complete_tasks in range(n + 1):
        time_used = complete_tasks * total_time_per_task
        if time_used > M:
            break
        points = complete_tasks * (k + 1)
        remaining_time = M - time_used
        subtasks_solved = 0
        for subtask_time in t:
            if remaining_time >= subtask_time:
                max_subtasks_for_this_task = remaining_time // subtask_time
                subtasks_solved += max_subtasks_for_this_task
                remaining_time -= max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time
        subtasks_solved = min(subtasks_solved, (n - complete_tasks) * k)
        max_points = max(max_points, points + subtasks_solved)
    return max_points


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided code, we must analyze the program based on the problem description.

The problem requires calculating the maximum number of points Polycarp can earn given a certain amount of time (M minutes) to solve n tasks, each composed of k subtasks. The points earned are calculated both from individual subtasks solved and an additional point if all subtasks of a task are completed.

Let's analyze the `func_1` function:

1. It calculates the total time required to complete one full task (`total_time_per_task = sum(t)`).
2. It iterates through the number of complete tasks Polycarp can accomplish (`complete_tasks`).
3. For each number of complete tasks, it calculates how much time would be used and the corresponding points.
4. It checks remaining time after completing those tasks and attempts to maximize additional subtasks solved within the remaining time.
5. It uses a greedy approach to decide how many subtasks can be solved with the remaining time.

However, there are potential edge cases that might not be handled correctly:

- If `M` is 0, Polycarp cannot solve any subtasks, yet the program calculates points based on tasks that cannot be completed.
- The program does not properly account for exceeding the maximum number of tasks or subtasks (i.e., when remaining subtasks exceed the total available tasks post-completion of complete tasks).
- In cases where `n` or `k` is at its minimum (like 1), it might lead to unexpected results if there's not enough time. The implementation assumes he can solve at least one subtask each time without checking the limits.
- Additionally, if `M` is less than the smallest subtask time, he can’t solve any subtask (which should lead to a direct output of `0` points). 

**Example Input to Demonstrate Failure:**
- For `n = 1`, `k = 1`, `M = 0`, and `t = [1]`, the correct output should be `0`, but the current implementation would still calculate points from the loops without correctly functioning to output `0` directly in this case.

Based on this analysis, we identify that the program may not function as intended for certain edge cases.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `n` (the number of complete tasks), `k` (the number of subtasks per task), `M` (the maximum available time), and `t` (a list of integers representing the time needed for each subtask). It calculates and returns the maximum possible points that can be achieved based on completing the specified number of tasks and solving as many subtasks as time allows within `M`. The function iterates through all possible numbers of complete tasks (from 0 to `n`), checking the time required for those tasks against `M`. If the time used exceeds `M`, it stops further calculations. For each possible complete task count, it calculates points and subsequently evaluates how many subtasks can be solved with the remaining time, ultimately determining the maximum points obtainable. The function also handles edge cases such as when no time is available for subtasks or when the total time for complete tasks exceeds `M` from the start, allowing it to return 0 points in those scenarios. It ensures the number of subtasks solved does not exceed feasible limits based on the remaining capacity.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
