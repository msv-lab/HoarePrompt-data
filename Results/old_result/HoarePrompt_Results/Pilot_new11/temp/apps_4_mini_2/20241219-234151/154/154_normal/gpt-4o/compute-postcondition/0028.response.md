The variable `max_points` is assigned the value from the operation `max(max_points, points + subtasks_solved)`. Given that `max_points` starts at 0, the updated value will depend on the values of `points` and `subtasks_solved`.

1. The initial value of `max_points` is 0.
2. The value of `points` is initially 0.
3. The variable `subtasks_solved` is updated to a value that can be derived from `(n - complete_tasks) * k`, which is a non-negative value since `n` and `complete_tasks` are both non-negative and `k` is at least 1. 

Thus, `subtasks_solved` will contribute positively (or zero) to `points + subtasks_solved`, leading to the following outcomes:

- Since both `points` and `subtasks_solved` can yield non-negative results, `max_points` can potentially be updated from 0 to the value of `points + subtasks_solved`, with the latter being at least 0.

Therefore, the updates affect `max_points` directly while leaving all other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45, `k` is such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45, `M` is between 0 and 2·10^9, `t` is a list of `k` integers, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the elements in `t`, `max_points` is equal to `max(0, 0 + subtasks_solved)`, `complete_tasks` is 0, `time_used` is greater than `M`, `points` is 0, `remaining_time` is less than 0, and `subtasks_solved` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `(n - complete_tasks) * k`.**
