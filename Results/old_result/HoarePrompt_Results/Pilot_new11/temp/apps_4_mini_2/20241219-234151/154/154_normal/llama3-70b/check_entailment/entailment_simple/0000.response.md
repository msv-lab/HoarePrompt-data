Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not implement the functionality required by the problem description correctly. Here are the issues:

1. **Dynamic Programming Table Initialization:** 
   - The program initializes a 2D list `dp` where `dp[i][j]` is intended to track the maximum number of subtasks Polycarp can complete given `i` subtasks and `j` minutes. However, the understanding of what this table should represent is incorrect. The extra point for fully completing a task must be taken into account separately.

2. **Points Calculation:**
   - The points calculation in the `print` statement is flawed. The sum of `dp[i][M]` does not properly account for the extra points from completing entire tasks. The use of the line `sum(1 for i in range(k + 1) if dp[i][M] == i)` incorrectly assesses the number of complete tasks. For each task fully completed, the code should add one point but this logic does not correctly implement that.

3. **Return of Maximum Points:**
   - The program aims to calculate the maximum points Polycarp can earn, but it doesnâ€™t differentiate between points earned for subtasks solved and the bonus points for full tasks completed consistently.

In summary, the program's implementation of the points calculation mechanism and the dynamic programming approach does not follow the problem description accurately, leading to potential inaccuracies in the computed result. Thus, it fails to meet the requirements of the problem statement effectively.
