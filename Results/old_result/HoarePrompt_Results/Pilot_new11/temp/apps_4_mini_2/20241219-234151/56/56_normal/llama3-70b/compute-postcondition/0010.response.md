Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers where `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `a` is an empty list, `i` is 0, and `x` is equal to `n.bit_length() - 1`. If `x` is less than or equal to `i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change in state as there is no else part.***
