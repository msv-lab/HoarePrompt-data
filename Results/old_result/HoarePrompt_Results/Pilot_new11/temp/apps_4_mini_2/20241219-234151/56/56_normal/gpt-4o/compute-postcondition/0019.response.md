The `smallest` variable will be assigned the last value from the `bits` list due to the `pop()` method. The previous states of `n` and `k` are not affected by this operation, but we do not have specific information about the contents of the `bits` list, only that `k` is greater than its current length. Therefore, `smallest` gets the last element of `bits`, and no other variable is modified.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5) and must be greater than the current length of bits; `smallest` is the last element of `bits` which is now removed from the list.**
