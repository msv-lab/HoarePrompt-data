The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters within the function signature. However, it operates under the constraints that `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) and `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5). The function returns a value based on these inputs.

Since no specific output behavior is provided, we cannot determine the exact return value or behavior based on the given constraints alone. Therefore, without additional context or output specifications, we can only describe the parameters.

Functionality: **The function operates with a positive integer `n`, constrained to 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, and a positive integer `k`, constrained to 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5. The return value is unspecified based on the provided information.**
