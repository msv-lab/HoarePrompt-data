Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer (possibly 0), `k` is the original positive integer, and `a` is a list containing the values of `x` collected during the iterations. If the length of `a` is less than `k`, `a` retains its current values and `i` represents the total number of iterations executed. Otherwise, `a` contains the first `k` values sorted in descending order, `i` is the total number of iterations executed, and 'Yes' has been printed to the console as a space-separated string of the values in `a`.***
