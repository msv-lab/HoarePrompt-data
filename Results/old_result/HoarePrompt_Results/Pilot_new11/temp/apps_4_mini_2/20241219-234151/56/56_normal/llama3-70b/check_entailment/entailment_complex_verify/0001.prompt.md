You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Jamie is preparing a Codeforces round. He has got an idea for a problem, but does not know how to solve it. Help him write a solution to the following problem:

Find k integers such that the sum of two to the power of each number equals to the number n and the largest integer in the answer is as small as possible. As there may be multiple answers, you are asked to output the lexicographically largest one. 

To be more clear, consider all integer sequence with length k (a_1, a_2, ..., a_{k}) with $\sum_{i = 1}^{k} 2^{a_{i}} = n$. Give a value $y = \operatorname{max}_{1 \leq i \leq k} a_{i}$ to each sequence. Among all sequence(s) that have the minimum y value, output the one that is the lexicographically largest.

For definitions of powers and lexicographical order see notes.


-----Input-----

The first line consists of two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5) — the required sum and the length of the sequence.


-----Output-----

Output "No" (without quotes) in a single line if there does not exist such sequence. Otherwise, output "Yes" (without quotes) in the first line, and k numbers separated by space in the second line — the required sequence.

It is guaranteed that the integers in the answer sequence fit the range [ - 10^18, 10^18].


-----Examples-----
Input
23 5

Output
Yes
3 3 2 1 0 

Input
13 2

Output
No

Input
1 2

Output
Yes
-1 -1 



-----Note-----

Sample 1:

2^3 + 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0 = 8 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 23

Answers like (3, 3, 2, 0, 1) or (0, 1, 2, 3, 3) are not lexicographically largest.

Answers like (4, 1, 1, 1, 0) do not have the minimum y value.

Sample 2:

It can be shown there does not exist a sequence with length 2.

Sample 3:

$2^{-1} + 2^{-1} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1$

Powers of 2:

If x > 0, then 2^{x} = 2·2·2·...·2 (x times).

If x = 0, then 2^{x} = 1.

If x < 0, then $2^{x} = \frac{1}{2^{-x}}$.

Lexicographical order:

Given two different sequences of the same length, (a_1, a_2, ... , a_{k}) and (b_1, b_2, ... , b_{k}), the first one is smaller than the second one for the lexicographical order, if and only if a_{i} < b_{i}, for the first i where a_{i} and b_{i} differ.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    if n < k:
        print('No')
    else:
        a = []
        i = 0
        while n > 0:
            x = n.bit_length() - 1
            if x <= i:
                break
            a.append(x)
            n -= 2 ** x
            i += 1
        if len(a) < k:
            print('No')
        else:
            a = a[:k]
            a.sort(reverse=True)
            print('Yes')
            print(' '.join(map(str, a)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not accurately solve the problem as described. Specifically, it fails to handle cases where the required sum `n` can be achieved using fewer integers than specified by `k`, or where the maximum integer in the output does not satisfy the condition of being minimized.

For instance, consider the input:

```
5 2
```

In this case, the program will output:

```
Yes
2 0
```

This output is incorrect because it indicates that we can represent `5` with two integers, where the maximum integer used is `2`, which is not the lexicographically largest valid sequence. The correct representation should be:

```
Yes
1 1
```

This represents `2^1 + 2^1 = 2 + 2 = 4`, not `5`. Therefore, since the program logic does not guarantee all edge cases, and especially the case where a valid solution cannot exist with the specified `k`, it does not fulfill the requirements of the problem. Thus, there are many more inputs that can yield incorrect outputs compared to acceptable outputs.

Additionally, when `n` is less than `k` but `k` is allowed to represent negative integers (as stated in the problem), the program returns "No" prematurely without considering potential sequences of negative powers, leading to further inaccuracies. 

Therefore, since there are clear cases where the program does not yield the correct output aligning with the problem requirements, the overall evaluation of correctness is **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, k is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5.
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if (n < k) :
        print('No')
    else :
        a = []
        i = 0
        while n > 0:
            x = n.bit_length() - 1
            
            if x <= i:
                break
            
            a.append(x)
            
            n -= 2 ** x
            
            i += 1
            
        #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer (possibly 0) now, `k` is the original positive integer, `a` is a list containing the values of `x` collected during the iterations, `i` is the total number of iterations executed (which corresponds to how many times `x` was appended to `a`), and for each iteration, `x` was equal to the bit length of the previous value of `n` minus 1.
        if (len(a) < k) :
            print('No')
        else :
            a = a[:k]
            a.sort(reverse=True)
            print('Yes')
            print(' '.join(map(str, a)))
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is a non-negative integer (possibly 0), `k` is the original positive integer, and `a` is a list containing the values of `x` collected during the iterations. If the length of `a` is less than `k`, `a` retains its current values and `i` represents the total number of iterations executed. Otherwise, `a` contains the first `k` values sorted in descending order, `i` is the total number of iterations executed, and 'Yes' has been printed to the console as a space-separated string of the values in `a`.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer equal to the input value and `k` is a positive integer equal to the input value. If `n` is less than `k`, then 'No' has been printed. If `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, the list `a` retains its current values if its length is less than `k`. Otherwise, `a` contains the first `k` values sorted in descending order, and 'Yes' has been printed to the console as a space-separated string of the values in `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` takes two positive integers, `n` and `k`, as input. It first checks if `n` is less than `k`, printing 'No' and terminating if this is the case. If `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, it initializes an empty list `a` and performs a loop where it decrements `n` by powers of two corresponding to the highest set bit until `n` becomes 0 or no higher bits can be found. The collected values (indexes of the bits) are stored in the list `a`. After the loop, if the list `a` contains fewer than `k` elements, it outputs 'No'. If it has at least `k` elements, it truncates `a` to the first `k` elements, sorts them in descending order, and prints 'Yes' followed by the space-separated values from `a`. The final state of `n` will be non-negative (possibly 0), retaining its original input value after function execution; `k` will also remain unchanged; if 'Yes' is printed, a contains the first `k` values sorted in descending order. If 'No' is printed at any point, a will not be printed. Overall, the function checks conditions and combats the binary representation of `n` while managing a list of bit positions until a defined output is achieved based on `k`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
