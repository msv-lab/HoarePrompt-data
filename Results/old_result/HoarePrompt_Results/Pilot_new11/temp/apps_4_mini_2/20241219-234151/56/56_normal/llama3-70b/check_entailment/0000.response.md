The program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. Specifically, there are cases where it could produce incorrect results or missed edge cases.

Let's analyze the algorithm:

1. The condition `if n < k:` checks if the sum of powers of 2 can be formed. However, this condition is not comprehensive. For instance, if n is exactly equal to k, the output should still be "Yes" with k occurrences of `0` since `2^0` = 1, and we can have k occurrences of `1` to sum to k. 

2. The variable `a` gathers powers of 2 as long as there is still some `n` available. If the number of additions to `a` is less than `k`, the result is marked as "No". This does not account for the case where we can fill in with `-1` to achieve the total `k` length, which is allowable as mentioned in the examples.

3. In scenarios where `n` is less than the number of bits required to split into k powers of 2, we could have valid results as shown in the last illustration (inputs 1, 2). If we run into this case and `len(a)` is less than `k`, the program should fill the rest up to `k` by adding `-1` instead of outputting "No". 

4. There's no check or handling for negative powers. Powers of 2 can indeed be negative, thus the algorithm must include this possibility. 

As a concrete example of failure:
Consider the case with `n = 2` and `k = 3`. According to the allowed output, the program should be able to provide `(-1, -1, 0)` since `2^0 = 1`, where we fill with `-1` to meet the length requirement, but the condition `n < k` would lead to a "No" output, which is incorrect.

Thus, given these deficiencies in the logic leading to incorrect outputs for certain inputs, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**.
