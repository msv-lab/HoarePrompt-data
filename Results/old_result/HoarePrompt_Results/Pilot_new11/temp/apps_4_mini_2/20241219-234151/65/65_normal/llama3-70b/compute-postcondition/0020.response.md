The `print('YES')` statement outputs the string 'YES' to the console. None of the variables in the initial state have been altered as a result of this code execution. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables along with the indication that 'YES' has been printed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 100, `s` is a string of length `n`, `color_count` is a dictionary where keys are the unique characters in `s` and values represent their counts in `s`, `max_color_count` is the maximum value of the counts in `color_count` or undefined if `color_count` is empty and the current value of `max_color_count` is less than or equal to `k`, and 'YES' has been printed.**
