Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 100, `s` is a string with at least 2 characters, `c` is the second character of `s`, and if `c` is in `color_count`, then the count of `color_count[c]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `color_count[c]` is set to 1.***
