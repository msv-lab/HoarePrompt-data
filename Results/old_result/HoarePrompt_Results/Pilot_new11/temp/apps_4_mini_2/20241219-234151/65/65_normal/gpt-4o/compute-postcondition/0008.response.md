Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `s` is a string of length `n`, and `color` is the first character of `s`. If `color` is in `color_count`, then `color_count[color]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `color_count[color]` is set to 1, indicating that `color` was not previously present in `color_count`.***
