You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One day Kefa found n baloons. For convenience, we denote color of i-th baloon as s_{i} — lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet. Also Kefa has k friends. Friend will be upset, If he get two baloons of the same color. Kefa want to give out all baloons to his friends. Help Kefa to find out, can he give out all his baloons, such that no one of his friens will be upset — print «YES», if he can, and «NO», otherwise. Note, that Kefa's friend will not upset, if he doesn't get baloons at all.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 100) — the number of baloons and friends.

Next line contains string s — colors of baloons.


-----Output-----

Answer to the task — «YES» or «NO» in a single line.

You can choose the case (lower or upper) for each letter arbitrary.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 2
aabb

Output
YES

Input
6 3
aacaab

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first sample Kefa can give 1-st and 3-rd baloon to the first friend, and 2-nd and 4-th to the second.

In the second sample Kefa needs to give to all his friends baloons of color a, but one baloon will stay, thats why answer is «NO».
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    color_count = {}
    for color in s:
        if color in color_count:
            color_count[color] += 1
        else:
            color_count[color] = 1
    can_distribute = True
    for count in color_count.values():
        if count > k:
            can_distribute = False
            break
    if can_distribute:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program and the problem requirements closely.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. There are `n` balloons of different colors represented by characters in a string `s`.
2. There are `k` friends. Each friend can only receive balloons of different colors - that is, no friend can receive two balloons of the same color.
3. We need to determine if it is possible to distribute all balloons such that no friend will get two balloons of the same color.

### Program Analysis:
The program follows this logic:
- It first counts the occurrences of each color in the string `s`.
- Then it checks if any color count exceeds `k` (the number of friends). If it does, it sets `can_distribute` to `False`.
- Finally, it prints "YES" if it's possible to distribute the balloons according to the rules, and "NO" otherwise.

### Checking for Edge Cases:
1. **If `n` > `k` with all distinct colors**: If there are `n` distinct colors and `k` friends, it should return "YES".
2. **If any color count in the string `s` is greater than `k`**: For example, if `n = 6`, `k = 3`, and `s = "aaabc"`, the program will return "NO", which is correct.
3. **Minimum values**: If `n = 1` and `k = 1`, and `s` contains one color, it should return "YES", which the program handles.

### Potential Case:
However, checking further, there is an edge case that reveals an issue:
- Suppose `n = 4`, `k = 2`, and `s = "aaaa"`. In this case, we have only one color (which appears 4 times), and we have 2 friends. The program will correctly identify that the count (4) exceeds `k`, and will output "NO". 

### Contradiction:
Now consider a case where `n = 3`, `k = 3`, and `s = "aaa"`. The count of `'a'` is 3. Although there are 3 friends, each friend can only take one `'a'`, hence it should output "YES". But the program as written would state "NO" since it doesn’t handle the ability to distribute balloons when the count equals `k`.

### Conclusion:
The program fails in a case where the count of a color equals the number of friends allowed. Since there are cases where the program does not satisfy all conditions, we conclude:
Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of balloons, k is a positive integer representing the number of friends, and s is a string of length n consisting of lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet representing the colors of the balloons.
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    color_count = {}
    for color in s:
        if color in color_count:
            color_count[color] += 1
        else:
            color_count[color] = 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `s` is a string of length `n`, and `color_count` is a dictionary where each key is a unique character from `s`, and the corresponding value is the count of occurrences of that character in `s`.
    can_distribute = True
    for count in color_count.values():
        if count > k:
            can_distribute = False
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `s` is a string of length `n`, `color_count` is a dictionary with character counts, and `can_distribute` is False if any character count in `color_count` exceeds `k`, otherwise it is True.
    if can_distribute :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `s` is a string of length `n`, and `color_count` is a dictionary with character counts. If `can_distribute` is True, it indicates that no character count in `color_count` exceeds `k`, allowing for distribution. If `can_distribute` is False, the output is 'NO' due to at least one character count exceeding `k`.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
