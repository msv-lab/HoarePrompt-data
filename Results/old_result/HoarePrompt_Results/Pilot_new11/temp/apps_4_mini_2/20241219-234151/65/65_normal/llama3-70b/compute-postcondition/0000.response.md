The variables `n` and `k` are assigned new values from the input, which are converted into integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The initial constraints that determine the valid ranges for both `n` and `k` remain valid. Since the exact input values for `n` and `k` are not provided, we will state that their values are now determined by the user input but still fall within the specified bounds.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 100, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase letters from the Latin alphabet representing the colors of the balloons, with new values for `n` and `k` assigned from user input.**
