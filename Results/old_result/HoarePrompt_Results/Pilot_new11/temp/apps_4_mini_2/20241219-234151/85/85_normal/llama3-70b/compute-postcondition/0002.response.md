According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n // 2 + 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n // 2` must be at least 1, which means `n` must be at least 2.

Since `n` is an input integer that is already guaranteed to be within the range of 2 to 10^9, it satisfies this condition. The variable `i` needs to be initialized before the loop starts. For the first iteration, `i` will be 1.

Therefore, the adjusted states should reflect that `i` is initialized to 1.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `ans` is 0, `i` is 1**
