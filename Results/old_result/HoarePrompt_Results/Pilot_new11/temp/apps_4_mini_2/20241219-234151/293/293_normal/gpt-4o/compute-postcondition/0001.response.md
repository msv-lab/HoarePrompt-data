The values of `h` and `n` are updated based on the `input` provided through `sys.stdin.read`. Specifically, `h` and `n` will hold the integer values obtained from the input split by whitespace. Since `h` is constrained to be between 1 and 50 inclusive and `n` is set to be between 1 and \(2^h\) inclusive, the new values for `h` and `n` will depend on the specific input received. 

Thus, the output state reflects that `h` is now determined by the first integer from the input and `n` is determined by the second integer from the input, while the constraints on their values still hold. The states of other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`h` is the first integer from the input (between 1 and 50 inclusive); `n` is the second integer from the input (between 1 and 2^h inclusive).**
