The value of `visited_count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `visited_count` is 0, so the new value becomes 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`h` is between 1 and 50 inclusive, `n` is between 1 and `2^h`, `total_leaves` is 2, `visited_count` is 1, `path` is a binary string of length `h` representing `n - 1`, `current_level` is 0, `current_node` is 0, `direction` is the first character of `path`**
