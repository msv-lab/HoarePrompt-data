Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly calculate the number of nodes Amr is going to visit before reaching the exit based on the provided rules of the game. 

To illustrate why the program is incorrect, consider the case where the input is `h = 2` and `n = 3`. According to the problem statement, Amr starting from the root (1), will attempt to move to leaf node 3 via the following path:

1. From 1, the first command is 'L', moving to node 2.
2. The next command is 'R', moving to node 3 (the exit).

According to the description, he visits the nodes 1 (the root) and 2 before reaching node 3 (the exit). Therefore, the number of visited nodes should be 2.

However, according to the provided function's logic:

- Start with `n = 3`.
- Since `n` is odd, the code executed `ans += n // 2`, which computes `3 // 2` giving `1` for `ans`.
- Then `n` becomes `1` (as `n //= 2`).
- Since `n` is now `1`, the loop terminates.

The final output is `1`, which does not match the expected output of `2`. This discrepancy shows that the program fails to account for the correct number of nodes Amr visits before he reaches the exit. Other test cases can be derived similarly to reinforce that the logic is flawed and does not adhere to the rules defined in the problem statement.
