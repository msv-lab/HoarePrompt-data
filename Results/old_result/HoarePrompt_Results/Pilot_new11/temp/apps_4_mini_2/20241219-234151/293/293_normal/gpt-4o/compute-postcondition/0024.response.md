Output State: **`h` is between 1 and 50 inclusive; `n` is between 1 and `2^h`; `total_leaves` is 2; `visited_count` is equal to the length of `path`; `path` is a binary string of length `h` representing `n - 1`; `current_level` is 0; `current_node` is determined by the binary interpretation of `path` as a sequence of left (0) and right (1) moves from the root node, where `current_node` is within the range of 1 to `2^h - 1.**
