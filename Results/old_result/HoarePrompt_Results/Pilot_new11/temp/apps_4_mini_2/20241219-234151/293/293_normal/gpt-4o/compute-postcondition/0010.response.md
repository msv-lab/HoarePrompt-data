The value of `current_node` is updated to `2 * current_node + 1`. Since the initial value of `current_node` is 0, the updated value will be `2 * 0 + 1 = 1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`h` is between 1 and 50 inclusive, `n` is between 1 and `2^h`, `total_leaves` is 2, `visited_count` is 1, `path` is a binary string of length `h` representing `n - 1`, `current_level` is 0, `current_node` is 1, and the `direction` is '0'.**
