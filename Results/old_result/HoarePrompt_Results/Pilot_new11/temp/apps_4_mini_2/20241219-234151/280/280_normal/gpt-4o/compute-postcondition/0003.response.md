The value of `speeds[0]` is assigned the value of `v_1`. The value of `v_1` represents the first input integer, and since `speeds` is initialized as a list with `t` elements all set to 0, the first element, `speeds[0]`, will now contain the value of `v_1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`v_1` is the first input integer, `v_2` is the second input integer, `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `d` ≤ 10, `speeds` is a list of `t` elements with `speeds[0]` equal to `v_1` and the rest of `speeds` unchanged.**
