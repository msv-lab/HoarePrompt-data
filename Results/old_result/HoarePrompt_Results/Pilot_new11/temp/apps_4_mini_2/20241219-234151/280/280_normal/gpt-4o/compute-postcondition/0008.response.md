To analyze the code snippet provided based on the initial state, let's break down the calculations and variables:

1. **Understanding the Variables**:
   - `speeds[i]` corresponds to `speeds[2]` because `i` is initialized to `2`.
   - `speeds[i - 1]` corresponds to `speeds[1]`.
   - The value of `speeds[1]` is calculated as `min(v_1 + d, v_2 + (t - 2) * d)`.
   - The function used is `min()` which will select the smaller of the two values in its parentheses.

2. **Calculation**:
   - The calculation for `speeds[2]` becomes:
     ```
     speeds[2] = min(speeds[1] + d, v_2 + (t - 2 - 1) * d)
     speeds[2] = min(speeds[1] + d, v_2 + (t - 3) * d)
     ```
   - Thus, the values for `speeds[1]` and the calculation for `speeds[2]` become crucial in finalizing the output state.

3. **Output Computation**:
   - After executing the line of code, `speeds[2]` will be updated based on the values of `speeds[1]` and the other provided parameters.

Now, let's summarize the changes in the variables of the output state:

Output State: **`v_1` is the first input integer, `v_2` is the second input integer, `t` is at least 2, `d` is an integer between 0 and 10, `speeds[0]` equal to `v_1`, `speeds[1]` equal to `min(v_1 + d, v_2 + (t - 2) * d)`, `speeds[2]` is equal to `min(speeds[1] + d, v_2 + (t - 3) * d)`, `speeds[-1]` equal to `v_2`, `i` is 2**.
