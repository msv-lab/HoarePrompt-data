You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The on-board computer on Polycarp's car measured that the car speed at the beginning of some section of the path equals v_1 meters per second, and in the end it is v_2 meters per second. We know that this section of the route took exactly t seconds to pass.

Assuming that at each of the seconds the speed is constant, and between seconds the speed can change at most by d meters per second in absolute value (i.e., the difference in the speed of any two adjacent seconds does not exceed d in absolute value), find the maximum possible length of the path section in meters.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers v_1 and v_2 (1 ≤ v_1, v_2 ≤ 100) — the speeds in meters per second at the beginning of the segment and at the end of the segment, respectively.

The second line contains two integers t (2 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the time when the car moves along the segment in seconds, d (0 ≤ d ≤ 10) — the maximum value of the speed change between adjacent seconds.

It is guaranteed that there is a way to complete the segment so that:  the speed in the first second equals v_1,  the speed in the last second equals v_2,  the absolute value of difference of speeds between any two adjacent seconds doesn't exceed d. 


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible length of the path segment in meters. 


-----Examples-----
Input
5 6
4 2

Output
26
Input
10 10
10 0

Output
100


-----Note-----

In the first sample the sequence of speeds of Polycarpus' car can look as follows: 5, 7, 8, 6. Thus, the total path is 5 + 7 + 8 + 6 = 26 meters.

In the second sample, as d = 0, the car covers the whole segment at constant speed v = 10. In t = 10 seconds it covers the distance of 100 meters.
Program:
```
def func():
    (v1, v2) = map(int, input().split())
    (t, d) = map(int, input().split())
    max_speed = max(v1, v2)
    min_speed = min(v1, v2)
    max_length = max_speed * t
    min_length = min_speed * t
    for i in range(t - 1, 0, -1):
        max_speed = max(max_speed - d, min_speed)
        min_speed = min(min_speed + d, max_speed)
        max_length += max_speed
        min_length += min_speed
    print(max_length)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to calculate the maximum possible length of the path under the constraints provided in the problem description. 

The main issue is in the way it calculates `max_speed` and `min_speed` in the loop. The loop iterates over `t - 1` seconds, adjusting `max_speed` and `min_speed` based on the maximum allowable speed change `d`. However, the way it accumulates the `max_length` and `min_length` in this block is flawed and doesn't consider that the car could theoretically increase its speed more significantly than allowed if not correctly handled from the beginning.

For example, consider the inputs:

```
5 7
4 2
```

According to the problem description, with `v1 = 5`, `v2 = 7`, `t = 4`, and `d = 2`, the maximum speed that can be achieved at each second is bounded by the change in speed allowed. The speeds can be arranged as `[5, 7, 9, 7]` (where the first second is 5, the last second is 7, and others rise to the maximum allowed). The program as written would fail to reach this correct maximum path length of 28. 

Instead, by the code logic, it could potentially yield a lower total in other complex interactions of speeds as the values are adjusted downwards prematurely in the loop. 

Thus, due to this systemic error in calculating `max_length`, the program is deemed incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: v_1 and v_2 are integers such that 1 ≤ v_1, v_2 ≤ 100; t is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100; d is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10.
def func():
    v1, v2 = map(int, input().split())
    t, d = map(int, input().split())
    max_speed = max(v1, v2)
    min_speed = min(v1, v2)
    max_length = max_speed * t
    min_length = min_speed * t
    for i in range(t - 1, 0, -1):
        max_speed = max(max_speed - d, min_speed)
        
        min_speed = min(min_speed + d, max_speed)
        
        max_length += max_speed
        
        min_length += min_speed
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a positive integer where 2 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `d` is a non-negative integer where 0 ≤ `d` ≤ 10; `v1` and `v2` are unchanged; `max_speed` is the final value after the loop; `min_speed` is the final value after the loop; `max_length` is equal to the total increment of `max_speed` over `t-1` iterations; `min_length` is equal to the total increment of `min_speed` over `t-1` iterations.
    print(max_length)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads four integers from user input: v1, v2 (speeds), t (time), and d (speed variation). It calculates the maximum and minimum possible distances traveled over the time period t based on the given speed variations. Specifically, it iterates through the time decrementing the maximum speed by d (until it reaches the minimum speed) and incrementing the minimum speed by d (until it reaches the current maximum speed). After performing these calculations, it sums the adjusted maximum and minimum speeds to compute the total maximum distance traveled. The function then prints the final total maximum distance calculated. Notably, the function does not directly take parameters and has no explicit return value; the result is printed instead. Additionally, while the function manages speeds and distances, it does not handle potential invalid user inputs (e.g., ensuring inputs comply with stated constraints).

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
