The variable `min_length` is updated by adding `min_speed` to it. The states of some other variables are relevant:

- `t` must be at least 3, so `t` could be 3 or greater.
- `d` is between 0 and 10.
- `v1` and `v2` remain unchanged.
- `max_speed` is updated to `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`.
- `min_speed` is now `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`.
- `max_length` is equal to `max_speed * t + 2 * max_speed`.
- `min_length` is originally equal to `min_speed * (t + 1)`.
- `i` is `t - 2`.

After running the code `min_length += min_speed`, the value of `min_length` will increase by `min_speed`. There are no other variables affected by this operation.

The Output State will therefore include the updated value of `min_length` as `min_length is now equal to (min_speed * (t + 1) + min_speed)`, without changing the other variable values.

Output State: **`t` must be at least 3; `d` is between 0 and 10; `v1` remains unchanged; `v2` remains unchanged; `max_speed` is updated to `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`; `min_speed` is now `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`; `max_length` is equal to `max_speed * t + 2 * max_speed`; `min_length` is equal to `(min_speed * (t + 1) + min_speed)`; `i` is `t - 2`.**
