The code updates `max_length` by adding `max_speed`. Since `max_length` is initially calculated as `(max_speed * t) + max_speed`, the new value of `max_length` becomes `(max_speed * t) + max_speed + max_speed`, which simplifies to `max_speed * t + 2 * max_speed`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged, except for the updated value of `max_length`.

Output State: **`t` must be at least 3; `d` is between 0 and 10; `v1` remains unchanged; `v2` remains unchanged; `max_speed` is updated to `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`; `min_speed` is now `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`; `max_length` is equal to `max_speed * t + 2 * max_speed`; `min_length` is equal to `min_speed * (t + 1)`; `i` is `t - 2`.**
