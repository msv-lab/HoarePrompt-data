You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The on-board computer on Polycarp's car measured that the car speed at the beginning of some section of the path equals v_1 meters per second, and in the end it is v_2 meters per second. We know that this section of the route took exactly t seconds to pass.

Assuming that at each of the seconds the speed is constant, and between seconds the speed can change at most by d meters per second in absolute value (i.e., the difference in the speed of any two adjacent seconds does not exceed d in absolute value), find the maximum possible length of the path section in meters.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers v_1 and v_2 (1 ≤ v_1, v_2 ≤ 100) — the speeds in meters per second at the beginning of the segment and at the end of the segment, respectively.

The second line contains two integers t (2 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the time when the car moves along the segment in seconds, d (0 ≤ d ≤ 10) — the maximum value of the speed change between adjacent seconds.

It is guaranteed that there is a way to complete the segment so that:  the speed in the first second equals v_1,  the speed in the last second equals v_2,  the absolute value of difference of speeds between any two adjacent seconds doesn't exceed d. 


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible length of the path segment in meters. 


-----Examples-----
Input
5 6
4 2

Output
26
Input
10 10
10 0

Output
100


-----Note-----

In the first sample the sequence of speeds of Polycarpus' car can look as follows: 5, 7, 8, 6. Thus, the total path is 5 + 7 + 8 + 6 = 26 meters.

In the second sample, as d = 0, the car covers the whole segment at constant speed v = 10. In t = 10 seconds it covers the distance of 100 meters.
Program:
```
def func():
    (v1, v2) = map(int, input().split())
    (t, d) = map(int, input().split())
    speeds = [0] * t
    speeds[0] = v1
    speeds[-1] = v2
    for i in range(1, t):
        speeds[i] = min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)
    total_distance = sum(speeds)
    print(total_distance)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the code step by step alongside the problem description:

1. **Understanding Inputs**: The program takes two speeds (`v1`, `v2`), a time duration (`t`), and a maximum speed change (`d`) as inputs.

2. **Speed Array Initialization**: An array `speeds` of size `t` is initialized to store the calculated speeds for each second. The first element is set to `v1` and the last element to `v2`.

3. **Loop for Speed Calculation**:
   - The loop fills in the `speeds` array based on the constraints that the speed change between adjacent seconds is limited by `d`.
   - The speed for each second after the first is calculated using the formula:
     ```python
     speeds[i] = min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)
     ```

4. **Summing Speeds**: Finally, the total distance is computed by summing up the elements in the `speeds` array.

### Potential Issue:
The loop logic, particularly the way it handles speed adjustments, may not always maintain the feasible speed profile given the difference constraints. The second half of the `min` function:
```python
v2 + (t - i - 1) * d
```
seems problematic. This logic tries to ensure that the last speed is not exceeded, but it might not yield the maximum path length in some cases, particularly when speeds need to fill out a larger gap earlier on.

### Example Case Where the Program May Fail:
Consider the following input:
```
5 6
4 2
```
In this case, the actual feasible speed sequence could be `[5, 7, 8, 6]`, yielding a distance of `26`. However, if inappropriately limited during the speed setup, the array could end up with a sequence that provides a shorter distance than this maximum.

1. Starting speeds:
   ```python
   speeds = [5, ?, ?, 6]
   ```

2. For the second second (`i=1`):
   - Current speed `5`, max increase `d=2`: 
   - The calculated new speed could be:
     - `5 + 2 = 7`
   Thus, valid so far.

3. For the third second (`i=2`):
   - Current speed `7`, max increase `d=2`: 
   - It correctly allows a potential speed of `9`, but needs to account that it should drop back to `6` at the end. 

4. A scenario where the adjustment logic could fall short would be:
   - If `d` wasn’t sufficient to adjust down from a higher mid-value to meet the last required speed of `6`.

Hence, while the expected logic feels world-friendly, it subtly introduces scenarios where it might lead to incorrect summation by incorrectly bounding the speeds at certain indices.

### Conclusion:
Thus, given the potential for failure in generating the maximum distance path under some input conditions, I conclude that the code may not work correctly for all cases.

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads four integers from input: `v1` (initial speed), `v2` (final speed), `t` (number of time intervals), and `d` (maximum speed increment). It calculates a list of speeds for each time interval, ensuring that the speed does not exceed the bounds defined by the initial and final speeds nor the increments allowed by `d`. The first speed is set to `v1` and the last to `v2`. Intermediate speeds are computed based on the previous speed and the increment `d`, while ensuring that the speed at any time does not exceed the allowed maximum based on remaining time intervals. Finally, the function computes and prints the total distance traveled, which is the sum of the speeds over the `t` intervals. Note that the function does not return a value but prints the total distance. Potential edge cases include the scenario where `d` is zero, leading to constant speeds throughout the intervals, or where `v1` is equal to `v2`, resulting in all speeds being the same.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
