The value of `min_speed` is assigned the minimum value of `v1` and `v2`. The values of `t`, `d`, and `max_speed` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is the new input integer such that 2 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `d` is the new input integer such that 0 ≤ `d` ≤ 10; `v1` and `v2` remain unchanged; `max_speed` is the maximum value of `v1` and `v2`; and `min_speed` is the minimum value of `v1` and `v2`.

Output State: **`t` is the new input integer such that 2 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `d` is the new input integer such that 0 ≤ `d` ≤ 10; `v1` and `v2` remain unchanged; `max_speed` is the maximum value of `v1` and `v2`; `min_speed` is the minimum value of `v1` and `v2`.**
