The code snippet assigns the value of `v_2` to the last element of the `speeds` list, which is currently `speeds[t-1]` since `t` equals the length of the list. The first element of `speeds` is `v_1`, and the value of `v_2` is unchanged. The `speeds` list will now reflect the new value for its last element. 

Output State: **`v_1` is the first input integer, `v_2` is the second input integer, `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `d` ≤ 10, `speeds` is a list of `t` elements with `speeds[0]` equal to `v_1` and `speeds[-1]` equal to `v_2`.**
