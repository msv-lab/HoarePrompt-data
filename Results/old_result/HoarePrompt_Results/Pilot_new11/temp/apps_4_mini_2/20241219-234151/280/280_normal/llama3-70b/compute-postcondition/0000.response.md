The code assigns values to `v1` and `v2` by splitting an input string and mapping the elements to integers. The previous values of `v1` and `v2` are overwritten by these new input values, which are guaranteed to be integers within the specified range of 1 to 100. The variables `t` and `d` are not affected by this operation, so their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100; `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10; `v1` and `v2` are integers assigned new values based on input, satisfying 1 ≤ v1, v2 ≤ 100**
