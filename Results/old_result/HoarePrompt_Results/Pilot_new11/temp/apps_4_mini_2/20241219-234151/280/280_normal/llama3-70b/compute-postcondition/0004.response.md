The variable `max_length` is assigned the value of `max_speed * t`. The variable `max_speed` retains its value as the maximum of `v1` and `v2`, and `t` is a new input integer constrained within the range of 2 to 100. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is the new input integer such that 2 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `d` is the new input integer such that 0 ≤ `d` ≤ 10; `v1` and `v2` remain unchanged; `max_speed` is the maximum value of `v1` and `v2`; `min_speed` is the minimum value of `v1` and `v2`; `max_length` is equal to `max_speed * t`.

Output State: **`t` is the new input integer such that 2 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `d` is the new input integer such that 0 ≤ `d` ≤ 10; `v1` and `v2` remain unchanged; `max_speed` is the maximum value of `v1` and `v2`; `min_speed` is the minimum value of `v1` and `v2`; `max_length` is equal to `max_speed * t`.**
