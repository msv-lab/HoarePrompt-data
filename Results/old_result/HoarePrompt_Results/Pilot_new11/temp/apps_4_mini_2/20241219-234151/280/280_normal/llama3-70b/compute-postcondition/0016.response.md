According to the code, the loop's ability to execute depends on the variable `i`, which is initially set to `t - 2`. The `for` loop is defined as running from `i = t - 1` down to `1` (inclusive).

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `t - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decreased by 1. 

Thus:
- Before the next iteration, `i` will be equal to `t - 2 - 1`, which simplifies to `t - 3`.

To ensure the loop can execute again, `i` should still be greater than `0`, which implies that `t - 3` must be greater than `0`. Therefore, `t` must be at least `4`.

As a result, the adjusted states are as follows:
- `t` must be at least `4`
- `i` will be `t - 3`, which makes it `4 - 3 = 1` if `t` is exactly `4`.

Thus, the states we record are:
State: **`t` must be at least 4; `d` is between 0 and 10; `v1` remains unchanged; `v2` remains unchanged; `max_speed` is updated to `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`; `min_speed` is now `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`; `max_length` is equal to `max_speed * t + 2 * max_speed`; `min_length` is equal to `(min_speed * (t + 1) + min_speed)`; `i` is `t - 3`**
