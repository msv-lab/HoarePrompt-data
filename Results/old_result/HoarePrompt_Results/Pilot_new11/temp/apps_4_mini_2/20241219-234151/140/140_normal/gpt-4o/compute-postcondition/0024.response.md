Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary with at least 3 keys, `n` is between 2 and 500, `u` is the third key in the graph, `graph[u]` has `k` elements (where `k` is the number of elements in `graph[u]`), and `in_degree[v]` for each `v` in `graph[u]` is increased by `1` for each element in `graph[u]` (resulting in `in_degree[v]` being the original value plus `k`).**
