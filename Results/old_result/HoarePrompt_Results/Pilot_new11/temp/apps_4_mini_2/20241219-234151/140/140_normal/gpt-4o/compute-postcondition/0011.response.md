The value of `in_degree[v]` is incremented by 1. The variable `in_degree` is not changed apart from the increment at the index `v`. The values of `graph`, `n`, and `u` remain unchanged, but since `graph[u]` has at least one element, it indicates that `v` must be a valid key in the `in_degree` dictionary.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary with at least 2 keys, `n` is between 2 and 500, `u` is the second key in the graph, `in_degree[v]` has increased by 1, and `in_degree` remains unchanged for other keys.**
