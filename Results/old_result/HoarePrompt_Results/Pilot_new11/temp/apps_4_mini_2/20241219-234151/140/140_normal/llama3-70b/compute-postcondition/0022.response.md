Postcondition: ***`node` is an integer, `graph` is a list of lists of integers, `visited[node]` is True, `rec_stack[node]` is True, and `graph[node]` has at least 2 neighbors. If the `rec_stack` for the `neighbor` is marked True, the function returns True, indicating that the current node is part of a cycle in the graph.***
