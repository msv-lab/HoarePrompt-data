Postcondition: ***`in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1, `n` is between 2 and 500, `graph` maintains its structure with `n` keys, `queue` includes `neighbor`, `node` has at least 1 remaining neighbor in `graph`, and `count` is increased by 1. If `in_degree[neighbor]` is equal to 0, then the above conditions hold true.***
