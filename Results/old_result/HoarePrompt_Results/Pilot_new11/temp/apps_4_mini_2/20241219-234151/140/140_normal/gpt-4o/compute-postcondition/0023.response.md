The variable `in_degree[v]` is incremented by 1. Since `v` is an element in `graph[u]`, the state of `in_degree` related to `v` will change. The values of `graph`, `n`, and `u` remain unaffected, while `in_degree[v]` will be increased by one.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary with at least 3 keys, `n` is between 2 and 500, `u` is the third key in the graph, `graph[u]` has at least 3 elements, `v` is the next element in `graph[u]`, and `in_degree[v]` is incremented by 1.**
