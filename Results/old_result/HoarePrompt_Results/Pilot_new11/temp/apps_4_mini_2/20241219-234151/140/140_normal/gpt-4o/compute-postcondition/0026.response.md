In the given code snippet, `queue` is assigned a deque containing nodes from `in_degree` that have an incoming edge count of zero. The `in_degree` dictionary holds values representing the total number of incoming edges for each vertex in the graph, and `n` is an integer reflecting the number of keys in the `graph` dictionary. The specific nodes added to the `queue` are those for which the corresponding in-degree value equals zero. The `graph` structure remains unchanged.

Thus, the output state will now reflect the new composition of `queue` alongside the unchanged properties of the other variables.

Output State: **`in_degree` is a dictionary with values representing incoming edges, `n` is an integer between 2 and 500, `graph` is a dictionary with `n` keys, `queue` is a deque containing nodes from `in_degree` where `in_degree[node] == 0`.**
