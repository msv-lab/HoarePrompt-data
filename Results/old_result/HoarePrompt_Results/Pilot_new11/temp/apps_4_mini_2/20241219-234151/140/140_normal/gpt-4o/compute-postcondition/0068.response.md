The code appends `neighbor` to the `queue`. Since `in_degree[neighbor]` was decremented to 0, this indicates that `neighbor` is now ready to be processed because it has no remaining incoming edges. The other variables remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, the Output State remains consistent with the preconditions but now includes the updated `queue`.

Output State: **`in_degree` is updated with `in_degree[neighbor]` decreased by 1, `n` is between 2 and 500, `graph` maintains its structure with `n` keys, `queue` is updated to include `neighbor`, `node` is the current node which has at least 1 neighbor in `graph`, `count` is increased by 1, and the current value of `in_degree[neighbor]` is now 0.**
