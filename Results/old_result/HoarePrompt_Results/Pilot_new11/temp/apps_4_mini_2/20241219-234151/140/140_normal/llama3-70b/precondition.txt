n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the directed graph (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), m is an integer representing the number of edges (1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)), and each directed edge is represented by a pair of integers (u, v) indicating an edge from vertex u to vertex v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v), with each edge being unique.
