The code `queue.append(neighbor)` adds the variable `neighbor` to the list `queue`. The other variables maintain their previous values, as the operation only affects the `queue`.

The initial state mentions that `in_degree[next_neighbor]` is equal to 0, indicating that `next_neighbor` is now ready to be processed in the queue. The count's increment, the current state of `in_degree`, and the structure of `graph` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1; `n` is between 2 and 500; `graph` maintains its structure with `n` keys; `queue` now includes `neighbor`; `node` still has at least 1 remaining neighbor in `graph`; `count` is increased by 1; `in_degree[next_neighbor]` is equal to 0.**
