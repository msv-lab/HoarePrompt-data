Postcondition: ***`node` is an integer, `graph` is a list of lists of integers, `visited[node]` is True, `rec_stack[node]` is True, and `graph[node]` has at least 2 neighbors. If `func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack)` returns True, the function also returns True. If `func_1` does not return True, there is no specified return value from the function.***
