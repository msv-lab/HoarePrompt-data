Postcondition: ***`l`, `r`, `x`, `y`, `count` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ `x` ≤ `y` ≤ 10^9. If `z` is equal to `y // x` and `i` is equal to `k + 1` where 1 ≤ k + 1 ≤ int(math.sqrt(z)), when `z` is divisible by `i`, if `a` is equal to `b`, then `count` is incremented by 1; if `a` is not equal to `b`, then `count` is updated to `count + 2`. Additionally, if the conditions for `a` and `b` being within the range and their gcd being equal to `x` are fulfilled, these updates are reflected accordingly in `count`, `a`, and `b`. Otherwise, the values remain unchanged.***
