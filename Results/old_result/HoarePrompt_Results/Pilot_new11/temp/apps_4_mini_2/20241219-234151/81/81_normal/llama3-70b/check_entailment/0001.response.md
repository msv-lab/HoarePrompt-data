To evaluate whether the provided program meets the requirements of the problem description, we need to analyze the logic and functionality of the program against the explicitly described task.

The task is to find the number of good pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \( \text{GCD}(a, b) = x \)
- \( \text{LCM}(a, b) = y \)
- \( l \leq a, b \leq r \)
- The pairs \((a, b)\) and \((b, a)\) are counted as distinct when \( a \neq b \).

### Analyzing the functions provided:

1. **GCD Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` correctly computes the GCD using the Euclidean algorithm.

2. **LCM Calculation:**
   - The function `func_2(a, b)` calculates the LCM based on the formula \( \text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{a \cdot b}{\text{GCD}(a, b)} \), which is also correct.

### Missing Logic in the Implementation:
The provided program only defines two functions for GCD and LCM calculations but doesn't implement the logic needed to find the good pairs \((a, b)\) fulfilling all the conditions of the problem:

- There is no code to enumerate potential pairs \((a, b)\) in the range \([l, r]\).
- There is no validation of whether the pairs satisfy both the GCD and LCM conditions.
- The overall structure that would compute the count of good pairs is missing.

### Example Case Where It Fails:
Suppose we test with inputs:
```
l = 1, r = 3, x = 1, y = 3
```
The only good pairs that satisfy GCD = 1 and LCM = 3 would be (1, 3) and (3, 1). 

- The code, in its current form, does not produce any output or logic to find these pairs or their count, because it lacks the main implementation. Thus, it fails to meet the requirements of performing the necessary steps.

### Conclusion:
Given that the program does not perform the computation required to find the number of good pairs of integers and lacks the logic to fulfill the task requirements, the program is **incorrect**.

Correctness: **False**.
