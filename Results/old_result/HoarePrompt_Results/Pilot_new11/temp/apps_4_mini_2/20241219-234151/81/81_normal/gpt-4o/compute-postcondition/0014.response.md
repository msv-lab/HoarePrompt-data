Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^9; `r` is an integer such that `r` ≤ 10^9; `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ `y` ≤ 10^9; `y` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `y` ≤ 10^9; `z` is equal to `y // x`. If `a` is equal to `b`, `count` is set to 1, and the current values of `a` and `b` satisfy `l <= a <= r` and `l <= b <= r`, the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b` is equal to `x`, and the product of `a` and `b` divided by their greatest common divisor is equal to `y`. Otherwise, if `a` is not equal to `b`, `count` is set to 2, and the same conditions on `a` and `b` hold, including the satisfaction of `l <= a <= r`, `l <= b <= r`, the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b` being equal to `x`, and the product of `a` and `b` divided by the greatest common divisor being equal to `y`.***
