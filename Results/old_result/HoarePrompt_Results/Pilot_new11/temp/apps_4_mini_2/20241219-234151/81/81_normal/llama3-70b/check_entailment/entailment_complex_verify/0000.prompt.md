You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Today on Informatics class Nastya learned about GCD and LCM (see links below). Nastya is very intelligent, so she solved all the tasks momentarily and now suggests you to solve one of them as well.

We define a pair of integers (a, b) good, if GCD(a, b) = x and LCM(a, b) = y, where GCD(a, b) denotes the greatest common divisor of a and b, and LCM(a, b) denotes the least common multiple of a and b.

You are given two integers x and y. You are to find the number of good pairs of integers (a, b) such that l ≤ a, b ≤ r. Note that pairs (a, b) and (b, a) are considered different if a ≠ b.


-----Input-----

The only line contains four integers l, r, x, y (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 10^9).


-----Output-----

In the only line print the only integer — the answer for the problem.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 2 1 2

Output
2

Input
1 12 1 12

Output
4

Input
50 100 3 30

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example there are two suitable good pairs of integers (a, b): (1, 2) and (2, 1).

In the second example there are four suitable good pairs of integers (a, b): (1, 12), (12, 1), (3, 4) and (4, 3).

In the third example there are good pairs of integers, for example, (3, 30), but none of them fits the condition l ≤ a, b ≤ r.
Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

#Function 2:
def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b // func_1(a, b)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the given problem description, let's analyze the requirements and the code carefully.

The problem involves finding "good" pairs of integers (a, b) such that:
1. GCD(a, b) = x
2. LCM(a, b) = y
3. l ≤ a, b ≤ r

From the problem, we can derive that for pairs (a, b) to be good:
- The relationship between GCD and LCM gives us the equation: GCD(a, b) * LCM(a, b) = a * b. Hence, x * y = a * b.
- Since x divides y, we can consider the candidates for (a, b) as multiples of x. Specifically, we can rewrite the candidate pairs as:
  - Let a = k1 * x
  - Let b = k2 * x
- So the equation becomes: x * y = (k1 * x) * (k2 * x) => k1 * k2 = y / x
- Therefore, both k1 and k2 must be such that \( l/x ≤ k1, k2 ≤ r/x \).

Now let's evaluate the provided code and see if it addresses this properly.

### Provided Program Analysis
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function computes the GCD of two numbers, which will be used to verify the GCD condition.
2. **Function `func_2`**: Computes the LCM of two numbers.
3. **Missing Logic**: The provided program lacks any mechanism to actually calculate all pairs (a, b) within the range [l, r] that satisfy the conditions for x and y. There is no implementation that counts these pairs, and thus it cannot provide any output related to the counting of pairs.

### Example Potential Cases that Reveal Failure
- If we take `l = 1`, `r = 10`, `x = 1`, and `y = 10`, the valid pairs would involve checking conditions that the code does not handle. Specifically, while the code can compute GCD and LCM, it does not generate or check pairs of integers (a, b) from the specified range.

### Conclusion
Since the code does not correctly implement the necessary logic to find and count the valid pairs based on the input constraints of the problem description, it fails to meet the provided requirements entirely.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
(l, r, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
count = 0
for a in range(l, r + 1):
    for b in range(a, r + 1):
        if func_1(a, b) == x and func_2(a, b) == y:
            count += 1
print(count)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers greater than or equal to 1.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`, `b` is 0, where the loop executes until `b` becomes 0, and the original values of `a` and `b` are both greater than or equal to 1.
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`, where `b` is 0 and the original values of `a` and `b` are both greater than or equal to 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters, `a` and `b`, both of which must be greater than or equal to 1. It computes and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`. The function employs the Euclidean algorithm, where it repeatedly replaces `a` with `b` and `b` with the remainder of `a` divided by `b` until `b` reaches 0. At the conclusion of the function, `a` holds the GCD, and `b` is guaranteed to be 0. It is important to note that the function does not handle cases where `a` or `b` are less than 1, which could lead to incorrect behavior. Additionally, since the function does not check for inputs of `0`, it assumes the inputs will always meet the precondition of being at least 1.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers greater than or equal to 1.
def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b // func_1(a, b)
    #The program returns a multiplied by b divided by func_1(a, b), where a and b are integers greater than or equal to 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are both integers greater than or equal to 1. It calculates the result of `a` multiplied by `b`, and then divides this product by the result of the function `func_1(a, b)`. The function returns this final value. The returned value will depend on the implementation of `func_1`, which is not provided, and could introduce edge cases related to its return value, such as division by zero if `func_1(a, b)` returns 0. Hence, the function's final output depends on both the inputs `a` and `b`, and the behavior of `func_1`.



Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
