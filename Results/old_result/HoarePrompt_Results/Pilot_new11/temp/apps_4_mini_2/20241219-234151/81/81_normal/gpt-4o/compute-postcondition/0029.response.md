The value of `count` is incremented by 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `count` is increased by 2, `z` is equal to `y // x`, `i` is equal to `k + 2`, and `b` is equal to `(y // x) // (k + 2) * x` with `i` less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(z))`.

Output State: **`l` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `count` is increased by 2, `z` is equal to `y // x`, `i` is equal to `k + 2`, and `b` is equal to `(y // x) // (k + 2) * x` with `i` less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(z))**.
