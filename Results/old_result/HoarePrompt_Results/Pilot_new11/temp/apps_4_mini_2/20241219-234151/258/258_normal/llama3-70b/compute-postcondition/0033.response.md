The variable `ans` is updated to the minimum between its initial value and the value at the `K-1` index of the `times` array. The variable `times` is sorted, and since `K` is between 1 and `N`, the `times[K - 1]` is a valid reference. The values of `N`, `K`, `times`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer in the range 1 to 60; `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`; `times` is sorted; `ans` is updated to the minimum of the initial `ans` and `times[K - 1]`; `x` is 1001; `y` is -1000.**
