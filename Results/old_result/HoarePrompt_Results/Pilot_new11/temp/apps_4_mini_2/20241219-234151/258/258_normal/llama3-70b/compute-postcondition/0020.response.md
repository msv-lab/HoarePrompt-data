According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y`. The loop will iterate through values of `y` in the range from -1000 to 1000, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is -1000. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `y` will be incremented by 1. The new value of `y` will therefore be -999. The range indicates that `y` can take any integer from -1000 to 1000, so there are still values available for `y` to iterate over.

State: **`N` is an integer in the range 1 to 60; `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`; `ans` is updated to be min(`ans`, `times[K - 1]`); `y` is -999; `times` is assigned the result of `func_2(x, -1000, x, -1000) and sorted.**
