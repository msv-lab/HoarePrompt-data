According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `y`, which is initially set to -1000 and increments by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 1000. At the end of the last iteration, `y` would be at its maximum allowable value for the loop, specifically 1000. The next potential value of `y`, if the loop were to execute again, would be 1001, which exceeds the defined range for the loop. Thus, the loop cannot execute again.

Since there is no change to `N`, `K`, `times`, `ans`, `(x_i, y_i)`, and `c_i` required for the loop to execute again because the loop boundaries are already breached, we highlight that `y` needs to be adjusted to potentially exceed the maximum limit, which means we would state `y` to be beyond the loop's upper limit.

State: **`N` is an integer in the range 1 to 60, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `times` is sorted, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`, `y` is 1001, `(x_i, y_i)` are integer coordinates in the range -1000 to 1000, `c_i` is an integer in the range 1 to 100 for the i-th piece of meat.**
