Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Input Variables**: The function `func_2` takes the wrong parameters (`x, y` as coordinates of the meat instead of heat source coordinates). The function should calculate the time it takes for the meat pieces to grill based on the heat source coordinates instead.

2. **Heat Source Location Search**: The function `func_3` iterates over a grid of potential heat source locations from -1000 to 1000 for both x and y coordinates, which may not be the optimal or correct way to determine the best position for the heat source. This exhaustive search is computationally expensive and doesn't guarantee the optimal placement. Instead, it should ideally employ optimization techniques to find the best position for the heat source.

3. **Final Result**: The way `ans` is being calculated in `func_3` assumes that sorting `times` and taking the K-th smallest value will yield the correct grilling time, but this may not be sufficient to ensure the K pieces of meat are grilled within the minimum time.

For example, considering the input:
```
5 3
-1 0 1
0 0 1
1 0 1
2 0 1
3 0 1
```
The program could potentially miscalculate the time required for the K pieces of meat to be ready if the heat source is not optimally placed, leading to a wrong output. The expected output should reflect the minimum time achievable with an optimally chosen heat source location, which the program does not correctly compute.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem statement as it fails in its logic and implementation, leading to edge cases where it could give incorrect results.
