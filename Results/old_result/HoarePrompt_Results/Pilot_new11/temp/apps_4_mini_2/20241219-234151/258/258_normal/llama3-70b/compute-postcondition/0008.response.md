The `times` variable is sorted in ascending order, but we do not have information about its previous values or the result of the `func_2` function. Therefore, we cannot determine the specific order of values in `times` after sorting. The variable `ans` will also be updated to the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`, but we do not have specific information about `ans` or `times[K - 1]`. 

As a result, while we can note that the `times` array is now sorted, we do not have enough information to specify the detailed outcome for all the required variables. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer in the range 1 to 60, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `times` is sorted. `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`, `y` is -999, `(x_i, y_i)` are integer coordinates in the range -1000 to 1000, `c_i` is an integer in the range 1 to 100 for the i-th piece of meat.**
