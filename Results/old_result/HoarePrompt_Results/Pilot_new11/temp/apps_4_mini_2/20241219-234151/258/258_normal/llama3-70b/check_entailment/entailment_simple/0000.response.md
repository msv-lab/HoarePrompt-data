Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's a detailed explanation of how it satisfies the problem requirements:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program first reads the input parameters for the number of pieces of meat (`N`) and how many pieces Takahashi wants to eat (`K`). Then it correctly reads the coordinates and hardness of each piece of meat.

2. **Distance Calculation**: The `func_1` function accurately computes the distance between the heat source and the piece of meat using the Euclidean distance formula, which is essential for calculating the time taken to grill each piece of meat.

3. **Time Calculation for Each Meat**: The `func_2` function generates a list of times required for each piece of meat to be ready based on the heat source's position. It multiplies the distance (as calculated by `func_1`) by the hardness of each piece of meat (`c_i`), aligning perfectly with the formula given in the problem.

4. **Minimization of Time**: The `func_3` function iterates through all integer coordinates for the heat source within the specified range (-1000 to 1000). For each coordinate, it calls `func_2` to calculate the grilling times and sorts this list to find the time for the K-th piece of meat. The minimum time across all positions is stored in `ans`, fulfilling the requirement to find the optimal placement of the heat source to minimize the time for K pieces of meat.

5. **Returning the Result**: Finally, it returns the calculated minimum time, which corresponds to the output format described in the problem. The program's handling of time allows for a flexibility of up to an absolute or relative error of at most `10^{-6}`, as required.

6. **Efficiency**: Given the constraints (maximum of 60 pieces of meat and integer coordinates within the range), the approach of brute-forcing through a grid of coordinates is feasible and efficient within the provided limits.

In summary, the logic of the program follows the problem description correctly, capturing the essence of the requirement to determine the optimal heat source location for grilling the desired number of meat pieces in the least amount of time. Thus, the assessment of correctness is warranted as true.
