The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `float('inf')`, which represents positive infinity in floating-point arithmetic. The other variables, `N`, `K`, `(x_i, y_i)`, and `c_i`, are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state retains information about these variables and their current constraints.

Output State: **`N` is an integer in the range 1 to 60, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `(x_i, y_i)` are integer coordinates in the range -1000 to 1000, `c_i` is an integer in the range 1 to 100 for the i-th piece of meat, `ans` is positive infinity**.
