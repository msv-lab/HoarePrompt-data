The `continue` statement does not change any variable values but instead skips the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. The states of all variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T`, `cx` is the average of the last two x-coordinates `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is the average of the last two y-coordinates `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is equal to `dx * dx + dy * dy`, `count` is the sum of `c` values from `meats` where `math.sqrt((mx - x) < K)`, `N` must be greater than `i + 2`, `j` is `i + 2`, `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` are assigned from `meats[i]`, `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` are assigned from `meats[j]` if `c1 * T < c2 * T`, and we skip the current iteration of the loop.
