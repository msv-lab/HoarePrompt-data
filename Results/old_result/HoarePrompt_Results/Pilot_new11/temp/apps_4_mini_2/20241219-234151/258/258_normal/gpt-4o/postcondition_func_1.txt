The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `N`, a positive integer representing the number of available meats; `K`, a positive integer representing the number of meats to select; and `meats`, a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers that specify the coordinates and a value associated with each piece of meat. The function conducts a binary search within a specified range, adjusting the bounds (`low` and `high`) based on the results of the `func_1` evaluation with respect to `K` and a midpoint value `mid`. The loop continues until `low` and `high` are within a very small tolerance (1e-07). Finally, the function returns `high`, which indicates the upper boundary of the last successful evaluation of `func_1` for the meat selection problem. Notably, while the logic for selecting the meats is accurately iterated in the binary search, any potential edge cases that may arise from invalid inputs or edge conditions in the `func_1` evaluation are not explicitly handled within this function. If `func_1` fails for all iterations, `high` will reflect a scenario very close to an arbitrary high limit rather than a definitive meaningful outcome regarding meat selection.
