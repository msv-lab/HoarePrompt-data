The `continue` statement in the provided code snippet indicates that the current iteration of the loop will be skipped, and the next iteration will commence. In the context given, the values of the variables remain unchanged since no modifications are being made. However, the loop condition still applies, affecting the flow by not processing any further code in the current iteration.

Output State: **`d` is equal to the previous value of `d` divided by `c1 * c2`, `cx` is the average of the last two x-coordinates `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is the average of the last two y-coordinates `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is equal to `dx * dx + dy * dy`, `count` is the sum of `c` values from `meats` within threshold distance `T` from (`mx`, `my`), `i` is less than `N - 1`, `j` is `i + 1`, the loop continues if `d` is negative, and the current value of `d * d2 is greater than d2; the current iteration of the loop is skipped and the next iteration begins.**
