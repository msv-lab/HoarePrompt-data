Initial State: If `c1 * T < c2 * T`, then `d` is negative and equal to (c1 * T - c2 * T); `cx` is (x1 + x2) / 2; `cy` is (y1 + y2) / 2; `dx` is (x1 - x2) / 2; `dy` is (y1 - y2) / 2; `d2` is equal to (x1 - x2) * (x1 - x2) / 4 + (y1 - y2) * (y1 - y2) / 4; `count` is less than K; `i` is N - 1; `j` is N; and if the condition `d * d2 > d2` is met, then `mx` is equal to `cx + (dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2)`.

```
my = cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2
```

Now, considering the assigned values and the formula, `my` is calculated using the values of `cy`, `dx`, `d2`, and `d`. The earlier conditions state that if `c1 * T < c2 * T`, `d` is negative and `(cx, cy, dx, dy, d2)` are defined but don't change. Consequently, the new value of `my` will be determined by substituting the current known values.

Therefore, the output state is updated to reflect the new value of `my`:

Output State: **If `c1 * T < c2 * T`, then `d` is negative and equal to (c1 * T - c2 * T); `cx` is (x1 + x2) / 2; `cy` is (y1 + y2) / 2; `dx` is (x1 - x2) / 2; `dy` is (y1 - y2) / 2; `d2` is equal to (x1 - x2) * (x1 - x2) / 4 + (y1 - y2) * (y1 - y2) / 4; `count` is less than K; `i` is N - 1; `j` is N; and `my` is `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`.**
