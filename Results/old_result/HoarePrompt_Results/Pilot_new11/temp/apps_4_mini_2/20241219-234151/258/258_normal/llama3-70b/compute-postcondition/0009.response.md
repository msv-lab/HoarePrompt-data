The `ans` variable is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`. The value of `times[K - 1]` accesses the sorted list at index `K - 1`, which will return a specific value due to the provided range of `K` (1 to `N`, inclusive).

Since `N` is an integer in the range 1 to 60, `K` is constrained such that it is between 1 and `N`, and `times` is sorted, this ensures that `times[K - 1]` yields a valid value from `times`.

Other variables remain unaffected, so we will keep their conditions intact in the output.

Output State: **`N` is an integer in the range 1 to 60, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `times` is sorted, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`, `y` is -999, `(x_i, y_i)` are integer coordinates in the range -1000 to 1000, `c_i` is an integer in the range 1 to 100 for the i-th piece of meat.**
