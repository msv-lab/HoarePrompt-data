The variable `times` is assigned the result of calling the function `func_2` with parameters `(x, y, x, y)`. Since `y` is initially set to -999, the parameters become `(x, -999, x, -999)`. The impact of calling `func_2` on `times` is unknown without details about the function, but it modifies `times` directly. The other variables remain unchanged.

Since `times` is subsequently sorted, its sorted order will depend on the values produced by `func_2`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer in the range 1 to 60, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `(x_i, y_i)` are integer coordinates in the range -1000 to 1000, `c_i` is an integer in the range 1 to 100 for the i-th piece of meat, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`, `y` is -999, `times` is updated to the result of `func_2(x, -999, x, -999)` and is sorted.**
