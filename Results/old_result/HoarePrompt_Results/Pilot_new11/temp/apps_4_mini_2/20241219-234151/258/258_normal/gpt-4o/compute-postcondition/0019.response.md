The variable `y` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`, where `index` is currently 10. Thus, `y` will take on the integer value of the element at position `index + 1`, which is 11, in the `data` list. The other stated conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` must be greater than or equal to 2; `K` must be between 1 and `N` (inclusive); `meats` is now a list containing the existing tuples and the new tuple `(x, y, c)`; `index` is 10; `x` is equal to `int(data[10])`; `y` is equal to `int(data[11])`.**
