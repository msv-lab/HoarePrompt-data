Postcondition: ***`d`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, and `count` are defined as described in the precondition. If `count` is greater than or equal to `K`, the program returns True. In the absence of an else part, no other value or action is specified for the case when `count` is less than `K`.***
