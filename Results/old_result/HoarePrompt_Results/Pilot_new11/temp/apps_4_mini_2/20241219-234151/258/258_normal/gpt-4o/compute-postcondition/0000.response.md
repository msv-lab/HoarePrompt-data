The variable `data` is assigned the value of `input().split()`, which takes input from the user, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns that list to `data`. The initial conditions regarding `N`, `K`, and `meats` remain unchanged since they are not directly affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer representing the number of pieces of meat, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, and `meats` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (x_i, y_i, c_i) representing the coordinates and hardness of each piece of meat, with constraints where -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000 and 1 <= c_i <= 100; `data` is a list of strings from the input**.
