The `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` variables are assigned the values from the `meats[j]` which correspond to the index `j`, where `j` is previously defined as `i + 2`. The initial state ensures that `N` is greater than `i + 2`, confirming that `j` is a valid index of the `meats` list.

The values of `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` are now equal to the values in `meats[j]`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`d`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, and `count` are defined as described in the precondition, `count` is less than `K`, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `j` is equal to `i + 2`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are assigned the values from `meats[i]`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are assigned the values from `meats[j]`.**
