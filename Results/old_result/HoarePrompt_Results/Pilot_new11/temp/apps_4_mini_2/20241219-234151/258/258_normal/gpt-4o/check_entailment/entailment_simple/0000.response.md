The provided Python program aims to solve the problem described, where Takahashi wants to grill pieces of meat using a heat source positioned in a way that minimizes the time required for at least K pieces to be ready. Let's analyze the program and check if it adheres to the requirements of the problem description.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads input values representing the number of pieces of meat (N), the required number of pieces to be ready (K), and the associated coordinates and hardness values of each piece of meat. This input is correctly structured and parsed.

2. **Function Definitions**:
   - `func_1`: This function takes a list of meat tuples, K, and a time threshold T. It checks combinations of pieces of meat to see if the heat source can be positioned such that at least K pieces are ready within the time T. The logic for calculating the distances and determining if the count of ready meat is sufficient appears correct.
   - `func_2`: This function performs a binary search on the time value, calling `func_1` repeatedly to narrow down the minimum time required. The termination condition is set to ensure that the final time found is precise to at least 1e-7, which meets the problem's requirement for accuracy.
   - `func_3`: This function serves as the main entry point, gathering input, invoking the calculation function, and formatting the output to six decimal places as required by the problem statement.

3. **Correctness of the Logic**:
   - The mathematical operations and logic for calculating the necessary times are handled appropriately. The program uses the hardiness of the meat and the distance from the heat source effectively.
   - The check in `func_1` ensures that if a configuration allows K or more pieces to be ready in time T, it returns True. If all pairs of meat are considered, and none allow for K pieces to be ready in time less than or equal to T, it returns False.

### Conclusion

The program adheres closely to the problem description:
- It correctly reads input, processes it, and attempts to find the optimal grilling time.
- It ensures that the calculations respect the requirements outlined (e.g., handling the hardness and distances correctly).
- It correctly prints the output using the specified formatting.

Thus, having evaluated the entire program and its adherence to the problem requirements, we conclude:

Correctness: **True**
