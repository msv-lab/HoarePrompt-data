The function `func_2` is called with parameters `(x, y, x, y)`. Since the values of `x` and `y` themselves are not given in the initial state, we cannot ascertain their specific values. The output of `func_2` is assigned to `times`, but without knowledge of what `func_2` computes with the provided parameters, we cannot determine the resulting value of `times`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the unchanged variables and the assignment of `times`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer in the range 1 to 60, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `(x_i, y_i)` are integer coordinates in the range -1000 to 1000, `c_i` is an integer in the range 1 to 100 for the i-th piece of meat, `ans` is positive infinity, `y` is -1000, `times` is assigned the result of func_2(x, y, x, y)**
