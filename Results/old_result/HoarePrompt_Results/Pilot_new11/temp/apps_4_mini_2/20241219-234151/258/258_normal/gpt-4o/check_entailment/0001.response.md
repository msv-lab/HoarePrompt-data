To assess the correctness of the given Python program based on the provided problem description regarding grilling pieces of meat, let’s analyze the logic implemented in the code.

### Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(meats, K, T)`**:
    - The function iterates through all pairs of meat pieces. For each pair, it calculates a mid-point and attempts to find a point `(mx, my)` such that enough pieces can be cooked within time `T`.
    - The conditions and math implemented seem to implement a geometric approach to resolve the meat grilling problem by referencing how far the heat acts on the pieces of meat (using their hardness).

2. **Function `func_2(N, K, meats)`**:
    - This function attempts to find the minimal time required using binary search over the time `T`.
    - The loop continues until the potential difference between `low` and `high` is very small (`1e-07`), ensuring a high precision in the output.

3. **Function `func_3()`**:
    - This function handles input parsing and directly ties the functions together to produce an output.

### Potential Edge Cases:
- The code seems to rely heavily on the calculation involving `c1 * T` and `c2 * T`, and relies on careful handling of distances and midpoints.
- A potential issue could arise if it misses cases where meat pieces are at extreme coordinates but possess high hardness. The precision in determining `(mx, my)` may not accurately reflect the optimal heat point for every potential configuration of meat pieces under varying `T`.
- The given boundaries of the problem and constraints are all respected, but without testing the specific input values and configurations, it’s difficult to assert that it functions correctly under all conditions specified.

### Test Input Example:
One example to consider is if:
```plaintext
N = 3, K = 2
-1000 0 1
0 1000 1
0 -1000 1
```
- Here, the pieces of meat are spread widely, and all have the same hardness. The function should ideally locate an efficient point for grilling.

### Conclusion:
- After examining the logic, while it aims to capture pivotal cases through calculations of `(mx, my)`, it could still falter on edge cases that involve extreme values or specifically arranged meat coordinates affecting how heat disperses due to corresponding hardness.

Thus, given the potential edge cases and the complexity of geometric placements versus hardness:

Correctness: **False**
