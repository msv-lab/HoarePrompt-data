To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have completed, we analyze the behavior of the loop based on the provided code and initial state.

The loop iterates `y` from -1000 to 1000 (inclusive), which means it executes a total of 2001 times. During each iteration, it computes the `times` list with `func_2(x, y, x, y)`, sorts this list, and updates `ans` with the minimum value between its current value and `times[K - 1]`. The variable `x` remains constant at 1001 throughout the iterations.

Given that `N` is in the range from 1 to 60 and `K` is a non-negative integer that must be at least 1 and at most `N`, the following conclusions can be drawn:

1. `N` retains its value from the initial state (between 1 and 60).
2. `K` also retains its value, remaining in the range specified (1 to N).
3. `y` will have ranged from -1000 to 1000, and in the last iteration, its final value will be 1000.
4. The `times` variable will have been sorted through the loop iterations, and we will have been updating `ans` each time based on the minimum of its original value and different `times[K - 1]` values.

Thus, when the loop completes:

- `y` will be 1000.
- `times` will have been sorted on each iteration but it's not specified what `func_2` returns, so we cannot determine its final state.
- `ans` will have been continuously updated throughout the iterations based on its original value and various `times[K - 1]` values, but its final value is not specified.

Considering all of these factors, the output state will outline the relationships and values known after the loop has executed completely:

Output State: **`N` is an integer in the range 1 to 60; `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`; `y` is 1000; `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(1001, 1000, 1001, 1000)`; `ans` is updated to the minimum of its original value and the last `times[K - 1]`.**
