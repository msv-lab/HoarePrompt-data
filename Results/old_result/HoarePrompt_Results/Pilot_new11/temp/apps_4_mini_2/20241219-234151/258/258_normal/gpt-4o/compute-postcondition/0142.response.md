Output State: **`d` is the calculated difference based on the conditions of the meats, `cx` is the average x-coordinate from the last two tuples processed, `cy` is the average y-coordinate from the last two tuples processed, `dx` and `dy` represent half the differences of the respective coordinates from the last two tuples processed, `d2` is the squared distance between the last two tuples processed, `count` is the sum of `c` values from `meats` that are within the threshold distance `T` from the final calculated point (`mx`, `my`), `i` is N, `N` must be greater than `i + 1`, `x1` is taken from `meats[i]`, `y1` is taken from `meats[i]`, `c1` is taken from `meats[i]`, `x2` is taken from `meats[j]`, `y2` is taken from `meats[j]`, `c2` is taken from `meats[j]`.**
