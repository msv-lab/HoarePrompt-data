The code calculates `dy` as half the difference between `y1` and `y2`. The values of `y1` and `y2` are not given directly, but `dy`'s calculation is fully dependent on these two variables, so it is defined as `dy = (y1 - y2) / 2`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is:
`count` is less than `K`, `j` is equal to `i + 2`, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`, and `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`.

Output State: **`count` is less than `K`, `j` is equal to `i + 2`, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`**.
