The `times` variable is assigned the result of `func_2(x, -998, x, -998)` and is subsequently sorted. The initial state contains `times` in an unsorted form but does not provide further details about the content of `times`. The sorting operation will change the order of elements in `times`, but the actual content of `times` after sorting is unknown. The states of the other variables remain unaffected, except that the content of `times` will now be in sorted order.

Output State: **`N` is an integer in the range 1 to 60; `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`; `ans` is updated to be min(`ans`, `times[K - 1]`); `y` is -998; `times` is now sorted.**
