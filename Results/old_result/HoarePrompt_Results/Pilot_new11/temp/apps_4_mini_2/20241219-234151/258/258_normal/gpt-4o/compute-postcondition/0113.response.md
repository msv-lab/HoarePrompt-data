To calculate the new value of `my`, we need to analyze the variable dependencies based on the provided initial state.

1. `my` is calculated using the formula: 
   \[
   my = cy - dx \times \frac{\sqrt{d2 \times d - d \times d}}{d2}
   \]

2. From the initial state:
   - `cy = (y1 + y2) / 2`
   - `dx = (x1 - x2) / 2`
   - `d2 = dx \times dx + dy \times dy`
   - `d` is determined by: 
   \[
   d = \frac{(c1 - c2) \times T}{c1 \times c2}
   \]

After substituting the values of `cy`, `dx`, `d2`, and `d` into the equation for `my` while keeping in mind that `mx` remains unchanged by this operation, we note that `my` is now defined given the updated formula.

With all the dependencies handled and values plugged in, the impact of this code on the output state is that `my` is updated while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d` is equal to `((c1 - c2) * T) / (c1 * c2)`; `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`; `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`; `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`; `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`; `d2` is equal to `dx * dx + dy * dy`; `count` is the sum of the `c` values from `meats`; `N` is greater than `i + 2`; `j` is set to `i + 2`; `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` are assigned from `meats[i]`; `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` are assigned from `meats[j]`; `my` is equal to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`.**
