The loop iterates over the range of `y` values from -1000 to 1000, totaling 2001 iterations. In each iteration, it calculates a `times` list based on the function `func_2`, and then updates `ans` with the minimum of its current value and the `K-1` indexed value from the sorted `times` list.

Based on the code, we can derive the final state after all iterations:

- `N` remains an integer in the range 1 to 60.
- `K` remains a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`.
- `y` will have the final value of 1000 (the last value in the loop).
- `times` will hold the sorted results from the last execution of `func_2(x, 1000, x, 1000)`.
- `ans` will be updated to contain the minimum of its initial value and the last `times[K - 1]` value.

Thus, the output state after the loop has executed all iterations is:

Output State: **`N` is an integer in the range 1 to 60; `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`; `y` is 1000; `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(x, 1000, x, 1000); `ans` is the minimum value of the initial `ans` and `times[K - 1]`.**
