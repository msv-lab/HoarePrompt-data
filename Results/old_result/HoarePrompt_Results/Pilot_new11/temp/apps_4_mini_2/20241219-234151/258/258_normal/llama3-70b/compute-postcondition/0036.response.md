The code sorts the list `times`, which initially holds the output of `func_2(1001, -999, 1001, -999)`. The variable `times` is now sorted in ascending order, but since we do not have the specific values from `times`, we can only express the relationship that `times` is now sorted. The state of other variables remains unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer in the range 1 to 60, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `times` is sorted, and `ans` is updated to the minimum of the initial `ans` and `times[K - 1]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer in the range 1 to 60; `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`; `times` is sorted; `ans` is updated to the minimum of the initial `ans` and `times[K - 1]**.
