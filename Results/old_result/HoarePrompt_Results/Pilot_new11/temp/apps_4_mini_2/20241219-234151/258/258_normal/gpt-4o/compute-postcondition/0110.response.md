The code `continue` is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. In this case, it does not change any variable values but influences the flow of execution.

The initial state included several computations and assignments leading up to this point. However, since the `continue` statement is hit, the loop iteration will skip any further operations and move to the next iteration.

Output State: **`d` is equal to `((c1 - c2) * T) / (c1 * c2)`; `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`; `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`; `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`; `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`; `d2` is equal to `dx * dx + dy * dy`; `count` is the sum of the `c` values from `meats`; `N` is greater than `i + 2`; `j` is set to `i + 2`; `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` are assigned from `meats[i]`; `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` are assigned from `meats[j]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
