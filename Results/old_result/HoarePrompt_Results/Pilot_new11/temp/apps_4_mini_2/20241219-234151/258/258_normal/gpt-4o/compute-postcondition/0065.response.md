The variable `my` is assigned the value of `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`. Given the initial state:

- `d` is a negative value resulting from `(c1 - c2) * T`
- `count` is less than `K`
- `N` is greater than `i + 2`
- `j` is equal to `i + 2`
- `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`
- `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`
- `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`
- `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`
- `d2` is equal to `((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2) / 4`
- `mx` is calculated as `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`.

The initial conditions do not affect the calculation of `my`, so we evaluate it based on the formula provided. 

After executing the code:

- The value of `my` becomes `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Thus, the Output State is: **`d` is a negative value resulting from (c1 - c2) * T; `count` is less than `K`; `N` is greater than `i + 2`; `j` is equal to `i + 2`; `cx` is equal to (x1 + x2) / 2; `cy` is equal to (y1 + y2) / 2; `dx` is equal to (x1 - x2) / 2; `dy` is equal to (y1 - y2) / 2; `d2` is equal to ((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2) / 4; `mx` is calculated as cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2; `my` is equal to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`.**
