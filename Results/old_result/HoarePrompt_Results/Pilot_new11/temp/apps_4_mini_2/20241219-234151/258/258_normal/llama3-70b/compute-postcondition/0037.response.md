The variable `ans` is updated to the minimum of its initial value and the value at the `K-1` index of the `times` list. Since `K` is within the range from 1 to `N`, `times[K - 1]` is valid and retrieves the corresponding value from the sorted list. The value of `ans` is potentially reduced based on the comparison with `times[K - 1]`.

Thus, the Output State will indicate the updated value of `ans` based on its comparison with `times[K - 1]`, while all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer in the range 1 to 60; `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`; `times` is sorted; `ans` is updated to the minimum of its initial value and `times[K - 1]**
