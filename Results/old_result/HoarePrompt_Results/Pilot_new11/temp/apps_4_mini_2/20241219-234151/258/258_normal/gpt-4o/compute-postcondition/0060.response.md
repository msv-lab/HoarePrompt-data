The variable `dy` is assigned the value of `(y1 - y2) / 2`. The states of the other variables (`d`, `count`, `N`, `j`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`) are not affected. The values of `y1` and `y2` are not directly provided, so they are considered as unknown.

Output State: **`d` is a negative value resulting from `(c1 - c2) * T`, `count` is less than `K`, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `j` is equal to `i + 2`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2**.
