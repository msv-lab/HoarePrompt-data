According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `x`. The loop iterates over the range from -1000 to 1000, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, since `x` has iterated through all values from -1000 to 1000, we deduce that `x` is currently at the last value of this range, which is 1000.

For the loop to execute one more time, `x` would need to move to 1001; however, since 1001 is outside the given range in the constraint `x in range(-1000, 1001)`, the loop cannot execute again.

Thus, we recognize that the current loop iteration has reached its endpoint and cannot iterate any further. 

State: **`N` is an integer in the range 1 to 60, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `(x_i, y_i)` are integer coordinates in the range -1000 to 1000, `c_i` is an integer in the range 1 to 100 for the i-th piece of meat, `ans` contains the minimum of the `times[K - 1]` values across all `y` values from -1000 to 1000, and `x` is 1001**
