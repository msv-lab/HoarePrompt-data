The value of `d2` is assigned the result of the expression `dx * dx + dy * dy`. Given the initial state, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2` and `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`. Therefore, `d2` becomes the sum of the squares of those two calculated distances. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d` is equal to (c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2), `cx` is equal to (x1 + x2) / 2, `cy` is equal to (y1 + y2) / 2, `dx` is equal to (x1 - x2) / 2, `dy` is equal to (y1 - y2) / 2, `d2` is equal to (dx * dx + dy * dy), `count` is the sum of `c` values from `meats` that are within threshold distance `T` from the final calculated point (`mx`, `my`), `i` is N where N is greater than `i + 1`.**
