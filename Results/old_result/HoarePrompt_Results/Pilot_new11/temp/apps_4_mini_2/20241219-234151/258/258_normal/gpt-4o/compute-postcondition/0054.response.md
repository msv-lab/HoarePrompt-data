The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. As such, it does not change any of the variable values, including `d`, `count`, `N`, or `j`. The initial conditions remain unchanged, except we note that the loop iteration has been bypassed.

Output State: **`d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T`, where `c1` is less than `c2`; `count` is less than `K`; `N` is greater than `i + 2`; `j` is equal to `i + 2` and we have continued to the next iteration of the loop.**
