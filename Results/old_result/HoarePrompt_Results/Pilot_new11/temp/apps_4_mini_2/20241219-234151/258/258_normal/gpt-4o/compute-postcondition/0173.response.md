Output State: **If `c1 * T < c2 * T`, then `d` is negative, equal to (c1 * T - c2 * T) and now d is updated to d / (c1 * c2); `cx` is (x1 + x2) / 2; `cy` is (y1 + y2) / 2; `dx` is (x1 - x2) / 2; `dy` is (y1 - y2) / 2; `d2` is (dx * dx + dy * dy); `count` is less than K; `i` is N - 1; `j` is N; `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` are taken from the elements of meats[N - 1], and `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` are taken from the elements of meats[N].**
