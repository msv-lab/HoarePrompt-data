Output State: **`d` is the result of the computations based on the last tuples in `meats`, `cx` and `cy` are the average of the coordinates from the last two tuples in `meats`, `dx` and `dy` are half the differences of the respective coordinates from the last two tuples, `d2` is the squared distance between the last two tuples, `count` is calculated as the sum of `c` values from `meats` that are within the threshold distance `T` from the final calculated point (`mx`, `my`), `i` is less than `N - 1`, `j` is `i + 1`, `x1, y1, c1` are assigned the values of the tuple `meats[i]`.**
