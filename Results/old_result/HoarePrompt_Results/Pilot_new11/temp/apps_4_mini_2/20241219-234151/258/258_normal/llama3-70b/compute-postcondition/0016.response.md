To determine the necessary states for the for loop to execute, we need to analyze the loop statement and the provided state conditions.

The for loop iterates through the variable `y`, which takes on the values from -1000 to 1000 (inclusive). Given that this range spans from -1000 to 1000, it contains a total of 2001 values.

Here are the relevant states based on the given information:

1. **Variables Influencing the Loop**: The loop depends solely on the variable `y`, which iterates through the specified range.
2. **Pre-loop State Context**: Before the loop starts, we have `x` set to 1001, which is outside the loop's defined range for `y`. However, it appears that this does not prevent the loop from executing since `y` ranges from -1000 to 1000 independently of `x`.
3. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`N`, `K`, `(x_i, y_i)`, `c_i`, and `ans`) do not influence the execution of the loop itself but might affect operations within the loop.

For the loop to execute, no adjustments are necessary for the loop counter `y` as it is defined correctly to run through the range from -1000 to 1000. However, we can clarify the starting state of `y` and confirm that `ans` must be valid prior to loop execution context.

Thus, the necessary states for the loop to execute are already satisfied by the initial setup. The important factors to include in the adjusted state are the starting value of `y` and ensuring `ans` is defined properly.

State: **`N` is an integer in the range 1 to 60, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `ans` contains a minimum value, `y` is -1000**
