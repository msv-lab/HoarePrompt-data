According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `x`, which starts at -1000 and increments with each iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `x` has a current value that needs to be updated for the loop to execute again. Since the loop range is from -1000 to 1000, the last value of `x` in the previous iteration must be 1000.

To determine whether the loop can execute again, we note that the stopping condition occurs when `x` exceeds 1000. Therefore, the loop can execute one more time if the starting condition is still met when `x` is incremented.

If `x` is currently at 1000, then for the loop to execute one additional time, `x` must become 1001, which exceeds the upper limit of the range.

State: **`N` is an integer in the range 1 to 60; `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`; `y` is 1000; `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(x, 1000, x, 1000); `ans` is the minimum value of the initial `ans` and `times[K - 1]; x is 1001**
