To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the relevant parts step by step.

### Problem Requirements
The problem states that we need to determine the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns to correct a captured image based on a given camera angle. We need to account for both clockwise (positive angles) and counter-clockwise (negative angles) rotations. The valid outputs are integers ranging from 0 to 3, representing the required number of turns in the clockwise direction.

### Program Breakdown
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads a single integer input, which aligns with the problem requirements.
   
2. **Normalization**:
   - The input angle `x` is normalized within the range 0 to 359 degrees using `normalized_angle = x % 360`. This is appropriate since any angle can be converted to its equivalent angle within a complete rotation.

3. **Turn Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the necessary turns to align the camera using:
     ```python
     turns = (360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4
     ```
   - This formula effectively computes how far `normalized_angle` is from the next complete 90-degree mark. Since the problem requires counting turns, this logic takes into account the need for minimizing the number of turns.

4. **Output**:
   - Finally, the function prints the calculated number of turns required.

### Validation Against Problem Description
- **Positive Angles**: For a positive angle (e.g., 60 degrees), the normalization will yield the same result, and `(360 - 60) // 90` results in `3`, which is correct as it corresponds to three 90-degree clockwise turns necessary to reach the nearest upright position. 
- **Negative Angles**: For negative angles like -60, normalizing it will yield `300` degrees after `x % 360`. The turns are calculated as `(360 - 300) // 90`, resulting in `3` turns to minimize deviation.

### Conclusion
The program successfully processes both positive and negative camera angles while adhering to the requirement of minimal 90-degree clockwise turns. Additionally, it correctly normalizes angles and computes the required output based solely on integer division, ensuring no fractional turns occur.

Given all the points evaluated, the program does indeed follow the problem description requirements perfectly for all potential valid inputs, handling both counter-clockwise and clockwise rotations correctly.

Correctness: **True**
