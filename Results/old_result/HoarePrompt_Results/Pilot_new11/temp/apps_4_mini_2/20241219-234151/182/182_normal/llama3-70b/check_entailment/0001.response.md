Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle angles that are outside the range of -180 to 180 degrees, nor does it properly account for the fact that the effective rotations (to reduce the angle to the minimum deviation) need to be adjusted based on the direction of the input. 

For example, let's analyze an input of `-180` degrees. 

1. For `x = -180`, we should wrap the angle to this range. Negative 180 degrees can also be visualized as a half turn counter-clockwise, which would mean we want to figure out how many 90-degree clockwise rotations we need. The immediate output should be `0` since -180 is already aligned vertically.
   
2. However, for `x = -180`, the program will output `2` because it considers how many 90-degree rotations are needed for 180 degrees; it considers this value modulo 360, which does not truly reflect the reality of the required rotations considering counter-clockwise is treated as positive.

Thus, the program outputs an incorrect number of required rotations for certain inputs, like `-180`, which shows that it does not handle the behavior of angles correctly for every potential case described in the problem.
