To determine if the provided Python program meets the requirements of the problem description, we need to analyze both the problem description and the annotated program in detail.

**Problem Description Recap:**
1. The camera can be rotated in both clockwise and counter-clockwise directions, represented by a signed integer angle \( x \).
2. Our objective is to find the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise rotations required to correct the image so that it deviates minimally from the vertical.
3. A positive \( x \) denotes clockwise rotation and a negative \( x \) indicates counter-clockwise rotation.
4. The output should be the minimum integer representing the number of 90-degree clockwise turns required.

**Annotated Program Analysis:**
1. The program reads an integer input \( x \), which is normalized to the range of 0 to 359 degrees using modulo 360. This is correct since any angle can be reduced to an equivalent angle within this range.
2. If the normalized angle \( x \) is 0, it prints 0, indicating no rotations are needed, which is correct since the image is already correctly oriented.
3. For any other angle, it computes the expression:
   \[
   \text{print}((x + 90 - 1) // 90 \% 4)
   \]
   This expression aims to find how many 90-degree clockwise turns are needed to correct the image. 

4. The formula calculates how many 90-degree rotations are necessary by adjusting the angle to account for nearest divisible angles. The expression `((x + 90 - 1) // 90)` effectively computes the division for positive angles, while the `% 4` ensures it wraps around correctly, considering rotations modulo full rotations (360 degrees).

**Correctness Discussion:**
1. **Counter-clockwise angles**:
   For negative angles, the normalization step converts them to their equivalent clockwise rotation:
   - For example, if \( x = -60 \), then \( x \% 360 \) yields 300 (since -60 + 360 = 300). The rotational equivalence allows the program to correctly interpret counter-clockwise angles as a measure of how much clockwise rotation would be required to recover the original vertical position.
   
2. In terms of achieving minimal deviation:
   - After computing the adjusted rotation, the program outputs the number of rotations needed to reach the closest right-angle orientation (0, 90, 180, or 270 degrees), ensuring optimal performance as specified in the problem description.

**Conclusion**:
The program correctly executes the necessary steps to determine the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns required to achieve the proper orientation of the image, covering both clockwise and counter-clockwise angles correctly.

Correctness: **True**
