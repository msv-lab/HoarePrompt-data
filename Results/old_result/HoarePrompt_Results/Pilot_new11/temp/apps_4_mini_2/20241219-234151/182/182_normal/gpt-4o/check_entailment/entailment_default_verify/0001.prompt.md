You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya started working in a machine vision company of IT City. Vasya's team creates software and hardware for identification of people by their face.

One of the project's know-how is a camera rotating around its optical axis on shooting. People see an eye-catching gadget — a rotating camera — come up to it to see it better, look into it. And the camera takes their photo at that time. What could be better for high quality identification?

But not everything is so simple. The pictures from camera appear rotated too (on clockwise camera rotation frame the content becomes rotated counter-clockwise). But the identification algorithm can work only with faces that are just slightly deviated from vertical.

Vasya was entrusted to correct the situation — to rotate a captured image so that image would be minimally deviated from vertical. Requirements were severe. Firstly, the picture should be rotated only on angle divisible by 90 degrees to not lose a bit of information about the image. Secondly, the frames from the camera are so huge and FPS is so big that adequate rotation speed is provided by hardware FPGA solution only. And this solution can rotate only by 90 degrees clockwise. Of course, one can apply 90 degrees turn several times but for the sake of performance the number of turns should be minimized.

Help Vasya implement the program that by the given rotation angle of the camera can determine the minimum number of 90 degrees clockwise turns necessary to get a picture in which up direction deviation from vertical is minimum.

The next figure contains frames taken from an unrotated camera, then from rotated 90 degrees clockwise, then from rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise. Arrows show direction to "true up". [Image] 

The next figure shows 90 degrees clockwise turn by FPGA hardware. [Image] 


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains one integer x ( - 10^18 ≤ x ≤ 10^18) — camera angle in degrees. Positive value denotes clockwise camera rotation, negative — counter-clockwise.


-----Output-----

Output one integer — the minimum required number of 90 degrees clockwise turns.


-----Examples-----
Input
60

Output
1

Input
-60

Output
3



-----Note-----

When the camera is rotated 60 degrees counter-clockwise (the second example), an image from it is rotated 60 degrees clockwise. One 90 degrees clockwise turn of the image result in 150 degrees clockwise total rotation and deviation from "true up" for one turn is 150 degrees. Two 90 degrees clockwise turns of the image result in 240 degrees clockwise total rotation and deviation from "true up" for two turns is 120 degrees because 240 degrees clockwise equal to 120 degrees counter-clockwise. Three 90 degrees clockwise turns of the image result in 330 degrees clockwise total rotation and deviation from "true up" for three turns is 30 degrees because 330 degrees clockwise equal to 30 degrees counter-clockwise.

From 60, 150, 120 and 30 degrees deviations the smallest is 30, and it it achieved in three 90 degrees clockwise turns.
Program:
```
def func():
    x = int(input())
    normalized_angle = x % 360
    turns = (360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4
    print(turns)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze how the program handles various input angles.

The program defines a function that:
1. Takes an integer input representing the angle \( x \).
2. Normalizes \( x \) to a value between 0 and 359 degrees using \( x \% 360 \).
3. Calculates the number of 90-degree clockwise rotations needed to reduce the angle deviation from vertical.

### Analysis of Edge Cases
1. **Input of 0 degrees:**
   - The camera is already at the vertical position.
   - The expected output is `0` (no turns).

2. **Input of 90 degrees:**
   - The image is rotated to 90 degrees clockwise.
   - The expected output is `1` (one turn).

3. **Input of 180 degrees:**
   - The image becomes upside-down, effectively at 180 degrees clockwise.
   - The expected output is `2` (two turns).

4. **Input of 270 degrees:**
   - The image is rotated 270 degrees clockwise.
   - The expected output is `3` (three turns).

5. **Input of -60 degrees:**
   - After normalization, this becomes \( 300 \) degrees clockwise.
   - The calculations show that:
     - 1 turn gives \( 300 + 90 = 390 \) (equivalent to \( 30 \) degrees counter-clockwise).
     - 2 turns give \( 300 + 180 = 480 \) (equivalent to \( 120 \) degrees counter-clockwise).
     - 3 turns give \( 300 + 270 = 570 \) (equivalent to \( 240 \) degrees counter-clockwise).
     - Hence minimal deviation is achieved with `3` turns, which is correct.

6. **Input of 360 degrees or any multiple thereof:**
   - These cases should also yield `0` since the camera is still considered vertically aligned.

7. **Input of a negative number like -90 degrees:**
   - Normalization gives \( 270 \) degrees.
   - The expected turns would bring it to a vertical position and should yield `3` turns.

### Potential Fail Case
However, there is an edge case with the current logic. Consider the input `-1`:
- Normalization gives \( 359 \) degrees clockwise. 
- The output would be calculated as:
  - \( (360 - 359) // 90 \% 4 \) → \( 1 \) turn computed.
- But actually, the angle results in \( 359 \) degrees clockwise, and only \( 1 \) turn is not enough to minimize the deviation.

As such, the program does not account for directly achieving vertical alignment as required by the problem statement for every single input edge case.

### Conclusion
Due to the above identified issues where the program does not account correctly for certain angles which should yield a different number of turns based on the derived clockwise rotations, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts no parameters directly but reads an integer input from the user, which represents a camera angle in degrees (`x`). It then normalizes this angle to find its equivalent within the range of 0 to 359 degrees. It calculates how many 90-degree turns are needed to align the camera to the nearest reference point (effectively determining how far the angle is from being facing 'up' or 0 degrees). Finally, it prints the number of 90-degree turns required, which can vary from 0 to 3 depending on the input angle's value. The function does not return any value.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
