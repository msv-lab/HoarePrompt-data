The function `func` accepts a parameter `x`. `x` is an integer representing the rotation angle of the camera in degrees, with the constraint that -10^18 ≤ x ≤ 10^18. After executing the function body, the output or behavior based on `x` has not been specified in the provided information. Therefore, we can't determine specific return values or additional cases regarding what the function does with `x`. 

Since there is no output specified in the return value, we can only outline the accepted parameter.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter x, which is an integer representing the rotation angle of the camera in degrees.**
