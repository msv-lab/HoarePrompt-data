The function `func` accepts a parameter `x`. `x` is an integer representing the camera angle in degrees, where -10^18 ≤ x ≤ 10^18. However, the output details regarding what the function returns based on the value of `x` are not provided. Therefore, I cannot specify the functionality without additional information about the output for the function. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter x, which is an integer representing the camera angle in degrees. The specific return value based on x is not provided.**
