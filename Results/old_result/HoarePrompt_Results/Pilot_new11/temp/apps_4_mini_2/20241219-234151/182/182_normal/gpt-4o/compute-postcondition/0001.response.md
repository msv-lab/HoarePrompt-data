The variable `normalized_angle` is assigned the value of `x % 360`, which calculates the remainder of the division of `x` by 360. Since `x` is an integer representing the camera angle in degrees, `normalized_angle` will effectively normalize `x` to a range between 0 and 359 degrees.

Therefore, the Output State will include the original value of `x` and the new value of `normalized_angle`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer representing the camera angle in degrees; `normalized_angle` is `x % 360`.**
