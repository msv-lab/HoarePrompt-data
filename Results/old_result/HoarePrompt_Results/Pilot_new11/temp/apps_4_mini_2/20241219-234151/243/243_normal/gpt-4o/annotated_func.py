    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is less than 5, `count` is equal to the sum of all integer divisions of the original value of `n` by powers of 5 (5, 25, 125, ...), and `power_of_5` is the smallest power of 5 greater than the original value of `n` that caused the loop to terminate. If `n` was initially less than 5, `count` remains 0 and `power_of_5` is 5.
    return count
    #The program returns count which is equal to 0 since n is less than 5, resulting in no contributions from integer divisions by powers of 5.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` receives a non-negative integer `n` and calculates the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `n` (denoted as `n!`). It does this by counting how many times `n` can be divided by increasing powers of 5 (i.e., 5, 25, 125, ...). The result, stored in the variable `count`, represents the total count of trailing zeroes in `n!`. If `n` is less than 5, the function will return 0, as there cannot be any trailing zeroes. Therefore, the function correctly identifies the number of trailing zeroes for any non-negative integer, including edge cases where `n` is less than 5, returning an accurate count based on the integer divisions.

    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `high` is less than `5 * (m + 1)`, `low` is greater than `high`, `result` contains integers that correspond to the original value of `m` when passed through `func_1`, where the number of zeroes returned matches `m`. If `zeroes` was less than `m` in the last iteration, then `low` would have been updated to `mid + 1`; if `zeroes` was greater than `m`, `high` would have been updated to `mid - 1`. If `zeroes` were equal to `m`, the loops would finalize the `result` list to include the correct range around `mid`.`
    return result
    #The program returns the list 'result' that contains integers corresponding to the original value of 'm' when passed through 'func_1', ensuring the number of zeroes returned matches 'm'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer `m` (where 1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000) and searches for all integers `n` such that `n!` (n factorial) ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes. It utilizes a binary search strategy with a helper function `func_1` to count the trailing zeroes of `n!`. If it finds a range of integers that yield exactly `m` trailing zeroes, it collects those integers into a list named `result`. If no such integers are found, the function returns an empty list. It is important to note that if `func_1` has not been adequately designed to handle the calculation of trailing zeroes for all potential `n`, this could lead to incomplete or incorrect results. Finally, the function returns the list of integers which reflect the extent of `m` trailing zeroes corresponding to their factorials.
