The value of `zeroes` is assigned the result of the function `func_1(mid)`, where `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`. Since `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `mid` will be defined based on specific values of `low` and `high`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is (low + high) // 2; `zeroes` is the result of `func_1(mid)`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is (low + high) // 2; `zeroes` is the result of `func_1(mid)`.**
