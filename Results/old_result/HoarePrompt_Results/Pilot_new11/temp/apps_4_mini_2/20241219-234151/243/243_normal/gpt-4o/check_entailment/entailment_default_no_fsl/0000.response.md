Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle cases where the factorial of `n` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes. According to the problem description and the provided examples, for input `1`, the correct output is `5` with the integers `5, 6, 7, 8, 9`, which indicates that there are five numbers whose factorials produce exactly one trailing zero. However, for the input `5`, the expected output is `0`, which is correct as there are no natural numbers `n` where `n!` results in exactly five trailing zeroes. 

The implementation logic in `func_2` fails to appropriately identify ranges properly when exactly `m` trailing zeroes occur. Therefore, there are specific scenarios where it could output results that do not align with expectations, and as a consequence of potential failure in handling edge cases, the correctness of the program cannot be guaranteed. 

Hence, the program is not correct for every potential case.
