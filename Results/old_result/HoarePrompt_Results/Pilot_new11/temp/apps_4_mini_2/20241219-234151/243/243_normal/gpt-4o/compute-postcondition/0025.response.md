The variable `right` is incremented by 1. Prior to this operation, `right` was adjusted to ensure that `func_1(right)` equals `m`, and now it has been incremented by 1. The states of all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` is a value where `func_1(left)` is no longer equal to `m`; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` is 0; `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`; `result` is an empty list; `mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`; `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`; `right` is adjusted to be `right + 1` after incrementing.**
