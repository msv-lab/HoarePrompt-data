The value of `left` is decremented by 1. The initial condition states that `left` is set to the value that satisfies `func_1(left) == m`, but we do not have the specific value of `left`. Therefore, `left` is now equal to its previous value minus 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` is 0; `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`; `result` is an empty list; `mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`; `left` is one less than the previous value; `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m**
