The values of `low` and `high` are assigned based on the calculation given in the code. `low` is assigned the value `0`, and `high` is calculated as `5 * (m + 1)`, where `m` is a positive integer in the range of 1 to 100,000. Therefore, `high` will range from 10 to 500,005 depending on the value of `m`. The variable `m` remains unchanged, and the values of `low` and `high` are now explicitly defined.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` is 0; `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`**
