According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value returned by `func_1(left)`. For the loop to execute again, `func_1(left)` must remain equal to `m`. We know from the previous iteration that `func_1(left)` is currently equal to `m`, but this might change if `left` is modified or if the conditions affecting `func_1` change. 

Since `left` was defined as `(low + high) // 2 - 1`, we need to ensure that it remains such that `func_1(left)` continues to equal `m`. Additionally, since `left` is recalculated based on the values of `low` and `high`, the boundaries of `low` and `high` must also allow for `left` to be a valid index so that `func_1(left)` remains equal to `m`.

However, without any further indicators that `low` or `high` need to be adjusted, and given that the current state is valid for executing the loop, we can repeat the program state as it is.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `zeroes` is assigned the value returned from `func_1(mid)`; `result` is an empty list `[]`; `left` is equal to `(low + high) // 2 - 1`; func_1(left) must be equal to `m`**
