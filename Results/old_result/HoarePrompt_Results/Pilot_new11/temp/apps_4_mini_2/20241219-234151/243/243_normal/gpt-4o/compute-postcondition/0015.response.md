The value of `left` is decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` is 0; `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`; `result` is an empty list; `mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`; `left` is decreased by 1; `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`.
