To determine if the given Python program is correct according to the problem statement, we need to analyze its functions and understand how they handle all potential cases related to the trailing zeroes in factorials.

The main points to consider are:

1. **Understanding Trailing Zeroes**: The function `func_1(n)` correctly calculates the number of trailing zeroes in `n!` by counting the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to `n`. This is because trailing zeroes are produced by pairs of factors 2 and 5, and factors of 2 are more frequent.

2. **Finding Numbers with Exact Trailing Zeroes**: The function `func_2(m)` is supposed to determine all values of `n` such that `n!` has exactly `m` trailing zeroes. The binary search method used here is appropriate, but we need to ensure it properly manages edge cases.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `m` is very small (such as 1), the feasible values of `n` are 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, which are correctly found by the program.
   - If `m` is too large compared to the values of `n`, the number of n-values that produce `m` trailing zeroes may be incorrectly accounted for, especially noting that there might not be any n-values that produce exactly `m` trailing zeroes. The condition `zeroes > m` in the binary search should properly handle the situation if there are no valid `n` values.

4. **Potential Failing Cases**: We need to probe for cases where `func_2` might give unexpected behavior:
   - Suppose we call `func_2(5)`, which returns `0` indicating that no `n` has exactly `5` trailing zeroes. However, there are indeed numbers for which this is true: `24!`, for instance, has exactly `5` trailing zeroes. In the implementation, other combinations or ranges may not yield correctly because `func_2` initializes an empty list and it might not ever identify valid numbers if it doesn't handle the iteration properly.

After thorough analysis of edge cases and the overall flow of logic, we can confirm that there are scenarios where the expected output differs from actual output, specifically when `m` lies between exact factorial values.

Thus, the program does not fulfill the requirement of producing an accurate list of integers or an accurate count of `n` for every provided `m` particularly when `m` larger than the attainable limits of theoretical `n` for certain ranges.

Correctness: **False**
