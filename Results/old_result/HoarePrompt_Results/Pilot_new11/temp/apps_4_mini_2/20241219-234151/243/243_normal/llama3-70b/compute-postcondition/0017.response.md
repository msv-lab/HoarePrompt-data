The value of `n` is assigned the value `1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `if m is greater than 1, count is the maximum such that 1 // 5` and `n` is `1`.

Output State: **if m is greater than 1, `count` is the maximum such that `1 // 5`, `n` is 1**
