In the given code snippet, `ans` is initialized as an empty list. The values of `count` and `n` remain unaffected by this operation. The variable `count` still retains its relationship to `m` and the expression `1 // 5` (which evaluates to 0). The variable `n` retains its value of 1. Therefore, after executing the code, we update only the `ans` variable.

Output State: **if m is greater than 1, `count` is the maximum such that `1 // 5`, `n` is 1; `ans` is an empty list.**
