The variable `count` is initialized to 0. The initial state of `m` remains unchanged, as the assignment of `count` does not affect `m`. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000; `count` is 0.

Output State: **`m` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000; `count` is 0**.
