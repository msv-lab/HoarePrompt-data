The value of `left` is decremented by 1, but it must still maintain the condition that `func_1(left)` equals `m` after the decrement. The initial state indicates that `m` is a positive integer, and since `left` is specifically constrained by the condition of `func_1(left)`, we can conclude that `left` can be decremented while still satisfying this condition, as initially `func_1(left)` equals `m`. Therefore, after the decrement, `func_1(left)` will equal `m` minus 1.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `left` has decreased by 1; and `func_1(left)` equals `m - 1`.**
