Initial State: `m` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `count` is 0; `n` is 1. If `n // 5`

```
count += 1
```

Now, please think step by step: `count` is incremented by 1. The value of `n` is 1 and when performing integer division with 5, `n // 5` equals 0, which does not affect the count or any other variable. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `count` is 1; `n` is 1.**
