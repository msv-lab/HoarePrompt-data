To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the functionality of the code step by step.

### Problem Description Recap:
The problem requires finding how many positive integers \( n \) exist such that the factorial of \( n \) ends with exactly \( m \) trailing zeroes. Specifically, the output needs to include:
1. The count of such integers \( n \).
2. The integers themselves in increasing order.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   The program reads the integer \( m \), as described in the problem.

2. **Functionality**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: 
     This function calculates the number of trailing zeroes in \( n! \). This is correctly done by counting how many times the number can be divided by powers of 5 (since each pair of factors 2 and 5 contributes to a trailing zero, and there are always more factors of 2 than 5).
   
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: 
     This function aims to find integers \( n \) such that \( n! \) ends with exactly \( m \) trailing zeroes using a binary search approach:
     - It initializes `low` and `high` to find the range of numbers that generate \( m \) trailing zeroes.
     - If the number of trailing zeroes matches \( m \), it expands to find all contiguous numbers around the middle point (`mid`) that also yield \( m \) trailing zeroes.
     - It builds a list of these integers and returns it.

3. **Output**: 
   The program correctly outputs:
   - The count of integers found.
   - The integers themselves if there are any.

### Edge Cases Considered:
- The program returns `0` if there are no integers with exactly \( m \) trailing zeroes.
- It correctly determines the range of numbers that could potentially have exactly \( m \) trailing zeroes.

### Conclusion:
The program meets all requirements outlined in the problem description. It properly calculates trailing zeroes, correctly retrieves all integers that satisfy the condition of having \( m \) trailing zeroes, and formats the output as required.

Thus, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
