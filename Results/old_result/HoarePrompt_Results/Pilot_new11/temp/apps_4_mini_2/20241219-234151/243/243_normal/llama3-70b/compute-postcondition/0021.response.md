The statement `break` is executed, which terminates the most immediate loop or if statement. The values of the variables do not change, so we maintain all existing information about the state.

Output State: **If `m` is greater than 1, `count` is the maximum such that `1 // 5`, `n` is 1, `ans` is an empty list, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
