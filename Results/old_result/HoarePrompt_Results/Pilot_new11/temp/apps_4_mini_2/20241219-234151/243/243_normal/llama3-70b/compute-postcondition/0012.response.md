According to the code, the `while` loop is structured as `while True`, which means it will always be true and will execute indefinitely unless there is a break condition within the loop. Since there are no conditions to prevent another iteration, the loop can certainly execute one more time without any changes to the program state. 

State: **`m` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `count` is 2; `n` is 1**
