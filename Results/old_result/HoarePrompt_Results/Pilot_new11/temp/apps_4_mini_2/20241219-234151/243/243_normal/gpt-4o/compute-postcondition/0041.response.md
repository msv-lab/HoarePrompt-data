Initially, `left` is adjusted by subtracting 1 from its current value. The variable `m` remains a positive integer within the range specified (1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000), while the conditions for `low` and `high` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state only reflects the updated value of `left`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `left` is adjusted to be one less than its previous value (left - 1).**
