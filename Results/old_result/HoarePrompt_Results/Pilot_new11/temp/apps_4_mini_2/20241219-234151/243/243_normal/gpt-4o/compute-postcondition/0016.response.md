To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the `while` loop to execute one more time, we analyze the loop condition:

```
while func_1(left) == m:
```

For the loop to continue executing, the expression `func_1(left)` must evaluate to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, we know from the provided state that:

- `left` has been decreased by 1 (let's denote the previous value of `left` before it was decreased as `left_prev`),
- `func_1(left)` must still equal `m`.

Since `left` has been decreased by 1, we need to ensure that calling `func_1` with the new value of `left` still results in `m`. This implies that `func_1(left)` as it currently stands (after the decrement) does not guarantee it will equal `m`.

Given that `left` was decreased by 1, for the loop to execute once more, we need to ensure that `func_1(left_prev)` equals `m`. This means there might need to be a relationship where the function `func_1` when called with `left` returns a value that is still consistent with producing `m`.

Therefore, we need `left_prev` (the value of `left` before decrement) such that its corresponding `func_1` call yields `m`. Additionally, if `left_prev` is a specific number, we would need the function `func_1(left_prev)` to maintain its output.

Apart from `left`, since `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`, it may remain unchanged for the loop to execute again, however, it isn't impacting the continuation of the loop in this specific case but it's worth noting in context.

Thus, the necessary adjustment to the state is:

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` is 0; `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`; `result` is an empty list; `mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`; `left` must be at least `left_prev + 1` such that func_1(left) must still equal `m`; `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m.**
