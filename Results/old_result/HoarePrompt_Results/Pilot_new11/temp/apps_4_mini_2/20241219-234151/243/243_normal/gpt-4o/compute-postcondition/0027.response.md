The value of `right` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is a value where `func_1(left)` is no longer equal to `m`; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` is 0; `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`; `result` is an empty list; `mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`; `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`; `right` is increased by 1 to make `func_1(right)` equal to `m`.
