To determine whether the loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition specified in the `while` statement, which is `func_1(right) == m`. 

At the end of the previous iteration:
- The state indicates that `right` is equal to `(low + high) // 2 + 3`.
- The requirement is that `func_1(right)` must equal `m` for the loop to run again.

For the loop to execute again, the value of `right` needs to remain such that `func_1(right)` still equals `m`. 

Without knowing how `func_1` behaves, we can only assert that `right` should remain unchanged in terms of its relationship to `m`. Therefore, as there are no further conditions provided from the previous state about the value of `left`, `mid`, `zeroes`, and `result` that need to be adjusted, we can summarize this conclusion.

Since nothing indicates that `func_1(right)` is going to change and since it is already stated that `func_1(right)` must equal `m`, we do not need to adjust other states.

State: **`left` is equal to `(low + high) // 2 - k`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `zeroes` is assigned the value returned from `func_1(mid)`; `result` is an empty list `[]`; `right` is equal to `(low + high) // 2 + 3`; `func_1(right)` must equal m**.
