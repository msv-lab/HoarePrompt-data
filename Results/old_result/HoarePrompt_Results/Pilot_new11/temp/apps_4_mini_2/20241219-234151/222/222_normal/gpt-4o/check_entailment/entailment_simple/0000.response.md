The program does not correctly follow the problem description.

Here's why:

1. **Understanding the Action of Turning Skewers**: According to the problem, turning skewer number `i` not only affects skewer `i` itself but also the `k` skewers to the left and `k` skewers to the right. This means that the number of skewers affected by each action needs to be taken into account. The problem description specifically states which skewers get turned based on the position of `i`.

2. **Incrementing `i`**: The program increments `i` by `2 * k + 1`, meaning it skips directly to the next skewer that is `k` skewers away after turning the current skewer (and its `k` neighbors). This implies that it does not take into account overlapping influence of turning operations. For instance, if `k = 1`, turning skewer `1` affects `1`, `2`, and `3`, and then moving to skewer `4` skips `3`, which means it might be in its initial state if you only turn `1` and `4`.

3. **Boundary Conditions**: The program does not account for scenarios where the number of skewers is less than or equal to `k`. For instance, if `k = 1` and `n = 1`, only skewer `1` can be turned, but the current implementation wouldnâ€™t handle what should happen.

4. **Output does not guarantee coverage**: The output lists the skewers turned but does not confirm whether all skewers from `1` to `n` have indeed been turned over. It only ensures that the selected skewers have been turned, which can lead to the situation where some skewers remain upright.

Considering these points, the program does not fulfill the requirement to turn all skewers over optimally as described. Therefore, the conclusion is:

Correctness: **False**
