The function reads two integers, `n` (a positive integer between 1 and 1000) and `k` (a non-negative integer between 0 and 1000), from input. It calculates `l`, which represents how many times `k * 2 + 1` fits into `n` when considering `k`. Then, it creates a list `res` that contains `l` elements, where each element is computed as `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1` for `i` ranging from 0 to `l - 1`. Finally, it prints the value of `l` and the values in `res` as a space-separated string. If `l` is 0, `res` will be an empty list, leading to an empty output for the second print statement. There are no explicit return values, and potential edge cases such as `k` being 0 or `n` being at its upper limit are addressed through the calculations.
