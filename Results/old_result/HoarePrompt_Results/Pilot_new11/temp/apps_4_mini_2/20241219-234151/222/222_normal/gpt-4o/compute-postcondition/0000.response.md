The code snippet initializes `positions` as an empty list. Since this assignment does not depend on the values of `n` or `k`, they remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000), `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 1000), `positions` is an empty list.**
