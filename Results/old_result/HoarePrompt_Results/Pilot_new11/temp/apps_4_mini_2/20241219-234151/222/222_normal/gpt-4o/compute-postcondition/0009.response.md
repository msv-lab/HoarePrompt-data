The `append` method is called on the `positions` list to add the value of `i` to it. The value of `i` is calculated as `4 * k + 3`, where `k` is a non-negative integer. The value of `positions` is updated to include this new value.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. The previous state showed:

- `n` must be greater than or equal to 3
- `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 1000)
- `positions` was originally [1, 2 * k + 2]
- `i` is defined as 4 * k + 3, which will now be appended to the `positions`.

Now incorporating this, the updated output includes the new state of `positions` after the append operation.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 1000), `positions` is [1, 2 * k + 2, 4 * k + 3], `i` is 4 * k + 3**
