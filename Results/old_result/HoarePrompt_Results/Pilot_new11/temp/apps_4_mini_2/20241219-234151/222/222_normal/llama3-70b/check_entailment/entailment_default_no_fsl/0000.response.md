To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's break down the functionality step by step.

### Given Problem Description:
Miroslav wants to turn over `n` skewers with the minimal number of actions. When he turns over skewer `i`, he also turns over `k` closest skewers from each side. The goal is to find out the series of actions (skewers turned) to ensure all `n` skewers are turned over.

### Analyzing the Code:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers, `n` and `k`.
2. **Calculate Minimum Actions**: 
   - It calculates the minimum number of actions `l` required to turn over all skewers. This is computed using the formula: 
     ```python
     l = (n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)
     ```
   - Here, `k * 2 + 1` gives the number of skewers affected by a single turn (one skewer turned over plus `k` on each side).
3. **Compute Actions**: It then creates a list of skewer indices to turn:
   ```python
   res.append(i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1)
   ```
   This calculates which skewer to turn for each of the `l` actions.
4. **Output**: The program prints `l` and the skewer indices.

### Issues in the Code:
- The computed actions `1, 1 + (k * 2 + 1), 1 + 2 * (k * 2 + 1), ...` might skip some skewers, particularly when `k` is adjusted in different sizes relative to `n`. The program could miss skewers that aren't completely covered by its action range.
- Furthermore, for edge cases where `k` is 0 or the number of skewers (`n`) is small, the calculated skewers affected by turns may not include all.

### Example Analysis:
Letâ€™s consider some specific examples to see if the program works in every potential case:

1. **Example Case**: For `n = 5` and `k = 1`, the expected output is:
   - Turn skewer `1` -> Turns skewers `1`, `2`, `3`.
   - Turn skewer `4` -> Turns skewers `4`, `5`.
   
   The output should yield:
   ```
   2
   1 4
   ```
   The program, however, calculates:
   ```
   2
   1 4 (which is actually correct, but the logic could fail with larger `k`)
   ```

2. **Case with Large `k`**: For `n = 5` and `k = 2`, the expected turns should be:
   - Turn skewer `1` -> Turns skewers `1`, `2`, `3`, `4` (completely overlaps)
   - Turn skewer `5` -> Turns skewers `5`.
   
   The output should yield:
   ```
   2
   1 5
   ```
   However, if you analyze calculation:
   ```
   l = (5 + 2 - 1) // (2 * 2 + 1) = 5 // 5 = 1
   res.append(1) -> Output becomes:
   1
   1
   ```

### Conclusion:
The example reveals a critical flaw where the method of calculating the actions does not necessarily cover all skewers correctly under different values of `k`, particularly when `k` is greater than or equal to half of `n`.

Thus, we conclude that it fails in at least the example where `k >= n/2` and can miss skewers.

Given that the program does not follow the problem description correctly for every potential case, the result is:

Correctness: **False**
