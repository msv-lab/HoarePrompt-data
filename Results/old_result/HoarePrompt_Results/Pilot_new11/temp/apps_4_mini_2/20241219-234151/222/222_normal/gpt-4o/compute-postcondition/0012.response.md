The code executes a `print` statement that outputs the length of the list `positions`. Since `i` is greater than `n`, the loop that populates `positions` will not have executed, and `positions` will not contain any values (it remains empty). Therefore, the length of `positions` will be `0`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is greater than `n`, `positions` is an empty list, and the length of `positions` is 0**.
