The variable `i` is calculated as `1 + 2 * k + 1`, which simplifies to `2 * k + 2`. The current value of `positions` is `[1]`, and after appending `i`, `positions` will become `[1, 2 * k + 2]`. The other variables' states remain unchanged, so after executing the code, we have the following valid information: `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 1000), `positions` now includes `2 * k + 2`, and `i` is `2 * k + 2`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 1000), `positions` is [1, 2 * k + 2], `i` is 2 * k + 2**.
