`n` and `k` are both assigned values from the input, where `map(int, input().split())` converts two space-separated input values into integers. The values provided in the input will directly replace the previous values of `n` and `k`. Since no specific values of `n` and `k` are provided initially, they remain within their specified ranges.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `k` is an input non-negative integer (0 <= k <= 1000)**
