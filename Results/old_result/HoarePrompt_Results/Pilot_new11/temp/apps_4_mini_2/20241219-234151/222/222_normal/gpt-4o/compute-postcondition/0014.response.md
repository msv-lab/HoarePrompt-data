The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer that represents the number of skewers, constrained such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000. The parameter `k` is a non-negative integer that represents the number of skewers that are turned from each side in one action, with the constraint that 0 ≤ k ≤ 1000. The function's output is determined by the following cases:

Case_1: If `k` is 0, the function returns the value of `n`, indicating no skewers are turned.

Case_2: If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the function returns 0, indicating that all skewers have been turned.

Case_3: If `k` is less than `n`, the function returns the result of `n - k`, indicating the remaining number of skewers after some have been turned.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two parameters, a positive integer `n` representing the number of skewers and a non-negative integer `k` representing the skewers turned per action, and return the number of remaining skewers based on the actions performed. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` (number of skewers) and `k` (skewers turned per action), returns `n` if `k` is 0; returns 0 if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`; otherwise returns `n - k`.**
