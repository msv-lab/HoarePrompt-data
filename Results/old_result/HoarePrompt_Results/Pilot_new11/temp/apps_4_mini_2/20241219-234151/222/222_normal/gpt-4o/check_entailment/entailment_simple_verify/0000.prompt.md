You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Long story short, shashlik is Miroslav's favorite food. Shashlik is prepared on several skewers simultaneously. There are two states for each skewer: initial and turned over.

This time Miroslav laid out $n$ skewers parallel to each other, and enumerated them with consecutive integers from $1$ to $n$ in order from left to right. For better cooking, he puts them quite close to each other, so when he turns skewer number $i$, it leads to turning $k$ closest skewers from each side of the skewer $i$, that is, skewers number $i - k$, $i - k + 1$, ..., $i - 1$, $i + 1$, ..., $i + k - 1$, $i + k$ (if they exist). 

For example, let $n = 6$ and $k = 1$. When Miroslav turns skewer number $3$, then skewers with numbers $2$, $3$, and $4$ will come up turned over. If after that he turns skewer number $1$, then skewers number $1$, $3$, and $4$ will be turned over, while skewer number $2$ will be in the initial position (because it is turned again).

As we said before, the art of cooking requires perfect timing, so Miroslav wants to turn over all $n$ skewers with the minimal possible number of actions. For example, for the above example $n = 6$ and $k = 1$, two turnings are sufficient: he can turn over skewers number $2$ and $5$.

Help Miroslav turn over all $n$ skewers.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \leq n \leq 1000$, $0 \leq k \leq 1000$) — the number of skewers and the number of skewers from each side that are turned in one step.


-----Output-----

The first line should contain integer $l$ — the minimum number of actions needed by Miroslav to turn over all $n$ skewers. After than print $l$ integers from $1$ to $n$ denoting the number of the skewer that is to be turned over at the corresponding step.


-----Examples-----
Input
7 2

Output
2
1 6 

Input
5 1

Output
2
1 4 



-----Note-----

In the first example the first operation turns over skewers $1$, $2$ and $3$, the second operation turns over skewers $4$, $5$, $6$ and $7$.

In the second example it is also correct to turn over skewers $2$ and $5$, but turning skewers $2$ and $4$, or $1$ and $5$ are incorrect solutions because the skewer $3$ is in the initial state after these operations.
Program:
```
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
func_1(n, k)

def func_1(n, k):
    positions = []
    i = 1
    while i <= n:
        positions.append(i)
        i += 2 * k + 1
    print(len(positions))
    print(' '.join(map(str, positions)))


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the logic and check for any potential cases that could break the implementation:

The description mentions that turning skewer number `i` turns `k` skewers from each side of `i`. Therefore, turning skewer `i` results in turning skewers from `i-k` to `i+k`. The goal is to turn all `n` skewers over with the minimum number of operations.

Given the code:
```python
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
func_1(n, k)

def func_1(n, k):
    positions = []
    i = 1
    while i <= n:
        positions.append(i)
        i += 2 * k + 1
    print(len(positions))
    print(' '.join(map(str, positions)))
```
1. The starting position is set at `i = 1`, which is correct.
2. Each time a skewer is turned at position `i`, it influences `2k + 1` skewers. Thus, the next skewer to turn would be at position `i + 2k + 1`, which is also correctly implemented.
3. The list `positions` collects these positions, and then the count and the positions are printed.

However, let's consider the edge cases:
- When `k = 0`, the logic should still cover all skewers individually since turning a skewer only affects itself. For `n = 5` and `k = 0`, we should have the output: `5 1 2 3 4 5`.
- For larger `k`, it should correctly spread out and minimize the number of operations.

Now, the crucial test is if there are scenarios where all skewers are not fully turned when the numbers are picked:
- Given `n = 5` and `k = 1`, the model chooses `1` to turn skewer `1, 2, 3`, and then `4` to turn `4, 5`. This will turn all skewer states correctly. However, if `n` is odd and `k` is small, we need to check if the skewers in the middle are covered adequately by the turning.

If we think through various scenarios, it appears that the implementation does cover all possible edge cases correctly, turning the right sets of skewers each time.

The critical example to check shows that starting from position `1` (turning skewers `1` to `1 + 1 = 2`) does in fact influence the total count without leaving any skewer unturned, as larger `n` values give enough spread. Larger `k` effectively pulls more skewers from both sides, ensuring all edges are covered since movements skip `2k + 1` spaces.

Thus, after analyzing potential edge cases, it seems that the logic handles all proposed states and edge scenarios effectively.

Correctness: **True**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
func_1(n, k)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) representing the number of skewers, and k is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 1000) representing the number of skewers that are turned from each side in one action.
def func_1(n, k):
    positions = []
    i = 1
    while i <= n:
        positions.append(i)
        
        i += 2 * k + 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `i` is greater than `n`, `positions` contains values [1, 1 + (2 * k + 1), 1 + 2*(2 * k + 1), ..., up to the largest value ≤ n] based on iterating until the condition `i <= n` is false
    print(len(positions))
    print(' '.join(map(str, positions)))


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
