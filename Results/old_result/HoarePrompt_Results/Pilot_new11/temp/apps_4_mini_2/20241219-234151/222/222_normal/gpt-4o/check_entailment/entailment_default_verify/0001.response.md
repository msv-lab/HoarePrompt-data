Based on the analysis of the problem description, the provided code, and the original assessment, the following points are clear:

1. The program aims to turn over skewers effectively, based on the input parameters `n` (the number of skewers) and `k` (the number of adjacent skewers affected by each turn).

2. The logic in the function `func_1` increments the index `i` by `2*k + 1`, thereby collecting skewer indices intended for action. However, this approach fails to ensure full coverage of all skewers in scenarios where `k` is insufficient relative to `n`.

3. The original assessment rightly identifies that the function might not cover all skewers for certain configurations, which could lead to some skewers remaining in their initial position after accounting for turns.

4. The output hints confirm this logic by pointing out that the mentioned formula for incrementing `i` does not guarantee that all skewers are turned, especially in edge cases where overlapping actions may lead to missed skewers.

5. Given this logic and the assertion from the output hints about discrepancies in the return conditions, it is evident that the initial assessment that the program is **False** due to its inability to guarantee that all skewers are turned over is accurate.

Consequently, I maintain the original assessment due to the valid reasoning provided.

Final: **False**
