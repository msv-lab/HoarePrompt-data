To evaluate the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the logic and check for any potential cases that could break the implementation:

The description mentions that turning skewer number `i` turns `k` skewers from each side of `i`. Therefore, turning skewer `i` results in turning skewers from `i-k` to `i+k`. The goal is to turn all `n` skewers over with the minimum number of operations.

Given the code:
```python
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
func_1(n, k)

def func_1(n, k):
    positions = []
    i = 1
    while i <= n:
        positions.append(i)
        i += 2 * k + 1
    print(len(positions))
    print(' '.join(map(str, positions)))
```
1. The starting position is set at `i = 1`, which is correct.
2. Each time a skewer is turned at position `i`, it influences `2k + 1` skewers. Thus, the next skewer to turn would be at position `i + 2k + 1`, which is also correctly implemented.
3. The list `positions` collects these positions, and then the count and the positions are printed.

However, let's consider the edge cases:
- When `k = 0`, the logic should still cover all skewers individually since turning a skewer only affects itself. For `n = 5` and `k = 0`, we should have the output: `5 1 2 3 4 5`.
- For larger `k`, it should correctly spread out and minimize the number of operations.

Now, the crucial test is if there are scenarios where all skewers are not fully turned when the numbers are picked:
- Given `n = 5` and `k = 1`, the model chooses `1` to turn skewer `1, 2, 3`, and then `4` to turn `4, 5`. This will turn all skewer states correctly. However, if `n` is odd and `k` is small, we need to check if the skewers in the middle are covered adequately by the turning.

If we think through various scenarios, it appears that the implementation does cover all possible edge cases correctly, turning the right sets of skewers each time.

The critical example to check shows that starting from position `1` (turning skewers `1` to `1 + 1 = 2`) does in fact influence the total count without leaving any skewer unturned, as larger `n` values give enough spread. Larger `k` effectively pulls more skewers from both sides, ensuring all edges are covered since movements skip `2k + 1` spaces.

Thus, after analyzing potential edge cases, it seems that the logic handles all proposed states and edge scenarios effectively.

Correctness: **True**.
