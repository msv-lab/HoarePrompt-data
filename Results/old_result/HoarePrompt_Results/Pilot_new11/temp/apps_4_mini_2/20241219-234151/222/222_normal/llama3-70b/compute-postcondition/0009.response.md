Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `k` is an input non-negative integer (0 <= k <= 1000), `l` is calculated as (n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1), `res` is a list containing the values from the formula `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1` for `i` from 0 to `l - 1`. If `l` is 0, then `res` remains an empty list.**
