You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Summer holidays! Someone is going on trips, someone is visiting grandparents, but someone is trying to get a part-time job. This summer Noora decided that she wants to earn some money, and took a job in a shop as an assistant.

Shop, where Noora is working, has a plan on the following n days. For each day sales manager knows exactly, that in i-th day k_{i} products will be put up for sale and exactly l_{i} clients will come to the shop that day. Also, the manager is sure, that everyone, who comes to the shop, buys exactly one product or, if there aren't any left, leaves the shop without buying anything. Moreover, due to the short shelf-life of the products, manager established the following rule: if some part of the products left on the shelves at the end of the day, that products aren't kept on the next day and are sent to the dump.

For advertising purposes manager offered to start a sell-out in the shop. He asked Noora to choose any f days from n next for sell-outs. On each of f chosen days the number of products were put up for sale would be doubled. Thus, if on i-th day shop planned to put up for sale k_{i} products and Noora has chosen this day for sell-out, shelves of the shop would keep 2·k_{i} products. Consequently, there is an opportunity to sell two times more products on days of sell-out.

Noora's task is to choose f days to maximize total number of sold products. She asks you to help her with such a difficult problem.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and f (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ f ≤ n) denoting the number of days in shop's plan and the number of days that Noora has to choose for sell-out.

Each line of the following n subsequent lines contains two integers k_{i}, l_{i} (0 ≤ k_{i}, l_{i} ≤ 10^9) denoting the number of products on the shelves of the shop on the i-th day and the number of clients that will come to the shop on i-th day.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer denoting the maximal number of products that shop can sell.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 2
2 1
3 5
2 3
1 5

Output
10
Input
4 1
0 2
0 3
3 5
0 6

Output
5


-----Note-----

In the first example we can choose days with numbers 2 and 4 for sell-out. In this case new numbers of products for sale would be equal to [2, 6, 2, 2] respectively. So on the first day shop will sell 1 product, on the second — 5, on the third — 2, on the fourth — 2. In total 1 + 5 + 2 + 2 = 10 product units.

In the second example it is possible to sell 5 products, if you choose third day for sell-out.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, f) = map(int, input().split())
    days = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (k, l) = map(int, input().split())
        days.append((k, l))
    days.sort(key=lambda x: x[1] - x[0], reverse=True)
    sold = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if i < f:
            sold += min(days[i][0] * 2, days[i][1])
        else:
            sold += min(days[i][0], days[i][1])
    print(sold)


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic and ensure it captures all aspects of the problem statement.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input Structure**: 
   - The first line contains `n` (number of days) and `f` (number of days to choose for sell-out).
   - Each of the next `n` lines contains `k_i` (number of products) and `l_i` (number of clients) for each day.

2. **Sales Logic**:
   - On a sell-out day, the products available double (`2 * k_i`).
   - Customers buy products until they run out.

3. **Objective**: 
   - Maximize the total sold products over `n` days by optimally choosing `f` days for sell-out.

### Analyzing the Program:
- The program reads inputs and stores the days' data in a list.
- It calculates the potential increase in sales by choosing days based on the difference between clients (`l_i`) and products (`k_i`) and sorts these days.
- Then, it computes total sales by considering the `f` days with extra products and the remaining days.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **All Zero Products**: If all `k_i` are `0`, regardless of the number of clients `l_i`, the outcome should be `0` since no products can be sold.
2. **All Zero Clients**: If all `l_i` are `0`, again the outcome should be `0`.
3. **More Sell-Out Days Than Products**: If `f` is greater than `n`, the program should still adhere to `n`, but if it behaves incorrectly (e.g. does not restrict sell-out days correctly) could be an issue.

### Identified Error in Logic:
- The sorting condition `days.sort(key=lambda x: x[1] - x[0], reverse=True)` attempts to maximize sales based on the difference between clients and available products. However, if there are multiple configurations where `l_i` greatly exceeds `k_i`, but not selecting the days where clients are fewer could lead to suboptimal outcomes.

**Example Case**:
- Consider a case where we have:
```
4 2
2 1
3 5
2 3
1 6
```
If we apply the described logic:
- Sorts by `l_i - k_i`: Results could mislead the selected days.
- This configuration could lead to selecting a suboptimal combination.

### Conclusion:
Since the current logic could potentially yield less than optimal configurations, such situations illustrate that the program can produce incorrect results for specific inputs despite appearing to handle many cases adequately.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, f is an integer such that 0 ≤ f ≤ n, and each of the k_i and l_i values (for i from 1 to n) are integers such that 0 ≤ k_i, l_i ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    n, f = map(int, input().split())
    days = []
    for _ in range(n):
        k, l = map(int, input().split())
        
        days.append((k, l))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `days` is a list containing `n` tuples of input integers (k, l) where `k` and `l` are input integers; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000.
    days.sort(key=lambda x: x[1] - x[0], reverse=True)
    sold = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if i < f:
            sold += min(days[i][0] * 2, days[i][1])
        else:
            sold += min(days[i][0], days[i][1])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `days` is a list of `n` tuples sorted by the difference `l - k`, `sold` is equal to the total calculated based on the given conditions for all `n` elements in the list. If `f` is less than `n`, the first `f` tuples will contribute double their first element to `sold` if `days[i][0] * 2` is less than `days[i][1]`, otherwise the second element will contribute; for the remaining tuples, `sold` will contribute their first element unless `days[i][1]` is less. If `n` is 0, `sold` will remain 0.
    print(sold)


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
