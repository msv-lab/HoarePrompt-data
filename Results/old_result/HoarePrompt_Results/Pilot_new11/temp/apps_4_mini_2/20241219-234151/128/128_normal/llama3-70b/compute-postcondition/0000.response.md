The code assigns values to `n` and `f` from the input, where input consists of two integers, thus updating these variables. The ranges provided ensure that `n` is between 1 and 100,000 inclusive, and `f` is between 0 and `n` inclusive. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, `f` is an integer such that 0 ≤ f ≤ n, and each of the k_i and l_i values (for i from 1 to n) are integers such that 0 ≤ k_i, l_i ≤ 10^9; `n` and `f` are assigned new integer values from input.**
