According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` must be greater than 0 to allow the loop to run again. 

After the iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be greater than 1, as `i` will then be 1 in the next iteration.

State: **`days` is a list of `n` tuples sorted by the difference `l - k`, `sold` is equal to `min(days[1][0], days[1][1])`, and `n` must be greater than 1**
