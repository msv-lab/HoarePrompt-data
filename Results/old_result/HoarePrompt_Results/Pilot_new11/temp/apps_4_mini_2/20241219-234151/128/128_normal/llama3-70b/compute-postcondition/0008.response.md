According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than `_`, the loop can execute again for the next iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1 and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000. For the loop to be executed one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, so `_` will be 2. Additionally, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, `_` is 2, `k` and `l` are input integers, `days` is updated to include the tuple `(k, l)` and must allow for at least 2 iterations.**
