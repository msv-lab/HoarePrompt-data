The variable `potential_sales_increase` has the original computed value plus the new value `min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l)` appended to it. Additionally, the value of `regular_sales` now includes the appended value `min(k, l)`. The values of `n`, `f`, `days`, `k`, and `l` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer, `days` is a list of tuples containing at least three tuples, `k` is the first element of the third tuple in `days`, `l` is the second element of the third tuple in `days`, `potential_sales_increase` has been updated by appending `min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l)`, `regular_sales` has been updated by appending `min(k, l)`.**
