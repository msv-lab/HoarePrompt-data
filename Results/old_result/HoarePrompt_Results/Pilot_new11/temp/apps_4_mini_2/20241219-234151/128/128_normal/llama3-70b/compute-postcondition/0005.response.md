According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will iterate `n` times in total. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, indicating that this is the first iteration, and since `n` falls within the range 1 to 100000, the loop can still execute. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1.

At the start of the next iteration, `_` will be 1. The loop will execute until `_` is less than `n`. So for the loop to run again, `n` must be greater than 1 since `_` is currently 0.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, `_` is 1, `k` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `days` is updated to include the tuple `(k, l)`**
