According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if the starting point `i + 1` is less than or equal to `n`. Given that `i` is 1, the range for `j` will be from 2 to `n + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2.

At the end of the last iteration (if the loop were to run), `j` would take on the value of `n + 1`, which indicates that `j` starts at 2 in the first iteration.

So for the loop to be executed, the adjustments are:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, 
- `j` is 2 at the start of the loop.

State: **`s` is the user-input string of lowercase English letters, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `max_len` is the maximum length of non-palindromic substrings found in `s`, `j` is 2**
