According to the code, the for loop will continue to execute as long as the value of `j` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and since the loop is structured to start from `i + 1`, the next value of `j` will be 2 (i.e., `j` is incremented by 1).

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to 2, and the loop will continue as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`. Thus, `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`s` is the user-input string of lowercase English letters, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and `substr` is the first character of `s`**.
