According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n` and the calculated range for `j`. The loop starts at `i + 1` and goes up to `n + 1`. Given that `i` is 0 initially, the loop will start at `1` and will execute until `n`. 

For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than or equal to `1` because the range would be from `1` to `n + 1`. In this case, `max_len` is 0, and it doesn't directly affect the execution of the loop, but the loop's execution will have to take into account the string `s` which must have a length that could accommodate the values of `j`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` being greater than 0 is essential, `i` must remain 0, and `j` will start at `1` on the first loop iteration.

State: **`s` is the user-input string of lowercase English letters, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
