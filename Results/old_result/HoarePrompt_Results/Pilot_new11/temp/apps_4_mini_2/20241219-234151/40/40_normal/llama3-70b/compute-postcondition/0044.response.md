`substr` is assigned the value of `s` from index `i` to `j`, which is from index 2 to 5. Since `i` is 2 and `j` is 5, `substr` becomes the substring of `s` that starts at index 2 and ends before index 5. The initial state indicates that `s` is a user-input string of lowercase English letters, `n` must be greater than or equal to 5, `i` is 2, and `j` is 5. Therefore, the values of `n`, `i`, and `j` remain the same, while `substr` is updated based on the value of `s`.

Output State: **`s` is the user-input string of lowercase English letters, `n` must be greater than or equal to 5, `i` is 2, `j` is 5, and `substr` is the substring of `s` from index 2 to 5.**
