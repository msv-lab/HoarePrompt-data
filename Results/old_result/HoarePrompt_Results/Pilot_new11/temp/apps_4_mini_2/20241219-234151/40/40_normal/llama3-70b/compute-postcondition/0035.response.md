The value of `substr` is assigned the substring of `s` starting from index `i` (which is 2) up to but not including index `j` (which is 3). Therefore, `substr` will contain the single character at index 2 of the string `s`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is the user-input string of lowercase English letters, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `substr` is the substring of `s` from index 2 to 3 (i.e., `s[2]`).**
