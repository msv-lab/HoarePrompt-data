`substr` is assigned the value of `s[i:j]`, which means it takes characters from the string `s` starting from index `i` (1) up to but not including index `j` (3). Consequently, the previous value of `substr` was `s[1:3]`, and it now becomes `s[1:3]` again, but explicitly as `s[1:3]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is the user-input string of lowercase English letters, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `substr` is `s[1:3]`**
