#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters with a length at most 50 characters.
def func_1(s):
    return s == s[::-1]
    #The program returns True if the string 's' is a palindrome (the same forwards and backwards), otherwise it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters and returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome (meaning it reads the same forwards and backwards); otherwise, it returns `False`. The function effectively handles all valid input cases within the specified constraints, returning a boolean value based on the comparison of the string to its reverse. There are no further checks for edge cases like different character sets or empty strings, as those are explicitly excluded by the preconditions.
