The code assigns the value of `substr` to the substring of `s` taken from index `i` to index `j`. Given that `i` is `0` and `j` is `3`, `substr` is set to the first three characters of the string `s`. The value of `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged in this operation. 

Output State: **`s` is the user-input string of lowercase English letters; `n` is greater than 1; `i` is 0; `j` is 3; `substr` is the first three characters of `s`.**
