According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop runs with `j` starting from `i + 1` (which is 2) up to `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than or equal to 3, which means `n` is at least 3. The value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration is 3. 

For another iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, thus `j` becomes 4 in the next iteration. Since `n` is at least 3, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4. 

Thus, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
State: **`s` is a user-input string of lowercase English letters, `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, and `substr` is `s[1:4]`.**
