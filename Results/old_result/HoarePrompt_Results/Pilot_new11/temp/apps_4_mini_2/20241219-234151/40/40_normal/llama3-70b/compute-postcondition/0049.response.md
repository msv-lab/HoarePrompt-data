The code evaluates the value of `max_len`. If `max_len` is greater than 0, it returns `max_len`, otherwise, it returns 0. The variable `max_len` is expected to hold a length value of some non-palindromic substrings found in `s`. Thus, if all substrings are palindromic, `max_len` will retain its initial value of 0.

The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`s` is the user-input string of lowercase English letters, `n` is the length of `s`, `max_len` is the maximum length of all non-palindromic substrings found in `s`. The output is either `max_len` if it's greater than 0, or 0 if all substrings are palindromic.**
