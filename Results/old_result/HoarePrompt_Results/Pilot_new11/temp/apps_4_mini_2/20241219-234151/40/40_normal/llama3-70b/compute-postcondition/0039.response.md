According to the code provided, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3 and `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will need to be incremented by 1, making it 4. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` must now be 4, and `n` must still be at least 4 to allow the loop to continue executing.

State: **`s` is the user-input string of lowercase English letters, `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, and `substr` is the substring of `s` from index 2 to 4.**
