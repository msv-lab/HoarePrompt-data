The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `s` containing two binary strings, each consisting of '0' and '1' characters. It calculates a weighted sum based on the positions of '1's in the concatenated binary strings. The weight increases as the index of '1' decreases (using the golden ratio as the base of the exponentiation). The function returns a `float` value computed from the positions of '1's in the input strings. Specifically, if both strings are '0', the returned value is `0`; if one is '1' and the other is '0', the returned value will either be close to `1.618033988` or `1`, and if both strings are '1', the return value will be approximately `2.618033988`. The implementation does not include any validation for the input tuple or its contents and assumes that the strings are properly formatted as per the initial condition.
