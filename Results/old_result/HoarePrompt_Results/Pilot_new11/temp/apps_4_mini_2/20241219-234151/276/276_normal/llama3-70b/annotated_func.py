#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a list of two non-empty strings, each consisting of '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string does not exceed 100,000.
def func_1(s):
    q = (math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2
    decimal = 0
    for (i, c) in enumerate(reversed(s)):
        decimal += int(c) * q ** i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a list of two non-empty strings, `decimal` is the decimal representation of the binary values of the strings in `s`, `i` is equal to the length of `s` and `c` represents the characters from the two strings in `s`.
    return decimal
    #The program returns the decimal representation of the binary values of the two non-empty strings in the list 's'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a parameter `s`, which is expected to be a list containing two non-empty strings of '0' and '1' characters. It computes and returns the decimal representation of the concatenated binary values of these strings, interpreted as a single binary number using the golden ratio as the base for conversion. However, it does not effectively concatenate the two strings before conversion; instead, it operates on them individually without addressing their combined binary value properly. The final state of the program will hold a decimal value based on the interpretation of the reversed binary digits from the individual strings, but it will not account for cases where both strings should be considered as a single binary input. Importantly, if `s` does not contain exactly two items, the behavior may be undefined, as the code assumes this invariant is always met.
