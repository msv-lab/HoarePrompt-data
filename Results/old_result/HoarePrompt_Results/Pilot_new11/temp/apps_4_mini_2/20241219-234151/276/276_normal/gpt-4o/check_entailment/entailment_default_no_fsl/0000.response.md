Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly account for the irregularities of the golden system when comparing two binary strings representing numbers in this system. The `func_1` function calculates the value for each binary string based solely on the positions of '1's, which means it does not handle leading zeros correctly. In the golden system, leading zeros do not affect numeric value but can influence comparisons if ignored.

For instance, the strings "001" and "1" would yield the same numeric representation, as both equal \( q^2 \) (approximately 2.618033988), but only the first string would be considered numerically larger because it has leading zeros.

Additionally, the output hints suggest that the function processes a tuple of strings rather than two separate inputs, which misaligns with the problem requirements. This suggests that the comparison logic might not be executing correctly since it does not consider the actual design of the golden numbering system and assumes if strings have fewer '1's, they are numerically smaller, which isn't appropriate in golden representation.

For example:
- Input:
    ```
    00100
    11
    ```
  Both numbers are equal as established (value â‰ˆ 2.618033988), yet the logic assigns unequal outputs due to leading zero handling, resulting in an incorrect comparison.

Therefore, since the program does not work correctly for all potential cases, it is deemed incorrect.
