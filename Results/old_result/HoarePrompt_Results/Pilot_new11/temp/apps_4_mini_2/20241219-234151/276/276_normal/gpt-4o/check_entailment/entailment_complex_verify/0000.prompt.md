You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Piegirl got bored with binary, decimal and other integer based counting systems. Recently she discovered some interesting properties about number $q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2}$, in particular that q^2 = q + 1, and she thinks it would make a good base for her new unique system. She called it "golden system". In golden system the number is a non-empty string containing 0's and 1's as digits. The decimal value of expression a_0a_1...a_{n} equals to $\sum_{i = 0}^{n} a_{i} \cdot q^{n - i}$.

Soon Piegirl found out that this system doesn't have same properties that integer base systems do and some operations can not be performed on it. She wasn't able to come up with a fast way of comparing two numbers. She is asking for your help.

Given two numbers written in golden system notation, determine which of them has larger decimal value.


-----Input-----

Input consists of two lines — one for each number. Each line contains non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters. The length of each string does not exceed 100000.


-----Output-----

Print ">" if the first number is larger, "<" if it is smaller and "=" if they are equal.


-----Examples-----
Input
1000
111

Output
<

Input
00100
11

Output
=

Input
110
101

Output
>



-----Note-----

In the first example first number equals to $((\sqrt{5} + 1) / 2)^{3} \approx 1.618033988^{3} \approx 4.236$, while second number is approximately 1.618033988^2 + 1.618033988 + 1 ≈ 5.236, which is clearly a bigger number.

In the second example numbers are equal. Each of them is  ≈ 2.618.
Program:
```
s1 = input().strip()
s2 = input().strip()
value1 = func_1(s1)
value2 = func_1(s2)
if value1 > value2:
    print('>')
elif value1 < value2:
    print('<')
else:
    print('=')

def func_1(s):
    q = (5 ** 0.5 + 1) / 2
    value = 0
    n = len(s)
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '1':
            value += q ** (n - i - 1)
    return value


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze it in the context of the problem description.

**Problem description:** The task is to compare two numbers represented in a "golden system" which uses the base \( q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \). We need to output which of the two representations is larger in decimal value.

**Program analysis:**
1. The program reads two strings, `s1` and `s2`, which represent numbers in the golden system.
2. It computes the decimal values of both strings using the function `func_1`. This function:
   - Initializes `value` to 0.
   - Iterates through each character of the string.
   - If the character at position `i` is '1', it adds \( q^{(n - i - 1)} \) to `value`.
3. Finally, it compares the two computed values and prints '>', '<', or '=' based on their comparison.

**Critical Observations:**
- The calculation of values does not consider different lengths of binary strings. For instance, '00100' (which evaluates to a decimal value of 2.618033988...) and '11' (which also evaluates to about 2.618033988...) are treated as equal, which the program handles correctly.
- The current implementation computes values correctly for cases where digits represent the same length, but it does not ensure that shorter strings, which would have zero coefficients for missing higher powers of \( q \), are accurately reflected in the comparison. 

**Key Issue:**
- The function `func_1` does not take into account the fact that zeros at the beginning should not affect the result but rather should convey the absence of a certain power of \( q \) in contributing to the total value. 

For example:
- The strings `001` and `01` should be equal because in both cases they represent the same value \( q^1 + q^0 \).

**Conclusion Based on Observations:**
The program may not properly handle cases where numbers are represented with leading zeros or when their lengths are different, but they should equal because they effectively represent the same value in the golden number notation.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it doesn't accurately compute the values for all input cases.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
s1 = input().strip()
s2 = input().strip()
value1 = func_1(s1)
value2 = func_1(s2)
if value1 > value2:
    print('>')
elif value1 < value2:
    print('<')
else:
    print('=')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a tuple containing two non-empty strings, each consisting solely of '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string does not exceed 100,000 characters.
def func_1(s):
    q = (5 ** 0.5 + 1) / 2
    value = 0
    n = len(s)
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '1':
            value += q ** (n - i - 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a tuple containing two non-empty strings of '0' and '1'; `q` is approximately 1.618033988; `value` is determined by the values of `s[0]` and `s[1]` (if both are '1', then `value` is approximately `2.618033988`, if `s[0]` is '1' and `s[1]` is '0', then `value` is approximately `1.618033988`, if `s[0]` is '0' and `s[1]` is '1', then `value` is `1`, and if both are '0', then `value` stays `0`); `n` is 2.
    return value
    #The program returns the value determined by the values of s[0] and s[1], which are '0' and '1' respectively, resulting in value being 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `s` containing two binary strings, each consisting of '0' and '1' characters. It calculates a weighted sum based on the positions of '1's in the concatenated binary strings. The weight increases as the index of '1' decreases (using the golden ratio as the base of the exponentiation). The function returns a `float` value computed from the positions of '1's in the input strings. Specifically, if both strings are '0', the returned value is `0`; if one is '1' and the other is '0', the returned value will either be close to `1.618033988` or `1`, and if both strings are '1', the return value will be approximately `2.618033988`. The implementation does not include any validation for the input tuple or its contents and assumes that the strings are properly formatted as per the initial condition.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description.
