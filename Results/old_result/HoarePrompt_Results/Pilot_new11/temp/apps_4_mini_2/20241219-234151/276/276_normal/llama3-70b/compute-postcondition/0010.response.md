The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is a list that contains two non-empty strings, each consisting only of '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string does not exceed 100,000. After executing the function body, it returns the decimal representation of the binary values of the two strings in the list `s`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of two binary strings and return their decimal equivalent. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter s, which is a list of two non-empty strings of '0' and '1' characters, and returns the decimal representation of these binary values.**
