To determine the correctness of the given Python program according to the problem description, let's analyze the provided code and the requirements.

### Analysis of the Code:

1. **Input Handling**: The program takes two strings of '0's and '1's as input, representing numbers in the golden system.
2. **Function `func_1`**: This function calculates the decimal value of the golden system number by using the formula \( \sum_{i=0}^{n} a_{i} \cdot q^{n - i} \) where \( q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \).
3. **Comparison of Values**: After computing the decimal values of the two input numbers, the program compares them and prints '>', '<', or '=' based on the comparison.

### Issues to Consider:
- I need to check whether the floating-point arithmetic might lead to issues, especially given that `q^n` can grow very large and `n` can be up to 100,000. This can lead to imprecision errors in floating-point calculations.

### Potential Test Case:
Let's consider a corner case:
- Assume inputs that would produce very close values or values that are supposed to be equal but differ slightly due to floating-point precision issues.
  
Example test case:
- Input: `1` (which represents \( q^0 = 1 \))
- Input: `01` (which represents \( q^1 = q \approx 1.618 \))

Expected output: `<`, because \( 1 < q \).

However, if due to floating-point inaccuracies, one of the numbers evaluates to a value that seems larger because of precision errors, this can produce an incorrect result.

### Conclusion:
Given the potential for floating-point inaccuracies when computing and comparing values derived from a formula involving \( q^n \), the program could produce incorrect results for inputs that produce close values.

Thus, the program does not guarantee correctness for all cases. 

Correctness: **False**.
