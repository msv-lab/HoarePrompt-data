The program is attempting to compare two binary numbers represented in a non-standard "golden system" based on the golden ratio, \( q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \). The function `func_1` is designed to convert these binary strings into their corresponding decimal values based on this unique representation.

### Checking the Program Logic:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads two non-empty strings representing binary digits, which is aligned with the problem description.
2. **Conversion Logic**: The function `func_1` calculates the decimal value based on the golden ratio raised to the power of the position of '1's within the strings. It does this correctly by summing \( q^{(n-i-1)} \) for each '1' in the string, ensuring the significant contributions from leftmost bits.
3. **Comparison**: The output logic compares the computed decimal values and prints the appropriate relational operator.

### Output Hints Analysis:
The output hints suggest that the function calculates a weighted sum based on the location of '1's. However, it also implies limitations and weaknesses in the implementation, particularly about its lack of validation or handling of certain cases.

### Potential Issues:
The computation of the decimal value is based on floating-point arithmetic, which can introduce precision errors. This can particularly affect comparisons of closely valued results due to the nature of floating-point representation in computers.

- **Example Precision Issue**: 
  - When the two strings represent close values, such as `100000` and `111`, due to floating-point precision errors, the function might incorrectly evaluate their relative sizes when converted to their decimal representations.

### Conclusion:
Given that the implementation relies on floating-point arithmetic and does not cater to edge cases where precision may affect the comparison, the program is not guaranteed to work correctly for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
