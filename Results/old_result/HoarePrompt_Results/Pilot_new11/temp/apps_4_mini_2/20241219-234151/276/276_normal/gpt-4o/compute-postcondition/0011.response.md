The variable `value` is incremented by `q ** (n - i - 1)`. Here, `q` is approximately 1.618033988, `n` must be greater than 2, and `i` is 2. 

Since `n` must be greater than 2, let's denote `n` as `n`. The calculation for the expression `n - i - 1` simplifies to `n - 2 - 1`, which equals `n - 3`. 

Then we plug in the value of `q`:
`value += 1.618033988 ** (n - 3)`.

This means that `value` is updated by adding `1.618033988` raised to the power of `(n - 3)`. The initial states of `s`, `q`, and `i` remain valid, so:

Output State: **`s` is a tuple containing two non-empty strings of '0' and '1'; `q` is approximately 1.618033988; `n` must be greater than 2; `i` is 2; `value` is updated by adding `1.618033988 ** (n - 3)` to its previous value.**
