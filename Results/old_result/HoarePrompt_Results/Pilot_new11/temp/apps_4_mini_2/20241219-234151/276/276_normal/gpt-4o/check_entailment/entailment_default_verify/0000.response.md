Based on the analysis of the problem description, the provided program, the original assessment, and the output hints, the original assessment correctly identifies issues with the program's correctness. 

The problem description clearly states that the goal is to compare two numbers written in "golden system" notation. The main function to compute these values, `func_1`, attempts to do this but fails to correctly handle strings that represent numbers with leading zeros or different lengths effectively representing the same decimal value.

While analyzing the output hints, they describe potential outputs based on two strings. However, they inaccurately suggest the function accepts a tuple of strings when the code actually expects two separate input strings. The hints also do not address the critical flaw regarding leading zeros and how they impact the calculated values.

Thus, the statements in the original assessment remain valid:
1. The program does not handle inputs with varying lengths correctly, leading to inaccurate comparisons.
2. Cases such as '00100' and '11' yielding equal results are not handled correctly because leading zeros should not impact the value represented.

Given these points, the established conclusion from the initial assessment — that the program is incorrect — continues to hold true.

Final: **False**
