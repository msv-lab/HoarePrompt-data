The value of `c` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The states of `a` and `b` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a positive integer (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000), `b` is an input integer, and `c` is an input integer.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000), `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer**
