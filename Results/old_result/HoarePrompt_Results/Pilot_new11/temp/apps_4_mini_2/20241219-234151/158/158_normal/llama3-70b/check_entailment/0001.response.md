Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all potential edge cases as per the problem description. 

For example, consider the case:
```
Input
1
2
3
```
In this case:
- `a` (lemons) = 1
- `b` (apples) = 2
- `c` (pears) = 3

According to the ratio, the maximum possible compote that can be made would require:
- 1 lemon
- 2 apples (as required)
- 4 pears (which we do not have, since we only have 3)

Thus, no compote can be made, and the output should be `0`. However, the program calculates `min_lemon` as `min(1, 2 // 2, 3 // 4)`, which is `min(1, 1, 0)`, resulting in `0`. It then calculates the result as `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4` which leads to `0 + 0 + 0`, hence the output is indeed `0`.

However, consider this case:
```
Input
0
2
4
```
The program still assumes `min_lemon = 0` if `a=0` but we don't enter edge cases around potential literal misinterpretations of fruit count.

Also, an important distinction not handling invalid test cases like `0` for any of the fruit counts is relevant here.

Thus, while the program may return the correct answer in some cases, it does not meet the robustness that the problem requires. The fruit counts must always be positive as per the problem statement, meaning `0` isn't a valid input scenario, which isn't handled here.

Conclusively, the program lacks the complexity of input validation just around the fruit counts based on the full problem constraints. This leads to the understanding that it is, consequently, not solving the problem as robustly as intended. Thus, the answer is False.
