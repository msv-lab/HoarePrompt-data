The provided program aims to calculate the maximum total number of fruits (lemons, apples, and pears) that Nikolay can use to cook a compote, adhering to the specified ratio of 1:2:4. 

Upon examining the code, it reads three integers, which represent the counts of lemons, apples, and pears. The program correctly determines the maximum number of complete sets of fruits that can be used based on the ratio using the formula `max_lemons = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`. Then, it computes the total number of fruits by summing the scaled contributions from lemons, apples, and pears (`max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4`).

The logic in the code appears accurate for the following reasons:
1. It ensures that the number of apples and pears are sufficient in relation to the lemons by dividing their counts appropriately (`b // 2` and `c // 4`).
2. It correctly totals the fruits contributed based on the number of lemons determined.

However, let's analyze potential cases:
- Test case where the input is such that there are lemons and apples but not enough pears, e.g., `2`, `5`, `1` (not sufficing for any complete set of compote). The output is `0`, which is correct.
- For input `4`, `7`, `13`, the output should be `21`, which is also correctly calculated as `3 * (1 + 2 + 4) = 21`.

Upon further consideration, there is indeed a flaw in the program's logic. Although `max_lemons` is calculated properly, the program does not adequately handle cases where the fruit ratios cannot be met as whole integers from the start. The provided output hints are also misleading, as they do not clarify the need for complete sets of fruit based on given inventories.

Thus, while the program handles many scenarios aptly, it ultimately does not guarantee correctness under every potential case as required by the problem description, specifically when there are insufficient pears.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not correctly identify cases where the constraints of 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears cannot be met, particularly when there are lemons and apples available but insufficient pears to form even a single compote unit. For instance, an input like `1`, `2`, `1` would produce `0`, which is indeed correct; however, other combinations leading to insufficient fruit sets may not yield correct behavior under certain conditions.
