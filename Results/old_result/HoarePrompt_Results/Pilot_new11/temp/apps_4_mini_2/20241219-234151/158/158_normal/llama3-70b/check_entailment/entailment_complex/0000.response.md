Correctness: **False**

The program fails to meet the problem description requirements in a significant way. The task requires calculating the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears that can be used in the compote according to the specified ratio of 1:2:4. However, the implementation does not take into account the case where no valid compote can be made, and it directly computes the final result based on the minimum of `min_lemon` regardless of the availability of sufficient fruits to reach the necessary counts. 

Here’s a breakdown of issues with the implementation:
1. **Output Calculation**: The formula used to compute the output, `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`, simplifies to `min_lemon * 7`. This does not handle the case where `min_lemon` is 0 adequately. In such a scenario, the correct output should simply be 0, but the existing calculations may lead to misleading outputs if the number of fruits is insufficient.

2. **Handling Scenario of Insufficient Fruits**: The calculation of `min_lemon` relies on the existence of sufficient fruits to make at least one valid set of the compote (1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears). If there aren’t enough fruits in any category (for example, if `c` is too low), the function does not return 0 correctly. The program just checks for the minimum possible proportions and calculates the total without validating if at least 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears are available.

3. **Print Output Only**: The function only prints the result without considering edge cases like having enough fruits to make at least one serving, and there are no assertions or exceptions for cases where the fruits' availability is an issue.

Thus, the program does not properly satisfy the requirements as stated in the problem description; specifically, it doesn't correctly handle cases where the input would yield an impractical output given the constraints on fruit quantities. Consequently, it is deemed incorrect.
