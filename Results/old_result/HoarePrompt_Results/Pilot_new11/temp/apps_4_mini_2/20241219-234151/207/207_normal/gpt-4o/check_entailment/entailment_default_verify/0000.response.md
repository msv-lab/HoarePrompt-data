Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately captures the correctness of the program in relation to the problem description. The assessment thoroughly analyzes the core functionalities of the program, particularly the calculations of distinct integers reachable by the frog and the handling of edge cases. It explains the use of GCD, the recursive nature of the function, and how it correctly computes sums based on the input parameters.

The output hints reinforce the assessment by clarifying the function's operations and highlighting the handling of both main cases for the input ranges. The program appears effective in summarizing the frog's reachable integers while adhering to the mathematical basis outlined in the prompt.

Since all considerations support the conclusion that the program behaves as intended based on the problem description and the analysis holds true, the final assessment remains that the program is correct.
