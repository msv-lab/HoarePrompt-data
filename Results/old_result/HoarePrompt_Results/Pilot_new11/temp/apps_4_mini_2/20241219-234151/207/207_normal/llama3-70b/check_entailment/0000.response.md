The given Python program attempts to solve the problem by using a dynamic programming approach. However, there is a significant issue in the program with how it initializes the `dp` array and uses it to track the reachable integers.

The code initializes `dp[0] = 1`, implying that there is one way to be at position 0. It then tries to update the `dp` array for the positions that the frog can reach, but it does it incorrectly for the backward jump (`i - b`). Specifically, it miscalculates how many ways can be achieved for each `i` by incorrectly updating `dp[i]` when performing the backward jump. Instead of adding ways from `dp[i - b]` to `dp[i]`, it should instead be maintaining reachable counts independently for forward and backward jumps.

Additionally, the logic possibly fails when considering the range checks before updating. The loop attempts to fill the `dp` array for the entire range from `0` to `m`, but the jumps might lead to positions not being counted correctly or might exceed count due to erroneous accumulation.

Here's a potential test case to show the program fails:

Consider the input `m = 0`, `a = 1`, `b = 1`. 

- According to the problem, the outputs should be straightforward:
  - `f(0) = 1` (the frog can only stay at 0).
  
However, given the current code:
- It initializes `dp` as `[1]` for index `0`. 
- Then in the loop, it does not make any jumps because there are no further indexes to jump to, leading to the output being `1` which is correct here but on larger inputs and cases will start failing.

Just to highlight further:
Checking with larger jumps `m=10`, `a=1`, `b=10`: it leads to incorrect calculations because it can reach `10` from `0` via `10`, but not accumulate those reachable positions correctly.

Thus, the main concern stands, the backward jump logic, as well as the improper handling of jumping counts accumulation, leads to the conclusion that the program is incorrect. 

Correctness: **False**. 

The program needs significant revisions to appropriately maintain the reachability counts correctly to handle the inherent frog jumps both forward and backward properly.
