Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately reflects the correctness of the program. The detailed breakdown of the logic within both functions in the program corroborates their design with respect to the problem description. 

1. The program correctly calculates the greatest common divisor using the Euclidean algorithm, ensuring that all calculations thereafter are performed on simplified values of `a`, `b`, and `m`, maintaining the integrity of the problem. 
   
2. The implementation of the `func_2` function aligns with the requirements for computing `f(x)` values based on the conditions determined by `k` and the given constraints for `m`, `a`, and `b`. 

3. The annotations confirm that the states of variables within the functions are properly manipulated, and the program responds accurately based on comparisons between `m` and `k`.

4. Edge cases, where `a` and `b` might be equal or when only one jump type is possible, are effectively addressed through the program's logic.

5. The function terminology and the computations, such as the use of Gauss' formula, demonstrate an efficient and correct approach to summing the reachable integers by the frog.

Overall, the program matches the problem description and adheres to the logic required to compute the desired outputs, making it functionally correct as assumed in the original assessment.
