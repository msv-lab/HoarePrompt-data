Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `m`, `a`, and `b`, where `m` is a positive integer, and both `a` and `b` are positive integers. It performs the following operations based on the relations between these inputs: 

1. It first computes the value `g` as the output of `func_1(a, b)`. If `g` is not equal to 1, it recursively calls itself with new parameters `m // g`, `a // g`, and `b // g`, returning the product of this recursive call and `g`.

2. If `g` equals 1, it sets `k` as `a + b - 1`. The function then checks if `m` is less than `k`. If `m` is less than `k`, it returns the sum of the first `m` positive integers computed using the formula `(m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2`.

3. If `m` is greater than or equal to `k`, it calculates `sum_k` and `sum_m`, where `sum_k` is the sum of the first `k` integers and `sum_m` is the sum of integers from `k` to `m`. It returns the sum of these two calculated values.

This function effectively computes specific summations based on the integer inputs while also handling a recursion case based on the output from `func_1`, which is crucial for deriving `g`. Edge cases such as when `m` is less than `k` are explicitly handled, and the recursive nature of the function ensures it can deal with larger values of `m`, `a`, and `b` in inputs while ultimately returning numerical sums tailored to the given conditions.**
