To assess the correctness of the provided Python program in relation to the problem description, we must analyze both the requirements outlined in the problem and how the program operates, particularly examining the logic behind the dynamic programming approach used.

### Problem Description:
The function needs to accomplish the following:
1. For a given integer `m`, determine the function `f(x)` which quantifies how many distinct integers the frog can reach starting from `0` and utilizing the jumps defined by the integers `a` (forward jump) and `b` (backward jump).
2. Compute the total sum of `f(i)` for all integers `i` in the range `[0, m]`.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program takes three inputs, `m`, `a`, and `b`, correctly aligning with the problem requirements.

2. **Dynamic Programming Array (`dp`)**:
   - The dynamic programming list `dp` is initialized of size `m + 1`, which tracks the number of ways to reach each position from `0` using the defined jump actions.

3. **Updating `dp`**:
   - The loop iterates over every position `i` from `0` to `m`.
   - For each position:
     - It checks if it can jump forward by `a`, updating `dp[i + a]` if possible.
     - It also checks if it can jump backward by `b`, updating `dp[i]` if possible. However, this backward update is incorrectly implemented because it should be checking `dp[i - b]` instead (as we're trying to accumulate the number of ways to reach `i`).

4. **Summation**:
   - Finally, the program prints the sum of the elements in `dp`, which it interprets as the total number of ways to reach any position from `0` to `m`.

### What’s Wrong?
- The logic employed by the program does not accurately represent how many distinct integers the frog can reach. 
- Specifically, each position `i` is incorrectly updated with the number of ways to reach `i - b`. Instead, it should have been about marking the index as reachable.
- The way the values are aggregated and printed doesn’t correspond to the total distinct integers reachable but rather to the number of ways each position can be reached, which does not match the requirements of computing `f(i)`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not fulfill the requirements indicated by the problem description due to the erroneous nationality (particularly with the back jump), and therefore it fails to compute `f(i)` correctly. 

Correctness: **False**
