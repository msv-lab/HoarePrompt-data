The variable `k` is assigned the value of `a + b - 1`. The values of `a` and `b` are positive integers within their specified ranges, so `k` is also a positive integer. Specifically, since both `a` and `b` are at least 1, `k` will be at least 1 + 1 - 1 = 1. Given that `a` can be up to 10^5 and `b` can be up to 10^5, the maximum value of `k` can go up to 10^5 + 10^5 - 1 = 199999.

The value of `g` remains unchanged from 1, and the values of `m`, `a`, and `b` are still valid according to the original constraints.

Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 10^9; `a` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `a` <= 10^5; `b` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `b` <= 10^5; `g` is equal to 1; `k` is equal to `a + b - 1`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 10^9; `a` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `a` <= 10^5; `b` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `b` <= 10^5; `g` is equal to 1; `k` is equal to `a + b - 1`.**
