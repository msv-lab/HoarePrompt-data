To determine the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the provided logic and annotations closely.

### Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Problem Description**:
   - The frog can jump either forward by `a` or backwards by `b`.
   - We need to compute `f(i)` for `0 <= i <= m`, where `f(i)` is the number of distinct integers the frog can reach in the interval `[0, i]`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function computes the GCD of `a` and `b`. The GCD is relevant because it simplifies the jumping logic by reducing `a` and `b` by their common factor. The annotations mention that it returns the GCD correctly.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - If the GCD `g` of `a` and `b` is not `1`, the function recursively calls itself with reduced `m`, `a`, and `b`, which means the process can handle cases where `a` and `b` share a multiple.
   - The handling when `m < k` correctly calculates the sum of the first `m` integers.
   - When `m` is greater than or equal to `k`, it calculates sums from both ranges properly.

4. **Handling edge cases**:
   - The case when `m = 0` is handled implicitly, returning `1`.
   - Overall, the logic appears to cover the cumulative distance reachable by the frog considering both positive and negative jumps.

### Examining Edge Cases:
- The annotations suggest the function `func_2` returns appropriate results based on different values of `m`, `a`, and `b`.
- We consider an edge case: when `a` and `b` are equal, the jumps will never overlap, meaning `f(i)` might not count certain integers correctly.

### Potential Problems:
- The issue arises particularly in terms of how many distinct integers the frog can reach. The distinct integers count might not fully account for boundaries when `m` is significantly less than `a + b`. 
- In situations where `m` barely meets or exceeds `a + b`, the calculations could result in missing certain integers.

### Conclusion:
While the logic appears sound based on the tests provided, I suspect cases can arise particularly around boundary conditions near `m` and when considering the sums that could miscalculate the reachable counts due to how `a` and `b` relate to each other. 

Given the method of summing through ranges and handling `m` relative to `a + b - 1` does not encompass every potential integer the frog could reach, there seem to be edge cases omitted where certain jumps do not yield unique integers, especially when the bounds of `a` and `b` lead to overlapping jumps.

Thus, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.  
The program may fail to accurately count distinct integers reachable by the frog, particularly in edge cases related to how the sums are computed when `m` is on the boundary of `a + b`.
