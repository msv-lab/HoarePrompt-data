You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A frog is initially at position $0$ on the number line. The frog has two positive integers $a$ and $b$. From a position $k$, it can either jump to position $k+a$ or $k-b$.

Let $f(x)$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $[0, x]$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $0$.

Given an integer $m$, find $\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$. That is, find the sum of all $f(i)$ for $i$ from $0$ to $m$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers $m, a, b$ ($1 \leq m \leq 10^9, 1 \leq a,b \leq 10^5$).


-----Output-----

Print a single integer, the desired sum.


-----Examples-----
Input
7 5 3

Output
19

Input
1000000000 1 2019

Output
500000001500000001

Input
100 100000 1

Output
101

Input
6 4 5

Output
10



-----Note-----

In the first example, we must find $f(0)+f(1)+\ldots+f(7)$. We have $f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$. The sum of these values is $19$.

In the second example, we have $f(i) = i+1$, so we want to find $\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$.

In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.
Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x

#Function 2:
def func_2(m, a, b):
    g = func_1(a, b)
    if g != 1:
        return func_2(m // g, a // g, b // g) * g
    k = a + b - 1
    if m < k:
        return (m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2
    sum_k = k * (k + 1) // 2
    sum_m = m * (m + 1) // 2 - k * (k - 1) // 2
    return sum_k + sum_m


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic in the code against the requirements stated. 

1. **Understanding `f(x)`**: The function `f(x)` represents the number of distinct integers a frog can reach from position `0` with jump distances `a` forward and `b` backward while staying in the interval `[0, x]`.

2. **Input/Output Specification**: We need to compute the sum of `f(i)` for every `i` from `0` to `m`, given the constraints on `m`, `a`, and `b`.

3. **Program Logic**:
   - The program calculates the greatest common divisor (`g`) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm (via the `func_1` function).
   - It reduces the problem by dividing `m`, `a`, and `b` by `g`.
   - The program determines `k = a + b - 1`, which is the maximum position the frog can reach without overshooting the bounds.
   - If `m < k`, it computes the sum of integers from `0` to `m`.
   - If `m >= k`, it computes two different sums: one for `k` and another for the range from `k` to `m`.

4. **Potential Cases**:
   - We should check edge cases or scenarios that might not be properly handled by the implementation. 
   - For example, if `a` and `b` are equal, the frog can alternately jump forwards and backwards, and thus we need to check if the function `func_2` handles these cases correctly. However, in the sample cases provided, it seems that the outputs align with the respective `f(i)` values.

5. **Testing Edge Cases**:
   - Consider `m = 0`, `a = 1`, `b = 2`:
     - Expected output: `f(0) = 1` (can only stay at 0).
     - The program outputs `1`, which is correct.
   - Consider `m = 1`, `a = 3`, `b = 2`:
     - Expected outputs: `f(0) = 1`, `f(1) = 1`, so sum should be `2`.
     - The program would likely compute values correctly.
   - If `a` or `b` is very large compared to `m`, confirm the output remains correct.

6. **Final Verification**:
   - The handling of GCD seems viable as the function continues to break down the problem correctly without losing track of the potential jumps available.
   - The sections of the code that calculate `sum_k` and `sum_m` appear structured correctly.

After thorough consideration and analysis, it seems that the provided implementation covers necessary logic to meet the requirements of the problem description for all reasonable inputs conforming to the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
(m, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
result = func_2(m, a, b)
print(result)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a positive integer and y is a positive integer.
def func_1(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `y` is 0, `x` is the GCD of the initial values of `x` and `y`.
    return x
    #The program returns the GCD of the initial values of `x` (which is the GCD of itself and `y` being 0) and `y` (0)

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: m is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9, a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^5.
def func_2(m, a, b):
    g = func_1(a, b)
    if (g != 1) :
        return func_2(m // g, a // g, b // g) * g
        #The program returns the result of func_2 called with arguments m // g, a // g, and b // g, multiplied by g, where g is the value returned by func_1(a, b) and is not equal to 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 10^9; `a` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `a` <= 10^5; `b` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `b` <= 10^5; `g` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(a, b)`, and `g` is equal to 1.
    k = a + b - 1
    if (m < k) :
        return (m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2
        #The program returns the sum of the first m positive integers, which is calculated as (m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2 based on the given condition that the current value of m is less than k, where k is equal to a + b - 1.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 10^9; `a` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `a` <= 10^5; `b` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `b` <= 10^5; `g` is equal to 1; `k` is equal to `a + b - 1`; and `m` is greater than or equal to `k`.
    sum_k = k * (k + 1) // 2
    sum_m = m * (m + 1) // 2 - k * (k - 1) // 2
    return sum_k + sum_m
    #The program returns the sum of sum_k and sum_m, where sum_k is equal to (a + b - 1) * (a + b) // 2 and sum_m is equal to m * (m + 1) // 2 - (a + b - 1) * (a + b - 2) // 2



Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
