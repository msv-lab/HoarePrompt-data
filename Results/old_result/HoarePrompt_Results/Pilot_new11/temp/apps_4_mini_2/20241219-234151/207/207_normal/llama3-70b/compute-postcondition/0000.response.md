The values of `m`, `a`, and `b` are assigned based on the input received. Since `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\), and `a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^5\), the states of these variables will change as a result of the code execution while the preconditions for `m`, `a`, and `b` still apply.

Given the code `m, a, b = map(int, input().split())`, it assigns `m`, `a`, and `b` new positive integer values based on the split input. The specific values for `m`, `a`, and `b` will depend on the actual input provided, but they will still be within their respective constraints.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\); `a` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^5\); `b` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 10^5\).**
