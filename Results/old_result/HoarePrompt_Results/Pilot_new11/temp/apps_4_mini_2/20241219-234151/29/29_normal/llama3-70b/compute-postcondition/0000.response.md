The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`. The initial state indicates that `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100,000. After this code executes, `n` will be assigned a specific positive integer value as provided by the user input. The precondition related to the type and constraints of `n` remains valid, but its specific value will now depend on the user's input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `n` is an input integer.**
