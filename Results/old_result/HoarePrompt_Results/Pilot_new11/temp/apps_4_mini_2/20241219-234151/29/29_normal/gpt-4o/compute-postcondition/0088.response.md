To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute successfully, we evaluate the conditions set forth in the `while` loop, specifically the expressions involving `temp_counter`, `n`, and `files_set`.

The loop condition is:
```
while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
```

1. **Understanding the Conditions**:
   - The loop will execute as long as both conditions are true.
   - The first condition, `temp_counter <= 2 * n`, requires that `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`.
   - The second condition, `str(temp_counter) in files_set`, means that `temp_counter`, when converted to a string, must exist in the set `files_set`.

2. **Current State**:
   - We know `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n + 1`, which means that `temp_counter <= 2 * n` is currently false, hence the loop cannot execute. 
   - If `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n + 1`, then it clearly exceeds `2 * n`, which means we need to reduce `temp_counter` so that it becomes less than or equal to `2 * n`.

3. **What Needs Adjustment**:
   - The simplest solution is to modify `temp_counter` to ensure it is less than or equal to `2 * n`. Specifically, we can set `temp_counter` to `2 * n` or any value less than that.
   - The condition `str(temp_counter) in files_set` can potentially remain unchanged if `temp_counter` still matches one of the strings in `files_set`; however, based on the current conditions given, we will focus on reducing `temp_counter` primarily.

In summary, the key adjustment to ensure that the loop can execute one or more times is to reduce `temp_counter`.

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000), `files` is a list containing at least `n` strings, `examples` is a list where each element equals its respective index plus one as a string if it was equal to that index and was not moved, `moves` includes formatted strings for each element in `examples` that was not initially equal to its index plus one, `regulars` has at least 1 element, `i` is 1, `target` is `len(examples) + 2`, `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`, and `temp_counter` is not in `files_set`**.
