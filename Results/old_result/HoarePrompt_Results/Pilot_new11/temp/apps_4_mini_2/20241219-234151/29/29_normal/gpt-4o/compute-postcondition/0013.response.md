Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `files` is a list of strings that has at least 2 strings; `file` is the second string in the list; `name` is the first part of `file`. If `type_` is '1', then `examples` now contains `name`. Otherwise, `regulars` now contains `name`.***
