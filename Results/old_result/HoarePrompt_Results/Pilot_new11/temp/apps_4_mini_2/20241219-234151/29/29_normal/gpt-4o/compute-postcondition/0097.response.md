The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Since `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n` and not in `files_set`, the states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the incremented value of `temp_counter`, while all other variables retain their previous definitions.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n` and not in `files_set`; `temp_counter` is incremented by 1; `moves` now includes an additional entry formatted as 'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}'; `n`, `files`, `examples`, `regulars[i]`, `i`, `target` remain unchanged.**
