The code appends a string formatted with the current value of `examples[i]` and `i + 1` to the `moves` list. Given that `i` is `2`, `i + 1` evaluates to `3`. Since the current value of `examples[2]` is not equal to `str(3)`, it proceeds to use the value of `examples[2]`. However, the specific content of `examples[2]` is not provided, so it will remain symbolic.

No other variables are altered, and states remain consistent with the initial conditions.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `files` is a list containing at least `n` strings; `examples` is a list containing at least 3 elements; `i` is 2; `moves` has appended a formatted string `move {examples[2]} 3`.**
