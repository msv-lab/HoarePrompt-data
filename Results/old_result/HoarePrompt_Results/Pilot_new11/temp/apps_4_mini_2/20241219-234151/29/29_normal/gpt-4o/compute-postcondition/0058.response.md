According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on two conditions: `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`, and `str(temp_counter)` must be present in `files_set`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `temp_counter` is incremented by 1 and is now ≤ 2n. This means that the current value of `temp_counter` allows for the condition `temp_counter <= 2 * n` to still hold true. However, to allow the next iteration, it also needs to satisfy the condition that `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`.

Since we know `str(temp_counter)` is currently in `files_set`, we can conclude that the state is valid for another execution of the loop.

Thus, the state doesn't need any modifications since both conditions are satisfied for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `files` is a list containing at least `n` strings; `examples` is a list containing at least 3 elements; `i` is 2; `temp_counter` is incremented by 1 and is now ≤ 2n; `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`**.
