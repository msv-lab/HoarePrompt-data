The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Since `temp_counter` can be either 2 or 3, after the increment, it will be either 3 or 4. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000), `files` is a list containing at least `n` strings, `examples` is a list where each element equals its respective index plus one as a string if it was equal to that index and was not moved, `regulars` has at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `target` is `n + 3`, `temp_counter` is either 3 or 4 and must be ≤ 2 * n, and `str(temp_counter)` must be in files_set (if not, it must be provided or adjusted)**.
