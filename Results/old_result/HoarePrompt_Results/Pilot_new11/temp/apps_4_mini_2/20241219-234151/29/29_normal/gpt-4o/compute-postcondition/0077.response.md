The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged, so we maintain the existing preconditions. Since `temp_counter` was previously decremented by 1, its new value is `old_temp_counter + 1`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `files` is a list containing at least `n` strings; `examples` is a list where each element is equal to its respective index plus one as a string if it was equal to that index and was not moved; `moves` is a list containing formatted strings for each element in `examples` that was not initially equal to its index plus one, capturing the moves made with the corresponding `temp_counter` values; `temp_counter` is incremented by 1; `regulars` has at least 1 element; `i` is 0; `target` is len(examples) + 1; the current value of `regulars[i]` is not equal to the string representation of `target`.**
