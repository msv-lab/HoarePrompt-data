According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the length of the `examples` list. The loop iterates over the `examples` list, and since the iteration starts from `i = 1`, the next value of `i` will be 3. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and given that `examples` is a non-empty list containing at least 2 elements, for the loop to execute one more time, `examples` must have at least 3 elements, and `file` must correspond to the third element in the list.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples sorted by the second element in descending order, `examples` is a non-empty list containing at least 3 elements, `regular` is a list containing the first elements of tuples from `files` where the second element is equal to 0, `script` is a list containing `['move {file} 1', 'move {file} 2']`, `file` is the third element in `examples`, `i` is 3**
