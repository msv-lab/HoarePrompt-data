You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for modifying the program state so that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed. You will be provided with the program state right before the loop, which you need to modify. You will also see the `while` loop statement. If it is a `while True` loop or if the loop can certainly execute one time, please simply repeat the program state right before the loop. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State right before the while loop: `total` is 10, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer.
```
while i < n:
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time?


Example Answer:
According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer. `n` beinng an integer does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**

Example 2:
State right before the while loop: `total` is 0, students is 2 less than its initial value.
```
while students >=1 :
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time?


Example Answer:
According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable students.  If students is greater than or equal to 1, the loop can execute . Rigtht before the loop, students is 2 less than its initial value, So for the loop to  executed the first time time the initial value of students needed to have been equal or greater than 3 and students currently must be greater than 1.
State: **`total` is 0, students is 2 less than its initial value and students currently must be greater or equal to 1**


Your Task:
State right before the while loop: According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the `examples` list and the value of `i`. The loop will iterate for each index in the `examples` list, starting from 0 up to (but not including) the length of the list. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, which indicates that the loop has executed once (for index 0). 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Thus, `i` will be 2 in the next iteration. The loop checks `i` against the length of the `examples` list. Therefore, the loop can execute again as long as `i` (which will be 2) is less than `len(examples)`.

Since `examples` is a non-empty list and the current index is 1, the length of `examples` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue. Thus, the states must be adjusted accordingly.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `files` is a list containing at least `n` strings; `examples` is a list containing at least 3 elements; `i` is 2; if `examples[1]` is not equal to `str(2)`, then `temp_counter` is set to `2n + 2`, `files` still contains at least `n` strings including `str(2n + 1)` in `files_set`, and `moves` contains an additional entry `move {examples[1]} {temp_counter}`.
```
while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time?
