To determine the conditions under which the `while` loop can execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the program state provided.

The loop continues as long as `temp_counter <= 2 * n` and `str(temp_counter) in files_set`. Let's break down the current program state:

1. `n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000).
2. `temp_counter` is currently incremented by 1 and must now be greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to `2 * n + 1`. This implies that the current value of `temp_counter` is in the range [2, 2 * n + 1].
3. The string representation of `temp_counter` must also be in `files_set`, which is derived from the `files` list.

To execute the loop one more time, `temp_counter` has to satisfy both conditions in the `while` loop.

Now, since `temp_counter` is at least 2 and might be at the upper limit, we need to ensure:

- `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`. Since `temp_counter` is currently incremented, if it equals `2 * n`, it will not allow another iteration (as `temp_counter` would then exceed `2 * n` on the next increment).
- `temp_counter` must be a string that exists in `files_set`. 

If `temp_counter` is exactly `2 * n`, we cannot execute the loop again without adjusting it to be less than `2 * n`. Therefore, for it to run one more time, we need to adjust it to be less than `2 * n`. Also, `files_set` should still contain the updated value as a string.

To ensure both conditions are satisfied, let’s adjust `temp_counter`:

- `temp_counter` must now be at least 2 and **less than** `2 * n`, or specifically, it should be set to exactly `2 * n - 1` to allow one more iteration. 
- We need to ensure `str(temp_counter)`, which is `"2 * n - 1"`, is in `files_set`. 

In conclusion, we need to modify the conditions for `temp_counter`:

State: **`temp_counter` must now be less than `2 * n` and `temp_counter` should be a value that appears in `files_set` after decrement.**
