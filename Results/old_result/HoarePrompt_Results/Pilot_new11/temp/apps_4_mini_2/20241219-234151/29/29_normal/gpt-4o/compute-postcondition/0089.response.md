The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Given the initial conditions, `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, so after incrementing, `temp_counter` is now greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `2 * n + 1`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000), `files` is a list containing at least `n` strings, `examples` is a list where each element equals its respective index plus one as a string if it was equal to that index and was not moved, `moves` includes formatted strings for each element in `examples` that was not initially equal to its index plus one, `regulars` has at least 1 element, `i` is 1, `target` is `len(examples) + 2`, `temp_counter` is incremented by 1 and must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `2 * n + 1`, and `temp_counter` is not in `files_set`.**
