According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be greater than 1. Thus, for the loop to be executed one more time, `n` needs to remain greater than 1 while the loop is iterating. The loop will not change the `files` list condition, but it requires `n` to be decreased by 1. Therefore, `n` must be 2 for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `files` is a list containing one tuple (`name`, int(`type_`)), new tuple is appended to `files`, `n` is 2**
