Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000), `files` is a list containing at least `n` strings, `examples` is a list where each element is equal to its respective index plus one as a string if it was equal to that index and was not moved, and `moves` is a list that includes formatted strings for each element in `examples` that was not initially equal to its index plus one. If `regulars[i]` is not equal to `str(target)`, then `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n + 1`, `temp_counter` is not in `files_set`, `moves` includes `move {regulars[0]} {temp_counter}`, `regulars` has at least 1 element, `i` is still 0, `target` is `len(examples) + 1`, and `regulars[0]` is now equal to `str(temp_counter)`. Otherwise, the else part does not apply as there is no else condition in the code.***
