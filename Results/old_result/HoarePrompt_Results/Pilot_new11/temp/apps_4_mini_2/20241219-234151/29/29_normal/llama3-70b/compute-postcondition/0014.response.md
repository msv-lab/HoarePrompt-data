The variable `regular` is assigned a list comprehension that filters `files`, selecting the first element of each tuple where the second element equals 0. The initial state indicates that `files` contains `n` tuples sorted by the second element in descending order. Since `examples` contains the first elements of tuples where the second element is equal to 1, the tuples with a second element of 0 will not overlap with those in `examples`, meaning `regular` will consist of the first elements of tuples excluded from `examples`.

Thus, the impact of the code is to create a new list `regular` containing appropriate first elements from `files`. The count of tuples with the second element equal to 0 directly affects the size of `regular`, but since we do not know how many such tuples are in `files`, we denote them generically.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples sorted by the second element in descending order, `examples` is a list containing the first elements of tuples from `files` where the second element is equal to 1, `regular` is a list containing the first elements of tuples from `files` where the second element is equal to 0.**
