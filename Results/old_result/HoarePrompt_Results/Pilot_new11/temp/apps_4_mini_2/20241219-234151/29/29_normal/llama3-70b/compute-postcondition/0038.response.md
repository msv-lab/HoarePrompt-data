The function `func` accepts no parameters directly, but it processes an input consisting of a positive integer `n` followed by `n` lines, each containing a distinct filename (a string of digits and small English letters, with a length between 1 to 6 characters) and an associated type (either 0 for regular tests or 1 for example tests). After executing the function body, it organizes or processes the filenames based on their associated type. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to read and handle a list of filenames along with their test types based on a positive integer input that indicates the number of filenames to follow. 

Functionality: **The function processes a positive integer n and n subsequent lines containing filenames and their associated types, then organizes or processes this data according to the types specified.**
