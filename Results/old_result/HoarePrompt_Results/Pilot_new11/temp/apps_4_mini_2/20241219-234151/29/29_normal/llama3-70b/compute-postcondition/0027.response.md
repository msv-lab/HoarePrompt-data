According to the code, the loop is intended to iterate over the `regular` list, starting from `len(examples) + 1`. The variable `i` is currently set to `len(examples) + 2`, which indicates that the loop has already executed for the index corresponding to `len(examples) + 1` and is now set to execute for `len(examples) + 2`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `regular` must contain at least one more element beyond the current value of `i`, which is `len(examples) + 2`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `regular` must have at least `len(examples) + 3` elements.

Additionally, the variable `file` must be updated to represent the new element in the `regular` list that corresponds to the current value of `i`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples sorted by the second element in descending order, `examples` is a list containing the first elements of tuples from `files` where the second element is equal to 1, `regular` is a non-empty list containing at least 3 elements, `file` is the next element in the list, `i` is `len(examples) + 3`, and `script` contains the new entry `move {file} {i}` appended to it.**
