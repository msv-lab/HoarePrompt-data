According to the code, the loop can continue executing as long as `i` is less than the length of `examples`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. The length of `examples`, denoted as `len(examples)`, must be greater than `i` for the loop to execute again. Therefore, for the loop to run one more time, `i` will increment by 1, making it 1. 

Consequently, if we assume that the `examples` array has at least 2 elements, then `examples[i]` would refer to `examples[1]`. The previous conditions also suggest that `n` remains unchanged within its defined range, and the properties of `files` and `files_set` do not need to change for the next iteration since they are not directly related to the loop's continuation.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, `files` is a list of strings containing at least `n` strings, `examples` is a non-empty list, `i` is 1.**
