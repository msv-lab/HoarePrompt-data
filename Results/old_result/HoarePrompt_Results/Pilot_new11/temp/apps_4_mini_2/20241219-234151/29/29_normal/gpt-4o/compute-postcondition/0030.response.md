Output State: **`temp_counter` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 2 * n + 1; `files_set` must include the string representation of all integers from 0 to `temp_counter - 1`; the loop has terminated because either `temp_counter` is greater than 2 * n or the string representation of `temp_counter` is not in `files_set`.**
