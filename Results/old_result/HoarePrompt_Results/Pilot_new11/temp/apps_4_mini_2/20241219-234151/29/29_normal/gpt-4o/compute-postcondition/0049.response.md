Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, `files` is a list containing at least `n` strings, `examples` is a non-empty list, and `i` is 1. If `examples[i]` is not equal to `str(i + 1)`, then `temp_counter` is set to `2n + 2`, `files` contains at least `n` strings including `str(2n + 1)` present in `files_set` prior to exit, and a new element is added to `moves`: the string `move {examples[i]} {temp_counter}` where `examples[i]` corresponds to the string representation of `2n + 1`.***
