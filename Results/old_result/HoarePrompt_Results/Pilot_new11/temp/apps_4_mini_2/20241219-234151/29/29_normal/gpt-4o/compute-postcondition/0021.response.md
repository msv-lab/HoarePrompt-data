The variable `temp_counter` is assigned the value `n + 1`. Given that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, this means that `temp_counter` can range from 2 (if `n` is 1) to 100001 (if `n` is 100000). All other variables remain unchanged and retain their initial conditions.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `files` is a list of strings that contains at least `n` strings; `examples` is a list containing the names extracted from `files` where the corresponding type_ is '1'; `regulars` is a list containing the names extracted from `files` where the corresponding type_ is not equal to '1'; `moves` is an empty list; `temp_counter` is an integer such that `temp_counter` is between 2 and 100001.**
