`files` is a list that is being updated to include a new tuple, which consists of `name` (a string input) and `type_` (converted from the second input string to an integer). The state of `n` remains unchanged since the operation does not affect it. Thus, the output state captures `files` with the added tuple.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `files` is a list containing one tuple (`name`, int(`type_`)) and the new tuple (`name`, int(`type_`)) has been appended to `files`.**
