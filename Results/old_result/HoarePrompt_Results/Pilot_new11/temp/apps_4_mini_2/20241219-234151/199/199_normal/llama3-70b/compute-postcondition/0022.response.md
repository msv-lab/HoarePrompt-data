The value of `ways` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ways` is unknown, but it will now be one greater than it was before. Other variables remain the same as their initial state.

Output State: **`ways` is the count of pairs (2, b) such that `2 * (2 + b) == n + 1`, `b` is `(n - a) // 2 + 1`, `n` must be greater than 4; `ways` is incremented by 1**
