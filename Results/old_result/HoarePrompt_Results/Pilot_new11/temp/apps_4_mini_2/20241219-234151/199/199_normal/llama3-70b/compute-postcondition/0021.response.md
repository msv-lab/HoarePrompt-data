According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `b`, `a`, and `n`. The loop runs as long as `b` is less than or equal to `(n - a) // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 4 and `b` must equal `(n - a) // 2` to conclude the last iteration. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `b` must be one more than its last value and for that to occur, `(n - a)` must be adjusted accordingly.

If `b` is currently equal to `(n - a) // 2`, then it would increment to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`, which means `b` must be less than or equal to `(n - a) // 2`. To execute the loop again, `n` needs to be sufficiently large to allow for the increment of `b`.

Thus, for the loop to execute again, `b` should be updated to `(n - a) // 2 + 1` and `n` must be greater than `4` accommodating this increment in `b`.

State: **`ways` is the count of pairs (2, b) such that `2 * (2 + b) == n + 1`, `b` is `(n - a) // 2 + 1` and `n` must be greater than 4**
