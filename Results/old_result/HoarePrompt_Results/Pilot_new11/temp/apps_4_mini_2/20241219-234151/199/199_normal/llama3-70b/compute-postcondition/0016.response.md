The value of `ways` is incremented by 1. The initial state indicates that `n` is equal to 8 (since 2 * (2 + 2) equals n), and `ways` is the count of pairs (a, b). Since `a` and `b` are both 2, they do not satisfy the condition of being unequal, while `n` must be greater than 4, which is already satisfied. Therefore, the output state reflects the increment of `ways` while retaining the rest of the initial conditions.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 4, `ways` is the count of pairs (a, b) such that a is not equal to b and 2 * (a + b) == n, `a` is 2, `b` is 2; `ways` is incremented by 1.**
