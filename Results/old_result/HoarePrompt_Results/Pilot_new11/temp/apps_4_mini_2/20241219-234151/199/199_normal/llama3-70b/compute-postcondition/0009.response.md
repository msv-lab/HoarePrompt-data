According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `a` and `n`. Specifically, the loop continues while `b` is less than or equal to `(n - a) // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 3, and we know the loop may have incremented `b` at the end of the iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `b` needs to be increased by 1.

So if `b` is currently `b_max`, to execute the loop again, we need `b` to be `b_max + 1` and it needs to be the case that `b_max + 1` does not exceed `(n - a) // 2`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the state must be updated to reflect this increment.

State: **`n` is at least 3; if `a` is not equal to `b` and 2 times the sum of `a` and `b` equals `n`, then `ways` is incremented by 1, and `b` is `b + 1`**
