The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9. 

If `n` is equal to 1, the function returns 0. If `n` is greater than or equal to 6, the function returns the total number of valid pairs (a, b) calculated during the iterations. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a positive integer `n` and return 0 if `n` is 1, or the total number of valid pairs (a, b) if `n` is greater than or equal to 6. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and returns 0 if n is 1; if n is greater than or equal to 6, it returns the total number of valid pairs (a, b).**
