To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's recap the requirements:

The task is to count the number of ways to split a stick of length `n` into four parts such that:
1. Each part has a positive integer length.
2. They can form a rectangle (which means we need two pairs of equal lengths).
3. It is impossible for these lengths to also form a square (which requires all four lengths to be equal).

Given this, let's analyze the program:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer input `n` and checks if `n < 6`. If `n` is less than 6, it returns `0`, which is correct since it's impossible to cut the stick into four positive integer lengths.

2. **Counting Valid Pairs**:
   - The program counts valid configurations of lengths `a` (for two parts) and `b` (for the other two parts) using a loop:
     - It initializes `a` from `1` up to `n // 4`, ensuring `a` can be small enough for two pairs to fit into `n`.
     - It sets `b` equal to `a` (i.e., both of the selected lengths for the pairs of two parts).
     - It calculates the remaining length (`rem`) after assigning lengths `a` and `b` to two parts each.
     - It checks two conditions:
       - `rem` should be greater than `0` (ensures we can still split the remainder).
       - `rem` should be even (to allow division into two equal lengths).
     - Finally, it checks that the remnant length (half of `rem`) is distinct from `a` to ensure we do not form a square.

3. **Return Value**: The program returns the count of valid combinations.

### Analyzing Edge Cases:
- **n = 6**: The only valid configuration is `{1, 1, 2, 2}`, which can form a rectangle and not a square. The program provides the correct output `1`.
- **n = 20**: Valid configurations include `{1, 1, 9, 9}`, `{2, 2, 8, 8}`, `{3, 3, 7, 7}`, and `{4, 4, 6, 6}`, totaling to `4`. The calculations properly avoid configurations that would yield all sides equal (like `{5, 5, 5, 5}`).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description for all valid inputs and returns the expected outputs for the specified test cases. 

Thus, the correctness of the program based on the problem requirements is: 

Correctness: **True**
