To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to evaluate whether it correctly implements the task outlined in the problem description.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
- Pasha has a stick of length `n` and wants to perform three cuts to get four positive integer parts.
- The parts must allow forming a rectangle, which means two pairs of equal lengths, but should not allow forming a square (i.e., all four parts cannot be equal).
- We need to count distinct ways to achieve this.

### Analyzing the Code:
1. **Basic Checks**:
   - If `n < 6`, the program correctly returns `0` since it's impossible to get four positive parts under that length.
   
2. **Logic for Counting Valid Combinations**:
   - The loop iterates through potential lengths `a` from `1` to `n // 4`. For each `a`, it pairs it with `b = a` and calculates the remainder `rem` as `n - 2 * (a + b)`.
   - It checks if `rem > 0` and if `rem` is even.
   - Finally, it ensures that `a != rem // 2`, which is intended to prevent them from being all equal (i.e., forming a square).

3. **Counting Logic**:
   - The counting of valid configurations primarily relies on the values of `a` and ensures `rem` provides viable lengths to avoid squares.

### Review of Output Hints:
- The output hints detail that the function counts valid pairs `(a, a)` leading to a third dimension that can form a rectangular shape without equating to a square.
- Example outputs were demonstrated to validate the correctness of configurations.

### Edge Cases:
- Testing for various values below `n = 6` returns `0`, which is expected.
- For each valid `n >= 6`, the loop correctly checks conditions, thus the counting seems appropriate.

### Conclusion:
Upon a thorough examination, the provided code fulfills the requirements of the problem statement, returning accurate counts under valid test inputs and maintaining logic conformity with the conditions laid out.

Thus, the final verdict is:
Correctness: **True**
