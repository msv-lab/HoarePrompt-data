To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the requirements and how the program achieves them.

### Problem Requirements Analysis
The task is to find the number of ways to split a stick of length `n` into four positive integer parts such that:
1. The parts can form a rectangle (which necessitates having two distinct pairs of equal lengths).
2. The parts cannot form a square (meaning all four parts cannot be of the same length).

For the stick to be split into four parts (2 pairs of lengths) and still satisfy the rectangular condition, the lengths must be in the form of two different lengths (let's call them `a` and `b`), such that:
- `2a + 2b = n`, which simplifies to `a + b = n / 2`.
- `a` should not equal `b` (ensuring it's not a square).

### Program Logic Analysis
The given function `func_1(n)` attempts to count valid pairs `(a, b)` such that:
1. `a + b = n / 2`.
2. `a != b`.
3. It loops through possible values of `a` and calculates a corresponding value of `b`.

Here's a breakdown of how the logic is supposed to work:
- The outer loop iterates through possible values of `a` from `1` to `n // 2`.
- The inner loop checks values for `b` based on the first condition.
- The condition `if a != b and 2 * (a + b) == n` checks that it satisfies the problem's criteria.

### Conditions
1. If `n` is odd, `n / 2` is not an integer, which means there are no valid pairs `(a, b)`, so the result is correctly `0`.
2. If `n` is less than `4`, itâ€™s impossible to form four positive integer parts, thus the number of ways will also be `0`.
3. For even `n`, the program counts valid `(a, b)` pairs correctly observing that `a` must be less than `b` to count them distinctly.

### Conclusion
The analysis reveals that the program does provide the correct count of pairs satisfying the problem conditions:
- It correctly identifies pairs that can form a rectangle (`2a + 2b = n`).
- It ensures that pairs that would form a square (like `(x, x)`) are excluded by the condition `a != b`.

### Final Verdict
Therefore, the provided program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
