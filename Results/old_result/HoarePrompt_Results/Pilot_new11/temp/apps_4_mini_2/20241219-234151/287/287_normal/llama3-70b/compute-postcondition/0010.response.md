The variable `res` is incremented by 2, changing its value from 2 to 4. The variables `n` and `i` remain unchanged as they are not impacted by the operation. Thus, the output state is `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^9, `res` is 4, and `i` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^9, `res` is 4, `i` is 2**
