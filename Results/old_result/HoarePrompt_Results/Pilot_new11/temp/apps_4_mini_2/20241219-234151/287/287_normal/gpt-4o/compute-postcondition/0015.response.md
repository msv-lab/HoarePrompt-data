The value of `i` is incremented by 1. However, the previous state indicates that the specific values of `count`, `i`, and `num` may be dependent on conditions regarding `num`, so they remain unchanged. Thus, the output state captures the increment of `i` while maintaining the other variables.

Output State: **`num` is greater than or equal to 4; `count` is 2 initially and is increased by 1 to 4 if `num` is divisible by `i`; `i` is increased by 1.**
