The variable `i` is assigned the value 1. The states of the other variables, `num` and `count`, remain unchanged. Thus, the output state is: `num` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `num` <= 10^9; `count` is 0; `i` is 1. 

Output State: **`num` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `num` <= 10^9; `count` is 0; `i` is 1**
