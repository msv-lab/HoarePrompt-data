You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Let's define a split of $n$ as a nonincreasing sequence of positive integers, the sum of which is $n$. 

For example, the following sequences are splits of $8$: $[4, 4]$, $[3, 3, 2]$, $[2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1]$, $[5, 2, 1]$.

The following sequences aren't splits of $8$: $[1, 7]$, $[5, 4]$, $[11, -3]$, $[1, 1, 4, 1, 1]$.

The weight of a split is the number of elements in the split that are equal to the first element. For example, the weight of the split $[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]$ is $5$, the weight of the split $[5, 5, 3, 3, 3]$ is $2$ and the weight of the split $[9]$ equals $1$.

For a given $n$, find out the number of different weights of its splits.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 10^9$).


-----Output-----

Output one integer — the answer to the problem.

-----Note-----

In the first sample, there are following possible weights of splits of $7$:

Weight 1: [$\textbf 7$] 

Weight 2: [$\textbf 3$, $\textbf 3$, 1] 

Weight 3: [$\textbf 2$, $\textbf 2$, $\textbf 2$, 1] 

Weight 7: [$\textbf 1$, $\textbf 1$, $\textbf 1$, $\textbf 1$, $\textbf 1$, $\textbf 1$, $\textbf 1$]
Program:
```
n = int(input())
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(num):
    count = 0
    i = 1
    while i * i <= num:
        if num % i == 0:
            count += 1
            if i != num // i:
                count += 1
        i += 1
    return count


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided program is attempting to count the number of distinct weights of splits of a number `n`, but it mistakenly calculates the number of divisors of `n` instead. This logic does not align with the problem description.

To elucidate why the program is incorrect:

1. The problem defines a 'weight' of a split as the number of occurrences of the first element in a valid split. However, the provided function `func_1()` simply counts the number of divisors of `n`, which does not relate to the weights of the splits.

2. For example, consider the input of `n = 8`. The program will return `4` because there are four divisors: `1, 2, 4, 8`. However, according to the problem statement, the distinct weights of the splits of `8` are `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`, which results in the answer `5`.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, validating that the correctness is indeed **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
n = int(input())
print(func_1(n))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is a positive integer such that 1 <= num <= 10^9.
def func_1(num):
    count = 0
    i = 1
    while i * i <= num:
        if num % i == 0:
            count += 1
            if i != num // i:
                count += 1
        
        i += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: 'i' is greater than or equal to the integer part of the square root of 'num' plus 1; `count` is the total number of divisors of 'num'. `i` is 'floor(sqrt(num)) + 1'.
    return count
    #The program returns the total number of divisors of 'num'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `num` (1 <= num <= 10^9) as input and calculates the total number of divisors of `num`. It iterates from 1 up to the square root of `num`, checking if each integer is a divisor. If a divisor is found, it increments a count and checks if the divisor pair (i, num // i) is distinct, incrementing the count again if so. The function returns the total count of divisors. After execution, the program's final state reflects that `count` holds the number of divisors of `num`, ensuring it handles the edge case where `num` is a perfect square correctly.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
