The variable `count` is assigned the value `0`. The value of `num` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `num` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `num` <= 10^9; `count` is 0.

Output State: **`num` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `num` <= 10^9; `count` is 0**.
