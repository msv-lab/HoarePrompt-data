According to the code, the loop runs based on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to the square root of `n`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has its current value, and since `i` is used to assess whether the loop can run again, we need to determine its next value.

Since the loop defines its range as `range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1)`, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(n ** 0.5)`. 

Given that `i` was either set to 1 or remained 1 during the previous iteration, we will increment `i` by 1 to check if the loop can run again. 

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be 2, as there are no changes to `res` when `i * i` does not equal `n`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^9, `res` is 2, `i` is 2**
