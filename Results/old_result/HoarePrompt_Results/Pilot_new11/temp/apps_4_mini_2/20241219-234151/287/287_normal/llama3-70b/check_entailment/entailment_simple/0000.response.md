Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem specifically asks for the number of different weights of splits of a given integer \( n \). 

1. **Incorrect Functionality**: The program attempts to count the number of divisors of \( n \) (represented by the variable `res`), which is not related to the problem description about splits and weights. The program counts how many integers \( i \) can evenly divide \( n \) rather than how the non-increasing sequences that sum to \( n \) can be formatted and counted by their weights.

2. **Missing Logic**: The program does not implement any logic to form or analyze splits of \( n \) as described in the problem statement. It fails to explore the combinations of integers that sum up to \( n \), or to categorize them based on weights derived from the first elements of these sequences.

3. **Incorrect Output**: The output of the program, which is simply the count of divisors of \( n \), does not relate to the weights or the concept of the splits as specified.

In conclusion, the program does not accomplish the task required by the problem description regarding splits and weight calculation, thus making it incorrect.
