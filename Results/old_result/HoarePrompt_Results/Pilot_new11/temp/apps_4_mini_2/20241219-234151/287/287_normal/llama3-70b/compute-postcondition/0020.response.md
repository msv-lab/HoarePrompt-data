The code snippet provided is a print statement, which outputs the value of `res`. Since there are no changes made to the state of any variables, we will retain the existing information about `n` and `res`. 

The value of `res`, which represents the total number of divisors of `n`, is printed. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^9, `res` is the total number of divisors of `n`, and `res` has been printed.**
