`res` is decreased by 1. The initial value of `res` is 2, so after executing `res -= 1`, the new value of `res` becomes 1. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged and valid as per the initial conditions. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^9, `i` is 1 if `n` is divisible by `i`, else unchanged, and now `res` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^9, `res` is 1, `i` is 1 if `n` is divisible by `i`**.
