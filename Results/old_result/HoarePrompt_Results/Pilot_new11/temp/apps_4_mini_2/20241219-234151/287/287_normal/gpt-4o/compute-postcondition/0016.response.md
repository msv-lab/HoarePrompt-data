According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `num`. The condition for the loop to execute is `i * i <= num`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been increased by 1. Given that `num` is greater than or equal to 4, we need to consider the relationship between `i` and `num`. 

If `i` was `k` at the end of the last iteration, after the increment, it is now `k + 1`. For the loop to execute again, we need:

```
(k + 1) * (k + 1) <= num
```

This expands to:

```
k^2 + 2k + 1 <= num
```

Therefore, the only state that must be adjusted is to ensure that `num` is greater than `k^2 + 2k + 1`. 

Since we only have the information that `num` is greater than or equal to 4, there is uncertainty about whether `num` meets the condition required for `i = k + 1` to allow another iteration. Thus, we will modify `num` to reflect that it must be greater than `k^2 + 2k + 1`.

State: **`num` must be greater than or equal to `i * i + 2 * i + 1` after the increment of `i`**
