The value of `count` is incremented by 1. Given that `count` was initially 0, after the operation, `count` becomes 1. The values of `num` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated output state will reflect this change.

Output State: **`num` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `num` <= 10^9; `count` is 1; `i` is 1; and `num` is divisible by `i`.**
