According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the current value of `i` and `n`. The loop continues as long as `i` is within the range defined by `1` to `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`, which represents the square root of `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. The loop condition checks for the range from `1` to `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `int(n ** 0.5)` must be at least `2`, which means `n` needs to be at least `4` (since `sqrt(4) = 2`). During this next iteration, the value of `i` would be incremented to `3`.

Thus, in order for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least `9` (so that `int(n ** 0.5) + 1` equals 4).

State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range 4 to 10^9, `res` is 2, `i` is 3**
