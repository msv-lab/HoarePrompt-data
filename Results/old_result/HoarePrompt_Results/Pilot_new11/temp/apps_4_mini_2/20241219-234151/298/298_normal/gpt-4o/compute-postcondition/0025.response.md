The function `func` does not accept any parameters. According to the constraints provided, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers with specific bounds: \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 10^9 \) and \( 2 \leq k \leq 10^9 \). However, since the function does not take any inputs directly, it is implied that these constraints and their relationships may be utilized within the function in an unspecified manner.

Based on the output requirement, the functionality remains unclear as the specific return values or conditions have not been provided within the context. Therefore, there isn't a clear description of how the parameters and their constraints would influence the return value.

To summarize, the functionality of the function `func` is not explicitly defined without details on how `n`, `m`, and `k` are utilized or what output they generate.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its functionality is undefined without specific return values or conditions relating to n, m, and k.**
