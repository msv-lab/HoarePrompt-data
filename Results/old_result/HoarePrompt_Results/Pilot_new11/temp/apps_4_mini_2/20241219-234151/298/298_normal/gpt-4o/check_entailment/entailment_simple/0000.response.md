The program aims to solve the problem of finding three integer points such that the triangle they form has an area equal to \( \frac{nm}{k} \). 

### Analysis of Key Requirements:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three integers \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \) from input, ensuring that they conform to the specified constraints.
2. **Area Calculation and Validation**:
   - The area is computed as \( \text{area} = \frac{n \times m}{k} \).
   - If this area is not an integer (i.e., if \( n \times m \mod k \neq 0 \)), the program correctly outputs "NO".
   - If the calculated area is zero, the program also outputs "NO" (though this situation can't happen given the provided constraints).
3. **Output Points**:
   - When a valid area is found, it outputs "YES" and then provides three points.
   - The selection of points is conditional based on the value of \( 2 \times \text{area} \):
     - If \( 2 \times \text{area} \leq n \), it produces points: \( (0, 0) \), \( (2 \times \text{area}, 1) \), \( (0, 1) \)
     - If \( 2 \times \text{area} \leq m \), it outputs: \( (0, 0) \), \( (1, 2 \times \text{area}) \), \( (1, 0) \)
     - Otherwise, it falls back to using maximum coordinates within bounds, leading to points \( (n, m // 2) \) and \( (0, m // 2) \).

### Validity Check:
- The points selected are always valid due to the conditions ensuring they lie within the bounds defined by \( n \) and \( m \).
- The area of the triangle formed by any three points \( (x_1, y_1) \), \( (x_2, y_2) \), and \( (x_3, y_3) \) is: 
  \[
  \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \right|
  \]
  The outputs given by the program lead to configurations fulfilling the necessary area requirement.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the program line by line against the problem requirements:
- The program correctly identifies if an area can be formed.
- It adheres to the input constraints and generates appropriate outputs according to the conditions specified.
- It accurately returns "NO" when no valid triangle can be formed or outputs valid triangle vertices otherwise.

Therefore, the program indeed fulfills the requirements as set out in the problem description.
