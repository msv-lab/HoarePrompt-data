The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `a` and `b`. Both parameters are integers, with the additional constraint that `b` must be greater than or equal to 0. 

In the execution of the function:
- If `b` is equal to 0, the function returns the tuple (1, 0).
- If `b` is greater than 0, the function returns a tuple containing two values: `y` and the result of the expression `(x - a // b * y)`, where `y` and `x` are the results of invoking `func_2(b, a % b)`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two integers `a` and `b` and return specific tuples based on the value of `b`, handling a division-like operation when `b` is positive.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters a and b (both integers with b >= 0). If b is 0, it returns the tuple (1, 0); if b is greater than 0, it returns a tuple containing y and (x - a // b * y), where y and x are results from calling func_2(b, a % b).**
