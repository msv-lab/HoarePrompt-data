You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has got three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$. He'd like to find three integer points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, $(x_3, y_3)$, such that $0 \le x_1, x_2, x_3 \le n$, $0 \le y_1, y_2, y_3 \le m$ and the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$.

Help Vasya! Find such points (if it's possible). If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The single line contains three integers $n$, $m$, $k$ ($1\le n, m \le 10^9$, $2 \le k \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

If there are no such points, print "NO".

Otherwise print "YES" in the first line. The next three lines should contain integers $x_i, y_i$ â€” coordinates of the points, one point per line. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 3

Output
YES
1 0
2 3
4 1

Input
4 4 7

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example area of the triangle should be equal to $\frac{nm}{k} = 4$. The triangle mentioned in the output is pictured below:  [Image] 

In the second example there is no triangle with area $\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{16}{7}$.
Program:
```
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

#Function 2:
def func_2(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return (1, 0)
    else:
        (x, y) = func_2(b, a % b)
        return (y, x - a // b * y)

#Function 3:
def func_3(a, b):
    (x, y) = func_2(a, b)
    return (x, y, x * a + y * b)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The given program does not implement any logic that directly matches the problem description. The problem requires finding three integer points that form a triangle with an area equal to \(\frac{nm}{k}\). However, the provided code contains only three helper functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`) that seem to be concerned with finding the greatest common divisor and possibly with calculating the coefficients of the linear combination, but they do not address the problem at hand of calculating triangle coordinates or checking if such coordinates exist.

Moreover, the program lacks the main logic to determine whether the desired triangle can be formed with the specified area, and it does not handle input or produce the required output based on the problem's conditions.

Considering these points, the program does not meet the requirements as specified in the problem description, and it cannot handle any cases where valid points might be present or absent. Therefore, it is incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import math

(n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
if n * m % k:
    print('NO')
    exit()
(n1, m1, g) = func_3(n, m)
if abs(n1 * m) >= g:
    print('YES')
    print(0, 0)
    print(0, n1 * m // g)
    print(m1 * m // g, 0)
else:
    print('NO')

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: 'a' is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of 'a' and 'b', 'b' is 0.
    return a
    #The program returns the value of 'a', which is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of 'a' and 'b', where 'b' is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters, `a` and `b`, and computes their greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm. After executing, the function ensures that the value of `b` is 0 and returns the value of `a`, which represents the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`. It is important to note that if both parameters are initially 0, the function does not handle this edge case and will return 0, which is mathematically ambiguous since GCD(0, 0) is undefined.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers, with b >= 0.
def func_2(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        return 1, 0
        #The program returns the tuple (1, 0)
    else :
        x, y = func_2(b, a % b)
        return y, x - a // b * y
        #The program returns a tuple containing y and (x - a // b * y), where 'y' and 'x' are the results of func_2(b, a % b), and 'b' is an integer greater than 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters, a and b, where b is greater than or equal to 0. If b is 0, it returns the tuple (1, 0). If b is greater than 0, it recursively calls itself with the parameters (b, a % b), and upon returning from that call, it returns a tuple consisting of the value of y (result from the recursive call) and a computed value based on a, b, and x (result from the recursive call). This function essentially computes and returns values that are related to the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which finds coefficients that express the greatest common divisor of a and b (along with that gcd). The program does not currently have handling for invalid input cases, such as non-integer values or negative values for a, which could be considered as potential edge cases.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func_3(a, b):
    x, y = func_2(a, b)
    return x, y, x * a + y * b
    #The program returns the values of x and y assigned from func_2(a, b), as well as the result of the calculation x * a + y * b, where a and b are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function `func_3` accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, constrained to the range 1 to 10^9. It calls another function `func_2` with these parameters, which returns two values `x` and `y`. The function then returns a tuple containing the values of `x` and `y` along with the result of the expression `x * a + y * b`. The function's final output encapsulates both the results from `func_2` and a computed value that is dependent on the inputs `a` and `b`. There are no checks or exception handling for potential invalid states or ranges beyond the provided constraints in the comments, but the code assumes `func_2` will return valid outputs.



Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
