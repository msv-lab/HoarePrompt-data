#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: 'a' is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of 'a' and 'b', 'b' is 0.
    return a
    #The program returns the value of 'a', which is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of 'a' and 'b', where 'b' is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters, `a` and `b`, and computes their greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm. After executing, the function ensures that the value of `b` is 0 and returns the value of `a`, which represents the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`. It is important to note that if both parameters are initially 0, the function does not handle this edge case and will return 0, which is mathematically ambiguous since GCD(0, 0) is undefined.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers, with b >= 0.
def func_2(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        return 1, 0
        #The program returns the tuple (1, 0)
    else :
        x, y = func_2(b, a % b)
        return y, x - a // b * y
        #The program returns a tuple containing y and (x - a // b * y), where 'y' and 'x' are the results of func_2(b, a % b), and 'b' is an integer greater than 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters, a and b, where b is greater than or equal to 0. If b is 0, it returns the tuple (1, 0). If b is greater than 0, it recursively calls itself with the parameters (b, a % b), and upon returning from that call, it returns a tuple consisting of the value of y (result from the recursive call) and a computed value based on a, b, and x (result from the recursive call). This function essentially computes and returns values that are related to the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which finds coefficients that express the greatest common divisor of a and b (along with that gcd). The program does not currently have handling for invalid input cases, such as non-integer values or negative values for a, which could be considered as potential edge cases.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func_3(a, b):
    x, y = func_2(a, b)
    return x, y, x * a + y * b
    #The program returns the values of x and y assigned from func_2(a, b), as well as the result of the calculation x * a + y * b, where a and b are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function `func_3` accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, constrained to the range 1 to 10^9. It calls another function `func_2` with these parameters, which returns two values `x` and `y`. The function then returns a tuple containing the values of `x` and `y` along with the result of the expression `x * a + y * b`. The function's final output encapsulates both the results from `func_2` and a computed value that is dependent on the inputs `a` and `b`. There are no checks or exception handling for potential invalid states or ranges beyond the provided constraints in the comments, but the code assumes `func_2` will return valid outputs.
