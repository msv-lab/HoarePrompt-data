The function `func_3` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9. After executing the function body, it returns the values of `x` and `y` assigned from the function `func_2(a, b)`, along with the result of the calculation `x * a + y * b`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept two integers `a` and `b`, and return the values from `func_2(a, b)` as well as the computed value of `x * a + y * b`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters a and b, and returns the values from func_2(a, b) and the result of the calculation x * a + y * b.**
