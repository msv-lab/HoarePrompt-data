Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k` are integers. If `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`, then the output `0 1` is printed. If `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m`, then `'1 0'` is printed. Otherwise, since `2 * area` is greater than both `n` and `m`, the output is `'0 {m // 2}'`, indicating that `2 * area` is greater than `m`.***
