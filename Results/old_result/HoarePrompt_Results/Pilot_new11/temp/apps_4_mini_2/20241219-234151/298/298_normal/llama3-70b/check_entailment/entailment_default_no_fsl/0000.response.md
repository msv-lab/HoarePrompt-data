Correctness: **False**

The given program logic checks if \( n \times m \) is divisible by \( k \) to determine if a triangle with the specified area can be formed. However, while this condition ensures that the area can be an integer, the program does not guarantee that valid integer points can be found within the specified range for all valid cases. Furthermore, the potential output produced when the area is valid relies on specific values returned from `func_3`, which can fail in certain configurations.

1. If \( k \) is very large compared to \( n \) and \( m \), particularly when \( k > n \times m \), it is impossible to find any triangle that meets the area requirement. The program returns "YES" in such cases if the divisibility condition is met, but it may actually have no valid points.

2. The area calculation assumes that the triangle can always be constructed directly by the coordinates returned from `func_3`, which isn't rigorously verified within the constraints. The checks and balances to ascertain the validity of the points in forming a triangle of the specified area are insufficient.

Consequently, there exist scenarios where the output does not meet the requirement stated in the problem description, leading to cases that the program would incorrectly return "YES" when it should return "NO". An example is when \( n = 2, m = 2 \), and \( k = 5 \), where the area cannot be correctly formed, but the current logic would incorrectly align to produce points.

Thus, the program does not cater to every edge case correctly, making it incorrect.
