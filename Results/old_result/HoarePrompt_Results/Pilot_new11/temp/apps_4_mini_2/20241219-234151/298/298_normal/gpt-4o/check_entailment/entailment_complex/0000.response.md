To verify the correctness of the given Python program against the provided problem description, we need to analyze both the program's logic and how it aligns with the requirements laid out in the problem statement.

### Problem Description Recap:
Vasya has integers \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \) and wants to find three integer points \( (x_1, y_1) \), \( (x_2, y_2) \), \( (x_3, y_3) \) such that:
- \( 0 \leq x_1, x_2, x_3 \leq n \)
- \( 0 \leq y_1, y_2, y_3 \leq m \)
- The area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to \( \frac{nm}{k} \).

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Reading:** 
   The program reads three integers \( n, m, \) and \( k \) which meets the constraints given in the problem description.

2. **Area Calculation:**
   It calculates the area \( \text{area} = \frac{n \cdot m}{k} \). The program checks if this area is not an integer and prints "NO" if this is the case. This is important because it adheres to the requirement that \( \frac{nm}{k} \) must be a precise integer value for valid integer triangle coordinates.

3. **Zero Area Case:**
   If the calculated area is zero, it prints "NO". The triangle cannot have zero area if we need three distinct points; therefore, this check is required.

4. **Triangle Points Generation:**
   The program then checks conditions based on the value of \( 2 \cdot \text{area} \):
   - If \( 2 \cdot \text{area} \leq n \): It prints points \( (0, 0) \), \( (2 \cdot \text{area}, 1) \), and \( (0, 1) \).
   - If \( 2 \cdot \text{area} \leq m \): It prints points \( (0, 0) \), \( (1, 2 \cdot \text{area}) \), and \( (1, 0) \).
   - If \( 2 \cdot \text{area} \) exceeds both \( n \) and \( m \): It prints points \( (0, m // 2) \), \( (n, m // 2) \), and \( (0, 0) \).

5. **Output Points Validity:**
   Each set of points produced satisfies the constraints given:
   - They remain within the bounds \( 0 \leq x_i \leq n \) and \( 0 \leq y_i \leq m \).
   - The output points can generate the required triangle area calculated earlier due to the way the outputs are constructed.

### Summary:
The program accurately calculates the area and checks the feasibility of the triangle creation. It properly handles edge cases (like non-integer area and zero area) and satisfactorily generates possible coordinates within the bounds. 

There are conditions under which the areas may not generate valid integers or fall outside the constraints, but these are handled correctly.

Thus, the program meets all the specifications given in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
