The variable `mid` is assigned the value of `(low + high) // 2`, which computes the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high`. The initial state indicates that `n` is an integer that satisfies the condition `2 <= n <= a + b`, and there are no changes made to `n` or other variables in the provided code. Therefore, the output state will only reflect the update to `mid`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= a + b; `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2**
