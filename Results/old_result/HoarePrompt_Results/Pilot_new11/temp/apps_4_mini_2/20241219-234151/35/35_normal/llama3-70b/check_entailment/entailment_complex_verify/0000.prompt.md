You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: It's New Year's Eve soon, so Ivan decided it's high time he started setting the table. Ivan has bought two cakes and cut them into pieces: the first cake has been cut into a pieces, and the second one — into b pieces.

Ivan knows that there will be n people at the celebration (including himself), so Ivan has set n plates for the cakes. Now he is thinking about how to distribute the cakes between the plates. Ivan wants to do it in such a way that all following conditions are met:  Each piece of each cake is put on some plate;  Each plate contains at least one piece of cake;  No plate contains pieces of both cakes. 

To make his guests happy, Ivan wants to distribute the cakes in such a way that the minimum number of pieces on the plate is maximized. Formally, Ivan wants to know the maximum possible number x such that he can distribute the cakes according to the aforementioned conditions, and each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.

Help Ivan to calculate this number x!


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers n, a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b) — the number of plates, the number of pieces of the first cake, and the number of pieces of the second cake, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible number x such that Ivan can distribute the cake in such a way that each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 2 3

Output
1

Input
4 7 10

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the first example there is only one way to distribute cakes to plates, all of them will have 1 cake on it.

In the second example you can have two plates with 3 and 4 pieces of the first cake and two plates both with 5 pieces of the second cake. Minimal number of pieces is 3.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    x = min(n, a, b)
    while True:
        if a >= x and b >= x and (a - x + (b - x) >= x):
            break
        x -= 1
    print(x)


```
Original Assessment: To verify the given program, let’s analyze the problem description and the provided code in detail.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to distribute pieces of two cakes into `n` plates such that:
1. Each plate gets at least one piece of cake.
2. No plate contains pieces from both cakes.
3. The minimum number of pieces on any plate should be maximized.

### Input:
- `n`: number of plates (2 ≤ n ≤ a + b)
- `a`: pieces of the first cake (1 ≤ a ≤ 100)
- `b`: pieces of the second cake (1 ≤ b ≤ 100)

### Output:
- Print the maximum possible number `x` such that each plate contains at least `x` pieces of cake.

### Provided Code:
```python
def func():
    (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    x = min(n, a, b)
    while True:
        if a >= x and b >= x and (a - x + (b - x) >= x):
            break
        x -= 1
    print(x)
```

### Logic Breakdown:
1. The initial value of `x` is calculated as `min(n, a, b)`. This is because the maximum pieces per plate cannot exceed the number of plates, the number of pieces of the first cake, or the number of pieces of the second cake.
2. The code enters a loop that continues until the conditions are satisfied:
   - Each type of cake must have enough pieces to allow every plate to have at least `x`.
   - The remaining pieces after giving `x` to every plate from both cakes must still meet the condition such that all plates can have at least `x` pieces either from the first cake or the second cake.

### Potential Issues:
1. The decrement of `x` starts from `min(n, a, b)`, which may not respect the conditions when `a` or `b` is less than `n`. For instance, if `n = 5`, `a = 2`, and `b = 3`, the code sets `x` to `2` initially, and checks if `a >= 2`, `b >= 2`. This is false, and `x` is decreased until it reaches `1`, which results in a correct answer of `1`. However, if `n` was `4`, `a = 2`, `b = 2`, it would incorrectly begin with `x = 2`, leading to premature decrementing without accounting for the total number of plates.
2. Edge cases, such as when pieces are equal or when one cake completely satisfies the number of plates while the other doesn't, can yield results that break the assumptions made in the code.

### Example that Fails:
Consider `n = 4`, `a = 2`, and `b = 2`. Here:
- The expected output is `1`, since each cake has 2 pieces and we only need to satisfy `4` plates with at least `1` piece each.
- However, this will lead to an initial `x` of `2`, decrementing to `1`, satisfying conditions but bypassing the case where it's not valid (for configuration `1 piece on each plate, from both cakes`).

### Conclusion:
The logic in the code does not account for all the possible distributions correctly, leading to potential incorrect outputs in certain configurations.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ a + b, a is an integer representing the number of pieces of the first cake (1 ≤ a ≤ 100), and b is an integer representing the number of pieces of the second cake (1 ≤ b ≤ 100).
def func():
    n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    x = min(n, a, b)
    while True:
        if a >= x and b >= x and a - x + (b - x) >= x:
            break
        
        x -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is a non-negative integer, where the original value of `x` was equal to min(`n`, `a`, `b`) and has been decreased until either `a >= x`, `b >= x`, and `a - x + (b - x) >= x` holds true, or `x` reaches 0. If the loop executed successfully, then the final values of `a` and `b` must remain greater than or equal to the final value of `x`. If `x` reaches 0 without breaking, the last values of `a` and `b` still fulfill the balance condition for at least one piece from both cakes.
    print(x)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads three integers, \(n\), \(a\), and \(b\), from user input. It determines the maximum number \(x\) of cake pieces that can be distributed such that there are enough pieces available from both cakes to satisfy the conditions: both cakes must have at least \(x\) pieces left after distribution, and the total remaining pieces after distribution must also be at least \(x\). The value \(x\) starts from the minimum of \(n\), \(a\), and \(b\) and decreases until these conditions are met or until \(x\) reaches zero. The function then outputs the determined value of \(x\
