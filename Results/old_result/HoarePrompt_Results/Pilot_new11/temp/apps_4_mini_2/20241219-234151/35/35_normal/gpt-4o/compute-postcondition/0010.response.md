The variable `low` is assigned a new value, which is `mid + 1`. Given that `mid` is established as `(low + high) // 2`, the new value of `low` will be strictly greater than its previous value. 

The conditions provided indicate that `low` was strictly less than `high`, and now it will be updated to be strictly less than or equal to `high`, maintaining the invariant.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= a + b; `low` is now equal to `mid + 1`, which is strictly less than `high`; `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2.**
