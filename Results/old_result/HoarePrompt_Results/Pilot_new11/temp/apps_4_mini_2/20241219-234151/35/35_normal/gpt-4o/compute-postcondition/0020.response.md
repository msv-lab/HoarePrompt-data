The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `a`, and `b`. The parameter `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\). The parameter `a` is a positive integer representing the number of pieces of the first cake, and `b` is a positive integer representing the number of pieces of the second cake. After executing the function body, the program returns the value of `low`, adjusted to indicate the last possible distributed value, thus returning `low - 1`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `a`, and `b`, and returns `low - 1`, where `low` is adjusted to indicate the last possible distributed value based on the distribution of `a` and `b`.**
