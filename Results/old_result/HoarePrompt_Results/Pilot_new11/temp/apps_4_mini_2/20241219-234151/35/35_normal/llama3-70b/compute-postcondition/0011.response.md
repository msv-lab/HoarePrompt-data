Since the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, it will continue to execute indefinitely unless explicitly broken out of. Therefore, there is no need to make any assumptions or adjustments to the program state in order for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`; `a` and `b` are input integers representing the number of pieces of the first and second cake, respectively, both within the range of 1 to 100; `x` is equal to min(`n`, `a`, `b`) - 1, and if `a >= x`, `b >= x`, and `(a - x + (b - x) >= x)` were true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
