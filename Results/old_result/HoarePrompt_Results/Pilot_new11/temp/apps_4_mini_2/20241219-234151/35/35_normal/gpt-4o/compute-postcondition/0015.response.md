The value of `low` is updated to be `mid + 1`. However, we must first recognize the value of `mid`. Since `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, the value of `mid` can be calculated based on the current values of `low` and `high`. After the change, `low` will be one greater than the current value of `mid`. The state of `n` remains unchanged, as it is not directly affected by this operation. 

In summary, the new value of `low` becomes `(low + high) // 2 + 1`, while `n` stays the same.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= a + b; `low` is equal to `(low + high) // 2 + 1; `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2**
