You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: It's New Year's Eve soon, so Ivan decided it's high time he started setting the table. Ivan has bought two cakes and cut them into pieces: the first cake has been cut into a pieces, and the second one — into b pieces.

Ivan knows that there will be n people at the celebration (including himself), so Ivan has set n plates for the cakes. Now he is thinking about how to distribute the cakes between the plates. Ivan wants to do it in such a way that all following conditions are met:  Each piece of each cake is put on some plate;  Each plate contains at least one piece of cake;  No plate contains pieces of both cakes. 

To make his guests happy, Ivan wants to distribute the cakes in such a way that the minimum number of pieces on the plate is maximized. Formally, Ivan wants to know the maximum possible number x such that he can distribute the cakes according to the aforementioned conditions, and each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.

Help Ivan to calculate this number x!


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers n, a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b) — the number of plates, the number of pieces of the first cake, and the number of pieces of the second cake, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible number x such that Ivan can distribute the cake in such a way that each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 2 3

Output
1

Input
4 7 10

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the first example there is only one way to distribute cakes to plates, all of them will have 1 cake on it.

In the second example you can have two plates with 3 and 4 pieces of the first cake and two plates both with 5 pieces of the second cake. Minimal number of pieces is 3.
Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, a, b):
    (low, high) = (1, min(a, b) + 1)

    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if can_distribute(mid):
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
    return low - 1

#Function 2:
def can_distribute(x):
    return a // x + b // x >= n


```
Original Assessment: To analyze the provided program, we first need to understand the two functions `func_1` and `can_distribute`.

1. **func_1(n, a, b)**: This is a binary search function that aims to find the maximum number of pieces `x` that can be distributed such that each of the `n` plates gets at least `x` pieces.
  
2. **can_distribute(x)**: This function checks if it's possible to distribute the pieces such that each plate has at least `x` pieces by calculating the total number of plates that can be filled with pieces from both cakes. It returns true if the sum of pieces that can be placed on plates from both cakes (i.e., `a // x` for the first cake and `b // x` for the second) is at least `n`.

**Problem with the code:**

The primary issue in the program arises from the way the `can_distribute` function is defined. It uses `a` and `b` directly, but these variables are not passed to it. In Python, variables defined outside of a function must be declared global if they are to be accessed inside that function. Otherwise, it will throw a `NameError` since `a` and `b` are not defined in the scope of `can_distribute`. 

Additionally, the binary search might not cover all possible edge cases regarding the constraints given in the problem description. It doesn't handle the cases when `a` or `b` is less than `n`, as certain configurations might lead to no plates being able to receive pieces.

**Test case to demonstrate the failure:**
Consider the input `n = 5`, `a = 2`, and `b = 3`. 

- The expected output should be `1`. But due to the scope issue with `a` and `b`, if we were to run the code as is, it would fail because `can_distribute` would not have access to `a` and `b`, leading to an error.

Therefore, since the program does not work correctly due to this oversight, we can determine the correctness.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
(n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(n, a, b))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= a + b, a is a positive integer representing the number of pieces of the first cake, and b is a positive integer representing the number of pieces of the second cake.
def func_1(n, a, b):
    low, high = 1, min(a, b) + 1
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        if can_distribute(mid):
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `low` is equal to `high` (which is min(a, b) + 1 if the loop exited without executing `can_distribute(mid)`), indicating the value that cannot be distributed further, while `n` remains an integer such that 2 <= n <= a + b; `mid` holds the last calculated midpoint value, depending upon the final evaluation of `can_distribute(mid)`; if the loop executed at least once and `can_distribute(mid)` returned true at least once, the last value of `low` will have been adjusted to one more than at least one of the `mid` values computed during the loop.
    return low - 1
    #The program returns the value of low which is adjusted to indicate the last possible distributed value, thus returning low - 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: an integer `n`, and two positive integers `a` and `b`, which represent the number of pieces of two cakes. It performs a binary search to determine the maximum number of pieces (`low - 1`) that can be distributed evenly, constrained by the minimum of `a` and `b`. The final return value, `low - 1`, indicates the last value that can be distributed based on the conditions checked by the `can_distribute` function. Note that the function assumes the existence of `can_distribute`, and potential edge cases involve scenarios where `a` or `b` is zero or very small, as well as cases where the distribution may not be possible at all. The function does not handle instances where `can_distribute` is either undefined or always returns False, which could lead to logic errors in a real application.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers representing the number of pieces of the first and second cake respectively, n is a positive integer representing the number of plates, and x is a positive integer such that a // x + b // x >= n.
def can_distribute(x):
    return a // x + b // x >= n
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the total number of plates that can be formed from the pieces of the first and second cake (a // x + b // x) is greater than or equal to n, indicating the successful distribution of cakes onto the plates.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `can_distribute` accepts a positive integer parameter `x` and checks if the total number of plates that can be formed from the pieces of the first cake (`a // x`) and the second cake (`b // x`) is greater than or equal to `n`, where `a` and `b` are non-negative integers, and `n` is a positive integer. The function returns a boolean value: it returns `True` if the total number of plates is sufficient to meet or exceed `n`, indicating successful cake distribution onto plates; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function does not handle cases where `x` might exceed `a` or `b`, which could lead to additional edge cases that aren't covered in the current logic.
