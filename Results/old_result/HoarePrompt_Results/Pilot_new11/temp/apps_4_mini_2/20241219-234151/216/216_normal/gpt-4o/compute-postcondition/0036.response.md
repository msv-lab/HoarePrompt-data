Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of letters in a case-sensitive manner. It calculates and prints the maximum number of unique lowercase letters found in any contiguous segment of `s` consisting solely of lowercase letters. If no lowercase letters are present in `s`, it will return 0. The function maintains a count of unique lowercase letters and resets this count whenever an uppercase letter is encountered, thus only counting segments of lowercase letters. The final output is the maximum count found across all segments processed.**
