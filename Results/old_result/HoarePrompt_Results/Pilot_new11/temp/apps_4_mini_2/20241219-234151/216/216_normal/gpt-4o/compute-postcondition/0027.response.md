Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200; `s` is a string of length `n`; `char` is the third character in `s`. If `char` is not in `current_set`, then `current_set` includes `char` and `current_count` is increased by 1. If `char` is already in `current_set`, there is no change to `current_set` or `current_count`.***
