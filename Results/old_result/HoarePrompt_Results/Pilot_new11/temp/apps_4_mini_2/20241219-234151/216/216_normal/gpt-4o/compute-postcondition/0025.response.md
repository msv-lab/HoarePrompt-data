The value of `char` is the third character in the string `s`. The code attempts to add this `char` to the `current_set`. The variable `current_set` will now include `char`, while the values of `n`, `s`, and `char` will remain unchanged after this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200; `s` is a string of length `n`; `char` is the third character in `s`, and `current_set` now includes the character `char`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200; `s` is a string of length `n`; `char` is the third character in `s`; `current_set` now includes `char`.**
