The `current_set` is cleared, which means it will be empty after executing the code. The values of `n`, `s`, `char`, and `max_count` are not directly affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200; `s` is a string of length `n`; `char` is the third character in `s`; `max_count` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `current_count`; `current_set` is empty.**
