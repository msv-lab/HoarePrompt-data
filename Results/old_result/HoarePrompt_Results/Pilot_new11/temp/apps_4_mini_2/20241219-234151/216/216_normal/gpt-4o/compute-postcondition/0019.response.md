Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200; `s` is a string of length `n`; `max_count` is 0; if `char` (the second character in `s`) is not in `current_set`, then `current_set` includes `char`, and `current_count` is 2 if `char` is a lowercase letter not in `current_set`, otherwise `current_count` is 1. If `char` is already in `current_set`, the values of `current_set` and `current_count` remain unchanged.***
