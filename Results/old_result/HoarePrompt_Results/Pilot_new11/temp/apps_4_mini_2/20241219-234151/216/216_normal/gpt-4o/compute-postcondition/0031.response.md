Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200; `s` is a string of length `n`; `char` is the third character in `s`. If `char` is a lowercase letter and not in `current_set`, then `current_set` includes `char` and `current_count` is increased by 1. If `char` is already in `current_set`, there is no change to `current_set` or `current_count`. If `char` is not a lowercase letter, then `max_count` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `current_count`; `current_set` is emptied and `current_count` is reset to 0.***
