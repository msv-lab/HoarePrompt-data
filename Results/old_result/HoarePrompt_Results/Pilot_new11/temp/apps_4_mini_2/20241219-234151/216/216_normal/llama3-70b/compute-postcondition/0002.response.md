The code creates a list called `lowercase`, which contains the indices of all lowercase letters in the string `s`. Given that `s` is an input string consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters with a length equal to `n`, the value of `lowercase` will depend on the contents of the string `s`.

Since `n` is an input integer between 1 and 200 and `s` has a length equal to `n`, the output state will reflect these conditions. The `lowercase` variable now holds a list of indices, but since we do not know the specific content of `s`, we can't provide exact indices.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`n` is an input integer between 1 and 200; `s` is an input string of length `n` consisting of lowercase and uppercase letters; `lowercase` is a list of indices of all characters in `s` that are lowercase.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 200; `s` is an input string of length `n` consisting of lowercase and uppercase letters; `lowercase` is a list of indices of all characters in `s` that are lowercase.**
