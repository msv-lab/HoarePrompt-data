The code `current_set.add(char)` adds the character `char` to the `current_set`. Initially, `current_set` is an empty set and `char` is the first character of the string `s` which is a lowercase letter and is guaranteed not to be in `current_set`. Therefore, after execution, `current_set` will contain `char` and no other variables are affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `s` is a string of length `n`, `max_count` is 0, `current_set` is {`char`}, `current_count` is 0, `char` is the first character in `s`, which is a lowercase letter**.
