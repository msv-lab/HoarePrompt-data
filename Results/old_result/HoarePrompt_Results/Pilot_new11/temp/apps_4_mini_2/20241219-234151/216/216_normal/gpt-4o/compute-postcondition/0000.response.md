The value of `n` is assigned to be equal to `int(input())`, which means `n` is now an integer based on user input. The precondition that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200 continues to be valid, as it is expected that the input will still fall within this range. The variable `s` is unaffected by this code snippet as it has not been altered.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.**
