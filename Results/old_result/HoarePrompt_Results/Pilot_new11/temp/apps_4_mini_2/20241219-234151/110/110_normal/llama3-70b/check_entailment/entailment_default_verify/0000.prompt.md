You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: While Grisha was celebrating New Year with Ded Moroz, Misha gifted Sasha a small rectangular pond of size n × m, divided into cells of size 1 × 1, inhabited by tiny evil fishes (no more than one fish per cell, otherwise they'll strife!).

The gift bundle also includes a square scoop of size r × r, designed for fishing. If the lower-left corner of the scoop-net is located at cell (x, y), all fishes inside the square (x, y)...(x + r - 1, y + r - 1) get caught. Note that the scoop-net should lie completely inside the pond when used.

Unfortunately, Sasha is not that skilled in fishing and hence throws the scoop randomly. In order to not frustrate Sasha, Misha decided to release k fishes into the empty pond in such a way that the expected value of the number of caught fishes is as high as possible. Help Misha! In other words, put k fishes in the pond into distinct cells in such a way that when the scoop-net is placed into a random position among (n - r + 1)·(m - r + 1) possible positions, the average number of caught fishes is as high as possible.


-----Input-----

The only line contains four integers n, m, r, k (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m), 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n·m, 10^5)).


-----Output-----

Print a single number — the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes.

You answer is considered correct, is its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 9}. Namely, let your answer be a, and the jury's answer be b. Your answer is considered correct, if $\frac{|a - b|}{\operatorname{max}(1,|b|)} \leq 10^{-9}$.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3 2 3

Output
2.0000000000

Input
12 17 9 40

Output
32.8333333333



-----Note-----

In the first example you can put the fishes in cells (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3). In this case, for any of four possible positions of the scoop-net (highlighted with light green), the number of fishes inside is equal to two, and so is the expected value. [Image]
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, m, r, k) = map(int, input().split())
    ans = min(k, (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1))
    print(ans / ((n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)))


```
Original Assessment: To determine if the given program correctly calculates the expected number of caught fishes as per the problem description, let’s analyze its logic.

The problem requires placing `k` fishes on an `n x m` grid such that when a square scoop of size `r x r` is placed randomly, the expected number of fishes caught is maximized. The expected number of fishes that can be caught is derived from the number of positions the scoop can occupy, which is `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`.

The program logic does two main things:
1. It calculates the number of unique positions the scoop can occupy.
2. It attempts to place `k` fishes in such a way that they fit into these scoop positions, but if `k` exceeds the number of available scoop positions, it limits the placement to the available positions.

Here’s a breakdown of the program:

1. `ans = min(k, (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1))` effectively ensures that you only consider the minimum of `k` or the total available scoop positions. This is appropriate as you cannot place more fishes than available scoop positions.

2. The expected value calculation divides the number of fishes that can be caught (`ans`) by the number of positions that scoop can take, yielding the average or expected number of fishes caught when the scoop is placed randomly.

However, let's consider edge cases:

- If `k` is greater than `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`, the code does limit `ans` correctly, but it does not correctly calculate the average expected value since averaging over positions when `k` is more than the scraping positions does not mean every position has fish. 

- When `n = 1`, `m = 1`, and `r = 1`, if there is only one cell and one fish, the expected value should be `1.0`, but due to division logic, if `k` were more than `1`, it would cap at that single cell, leading to a division issue. 

Although the program seems to handle many cases appropriately, it does not take care of the scenarios when the number of fishes exceeds the number of scoop positions properly when calculating averages which could lead to an unexpected result.

For instance, given inputs: 
```
1 1 1 1
```
The expected output should be `1.0`, as you have one fish in one position for one scoop position. But if you have more fishes than positions:
```
3 3 2 10
```
It will still output an average but has too many assumptions based on valid placements rather than distinct positions.

Therefore, considering these points and potential edge cases:

Correctness: **False**. 

This is due to the fact that the expected number of caught fishes may not be accurately conveyed when `k` is significantly larger than the available positions or when it is improperly derived at edge cases like above noted.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts four integers `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k` from user input, which must fall within specific ranges. It computes the value `ans` as the minimum between `k` and the area equivalent to a rectangle formed in a grid defined by the dimensions `(n - r + 1)` and `(m - r + 1)`. The function then outputs the result of dividing `ans` by the area `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`. If the area is zero (which can occur if `r` is equal to `n` or `m`), dividing by zero will result in an error. Therefore, the function should ideally handle cases where `n` or `m` is equal to `r` to avoid undefined behavior. The function primarily produces a floating-point output based on the computed values.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
