The code snippet adds a new element to the `heap` list, specifically a tuple created by evaluating the function `coverage(x, y)` with `x` and `y` set to 1. The `heap` will have one more element after this operation.

Now, considering the following:
- The original state of `heap` contains `m + 1` elements.
- The values of `x` and `y` are both 1.

After executing the line of code, a new element `(-coverage(1, 1), 1, 1)` is appended to `heap`. The outputs of `coverage(1, 1)` are not evaluated in terms of specific numerical results, but the structure of the heap remains valid.

The other variables `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k` are not affected by this operation, so their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `r` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `heap` contains `m + 2` elements: (-coverage(0, 0), 0, 0), ..., (-coverage(0, m-1), 0, m-1), (-coverage(1, 0), 1, 0), (-coverage(1, 1), 1, 1), and `x` is 1, `y` is 1**
