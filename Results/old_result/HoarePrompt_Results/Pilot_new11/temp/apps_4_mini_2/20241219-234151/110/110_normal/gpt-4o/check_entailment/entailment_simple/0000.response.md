To verify the correctness of the given Python program in relation to the problem description, we need to analyze if the program fulfills the requirements specified.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. We have a rectangular pond of size n × m.
2. A scoop-net of size r × r is used to catch fishes.
3. Fishes must be placed in k distinct cells such that the expected number of caught fishes is maximized.
4. We need to calculate the maximum expected number of caught fishes based on the placement of the fishes and the random positions of the scoop-net.

### Program Analysis:
- The program reads four integers n, m, r, and k.
- It defines a function `func_1` to calculate the total coverage based on the placement of fishes using a priority queue (heap).
- Inside `func_1`, all potential coordinates (x, y) for the scoop-net are considered, and the coverage (number of fishes that can be caught when the scoop is placed there) is calculated using the `coverage` function.
- The `coverage` function returns the area covered by the scoop in a way that ensures it fits within the pond boundaries.

### Key Considerations:
- The program seems to maximize the total expected number of fishes by utilizing a heap to sort and select the k positions that provide the highest coverage.
- The expected number of caught fishes is computed by summing the highest k coverage values and dividing by the total number of positions available for the scoop.
- The program checks the validity of how it calculates coverage to ensure it adheres to the constraints provided (like bounds of the scoop within the pond).

### Validation of Implementation:
1. **Read Input:** The program correctly reads the input values.
2. **Calculate Coverage:** The `coverage` function correctly accounts for placing the scoop in the pond without exceeding its boundaries.
3. **Select Highest Coverages:** The heap enables efficient retrieval of positions that maximize the coverage.
4. **Expected Value Calculation:** The expected number of caught fishes is calculated by averaging the total coverage of the selected best positions over the total possible placements of the scoop.

### Conclusion:
Given the program correctly implements the requirements stated in the problem description, and it uses appropriate logic to maximize the expected number of caught fishes, we can conclude that the program is indeed correct.

Correctness: **True**
