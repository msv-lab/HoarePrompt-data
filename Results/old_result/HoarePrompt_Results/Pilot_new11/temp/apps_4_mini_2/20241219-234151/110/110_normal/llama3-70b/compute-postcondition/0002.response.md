The variable `ans` is defined as `min(k, (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1))`. The code then prints the result of `ans` divided by the product `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`. 

The impact of the code is that it will perform the calculation of `ans / ((n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1))` for the previously defined `ans`. The value of `ans` does not change; it remains the minimum value determined earlier. The final output will be just the result of that calculation, printed to the console.

Since the variables `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k` have not changed, they remain in their original state.

Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `r` is the third input integer, `k` is the fourth input integer, `ans` is the value min(k, (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)), and the printed result is ans / ((n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1))**.
