Before executing the code, let's establish the effective changes:

1. Initially, we have `total_coverage` as `-2 * cov`.
2. The line of code `total_coverage -= cov` adjusts `total_coverage` by subtracting the value of `cov`.

Now, replacing `total_coverage` with its initial value:
- `total_coverage` becomes `-2 * cov - cov`, which simplifies to `-3 * cov`.

The other variables remain unchanged, including `n`, `m`, `r`, `k`, `heap`, `cov`, `x`, and `y`.

Given that `k` was already adjusted to be `k - 1`, as stated in the initial conditions, we update `k` now to reflect the change after executing the subtraction.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `r` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1 (now decremented by 1), `heap` contains `n * m - 7` elements, `cov` is the first element popped from the heap, `x` is the second element popped from the heap, `y` is the third element popped from the heap, `total_coverage` is equal to `-3 * cov`.**
