Output State: **The program returns the area of the scoop-net in the pond, calculated as the product of two dimensions defined by the coordinates (x, y), the size of the scoop-net (r), and the dimensions of the pond (n, m). The formula evaluates how the scoop-net fits within the pond boundaries based on these values.**
