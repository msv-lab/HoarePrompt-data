`cov`, `x`, and `y` are assigned the first three popped elements from `heap`. The values of `cov`, `x`, and `y` will be the top three elements removed from the heap, and the state of the `heap` will now contain `n * m - 4` elements (since three elements are popped). The variable `total_coverage` remains equal to `-cov`, and `k` is adjusted to be `k - 1`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `r` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer greater than 1, `heap` contains `n * m - 4` elements, `cov` is the first element popped from the heap, `x` is the second element popped from the heap, `y` is the third element popped from the heap, `total_coverage` is equal to `-cov`, `k` is adjusted to be `k - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `r` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer greater than 1, `heap` contains `n * m - 4` elements, `cov` is the first element popped from the heap, `x` is the second element popped from the heap, `y` is the third element popped from the heap, `total_coverage` is equal to `-cov`, `k` is adjusted to be `k - 1`.**
