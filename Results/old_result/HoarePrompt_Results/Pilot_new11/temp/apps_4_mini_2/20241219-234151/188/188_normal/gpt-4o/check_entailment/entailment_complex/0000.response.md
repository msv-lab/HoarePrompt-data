To assess the correctness of the provided Python program against the given problem description, we can break down the program's logic and compare it to the requirements specified in the problem.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads an integer `n`, which is guaranteed to be even and between 2 and 100, followed by `n` integers.
   - This part matches the problem description.

2. **Counting Occurrences**: 
   - The program uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each integer.
   - This aligns with the requirement as it allows tracking how many cards have the same number.

3. **Unique Numbers**:
   - The unique integers are sorted based on their frequency.
   - The program checks if there are at least two unique numbers. If not, it prints "NO".
   - This is correct as having fewer than two unique numbers makes a fair game impossible.

4. **Fair Game Check**:
   - The program checks if the two most frequent unique numbers appear exactly `n // 2` times each.
   - If both conditions are met, it prints "YES" followed by the two numbers; otherwise, it prints "NO".
   - This reflects the requirement that both players need to have an equal number of cards for the game to be fair.

### Potential Edge Cases
The program logically follows the conditions provided in the problem description:
- If there are cards with the same number (like in cases where all cards are the same), it correctly identifies it as not possible for a fair game ("NO").
- It checks the counts of the two most frequent numbers correctly.

### Conclusion

The program checks all necessary conditions to determine whether a fair game can be played with the cards. The logic implemented covers all stated requirements of the problem description by ensuring:
- It validates the uniqueness of numbers.
- It properly enforces the count condition (i.e., both players getting half the cards).

Given that the program accurately meets all the problem's requirements and handles edge cases correctly, we conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
