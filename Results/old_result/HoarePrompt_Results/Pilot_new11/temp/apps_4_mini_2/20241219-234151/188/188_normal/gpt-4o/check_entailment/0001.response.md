Correctness: **False**

The program fails to consider cases where the numbers written on the cards can form pairs of distinct integers that are each present exactly `n / 2` times. For example, consider the following input:

```
4
1
1
2
2
```

In this case, both numbers (1 and 2) appear exactly two times, making it possible for Petya to choose 1 and Vasya to choose 2, resulting in the game being fair. However, the code does not check for the scenario where two different numbers both occur `n / 2` times. It only checks if the two most common numbers occur `n / 2` times each, which isnâ€™t a sufficient condition for fairness.

Thus, it misses this fair distribution and inaccurately prints "NO" for this input, demonstrating that it does not handle all potential cases correctly per the problem description.
