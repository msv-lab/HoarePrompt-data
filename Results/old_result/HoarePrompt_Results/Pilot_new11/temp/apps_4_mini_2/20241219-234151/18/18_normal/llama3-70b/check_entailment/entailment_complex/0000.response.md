Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down the functionality based on the inputs and the expected behavior for the Mexican wave:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads three integers, `n`, `k`, and `t` from the input, which fit the problem constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k). This is correct.

2. **Logic to Determine Standing Spectators**:
   - If `t` is less than or equal to `n`, the program evaluates `min(t, k)`:
     - This means the number of spectators standing is the smaller of `t` or `k`, which is correct since, at any time `t` up to `n`, a maximum of `k` spectators can stand (the first `t` spectators stand if `t <= k`).
   - If `t` is greater than `n`, the logic used is `k - (t - n) % k`:
     - After time `n`, the spectators will start sitting down, and this formula calculates how many remain standing. The logic is correct because the `% k` operation captures the cyclical nature of the wave after reaching `n`. 
     - Specifically, as time progresses past `n`, the subsequent number of standing spectators will decrease by 1 for every complete cycle of `k` until reaching a minimum as per the Mexican wave's rules.

3. **Ensured Output**: The program prints the computed result directly. This matches the problem description, which specifies that a single integer (the number of standing spectators) should be printed based on the input time `t`.

In conclusion, the implementation adheres to the problem requirements perfectly for all possible values of `t` within the defined constraints. The computations logically align with the expected dynamics of the Mexican wave event as described. Thus, the correctness judgement holds.
