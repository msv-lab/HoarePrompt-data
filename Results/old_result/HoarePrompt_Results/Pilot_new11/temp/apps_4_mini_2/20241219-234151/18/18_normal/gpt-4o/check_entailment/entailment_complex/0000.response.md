To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the requirements from the problem statement and the logic implemented in the program.

### Problem Description Breakdown:
1. The program needs to determine the number of spectators standing at given time `t`.
2. The logic for how the spectators stand and sit is as follows:
   - From time `1` to `k`, the number of standing spectators increases linearly: `1` at `t=1`, `2` at `t=2`, ..., `k` at `t=k`.
   - From `t=k+1` to `t=n`, the number of standing spectators remains constant at `k`.
   - From `t=n+1` to `t=n+k`, the number of standing spectators decreases linearly: `k-1` at `t=n+1`, `k-2` at `t=n+2`, ..., `0` at `t=n+k`.

### Program Logic:
1. If `t <= k`, it prints `t` which is correct because that's exactly the number of spectators standing at those times.
2. If `k < t <= n`, it prints `k`, which is correct since the number of spectators standing is constant at `k` during this period.
3. If `t > n`, it prints `n + k - t`. This is meant to gradually decrease the number of standing spectators as time progresses, which is correct. The spectators decrease from `k` at `t=n` down to `0` at `t=n+k`, following the expected linear descent.

### Verification:
- For all ranges of `t`:
  - For `1 <= t <= k`, outputs `t` (correct).
  - For `k < t <= n`, outputs `k` (correct).
  - For `n < t < n+k`, computes `n + k - t`, which correctly decreases the standing count gradually.

The program handles all specified scenarios and outputs the expected results according to the problem description for all valid inputs within the defined ranges.

### Conclusion:
Since the program correctly implements the logic required to determine the number of spectators standing at any time `t` based on the rules outlined, we conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
