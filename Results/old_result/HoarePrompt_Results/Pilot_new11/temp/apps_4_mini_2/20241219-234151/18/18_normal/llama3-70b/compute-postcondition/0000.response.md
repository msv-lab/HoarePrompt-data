The code assigns the values of `n`, `k`, and `t` by taking input that is split into three integers. The previous values of `n`, `k`, and `t` are integers and must still obey the conditions given in the initial state (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k). The previous values are replaced by the new integer values entered by the user. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `k`, and `t` are integers as input from the user.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `t` are user-defined integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k**
