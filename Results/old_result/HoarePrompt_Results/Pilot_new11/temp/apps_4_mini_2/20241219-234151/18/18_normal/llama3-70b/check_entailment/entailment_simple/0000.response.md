To determine the correctness of the given program against the problem description, we must analyze how the program computes the number of standing spectators at time `t`.

### Analysis of the Program
Here's the function in detail:
```python
def func():
    n, k, t = map(int, input().split())
    print(min(t, k) if t <= n else k - (t - n) % k)
```

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - It captures three integers, `n`, `k`, and `t`, which represent:
     - `n`: Total number of spectators.
     - `k`: Maximum number of spectators that can stand simultaneously.
     - `t`: The time for which we want to determine how many spectators are standing.

2. **Logic for Calculating Standing Spectators**:
   - The program has two cases:
     - **Case 1** (`t <= n`): It calculates the minimum of `t` and `k`. This means if time `t` is less than or equal to `n`, the number of standing spectators will be equal to `t` (as up to `k` spectators can stand, which means they won't exceed `k` until time `k`). This correctly reflects the first `k` time units of the wave.
     - **Case 2** (`t > n`): It calculates `k - (t - n) % k`. This is used to determine how many spectators are standing after all spectators have stood up, and some have started sitting down. The modulo operation `(t - n) % k` helps reset the counting after the full cycle where all spectators have stood up and started to sit down. This logic effectively addresses the periodic standing and sitting of the spectators after time `n`.

### Evaluation Against the Problem Description
- The program adheres to the rules laid out in the problem description by:
  - Correctly handling the first `k` time units where the number of standing spectators increases until it reaches `k`.
  - Correctly accounting for the subsequent times beyond `n` where the wave pattern begins to repeat.

### Conclusion
The implementation of the program aligns correctly with how spectators should stand according to the stated rules. For every valid input within the given constraints, the implementation will provide the correct number of standing spectators at the specified time `t`, thus fulfilling the requirements set out in the problem description.

**Correctness: True**
