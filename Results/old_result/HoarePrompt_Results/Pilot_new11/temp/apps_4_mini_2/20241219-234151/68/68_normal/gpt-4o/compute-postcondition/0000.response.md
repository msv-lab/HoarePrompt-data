In the provided code, `x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned values using the `map(int, input().split())`, which means they will take integer values from the user's input. Since no specific values are given for `x`, `y`, and `z`, the exact values after input can be any integers within the range of 0 to 100. Hence, while their new values will be definitive, we cannot specify exact numbers without user input. 

The previous constraints remain valid as they state that `x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers within the specified bounds. Therefore, the output state reflects that `x`, `y`, and `z` now hold integer values according to the user's input.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers within the range 0 to 100 according to user input.**
