Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, `z` are integers within the range 0 to 100. If `max_upvotes` is less than `min_downvotes`, it implies that `x + z < y`, maintaining the ranges initially defined. Otherwise, if `max_downvotes` is less than `min_upvotes`, it indicates that `y + z < x`, resulting in the output being '+'. If neither condition is satisfied, a question mark is printed.***
