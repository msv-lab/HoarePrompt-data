You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Nauuo is a girl who loves writing comments.

One day, she posted a comment on Codeforces, wondering whether she would get upvotes or downvotes.

It's known that there were $x$ persons who would upvote, $y$ persons who would downvote, and there were also another $z$ persons who would vote, but you don't know whether they would upvote or downvote. Note that each of the $x+y+z$ people would vote exactly one time.

There are three different results: if there are more people upvote than downvote, the result will be "+"; if there are more people downvote than upvote, the result will be "-"; otherwise the result will be "0".

Because of the $z$ unknown persons, the result may be uncertain (i.e. there are more than one possible results). More formally, the result is uncertain if and only if there exist two different situations of how the $z$ persons vote, that the results are different in the two situations.

Tell Nauuo the result or report that the result is uncertain.


-----Input-----

The only line contains three integers $x$, $y$, $z$ ($0\le x,y,z\le100$), corresponding to the number of persons who would upvote, downvote or unknown.


-----Output-----

If there is only one possible result, print the result : "+", "-" or "0".

Otherwise, print "?" to report that the result is uncertain.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 7 0

Output
-
Input
2 0 1

Output
+
Input
1 1 0

Output
0
Input
0 0 1

Output
?


-----Note-----

In the first example, Nauuo would definitely get three upvotes and seven downvotes, so the only possible result is "-".

In the second example, no matter the person unknown downvotes or upvotes, Nauuo would get more upvotes than downvotes. So the only possible result is "+".

In the third example, Nauuo would definitely get one upvote and one downvote, so the only possible result is "0".

In the fourth example, if the only one person upvoted, the result would be "+", otherwise, the result would be "-". There are two possible results, so the result is uncertain.
Program:
```
def func():
    (x, y, z) = map(int, input().split())
    min_upvotes = x
    max_upvotes = x + z
    min_downvotes = y
    max_downvotes = y + z
    if max_upvotes < min_downvotes:
        print('-')
    elif max_downvotes < min_upvotes:
        print('+')
    else:
        print('?')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not handle the case when there are exactly equal upvotes and downvotes with the addition of unknown votes (z).

To illustrate this issue, consider the following input case:

Input:
```
2 3 2
```

Explanation of the expected outcome:
- Minimum upvotes: `min_upvotes = 2`
- Maximum upvotes: `max_upvotes = 2 + 2 = 4`
- Minimum downvotes: `min_downvotes = 3`
- Maximum downvotes: `max_downvotes = 3 + 2 = 5`

In this scenario:
- The range of possible upvotes is `[2, 4]`
- The range of possible downvotes is `[3, 5]`

Since `2 <= 3` and `4 >= 3`, there are different potential outcomes based on how the unknown votes are cast:
- If both unknown votes upvote, we have 4 upvotes and 3 downvotes ("+").
- If both unknown votes downvote, we have 2 upvotes and 5 downvotes ("-").
- If one unknown votes upvote and the other downvote, we have 3 upvotes and 4 downvotes ("-").

This results in uncertain outcomes. The program, however, would print `?`, which is correct, but it fails to handle correctly other edge cases like when x is the same as y with unknown votes which can lead to "?" but can also lead to "+" or "-" based on the values of z, thus making it overall incorrect for certain conditions.

The conditions for uncertainty need to be more precisely defined by comparing the ranges correctly. Therefore, the detection of the uncertain outcome is not fully captured in the program.

Thus, the program is deemed incorrect because it does not consistently account for scenarios that lead to multiple possible voting outcomes when z is involved.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x, y, and z are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100.
def func():
    x, y, z = map(int, input().split())
    min_upvotes = x
    max_upvotes = x + z
    min_downvotes = y
    max_downvotes = y + z
    if (max_upvotes < min_downvotes) :
        print('-')
    else :
        if (max_downvotes < min_upvotes) :
            print('+')
        else :
            print('?')
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`x`, `y`, `z` are integers within the range 0 to 100. If `max_downvotes` is less than `min_upvotes`, the output is '+'. Otherwise, a question mark has been printed.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`x`, `y`, `z` are integers within the range 0 to 100. If `max_upvotes` is less than `min_downvotes`, it implies that `x + z < y`, maintaining the ranges initially defined. Otherwise, if `max_downvotes` is less than `min_upvotes`, it indicates that `y + z < x`, resulting in the output being '+'. If neither condition is satisfied, a question mark is printed.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
