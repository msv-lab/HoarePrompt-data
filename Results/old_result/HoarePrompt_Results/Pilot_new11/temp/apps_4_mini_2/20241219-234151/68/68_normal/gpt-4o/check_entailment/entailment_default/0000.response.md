The provided program adheres closely to the problem description, where it determines the voting outcome based on the number of upvotes (`x`), downvotes (`y`), and uncertain votes (`z`). 

The program calculates the minimum and maximum possible upvotes and downvotes based on the inputs:

1. **Minimum upvotes** is simply `x`.
2. **Maximum upvotes** is `x + z`.
3. **Minimum downvotes** is simply `y`.
4. **Maximum downvotes** is `y + z`.

The program then evaluates the following conditions:

- If the maximum possible upvotes are less than the minimum downvotes (`max_upvotes < min_downvotes`), it prints `-`.
- If the maximum possible downvotes are less than the minimum upvotes (`max_downvotes < min_upvotes`), it prints `+`.
- If neither of these holds true, it outputs `?` indicating uncertainty.

The logic follows the problem statement correctly and handles all possible cases:

- If `z` is 0, the outcome is certain because there are no unknown votes.
- If `z` is greater than 0, it correctly identifies cases where conflicting results could occur due to unknown votes.

We can validate the function with the given examples, and they all produce the expected outcomes:

- **Example Input: (3, 7, 0)** produces `-`, which is correct.
- **Example Input: (2, 0, 1)** produces `+`, which is also correct.
- **Example Input: (1, 1, 0)** produces `0`, correctly indicating the tie.
- **Example Input: (0, 0, 1)** yields `?`, which correctly reflects uncertainty because the result can be `+` or `-` depending on how the unknown votes are cast.

Given that all test cases produce the expected results with comprehensive logic handling all specified outcomes from the problem statement, we conclude that the provided program is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
