Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not handle the case when there are exactly equal upvotes and downvotes with the addition of unknown votes (z).

To illustrate this issue, consider the following input case:

Input:
```
2 3 2
```

Explanation of the expected outcome:
- Minimum upvotes: `min_upvotes = 2`
- Maximum upvotes: `max_upvotes = 2 + 2 = 4`
- Minimum downvotes: `min_downvotes = 3`
- Maximum downvotes: `max_downvotes = 3 + 2 = 5`

In this scenario:
- The range of possible upvotes is `[2, 4]`
- The range of possible downvotes is `[3, 5]`

Since `2 <= 3` and `4 >= 3`, there are different potential outcomes based on how the unknown votes are cast:
- If both unknown votes upvote, we have 4 upvotes and 3 downvotes ("+").
- If both unknown votes downvote, we have 2 upvotes and 5 downvotes ("-").
- If one unknown votes upvote and the other downvote, we have 3 upvotes and 4 downvotes ("-").

This results in uncertain outcomes. The program, however, would print `?`, which is correct, but it fails to handle correctly other edge cases like when x is the same as y with unknown votes which can lead to "?" but can also lead to "+" or "-" based on the values of z, thus making it overall incorrect for certain conditions.

The conditions for uncertainty need to be more precisely defined by comparing the ranges correctly. Therefore, the detection of the uncertain outcome is not fully captured in the program.

Thus, the program is deemed incorrect because it does not consistently account for scenarios that lead to multiple possible voting outcomes when z is involved.
