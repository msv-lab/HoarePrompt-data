The code executes a `print('+')` statement, which outputs a string but does not change the values of any variables. The conditions and values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is an integer within the range 0 to 100; `y` is an integer within the range 0 to 100; `z` is an integer within the range 0 to 100; `min_upvotes` equals `x`; `max_upvotes` equals `x + z`; `min_downvotes` equals `y`; `max_downvotes` equals `y + z`; the value of `max_upvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_downvotes`; and the current value of `max_downvotes` is less than `min_upvotes`. The output is '+'**
