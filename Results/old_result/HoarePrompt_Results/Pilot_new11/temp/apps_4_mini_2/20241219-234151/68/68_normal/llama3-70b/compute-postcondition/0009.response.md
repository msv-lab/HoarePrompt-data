The code executes a print statement which outputs the string '0'. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged since the print operation does not affect any variables. Thus, the output will reflect that the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are still the same as described in the initial state.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100, `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`, `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, currently, `x` is equal to `y`, and the current value of `z` is 0. The output printed is '0'.**
