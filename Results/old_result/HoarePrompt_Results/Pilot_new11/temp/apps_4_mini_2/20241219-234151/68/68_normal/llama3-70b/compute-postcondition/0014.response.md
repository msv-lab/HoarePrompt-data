The program prints a question mark '?', which affects no variables. The constraints and conditions for `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100, and `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`. `x` is greater than or equal to `y`. `x` is not equal to `y`.**
