Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100, `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`, `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, currently, `x` is equal to `y`. If `z` is 0, the output printed is '0'. If `z` is greater than 0, the output reflects the values of `x`, `y`, and `z`, adhering to the initial conditions.***
