The function `func_2` accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, both of which are constrained by the condition that they must be at least 1 and at most 10^9. It returns the result of multiplying `a` by `b`, then dividing that product by the result of another function, `func_1`, applied to the same parameters `a` and `b`. It is assumed that `func_1(a, b)` returns a non-zero integer to avoid division by zero; however, the code does not explicitly handle the case where `func_1(a, b)` returns zero, which could lead to a runtime error. Therefore, the function may encounter an error in such a scenario, indicating that the final state of the program could be an error state if `func_1` returns zero. If `func_1` does not return zero, the function performs the multiplication and division as described and returns the resultant value.
