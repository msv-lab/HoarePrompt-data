Postcondition: ***`a` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `a` <= 10^9, `b` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `b` <= 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is equal to `abs(a - b)` which is a positive integer, `min_lcm` is equal to positive infinity (float('inf')), `min_k` is 0, and `k` is now 1. The value of `diff` is divisible by `k` (i.e., `diff % k == 0`).***
