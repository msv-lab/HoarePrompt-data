The loop you provided implements the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. After running the loop, `b` will eventually reach `0`, and `a` will contain the GCD of the original values.

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is equal to the original value of `b`; `b` is equal to `original a % original b`, which is in the range `0` to `original b - 1`.

Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `a` is equal to the original value of `b`; `b` is equal to `original a % b`, where `b` must be greater than `0`.

Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `a` is equal to the original value of `b`; `b` is equal to `original a % original b`, where `b` is still greater than `0` and original `b` must be greater than original `a`.

After the loop terminates, `b` would be `0`, indicating that the algorithm has finished and `a` contains the GCD of the original `a` and `b`. Since the loop continues until `b` becomes zero, it is guaranteed that the output state reflects the results of the algorithm.

Output State: **`b` is 0, `a` is the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`.**
