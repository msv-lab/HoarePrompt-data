To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze the implementation against the problem description and the annotations provided. 

The task requires finding a non-negative integer `k` such that the least common multiple (LCM) of `a + k` and `b + k` is minimized. If multiple values of `k` yield the same minimal LCM, the smallest `k` should be returned.

### Analysis of the Functions and Annotations:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly computes the GCD of two positive integers using the Euclidean algorithm. The implementation appears correct for its purpose.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function calculates the LCM of two numbers using the relationship `lcm(x, y) = (x * y) / gcd(x, y)`. However, as annotated, there is a potential for division by zero, but given the constraints (both `x` and `y` are positive integers), we are assured `gcd` cannot be zero in valid inputs.

3. **Function `func_3`**: This is the primary function where the finding of `k` occurs:
   - If `a` equals `b`, it immediately returns `0`, which is correct because LCM(a, b) is simply `a` (or `b` since they are equal) without any enhancement.
   - If they are not equal, the function computes the absolute difference `diff = abs(a - b)`. It then generates divisors of this difference to compute potential values of `k`.
   - The algorithm checks both `k` and `diff // k` as candidates for the minimal LCM computation, which is aligned with factoring principles.

### Concerns Identified:
- The loop is designed to iterate over divisors of `diff`. However, there are edge cases involving values that are relatively prime or where the values of `a + k` and `b + k` could yield non-integer computations or unexpected results. The algorithm primarily focuses on divisors of `diff`, assuming all candidates will yield valid minimums for `k` but does not explicitly handle all scenarios around larger differences and their candidates adequately.
- While the algorithm works well for many cases, numbers with large disparities (for example, `1, 1000000000`) might not yield minimal `k` if the function only considers divisors related to `diff`. 

### Edge Case Example:
For some pairs like `(1, 10^9)`, the function's search for divisors will yield no suitable candidates to minimize `LCM(a+k, b+k)`, potentially returning a non-ideal `k`. This can lead to cases where larger values of `k` would provide a smaller LCM than what the function might suggest.

### Conclusion:
Given the identified potential limitations—namely the lack of comprehensive handling for all potential values of `k` arising from the adjustment of both `a` and `b`—the function could indeed fail to return the correct smallest non-negative integer `k` for certain cases.

Thus, based on the above reasoning, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**
