The variable `current_lcm` is assigned the result of the function `func_2(new_a, new_b)`. The values of `new_a` and `new_b` are determined based on previous calculations involving `a`, `b`, and `candidate`. However, the specific values of `new_a`, `new_b`, and the result of `func_2` are not provided. Therefore, while we know `current_lcm` is updated based on the function call, we cannot determine its exact value.

The variables `a`, `b`, `diff`, `k`, and `candidate` remain unchanged since `current_lcm` is simply assigned a new value. 

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer; `b` is a positive integer not equal to `a`; `diff` is greater than 0; `int(math.sqrt(diff))` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`; `k` is a positive integer; `candidate` is `diff // k`; `new_a` and `new_b` are defined based on the calculations involving `a`, `b`, and `candidate`; `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b`.**
