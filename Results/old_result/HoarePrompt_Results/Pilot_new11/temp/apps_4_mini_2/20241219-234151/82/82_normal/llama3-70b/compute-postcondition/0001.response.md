The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are integers constrained to the range between 1 and 10^9. After executing the function body, it returns the result of multiplying `a` by `b` and then dividing that product by the result of another function, `func_1(a, b)`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two integers `a` and `b`, and return the value of `(a * b) / func_1(a, b)`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters a and b, and returns the result of multiplying a by b divided by the result of func_1(a, b).**
