In this code snippet, `new_b` is assigned the value of `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`. The variable `b` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive. Given that `candidate` is also a positive integer, the expression calculates the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged, as this line only affects `new_b`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm`, `min_lcm` is updated to `current_lcm`, `min_k` is updated to `candidate`, `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.**
