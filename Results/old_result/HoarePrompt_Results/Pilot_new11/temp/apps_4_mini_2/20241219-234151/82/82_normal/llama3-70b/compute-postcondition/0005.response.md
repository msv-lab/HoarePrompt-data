In this code snippet, the values of `a` and `b` are being updated simultaneously. The variable `a` takes the original value of `b`, and `b` takes the result of `a % b`. Given that `original b` is greater than `original a`, after the execution:

1. `a` will become the original value of `b`.
2. The value of `b` will become `original a % original b`.

Since `b` is greater than 0, `original a % original b` will yield a non-negative value that is less than `original b`.

Output State: **`a` is equal to the original value of `b`, `b` is equal to `original a % original b`, where `b` is still greater than 0 and original b must be greater than original a.**
