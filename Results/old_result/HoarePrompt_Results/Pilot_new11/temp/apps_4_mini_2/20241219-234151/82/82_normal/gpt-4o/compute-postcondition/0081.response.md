Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are positive integers with `a` not equal to `b`, `diff` is positive and `int(math.sqrt(diff))` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`. If `diff` is divisible by `k`, then `min_lcm` is calculated as the minimum least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b`, and `min_k` is the candidate that corresponds to this minimum least common multiple.***
