The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a` and `b`. Both parameters are integers where \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\). According to the output description, when `b` is 0, the function returns the value of `a`, which represents the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of `a` and `b`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `a` and `b` and return `a` as the GCD when `b` is zero.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, and returns `a` when `b` is 0, representing the GCD of `a` and `b`.**
