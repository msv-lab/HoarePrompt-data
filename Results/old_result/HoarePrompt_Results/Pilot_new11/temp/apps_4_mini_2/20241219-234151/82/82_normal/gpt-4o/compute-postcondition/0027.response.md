The `min_lcm` is updated to the value of `current_lcm`. The previously defined states for `current_lcm`, `min_k`, `new_a`, and `new_b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the overall conditions for the variables will be maintained, but `min_lcm` will now hold the same value as `current_lcm`. 

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `current_lcm` is updated to the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_k` is updated to `candidate`, `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`.**
