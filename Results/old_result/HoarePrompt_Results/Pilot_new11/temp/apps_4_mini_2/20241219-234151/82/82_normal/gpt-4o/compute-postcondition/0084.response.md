The function `func_3` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\). 

If `a` is equal to `b`, the function returns `0`, indicating that the current value of `a` is equal to the current value of `b`. If `a` is not equal to `b`, the function calculates the absolute difference `diff` between `a` and `b`, and returns `min_k`, which is the candidate that produced the minimum least common multiple found among the generated candidates from the divisors of `diff`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept two positive integers `a` and `b` and return `0` if they are equal, or the candidate producing the minimum least common multiple based on their absolute difference if they are not equal. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, returns `0` if `a` is equal to `b`; otherwise, it returns `min_k`, the candidate that produced the minimum least common multiple from the divisors of the absolute difference between `a` and `b`.**
