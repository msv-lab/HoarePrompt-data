The code snippet `min_k = candidate` simply assigns the value of `candidate` to the variable `min_k`. The values of the other variables `a`, `b`, `current_lcm`, `new_a`, `new_b`, and `min_lcm` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the output state needs to reflect that `min_k` is updated to `candidate`, while all other variables retain their previous conditions.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive; `current_lcm` is updated to the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`; `min_k` is equal to `candidate`; `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`; `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`; `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`.**
