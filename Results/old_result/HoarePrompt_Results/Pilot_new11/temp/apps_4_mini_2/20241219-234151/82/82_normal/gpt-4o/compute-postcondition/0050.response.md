The code assigns a new value to `new_b`, which is calculated based on the current value of `b` and `candidate`. Given that `b` is a positive integer and `candidate` is defined as `diff // k`, the value of `new_b` will also be a positive integer.

`new_b` is assigned the value of `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`. No other variables are directly affected by this line of code. 

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm`, `min_k` is updated to be equal to `candidate`, `new_a` is the next multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b` is equal to `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` is updated to `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `candidate` is `diff // k`.**
