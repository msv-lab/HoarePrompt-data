#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `b` is 0, `a` is the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`.
    return a
    #The program returns a, which is the GCD of the original values of a and b, where b is 0. The GCD of any number and 0 is the number itself, so a is returned as it is.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers, `a` and `b`, representing two numbers in the range [1, 10^9]. It computes and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. The function utilizes a loop that repeatedly assigns the values of `b` and `a % b` until `b` becomes zero. After the loop, it returns `a`, which by that point holds the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`. If either `a` or `b` is 0 (though constraints specify they are at least 1), the function would still handle it correctly since the GCD of any number and 0 is the number itself. There are no additional checks for edge cases beyond the given constraints, but the function assumes valid input as specified.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b // func_1(a, b)
    #The program returns the result of a multiplied by b divided by the result of func_1(a, b)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, both of which are constrained by the condition that they must be at least 1 and at most 10^9. It returns the result of multiplying `a` by `b`, then dividing that product by the result of another function, `func_1`, applied to the same parameters `a` and `b`. It is assumed that `func_1(a, b)` returns a non-zero integer to avoid division by zero; however, the code does not explicitly handle the case where `func_1(a, b)` returns zero, which could lead to a runtime error. Therefore, the function may encounter an error in such a scenario, indicating that the final state of the program could be an error state if `func_1` returns zero. If `func_1` does not return zero, the function performs the multiplication and division as described and returns the resultant value.
