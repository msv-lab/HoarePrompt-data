The variable `diff` is assigned the value of the absolute difference between `a` and `b`, calculated as `abs(a - b)`. Since `a` and `b` are positive integers that are not equal, the difference will always be a positive integer. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `a` <= 10^9, `b` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `b` <= 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is equal to `abs(a - b)`, which is a positive integer.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `a` <= 10^9, `b` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `b` <= 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is equal to `abs(a - b)` which is a positive integer.**
