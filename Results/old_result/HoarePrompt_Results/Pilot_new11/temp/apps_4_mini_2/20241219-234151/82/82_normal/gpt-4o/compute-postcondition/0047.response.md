Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are positive integers with `a` not equal to `b`. If `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm` or equal to `min_lcm` while `candidate` is less than `min_k`, then `min_k` is updated to be equal to `candidate`, while `new_a` is the next multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b` is equal to `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, and `current_lcm` is updated to `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.***
