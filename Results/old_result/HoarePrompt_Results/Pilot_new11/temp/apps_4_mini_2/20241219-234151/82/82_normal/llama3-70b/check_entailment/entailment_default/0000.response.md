The provided program aims to find a non-negative integer `k` such that the least common multiple (LCM) of `a + k` and `b + k` is minimized. Upon analyzing both functions and their relationships, here's the breakdown:

1. **Function Analysis:**

   - **Function `func_1(a, b)`**:
     - It computes the GCD of `a` and `b`. This functionality is crucial because the LCM can be derived from the GCD.
     - It appears to handle valid inputs well, given that `a` and `b` are both positive integers as per constraints.

   - **Function `func_2(a, b)`**:
     - It computes the LCM using the formula: `LCM(a, b) = (a * b) / GCD(a, b)`.
     - The program assumes that `func_1(a, b)` will never return zero since both `a` and `b` are always greater than or equal to 1 based on the problem constraints. However, there's a defect in error handling explicitly stated in the hint but not observed in practice, considering the provided constraints.

2. **Loop Logic in the Main Program**:
   - The loop continuously computes the LCM for incremented values of `k` until it finds a `k` that results in a non-decreasing LCM. It correctly aims to find the smallest `k` for which the LCM reaches its minimal value.
   - The output, `print(k - 1)`, seeks to return the last successful `k` which minimized the LCM.

3. **Examples Analysis**:
   - The provided examples confirm that the program is performing correctly for the inputs outlined, returning expected results such as `k = 2` for `(6, 10)`, and `k = 0` for `(5, 10)`. 
   - The program checks for lower values of `k` continuously until it starts incrementing the LCM, ensuring it finds the correct minimal `k`.

**Major Concerns**:
- The major issue seems to be the `print(k - 1)` statement which may lead to incorrect outputs if LCM remains constant at larger values for consecutive input values of k.

In conclusion, while the code seems to provide correct outputs based on provided examples, the lack of fine control in behavior when two potential minimums arise might still indicate an edge case where the increment after finding the last optimal `k` could lead to an incorrect result. This makes it potentially erroneous in scenarios where inputs could lead to such behavior.

Therefore, the code should not be trusted for every edge case and input scenario, ultimately needing refinement for strict accuracy.

Correctness: **False**.
