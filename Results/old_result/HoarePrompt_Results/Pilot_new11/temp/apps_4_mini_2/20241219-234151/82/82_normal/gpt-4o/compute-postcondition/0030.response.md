Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. `min_lcm` is the minimum least common multiple found for the candidates generated in the loop, and `min_k` is the candidate that produces this minimum least common multiple. The candidates were derived from the divisors of `diff`, specifically `k` and `diff // k`, and `diff` is the absolute difference between `a` and `b`.**
