The function accepts two positive integers, x and y, within the range of 1 to 1 billion. It calculates the product of x and y and then divides this product by the result of another function, func_1(x, y). The function ultimately returns this computed value. Note that the behavior of the function is dependent on the implementation of func_1, which is not provided, and that there are no checks for the specific value that func_1 returns (including cases where func_1(x, y) may equal zero), which could lead to a division by zero error. Therefore, while the function is designed to perform the division operation as stated, the lack of safeguards related to the output of func_1 could manifest as potential edge cases in real usage scenarios.
