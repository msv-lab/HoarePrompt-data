To analyze the impact of the code snippet given the initial state, we will consider the assignment of `current_lcm`.

The initial state is:
- `a` is a positive integer
- `b` is a positive integer with `a` not equal to `b`
- `candidate` is equal to `diff // k`
- `new_a` is the next multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`
- `new_b` is equal to `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`

The function `func_2(new_a, new_b)` returns a value that is assigned to `current_lcm`. However, since the exact value returned by `func_2` is not specified and depends on the implementation of this function, we will retain that generality.

Since only `current_lcm` is being assigned a new value, while the values of `a`, `b`, `candidate`, `new_a`, and `new_b` remain unchanged, we reflect this in the output state.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer; `b` is a positive integer with `a` not equal to `b`; `candidate` is `diff // k`; `new_a` is the next multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`; `new_b` is equal to `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`; `current_lcm` is equal to `func_2(new_a, new_b`.**
