The variable `x` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 1. The values of `n` and `cycle` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `cycle` is an empty list, and `x` is 1. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `cycle` is an empty list, `x` is 1**
