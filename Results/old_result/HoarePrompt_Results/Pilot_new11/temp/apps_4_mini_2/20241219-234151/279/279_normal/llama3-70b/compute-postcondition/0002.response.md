The code takes input and converts it into a list of integers assigned to the variable `b`. The initial state indicates that `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones with a length of `n`, and that `p` is a specific list representing a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, while `n` is within the specified range. Therefore, `b` will now contain a list derived from user input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5; `p` is a specific list of integers representing a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`; `b` is a list of integers derived from user input as a list of zeros and ones with a length of `n`.**
