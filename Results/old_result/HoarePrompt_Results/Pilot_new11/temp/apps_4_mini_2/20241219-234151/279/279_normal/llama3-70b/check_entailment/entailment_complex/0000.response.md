Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Condition for the Permutation**: The problem states that the permutation should allow every skewer to visit each of the 2n placements. However, the program is simply counting how many elements in the permutation `p` are not in their correct positions (`p[i] != i + 1`). This check does not ensure that every skewer can reach all necessary positions over time. It only checks if the permutation is in a certain order at the start, which is insufficient to determine whether the permutation is valid long-term.

2. **Handling of Sequence `b`**: The program adds to `ans` for each `b[i] == 0` without considering the fact that a `1` in `b` indicates that the corresponding skewer is reversed. The problem description requires checking both the permutations and the reversing sequence in relation to skewer movement to determine if they can achieve the goal of visiting all placements in both directions, which the provided logic does not take into account.

3. **Output Value Clarification**: The output of the program (the value of `ans`) does not accurately reflect the minimum number of changes needed to ensure that the configuration allows for revisiting placements in both directions as specified by the problem. Simply counting mismatches does not guarantee that all permutations maintain connectivity to all positions.

Given these points, the logic of the function does not suitably validate whether Pavel's desired conditions are met, leading to an inaccurate implementation of the requirements laid out in the problem description. Therefore, the conclusion is that the program is incorrect.
