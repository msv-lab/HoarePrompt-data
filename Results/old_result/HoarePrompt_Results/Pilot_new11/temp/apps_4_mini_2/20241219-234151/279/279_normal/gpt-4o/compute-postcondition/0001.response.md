The code `data = input().split()` takes the string stored in `input` and splits it into a list, with each element being a substring separated by whitespace. It does not affect the variables `n`, `p`, or `b`, but it assigns a new list to `data` based on the contents of `input`. The exact content of `data` is dependent on the string that `input` contains.

Given that `input` is a string containing all input data, after executing the code, `data` will be a list of substrings derived from that string. The values of `n`, `p`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5, `p` is a list of integers representing a valid permutation of the numbers 1 to n, `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones with length n, `data` is a list of substrings resulting from splitting the input string.**
