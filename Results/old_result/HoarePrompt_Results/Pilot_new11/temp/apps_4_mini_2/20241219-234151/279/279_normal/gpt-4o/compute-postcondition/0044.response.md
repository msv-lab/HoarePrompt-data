According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the index `i` and the positive integer `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is a positive integer. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must increase by 1, so `i` will be 2 in the next iteration. Since `n` is a positive integer and is at least 2 (therefore allowing `i` to be 2), we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 2 for the loop to continue executing. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer that must be greater than 2, `i` is 2.**
