`cycle` is a list that now appends the value of `x`. Since `cycle` was already containing the value of `x`, it will include `x` again. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State will include that `cycle` now contains two occurrences of `x`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `cycle` is a list containing two occurrences of `x`, `visited[1]` is True, `visited[x]` is True**.
