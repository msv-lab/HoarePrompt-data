Postcondition: ***`visited` is a list of n True values, `cycles` contains all unique cycles detected in the permutation defined by `p`, `n` remains unchanged as a positive integer, `no_reverse_components` is the sum of boolean conditions for all cycles in `cycles`, and the current value of `len(cycles)` is equal to 1.***
