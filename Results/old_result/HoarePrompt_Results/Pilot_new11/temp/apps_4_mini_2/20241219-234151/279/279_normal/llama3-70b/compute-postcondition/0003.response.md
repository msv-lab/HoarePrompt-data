The variable `ans` is initialized to `0`. The states of the other variables, `n`, `p`, and `b`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5; `p` is a specific list of integers representing a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`; `b` is a list of integers derived from user input as a list of zeros and ones with a length of `n`; `ans` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5; `p` is a specific list of integers representing a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`; `b` is a list of integers derived from user input as a list of zeros and ones with a length of `n`; `ans` is 0.**
