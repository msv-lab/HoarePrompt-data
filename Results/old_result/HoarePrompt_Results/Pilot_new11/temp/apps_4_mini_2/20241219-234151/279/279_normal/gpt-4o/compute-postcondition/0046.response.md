The variable `x` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 2. The initial conditions specify that `n` is a positive integer greater than 2 and `i` is 2. The state of `cycle` remains unchanged since it is an empty list and not affected by this operation. 

Thus, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `cycle` is an empty list, and `x` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `cycle` is an empty list, and `x` is 2**.
