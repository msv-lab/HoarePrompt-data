The variable `p` is assigned the value of `list(map(int, input().split()))`, where `input().split()` accepts a line of input as a string that is split into substrings, and `map(int, ...)` converts each substring into an integer. Since `p` represents a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, it will now contain a specific list of integers from 1 to `n`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5; `p` is a specific list of integers representing a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`; `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones with a length of n.**
