The code increments the value of `max_questions` by 1. The initial state does not mention the previous value of `max_questions`, but it remains greater than or equal to 1 as per the precondition. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` and `m` are greater than or equal to 1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `row` is according to the last update based on `direction`, `col` is 1, `if row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, `sergei_questions` is increased by 1, `max_questions` is increased by 1.**
