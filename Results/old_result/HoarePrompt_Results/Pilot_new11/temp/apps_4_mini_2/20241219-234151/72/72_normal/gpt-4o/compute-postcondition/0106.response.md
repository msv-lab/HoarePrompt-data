The code `max_questions += 1` increments the value of `max_questions` by 1. The values of `n`, `m`, `remaining_questions`, `col`, `row`, `x`, `y`, and `sergei_questions` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this operation.

Now, we don't have any information regarding the initial value of `max_questions`, but we know that it is affected by the increment.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are greater than or equal to 1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `col` is 2, `max_questions` is increased by 1**
