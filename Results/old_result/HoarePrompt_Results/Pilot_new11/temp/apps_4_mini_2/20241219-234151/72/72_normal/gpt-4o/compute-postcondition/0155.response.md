The code increases the value of `max_questions` by 1. Since no conditions are stated to change `max_questions`, it simply gets incremented. The states of the other variables remain unaffected, which means their previous conditions still hold.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than 1, `remaining_questions` is greater than or equal to 1, `col` is 2, and `max_questions` is incremented by 1.**
