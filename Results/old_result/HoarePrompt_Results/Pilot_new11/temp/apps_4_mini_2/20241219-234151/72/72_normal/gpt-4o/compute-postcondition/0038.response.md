Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are greater than or equal to 1. If `row` is equal to -1, then `row` is updated to `x + 3`, `col` remains equal to `y`, and `direction` is equal to 1, with all other variables (`k`, `x`, `y`, `full_cycle_length`, `full_cycles`, `min_questions`, `sergei_questions`, and `max_questions`) retaining their previously defined values. If `row` is not -1, then no changes are made to the variable values, which means that `row` remains equal to `x + direction`, `col` remains equal to `y`, and all other defined variables remain unchanged.***
