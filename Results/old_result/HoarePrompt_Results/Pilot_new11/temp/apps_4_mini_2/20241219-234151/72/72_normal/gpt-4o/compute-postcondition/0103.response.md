According to the code, the loop iterates based on the value of `col` and the range defined by `m`. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `col` must be less than `m`.

At the end of the last iteration, `col` is 1 and we know that `m` is greater than or equal to 1, which means the loop can execute again if `col` is incremented. The next value for `col` will be 2.

Thus, for the loop to be executed one more time, we need to adjust the states accordingly.

State: **`n` and `m` are greater than or equal to 1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `col` is 2**
