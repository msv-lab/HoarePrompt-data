Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, `y`, `full_cycle_length`, `full_cycles`, `min_questions` is equal to `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)`, `sergei_questions` is equal to `min_questions`, `max_questions` is equal to `(full_cycles + n - 1) // (2 * n - 2)`. The current value of `x` is either 0 or `n - 1`.***
