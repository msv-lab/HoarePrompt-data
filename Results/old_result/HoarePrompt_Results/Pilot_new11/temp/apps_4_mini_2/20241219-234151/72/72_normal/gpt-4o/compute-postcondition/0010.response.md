The expression `max_questions = (full_cycles + n - 1) // (2 * n - 2)` updates the value of `max_questions`. The previous value of `max_questions` is equal to `full_cycles`. 

Enclosed in the formula:
- `full_cycles` is already defined as `k // full_cycle_length`.
- `n` is an integer greater than 1.
- `full_cycle_length` is equal to `(2 * n - 2) * m`, leading to the denominator of the division being non-zero since `m` is an integer.
  
Now, let's calculate the new value of `max_questions` using the existing formulas:
```
new_max_questions = (full_cycles + n - 1) // (2 * n - 2)
```

The output state should reflect that `max_questions` is now updated based on the new calculation. The other variables retain their prior states. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `x` is an integer (decreased by 1), `y` is `y - 1`, `full_cycle_length` is equal to `(2 * n - 2) * m`, `full_cycles` is equal to `k // full_cycle_length`, `min_questions` is equal to `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)`, `max_questions` is equal to `(full_cycles + n - 1) // (2 * n - 2)`**.
