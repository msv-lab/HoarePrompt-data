The value of `row` is incremented by 2. Since `row` is increased by 1 prior to this code snippet, we can conclude that the new value of `row` becomes the previous value of `row` plus 3. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are greater than or equal to 1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `col` is 2, `max_questions` is decreased by 1, `row` is increased by 3.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are greater than or equal to 1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `col` is 2, `max_questions` is decreased by 1, `row` is increased by 3.**
