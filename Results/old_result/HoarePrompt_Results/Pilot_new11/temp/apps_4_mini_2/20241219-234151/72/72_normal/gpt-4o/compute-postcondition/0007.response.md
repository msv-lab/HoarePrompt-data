The variable `max_questions` is assigned the value of `full_cycles`, which is already defined as `k // full_cycle_length`. Other variables remain unaffected by this assignment.

Therefore, the updated values of the affected variables are:
- `max_questions` is now equal to `full_cycles`.

The states of the other variables are unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `x` is an integer decreased by 1, `y` is `y - 1`, `full_cycle_length` is either `(2 * n - 2) * m` if `n > 1` or `m` otherwise, `full_cycles` is `k // full_cycle_length`, `min_questions` is `full_cycles`, `max_questions` is equal to `full_cycles`.**
