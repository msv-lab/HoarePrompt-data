The statement `row -= 2` decrements the value of `row` by 2. The initial state indicates that `row` was already increased by -1 (which means it's reduced by 1). Thus, the new value of `row` will be its previous value reduced by 3 in total.

Given that `row` is decreased by 3 after executing the code, the states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are greater than or equal to 1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `col` is 1, `max_questions` is increased by 1, and `row` is decreased by 3, `direction` is -1.**
