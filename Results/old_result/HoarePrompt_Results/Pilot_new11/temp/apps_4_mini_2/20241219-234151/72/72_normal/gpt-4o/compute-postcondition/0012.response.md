The code assigns the value of `min_questions` to `sergei_questions`. Since `min_questions` was calculated based on the initial conditions, it will affect the output state. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, `y`, `full_cycle_length`, `full_cycles`, `min_questions` is equal to `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)`, and `sergei_questions` is equal to `min_questions`. `max_questions` is equal to `(full_cycles + n - 1) // (2 * n - 2)`**.
