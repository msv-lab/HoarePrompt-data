The value of `row` is decremented by 2. The other variables `n`, `m`, `remaining_questions`, `col`, and `max_questions` remain unchanged. The precondition states remain valid, but the value of `row` is updated.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than 1, `remaining_questions` is greater than or equal to 1, `col` is 2, `max_questions` is incremented by 1, `row` is decremented by 2.**
