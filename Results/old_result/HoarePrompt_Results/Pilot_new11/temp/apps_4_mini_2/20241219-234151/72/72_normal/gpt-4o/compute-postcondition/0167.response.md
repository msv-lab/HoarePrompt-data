Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `remaining_questions` is less than or equal to 0, `row` is either `x` or `x +/- 1` depending on the final `direction`, `sergei_questions` contains the total count of occurrences of `(row == x and col == y)` throughout all iterations, and `max_questions` has been adjusted based on increments and decrements reflecting all column processes (0 to m-1).**
