Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `remaining_questions` is greater than or equal to 1, `col` starts as 0 for the first iteration, `sergei_questions` is one greater than its previous value, `max_questions` is decreased by 1, `remaining_questions` will be greater than or equal to 1, `direction` is not equal to 1, and if `row` is -1, then `direction` is now 1 and `row` is either `(x + direction) + 2` or `((x + 1) + direction) + 2`.***
