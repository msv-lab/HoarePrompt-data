The value of `y` is decremented by 1. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: 
`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is a positive integer, `x` is an integer decreased by 1, and `y` is `y - 1`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is a positive integer, `x` is an integer decreased by 1, `y` is `y - 1**
