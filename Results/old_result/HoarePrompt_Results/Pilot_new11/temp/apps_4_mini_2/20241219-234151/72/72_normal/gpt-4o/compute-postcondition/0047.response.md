Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are greater than or equal to 1, and `remaining_questions` is greater than 0. If `row` equals `n`, then the `row` is updated to the old `row` value minus 3, `col` is set to 1, and if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` and `max_questions` are both increased by 1, and `direction` is set to -1.***
