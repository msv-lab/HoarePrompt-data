According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `col` relative to `m`. If `col` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `col` is 0, and both `n` and `m` are greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `col` needs to be incremented by 1, which makes it 1. Thus, the loop can execute as long as `m` is greater than 1.

State: **`n` and `m` are greater than or equal to 1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `col` is 1**
