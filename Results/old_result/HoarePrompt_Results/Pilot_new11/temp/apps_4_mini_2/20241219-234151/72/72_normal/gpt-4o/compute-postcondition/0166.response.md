Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `col` is `m - 1`, `sergei_questions` is equal to the number of occurrences of `(row == x and col == y)` throughout the iterations, `max_questions` is the final adjusted value of `max_questions` after all increments and decrements, and `row` equals either `x` or `x + 1` depending on the last iteration's direction.**
