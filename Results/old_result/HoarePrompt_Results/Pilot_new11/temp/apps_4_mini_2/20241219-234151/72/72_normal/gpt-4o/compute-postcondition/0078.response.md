The variable `direction` is assigned a new value of `-1`, which updates its previous value of `1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are greater than or equal to 1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `col` is 0, `row` is either `x + 1` or `x + 2`, `direction` is -1, `max_questions` is incremented by 1, and the current value of `row` is equal to `n`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are greater than or equal to 1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `col` is 0, `row` is either `x + 1` or `x + 2`, `direction` is -1, `max_questions` is incremented by 1, and the current value of `row` is equal to `n`.**
