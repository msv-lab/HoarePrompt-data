The value of `direction` is assigned -1, but it does not affect any other variables directly. The previous states of all other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than 1, `remaining_questions` is greater than or equal to 1, `col` is 2, `max_questions` is incremented by 1, `row` is incremented by `direction` (which means `row` will decrease by 1 since `direction` is -1).

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than 1, `remaining_questions` is greater than or equal to 1, `col` is 2, `max_questions` is incremented by 1, `row` is decremented by 1.**
