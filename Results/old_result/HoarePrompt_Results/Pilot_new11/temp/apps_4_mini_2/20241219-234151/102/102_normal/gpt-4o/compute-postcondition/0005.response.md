The value of `y` is assigned the result of the expression `(n - x * a) // b`. Given the initial states, `x` is 0, which means the expression simplifies to `(n - 0 * a) // b`, or more simply, `n // b`. Since it is provided that `(n - 0 * a) % b == 0`, we know that `n` is divisible by `b`, meaning `y` will be an integer. 

The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` still hold true after the execution, and only `y` will be computed as `n // b`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`n` is at least equal to `a`, `x` is 0, `y` is equal to `n // b`, and `(n - 0 * a) % b == 0` continues to hold true. 

Output State: **`n` is at least equal to `a`, `x` is 0, `y` is equal to `n // b`, and `(n - 0 * a) % b == 0` holds true.**
