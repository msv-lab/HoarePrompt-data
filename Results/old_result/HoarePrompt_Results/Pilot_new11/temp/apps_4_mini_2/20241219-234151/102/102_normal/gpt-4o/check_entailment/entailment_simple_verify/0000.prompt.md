You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has n burles. One bottle of Ber-Cola costs a burles and one Bars bar costs b burles. He can buy any non-negative integer number of bottles of Ber-Cola and any non-negative integer number of Bars bars.

Find out if it's possible to buy some amount of bottles of Ber-Cola and Bars bars and spend exactly n burles.

In other words, you should find two non-negative integers x and y such that Vasya can buy x bottles of Ber-Cola and y Bars bars and x·a + y·b = n or tell that it's impossible.


-----Input-----

First line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10 000 000) — amount of money, that Vasya has.

Second line contains single integer a (1 ≤ a ≤ 10 000 000) — cost of one bottle of Ber-Cola.

Third line contains single integer b (1 ≤ b ≤ 10 000 000) — cost of one Bars bar.


-----Output-----

If Vasya can't buy Bars and Ber-Cola in such a way to spend exactly n burles print «NO» (without quotes).

Otherwise in first line print «YES» (without quotes). In second line print two non-negative integers x and y — number of bottles of Ber-Cola and number of Bars bars Vasya should buy in order to spend exactly n burles, i.e. x·a + y·b = n. If there are multiple answers print any of them.

Any of numbers x and y can be equal 0.


-----Examples-----

Output
YES

Output
NO

Input

2551
2557

Output
YES
1951 1949



-----Note-----

In first example Vasya can buy two bottles of Ber-Cola and one Bars bar. He will spend exactly 2·2 + 1·3 = 7 burles.

In second example Vasya can spend exactly n burles multiple ways:   buy two bottles of Ber-Cola and five Bars bars;  buy four bottles of Ber-Cola and don't buy Bars bars;  don't buy Ber-Cola and buy 10 Bars bars. 

In third example it's impossible to but Ber-Cola and Bars bars in order to spend exactly n burles.
Program:
```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    for x in range(n // a + 1):
        if (n - x * a) % b == 0:
            y = (n - x * a) // b
            print('YES')
            print(x, y)
            return
    print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we assess whether the program can handle all edges and required cases.

The function `func_1` takes three inputs `n`, `a`, and `b`, which represent the total amount of money Vasya has and the costs of Ber-Cola and Bars respectively. The logic aims to find two non-negative integers `x` and `y` such that `x * a + y * b = n`.

1. The program iterates over possible values for `x` (the number of Ber-Cola bottles) from `0` to `n // a`.
2. For each value of `x`, it checks whether `(n - x * a) % b == 0`, which indicates if the remaining money can be evenly spent on Bars with the cost `b`.
3. If an appropriate `x` and corresponding `y` is found, it prints "YES" followed by the values of `x` and `y`.
4. If no valid pair `(x, y)` is found by the end of the loop, it prints "NO".

Now, let us consider specific test cases to validate the correctness:

### Test Case 1
Input:
```
7
2
3
```
Output:
```
YES
2 1
```
Correct, since `2 * 2 + 1 * 3 = 7`.

### Test Case 2
Input:
```
15
4
8
```
Output:
```
NO
```
Correct, since there are no non-negative integers `x`, `y` such that `4x + 8y = 15`.

### Test Case 3
Input:
```
100
25
10
```
Output:
```
YES
0 10
```
Correct, since `0 * 25 + 10 * 10 = 100`.

### Test Case 4
Input:
```
9960594
2551
2557
```
Output:
```
YES
1951 1949
```
Correct, since `1951 * 2551 + 1949 * 2557 = 9960594`.

### Edge Case
Let's consider an edge case where either `a` or `b` equals `n`.

#### Edge Case 1
Input:
```
10
10
1
```
Output:
```
YES
1 0
```
Correct, since `1 * 10 + 0 * 1 = 10`.

#### Edge Case 2
Input:
```
10
1
10
```
Output:
```
YES
0 1
```
Correct, since `0 * 1 + 1 * 10 = 10`.

### Potential Case to Consider
- When both `a` and `b` are equal to `n`, the output should still be valid.
- Both `a` and `b` being larger than `n` (e.g., `n=5, a=10, b=10`) should return "NO".

The loop checks a valid range for `x`, calculating corresponding `y` whenever necessary.

### Conclusion
The function handles all the valid scenarios effectively and finds solutions if they exist. Given the analysis, there does not appear to be a case where the program fails against the problem's description. Thus, the program is deemed correct.

Correctness: **True**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10,000,000.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    for x in range(n // a + 1):
        if (n - x * a) % b == 0:
            y = (n - x * a) // b
            print('YES')
            print(x, y)
            return
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer between 1 and 10,000,000, `b` is an input integer where 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 10,000,000, `x` is the maximum integer from 0 to `n // a`, and (n - x * a) is never divisible by `b`. If `n` is less than `a`, then `x` is 0.
    print('NO')


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
