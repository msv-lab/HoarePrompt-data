The value of `y` is assigned as `(n - x * a) // b`. Given the conditions, `n` is at least `a`, `x` is 1, and it is not the case that `(n - x * a)` is divisible by `b`, we know that `n - x * a` is a positive integer. The division of this result by `b` using floor division will yield an integer. The other variables' states remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least `a`, `x` is 1, `(n - x * a)` is positive and not divisible by `b`, and `y` is equal to `(n - a) // b`.

Output State: **`n` is at least `a`, `x` is 1, `(n - x * a)` is positive and not divisible by `b`, and `y` is equal to `(n - a) // b`.**
