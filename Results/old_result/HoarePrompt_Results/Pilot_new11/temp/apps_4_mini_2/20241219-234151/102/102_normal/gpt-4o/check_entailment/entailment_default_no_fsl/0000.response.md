Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case when either `a` or `b` is greater than `n`. For instance, if `n = 5`, `a = 10`, and `b = 10`, there are no possible non-negative integer combinations of `x` and `y` that satisfy `x * a + y * b = n`, yet the program will go through the loop based on the range derived from `n // a` (which would yield zero iterations) and incorrectly output 'NO'. 

Additionally, if `n < a` and `n < b`, it should return 'NO' immediately without iterating since neither product can yield a valid purchase. The program fails to account for these edge cases thoroughly, hence it does not follow the problem description accurately for all potential cases.
