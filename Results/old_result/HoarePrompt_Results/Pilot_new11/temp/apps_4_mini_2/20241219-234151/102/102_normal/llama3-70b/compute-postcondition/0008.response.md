The code `exit()` immediately terminates the program. No variables change their values, but the program will stop executing and not return to the calling environment. Therefore, we capture the state before execution ends, highlighting the printed output and that the program exited.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `x` is 0, `y` is equal to `n // b`, 'YES' is printed; printed values are `0`, `y`, and the program exits.**
