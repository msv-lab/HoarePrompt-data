In the given code, `b` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. This means the initial integer value of `b` (which was between 1 and 10,000,000) is now updated to the new integer provided through input. The values of `n` and `a` remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**
