Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as outlined in the problem description. Specifically, the program can fail if the calculated value of `y` (the number of Bars bars) is negative. 

Consider the edge case where `n` is smaller than both `a` and `b`. For example, if `n = 2`, `a = 3`, and `b = 4`, the program will iterate through possible values of `x` but will never find any valid (x, y) such that `x * a + y * b = n`, and thus it will print "NO". However, it does not sufficiently check whether the combination of `x` resulting in a valid non-negative `y`. 

More generally, the calculation `y = (n - x * a) // b` may yield negative values for `y` if `n` is insufficient to cover the cost of `x * a`, and an assertion that it should also check if `y` remains non-negative after calculation is absent. 

Therefore, there are scenarios where the program can incorrectly determine that it's impossible to make the exact payment, leading to incorrect results. For those reasons, the program is not correct for every potential case, which confirms that the Correctness is **False**.
