Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's the breakdown of its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads three integers: `n` (the amount of money Vasya has), `a` (the cost of one bottle of Ber-Cola), and `b` (the cost of one Bars bar) within the specified constraints (1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10,000,000), as required.

2. **Logic Implementation**:
   - The program uses a loop ranging from `0` to `n // a` to determine the possible number of bottles of Ber-Cola (`x`) that Vasya could buy without exceeding his budget.
   - For each value of `x`, it calculates the remaining budget after buying `x` bottles of Ber-Cola and checks if this remaining budget can be evenly divided by the cost of a Bars bar (`b`). This is done by the condition `(n - x * a) % b == 0`.
   - If a valid combination (`x` and `y`) is found where the remaining budget can be perfectly divided by `b`, it prints "YES" and the respective values of `x` and `y`.

3. **Output**:
   - If the function finds valid `x` and `y`, it successfully prints "YES" and the required values. If no valid pairs are found within the loop, the program prints "NO", correctly signaling that it is impossible to spend exactly `n` burles on the two items.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `n < a`. In this situation, the loop will not execute as `n // a` will be `0`, resulting in the program checking conditions with `x = 0`, which is valid.
   - Additionally, since both `a` and `b` are guaranteed to be at least `1`, the program does not encounter complications associated with zero-cost items.

5. **Assumptions and Constraints**:
   - The annotations specify that inputs are valid and within constraints, which aligns with the problem assumption and removes concerns about error handling for invalid inputs.

Overall, the program effectively checks all possible non-negative integer combinations of bottles of Ber-Cola and Bars bars that could sum to exactly `n` burles and responds correctly according to the requirements of the problem description. Thus, it meets all outlined conditions, and since it addresses all cases appropriately, the correctness of the program can be confirmed.
