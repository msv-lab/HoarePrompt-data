Given the initial state, `n` is an input integer; `a` is an input integer between 1 and 10,000,000; and `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 10,000,000.

The code snippet provided is:
```
b = int(input())
```

The effect of this code is that `b` gets assigned a new value which is the result of `int(input())`, where `input()` accepts a new integer input from the user. The previous constraints on `b`, which state that it can be any integer within the specified range, remain valid but are now defined by the new input.

However, since the new value of `b` is determined by user input, we can state that `b` is now an input integer within the range of 1 to 10,000,000.

Therefore, the Output State will acknowledge the variable updates, specifically that `b` is now equal to an input integer:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer; `a` is an input integer between 1 and 10,000,000; `b` is an input integer where 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 10,000,000.**
