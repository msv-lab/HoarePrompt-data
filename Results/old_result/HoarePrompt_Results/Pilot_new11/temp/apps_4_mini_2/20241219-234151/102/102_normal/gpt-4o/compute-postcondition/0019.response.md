The `print(x, y)` statement outputs the current values of `x` and `y`. The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged by this operation. The preconditions are still valid after the code has been executed, but the variable `y` is represented in terms of the initial state.

Since `x` is already initialized to `2`, it will be printed as `2`. The variable `y` is defined as `(n - 2 * a) // b`, and we know that it is not divisible by `b`, but its specific value is not relevant for this output. Hence, `y` will be printed as whatever value it is calculated to be based on the inputs provided.

Output State: **`n` is at least `a`, `x` is 2, `y` is equal to `(n - 2 * a) // b`, and it is not the case that `(n - 2 * a)` is divisible by `b`.**
