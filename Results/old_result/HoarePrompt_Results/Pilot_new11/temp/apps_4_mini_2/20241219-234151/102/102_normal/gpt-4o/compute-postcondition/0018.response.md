The code simply prints 'YES', which does not alter any variables or their values. Therefore, all precondition variables retain their initial state without modification.

Output State: **`n` is at least `a`, `x` is 2, `y` is equal to `(n - 2 * a) // b`, and it is not the case that `(n - 2 * a)` is divisible by `b`.**
