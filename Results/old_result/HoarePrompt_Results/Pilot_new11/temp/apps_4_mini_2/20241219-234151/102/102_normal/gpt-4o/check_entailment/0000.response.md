To verify the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we assess whether the program can handle all edges and required cases.

The function `func_1` takes three inputs `n`, `a`, and `b`, which represent the total amount of money Vasya has and the costs of Ber-Cola and Bars respectively. The logic aims to find two non-negative integers `x` and `y` such that `x * a + y * b = n`.

1. The program iterates over possible values for `x` (the number of Ber-Cola bottles) from `0` to `n // a`.
2. For each value of `x`, it checks whether `(n - x * a) % b == 0`, which indicates if the remaining money can be evenly spent on Bars with the cost `b`.
3. If an appropriate `x` and corresponding `y` is found, it prints "YES" followed by the values of `x` and `y`.
4. If no valid pair `(x, y)` is found by the end of the loop, it prints "NO".

Now, let us consider specific test cases to validate the correctness:

### Test Case 1
Input:
```
7
2
3
```
Output:
```
YES
2 1
```
Correct, since `2 * 2 + 1 * 3 = 7`.

### Test Case 2
Input:
```
15
4
8
```
Output:
```
NO
```
Correct, since there are no non-negative integers `x`, `y` such that `4x + 8y = 15`.

### Test Case 3
Input:
```
100
25
10
```
Output:
```
YES
0 10
```
Correct, since `0 * 25 + 10 * 10 = 100`.

### Test Case 4
Input:
```
9960594
2551
2557
```
Output:
```
YES
1951 1949
```
Correct, since `1951 * 2551 + 1949 * 2557 = 9960594`.

### Edge Case
Let's consider an edge case where either `a` or `b` equals `n`.

#### Edge Case 1
Input:
```
10
10
1
```
Output:
```
YES
1 0
```
Correct, since `1 * 10 + 0 * 1 = 10`.

#### Edge Case 2
Input:
```
10
1
10
```
Output:
```
YES
0 1
```
Correct, since `0 * 1 + 1 * 10 = 10`.

### Potential Case to Consider
- When both `a` and `b` are equal to `n`, the output should still be valid.
- Both `a` and `b` being larger than `n` (e.g., `n=5, a=10, b=10`) should return "NO".

The loop checks a valid range for `x`, calculating corresponding `y` whenever necessary.

### Conclusion
The function handles all the valid scenarios effectively and finds solutions if they exist. Given the analysis, there does not appear to be a case where the program fails against the problem's description. Thus, the program is deemed correct.

Correctness: **True**.
