The code snippet will print the values of `x` and `y`. 
Initially, `x` is 1, and `y` is equal to `(n - a) // b`. The output does not modify any variables but simply presents their current values. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is at least `a`, `x` is 1, `(n - x * a)` is positive and not divisible by `b`, and `y` is equal to `(n - a) // b; x is 1, y is (n - a) // b.**
