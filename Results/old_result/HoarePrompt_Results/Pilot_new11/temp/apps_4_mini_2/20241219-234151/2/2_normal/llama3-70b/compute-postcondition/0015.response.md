The code calculates the digit sum of `i`, which is currently 3. The digit sum is obtained by converting `i` to a string, iterating over each digit, converting it back to an integer, and then summing these integers. Since `i` is 3, the computation is as follows: 

- The string representation of `i` is "3".
- The digit sum is the integer value of "3", which is simply 3.

Thus, `digit_sum` is assigned the value of 3. The other variables remain unaffected, so the output state will reflect the updated value of `digit_sum`, along with the unchanged values of `max_sum`, `max_num`, `i`, and the condition on `x`.

Output State: **`max_sum` is 0, `max_num` is 0, `i` is 3, `x` must be greater than or equal to 3, and `digit_sum` is 3.**
