In this case, the `digit_sum` is assigned the value calculated from the sum of the digits of `i`. The value of `i` is `2`, which, when converted to a string, gives '2'. The sum of the digits of '2' (which is just the digit 2) is `2`. 

The impact on the program is that `digit_sum` will now hold the value `2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`max_sum` is 0, `max_num` is 0, `i` is 2, `x` must be greater than or equal to 2, `digit_sum` is 2**
