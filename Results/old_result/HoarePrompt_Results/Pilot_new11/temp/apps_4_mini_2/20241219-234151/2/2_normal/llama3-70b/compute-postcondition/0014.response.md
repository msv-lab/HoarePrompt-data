According to the code, the for loop will iterate from 1 through `x` (inclusive). Since `i` is currently 2, the loop has executed for `i = 1` and `i = 2`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to the next value, which is 3.

At the end of the last iteration, `max_sum` is 0, `max_num` is 0, `i` is 2, and `x` is greater than or equal to 2. Since `i` needs to be less than or equal to `x` for the loop to continue, and `i` will be updated to 3, itâ€™s necessary that `x` is at least 3 to allow for one more iteration.

Thus, the correct adjusted state at the next iteration's start will reflect that `i` is now 3, and `x` must be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`max_sum` is 0, `max_num` is 0, `i` is 3, and `x` must be greater than or equal to 3.**
