The variable `max_sum` is assigned the value of `digit_sum`. The previous value of `max_sum` was `0`, and the value of `digit_sum` is `3`, so after the assignment, `max_sum` will now be `3`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `max_sum` is `3`, `max_num` is `0`, `i` is `3`, `x` must be greater than or equal to `3`, and `digit_sum` is `3`. 

Output State: **`max_sum` is 3, `max_num` is 0, `i` is 3, `x` must be greater than or equal to 3, and `digit_sum` is 3.**
