The value of `a` is now a list of `n` positive integers gathered from the input. When `a.sort()` is executed, it sorts the list of integers in ascending order. Therefore, after sorting, `a` will have its elements rearranged in non-decreasing order. The value of `n` remains the same since sorting does not change the number of elements in the list.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in ascending order; `n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000.**
