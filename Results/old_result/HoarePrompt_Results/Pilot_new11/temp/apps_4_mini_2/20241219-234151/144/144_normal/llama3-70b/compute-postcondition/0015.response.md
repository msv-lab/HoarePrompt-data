Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `a` is a list of integers, `arr` contains at least 2 integers, `mex` is 2, and `num` is the next integer in `arr`. If `num` is greater than `mex`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `num` is not greater than `mex`, the program continues without altering the state related to these variables.***
