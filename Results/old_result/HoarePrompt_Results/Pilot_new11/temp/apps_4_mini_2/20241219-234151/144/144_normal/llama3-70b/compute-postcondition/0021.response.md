Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `a` is a list of integers, `arr` contains at least 2 more integers, if `num` is equal to `mex`, then `mex` is updated to 3 and `num` will be the next integer in `arr`. If `num` is greater than `mex`, then the flow continues without interruption; otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is exited with `mex` remaining as 2.***
