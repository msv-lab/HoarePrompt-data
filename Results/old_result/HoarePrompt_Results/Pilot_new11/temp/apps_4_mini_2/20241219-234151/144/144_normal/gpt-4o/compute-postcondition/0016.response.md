The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`, which is a positive integer constrained by 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000. It also accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of `n` positive integers, with each element `a[i]` constrained by 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10^9. The function does not explicitly return any value in the code provided. However, without further details on the output, we can infer that the functionality description should reflect the accepted parameters. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000) and a list a containing n positive integers where each element a[i] (1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10^9) is a positive integer.**
