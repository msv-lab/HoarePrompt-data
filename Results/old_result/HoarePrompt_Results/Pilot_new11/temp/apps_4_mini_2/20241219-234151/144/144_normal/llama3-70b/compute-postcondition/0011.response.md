Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `a` is a list of integers, `arr` contains at least 1 integer, and `mex` is 1. If the current value of `num` is equal to 2, then `mex` is incremented to 2. If `num` is not equal to `mex`, and if `num` is greater than `mex`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
