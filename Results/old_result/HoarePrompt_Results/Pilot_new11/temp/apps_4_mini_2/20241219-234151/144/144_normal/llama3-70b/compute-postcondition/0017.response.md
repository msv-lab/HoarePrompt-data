According to the code, the loop execution depends on the elements in `arr`. The loop will iterate over each integer in `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, `mex` is 2, and `num` was just set to the last element of `arr`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the following:

- If `num` is equal to 3, `mex` would be updated to 3 in that iteration, but since the loop or any if statement could exit based on the values of `num` and `mex`, we need to ensure the loop will continue the next time.
- If `num` is less than or equal to `mex`, the loop can execute again without modifying any variables. Since we are looking for the state at the start of the next iteration, we can move to `num`, which will become the next integer in `arr` on the next iteration.

To summarize the state changes:
- `n` remains the same (still a positive integer between 1 and 100000).
- `a` remains unchanged.
- `arr` still contains at least 2 integers.
- Assuming `num` will be updated to the next element in `arr` for the next iteration, it is necessary for there to be at least one more integer in `arr` than has already been processed.

Since we aren't changing `mex`, and `num` would take the next integer in `arr`, for the loop to continue at least one more integer must be available for `num`.

Thus, if `num` was the last integer in `arr`, the state cannot continue. Therefore, we should account for additional integers in `arr` for successful execution.

State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `a` is a list of integers, `arr` contains at least 2 more integers, `mex` is 2, `num` will be the next integer in `arr`**.
