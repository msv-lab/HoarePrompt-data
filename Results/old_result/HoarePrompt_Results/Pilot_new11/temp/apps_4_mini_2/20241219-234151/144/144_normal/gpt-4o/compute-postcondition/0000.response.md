The value of `n` is reassigned using `int(input())`, where `input` function will accept an integer input. Since `n` was initially in the range of positive integers (1 to 100,000), `n` will change according to the value given as input within that range. The list `a` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of n positive integers where each element `a[i]` is such that 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 10^9; `n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000**.
