Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `a` is a list of integers, `arr` is a sorted list containing integers, and `mex` is the smallest positive integer not present in `arr`. If the loop does not execute, `mex` remains 1. If the loop executes multiple times, `mex` will be incremented up to the largest consecutive integer present in `arr`, which depends on the values in `arr`.**
