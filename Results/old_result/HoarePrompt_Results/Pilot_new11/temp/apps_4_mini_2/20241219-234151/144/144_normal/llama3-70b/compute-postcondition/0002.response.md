The list `arr` is sorted in ascending order. The initial conditions state that `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, and `a` is a list of integers where each integer `a[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 10^9. The original state of `arr` is derived from input values that fit these conditions. 

After the `arr.sort()` operation, the order of elements in `arr` will change, but since the initial state does not provide specific values for `arr`, we can only say that it is now sorted in non-decreasing order.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `a` is a list of integers where each integer `a[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 10^9; `arr` is a sorted list of integers derived from input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `a` is a list of integers where each integer `a[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 10^9; `arr` is a sorted list of integers derived from input.**
