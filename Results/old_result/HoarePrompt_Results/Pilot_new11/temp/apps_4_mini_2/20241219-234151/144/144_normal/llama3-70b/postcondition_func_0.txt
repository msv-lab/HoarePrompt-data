The function takes an integer input `n`, representing the number of integers to follow, and a list of integers provided via standard input. It processes this list to determine the smallest positive integer (Minimum Excludant or MEX) that is not present in the list. After sorting the list, the function iterates through the sorted integers, incrementing a `mex` variable starting from 1 for each consecutive integer found in the list. If an integer greater than the current `mex` is encountered, the loop terminates, and the final value of `mex` is printed. The edge cases handled include the scenario where the list does not contain consecutive integers starting from 1, causing `mex` to remain 1. If `arr` includes all integers from 1 to `n`, `mex` will be `n + 1`. The function effectively determines the MEX for any valid input according to the defined constraints.
