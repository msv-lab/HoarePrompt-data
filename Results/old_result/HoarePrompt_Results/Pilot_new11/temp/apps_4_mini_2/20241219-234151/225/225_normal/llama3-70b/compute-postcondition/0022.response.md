The code assigns the value to `max_jump` based on the maximum of its current value and the result of the expression `(i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`. The variable `i` is equal to 2, but the value of `last_vowel` is not specified. Therefore, the output state will reflect the relationship involving `max_jump` and the expression.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `max_jump` is updated to max(max_jump, (2 - last_vowel) // 2 + 1)**.
