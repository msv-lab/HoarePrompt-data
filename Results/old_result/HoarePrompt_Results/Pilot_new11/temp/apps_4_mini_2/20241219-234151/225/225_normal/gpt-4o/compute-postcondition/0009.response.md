The value of `max_jump` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the result of `i - prev_pos`. The specific values of `i` is 1 and `prev_pos` is 0, so `i - prev_pos` equals 1. Thus, `max_jump` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and 1.

The state of the other variables is not altered. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `i` is 1, `prev_pos` is 0, and `max_jump` is updated to `max(max_jump, 1)`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `i` is 1, `prev_pos` is 0, `max_jump` is updated to `max(max_jump, 1)`**.
