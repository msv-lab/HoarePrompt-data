To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the function `func_1(s)` and determine if it meets the requirements stated. 

The problem description indicates that the Grasshopper can only jump on vowels, and we need to determine the minimum jump ability to overcome the string. 

Let's go through the code:

1. The function initializes a set of vowels: `vowels = {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}`.
2. It initializes `max_jump` to 1 and `prev_pos` to -1. 
3. It then iterates through each character in the string.
4. If the character is a vowel, it calculates the distance from the previous vowel position to the current one, updating `max_jump` if this distance is larger.
5. After exiting the loop, it checks the distance from the last vowel to the end of the string.
6. Finally, it returns the value of `max_jump`.

Potential edge cases to consider:
- If the string consists entirely of consonants, the Grasshopper cannot land on any vowels. This case is not explicitly handled in the code. If we input a string like "BCDFGH", the function will not update `prev_pos` because there are no vowels and will ultimately return `len(s) - (-1)`, which equals `7`, which is incorrect based on the problem description. The correct behavior would be to return a value indicating it is impossible to jump over the string.

Since the program fails in this edge case, I'll conclude:

Correctness: **False**. 

The case where the string contains no vowels demonstrates that the program does not satisfy the problem's requirements. The Grasshopper cannot make any jumps if no vowels are present in the string.
