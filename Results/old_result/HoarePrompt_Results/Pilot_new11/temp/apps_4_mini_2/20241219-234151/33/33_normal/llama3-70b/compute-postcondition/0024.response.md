The code `exit()` terminates the program execution immediately, which means no further instructions will be processed. The previous values of the variables are not modified, but we won't have any state after this point as the program stops running. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `curr_lat` is 90; `dir` is not 'South'; 'NO' has been printed and the program has exited.**
