Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50 and `n` is greater than 1; if `dir` is 'South', then if `position + t` exceeds 20000, `valid` is set to False, otherwise `position` is updated to `position + t`. If `dir` is 'West' or 'East', and if `position` is either 0 or 20000, `valid` is set to False.***
