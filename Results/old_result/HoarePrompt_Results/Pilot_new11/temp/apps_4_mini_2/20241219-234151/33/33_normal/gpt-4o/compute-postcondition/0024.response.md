Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50. If `dir` is 'North', `position` is updated to `0 - t` and `valid` is set to False. If `dir` is 'South', `position` is updated to `position + t` where the sum exceeds 20000, and `valid` is set to False. If `dir` is 'West' or 'East', then `position` is either 0 or 20000 and `valid` is set to False. If `dir` is neither 'West' nor 'East', the values of `n`, `position`, `valid`, or `t` remain unchanged.***
