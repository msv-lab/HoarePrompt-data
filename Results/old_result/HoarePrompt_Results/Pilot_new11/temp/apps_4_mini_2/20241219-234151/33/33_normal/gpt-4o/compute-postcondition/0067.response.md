The `print('NO')` statement does not change the values of any variables; it simply outputs the string 'NO'. Therefore, the states of `position`, `valid`, `n`, `t_i`, and `dir_i` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`position` is the final position after all steps and is not equal to 0, `valid` is False, `n` remains the initial input integer between 1 and 50, and `t_i` and `dir_i` are the inputs received during the iterations.**
