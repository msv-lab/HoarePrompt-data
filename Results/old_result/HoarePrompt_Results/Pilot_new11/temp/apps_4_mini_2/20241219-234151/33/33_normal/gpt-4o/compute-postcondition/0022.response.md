Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `position` is either 0 or 20000, `valid` is set to False, `t` is an input integer, and `dir` is either 'West' or 'East'. If `dir` is neither 'West' nor 'East', the program does not alter the values of `n`, `position`, `valid`, or `t'***
