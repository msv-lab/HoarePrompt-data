The variable `position` is assigned the value `0`. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and there is no information provided on the values of `t_i` and `dir_i` in the provided code snippet. Therefore, the output state reflects that `position` is now 0, while the other variables retain their previous definitions.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; each `t_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t_i` ≤ 10^6 and `dir_i` is a string that is either "North", "South", "West", or "East"; `position` is 0**.
