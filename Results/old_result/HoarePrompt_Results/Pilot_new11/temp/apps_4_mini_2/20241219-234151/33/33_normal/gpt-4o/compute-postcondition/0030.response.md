The variable `t` is assigned the value of `int(t)`, which means that `t` is converted from a string to an integer. Since `t` was previously a string, we can assume it had a valid integer representation. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is outside the scope of this operation. The output state will reflect the new integer value of `t`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50 and `n` must be greater than 1; `t` is an integer; `dir` is a string representing the second part of the input.**
