Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `t` is an integer; `dir` is a string assigned from input. If `curr_lat` is equal to -90 and `dir` is not 'North', then `curr_lat` remains unchanged, and program execution is terminated. Otherwise, if `curr_lat` is within the range of -90 to 90, the value of `curr_lat` will either be increased by `t / 111.195` if `dir` is 'North', decreased by `t / 111.195` if `dir` is 'South', or remain unchanged for other values of `dir`.***
