Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `t` is an integer; `dir` is a string assigned from input; if `curr_lat` is equal to 90 and `dir` is not 'South', then program execution is terminated with output 'NO'. If `curr_lat` is not 90 or `dir` is 'South', `curr_lat` remains unchanged or is within the range of -90 to 90, based on how variables `t` and `dir` are handled in the overall logic.***
