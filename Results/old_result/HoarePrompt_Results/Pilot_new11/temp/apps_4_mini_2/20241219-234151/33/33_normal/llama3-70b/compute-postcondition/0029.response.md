The value of `curr_lat` is increased by `t / 111.195`. The input value of `t` is unknown, but `curr_lat` will be updated accordingly. The initial conditions on `n`, `t`, and `dir` remain valid as they are not affected by the code executed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `t` is an integer; `dir` is a string assigned from input; `curr_lat` is increased by `t / 111.195`.**
