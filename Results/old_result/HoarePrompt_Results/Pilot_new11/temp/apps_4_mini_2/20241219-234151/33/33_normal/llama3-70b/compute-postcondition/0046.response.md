The value of `curr_lat` is updated by adding `t / 111.195` to it. The variable `t` is an integer converted from its input string value, and `curr_lat` remains unchanged before this operation but changes after it. Since `curr_lat` is affected, its new value is `curr_lat + t / 111.195`. The conditions on `n`, `t`, and `dir` remain valid.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `t` is an integer converted from its input string value; `dir` is a string assigned from input; `curr_lat` is updated to `curr_lat + t / 111.195`.**
