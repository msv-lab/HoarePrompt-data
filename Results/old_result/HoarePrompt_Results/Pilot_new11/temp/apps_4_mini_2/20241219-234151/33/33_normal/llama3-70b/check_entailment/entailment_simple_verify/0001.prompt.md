You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: In this problem we assume the Earth to be a completely round ball and its surface a perfect sphere. The length of the equator and any meridian is considered to be exactly 40 000 kilometers. Thus, travelling from North Pole to South Pole or vice versa takes exactly 20 000 kilometers.

Limak, a polar bear, lives on the North Pole. Close to the New Year, he helps somebody with delivering packages all around the world. Instead of coordinates of places to visit, Limak got a description how he should move, assuming that he starts from the North Pole. The description consists of n parts. In the i-th part of his journey, Limak should move t_{i} kilometers in the direction represented by a string dir_{i} that is one of: "North", "South", "West", "East".

Limak isn’t sure whether the description is valid. You must help him to check the following conditions:  If at any moment of time (before any of the instructions or while performing one of them) Limak is on the North Pole, he can move only to the South.  If at any moment of time (before any of the instructions or while performing one of them) Limak is on the South Pole, he can move only to the North.  The journey must end on the North Pole. 

Check if the above conditions are satisfied and print "YES" or "NO" on a single line.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50).

The i-th of next n lines contains an integer t_{i} and a string dir_{i} (1 ≤ t_{i} ≤ 10^6, $\operatorname{dir}_{i} \in \{\text{North, South, West, East} \}$) — the length and the direction of the i-th part of the journey, according to the description Limak got.


-----Output-----

Print "YES" if the description satisfies the three conditions, otherwise print "NO", both without the quotes.

Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    curr_lat = 90
    for _ in range(n):
        (t, dir) = input().split()
        t = int(t)
        if dir == 'North':
            curr_lat += t / 111.195
        elif dir == 'South':
            curr_lat -= t / 111.195
        else:
            continue
        if curr_lat < -90 or curr_lat > 90:
            print('NO')
            exit()
        if curr_lat == -90 and dir != 'North':
            print('NO')
            exit()
        if curr_lat == 90 and dir != 'South':
            print('NO')
            exit()
    print('YES' if curr_lat == 90 else 'NO')


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's analyze how it processes the input, adheres to the conditions outlined in the problem description, and consider potential edge cases.

### Breakdown of the Conditions:
1. If Limak is at the North Pole (90 degrees latitude), he can only move South.
2. If Limak is at the South Pole (-90 degrees latitude), he can only move North.
3. The journey must end at the North Pole (90 degrees latitude).

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Initialization:** The program starts Limak at the North Pole (curr_lat = 90).
2. **Input Loop:** For each part of the journey:
    - It reads the distance (`t`) and direction (`dir`).
    - It updates the latitude based on the direction:
        - North increases the latitude.
        - South decreases the latitude.
3. **Boundary Checks:** After each update to `curr_lat`, it checks:
    - If `curr_lat` exceeds the valid range (-90 to 90), it outputs "NO".
    - If Limak is at the North Pole and tries to move North, it outputs "NO".
    - If Limak is at the South Pole and tries to move South, it outputs "NO".
4. **Final Check:** After processing all movements, it checks if Limak ends up back at the North Pole. If he does, it outputs "YES"; if not, it outputs "NO".

### Potential Case for Failure:
Let's consider the following hypothetical journey where the program may fail to adhere to the description:

- Input:
```
3
20000 South
20000 South
30000 North
```
In this case:
1. Starting at North Pole (90 degrees), on the first command (20000 South), Limak moves to 90 - (20000 / 111.195) = approximately 80.79 degrees.
2. On the second command (20000 South), he moves to approximately 70.58 degrees.
3. Finally, on the third command (30000 North), he calculates to approximately 80.38 degrees.

However, this journey does not lead Limak back to the North Pole, even though it did not violate any of the positional restrictions. 

Given that Limak ended the journey at approximately 80.38 degrees instead of the required 90 degrees, the third condition was not fulfilled, demonstrating that the answer should be "NO".

### Conclusion:
Since we’ve identified a situation where the program could produce an incorrect result (e.g., successfully executing commands while ultimately not returning to the North Pole), we conclude:

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and for each journey part, t_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ t_i ≤ 10^6 and dir_i is one of the strings "North", "South", "West", or "East".
def func():
    n = int(input())
    curr_lat = 90
    for _ in range(n):
        t, dir = input().split()
        
        t = int(t)
        
        if dir == 'North':
            curr_lat += t / 111.195
        elif dir == 'South':
            curr_lat -= t / 111.195
        else:
            continue
        
        if curr_lat < -90 or curr_lat > 90:
            print('NO')
            exit()
        
        if curr_lat == -90 and dir != 'North':
            print('NO')
            exit()
        
        if curr_lat == 90 and dir != 'South':
            print('NO')
            exit()
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `curr_lat` is in the range of -90 to 90; if `curr_lat` is 90, then the input direction must have been 'South' at least once; if `curr_lat` is -90, the input direction must have been 'North' at least once; the program executes without termination, meaning neither 'NO' was printed during execution nor did the program exit prematurely.
    print('YES' if curr_lat == 90 else 'NO')


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
