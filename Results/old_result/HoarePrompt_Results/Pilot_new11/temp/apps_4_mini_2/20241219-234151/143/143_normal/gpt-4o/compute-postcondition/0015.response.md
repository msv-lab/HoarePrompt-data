The code updates `dp[i]` to the minimum of its current value and `dp[i - 1] * 2`. Since `i` is 3, the code updates `dp[3]`. The previous values for `dp` need to be considered. `dp[1]` was previously updated to `min(dp[1], dp[0] * 2)`, and `dp[2]` was updated to `min(dp[2], dp[1] * 2)`; therefore, we need to keep these updates in mind.

Now, we can summarize the output based on the updated values:

- The value of `dp[3]` is updated to `min(dp[3], dp[2] * 2)`, where `dp[2]` could have been updated to the minimum based on its previous value compared to `dp[1] * 2`.
- The initial conditions for `n` and `i` remain unchanged, and we include the updates for `dp[1]`, `dp[2]`, and `dp[3]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `i` is 3, `dp[1]` is updated to min(`dp[1]`, `dp[0] * 2`), `dp[2]` is updated to min(`dp[2]`, `dp[1] * 2`), and `dp[3]` is updated to min(`dp[3]`, `dp[2] * 2`)**.
