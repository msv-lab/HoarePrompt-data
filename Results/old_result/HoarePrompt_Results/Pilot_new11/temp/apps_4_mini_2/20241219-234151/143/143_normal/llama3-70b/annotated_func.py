#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, L is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9, and the costs list c contains n integers where each c[i] is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ c[i] ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    n, L = map(int, input().split())
    costs = list(map(int, input().split()))
    dp = [float('inf')] * (L + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(1, L + 1):
        for j in range(n):
            vol = 2 ** j - 1
            if vol <= i:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - vol] + costs[j])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `L` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ `L` ≤ 10^9, `costs` is a list of integers from input, `dp` is a list of integers where `dp[0]` is 0 and `dp[i]` is the minimum of all possible sums of `dp[i - (2^j - 1)] + costs[j]` for `vol` such that `vol ≤ L` and `j` ranges from 0 to `n-1`; other `dp` elements remain float('inf') if not updated.
    print(dp[L] if dp[L] != float('inf') else -1)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes input values for `n` (number of cost entries) and `L` (target volume). It then builds a dynamic programming list, `dp`, where each index represents the minimum cost to reach that volume using a defined set of volume values derived from powers of 2 (specifically, `2^j - 1` for each `j` in `0` to `n-1`). The function ultimately outputs the minimum cost to achieve exactly volume `L`, or `-1` if it is impossible to reach that volume given the costs and available entries. It is important to note that if no valid volume combination can accumulate to `L`, the output will be `-1`. Moreover, the function lacks explicit input validation for the specified ranges of `n`, `L`, and cost values, which could lead to undefined behavior if invalid inputs are supplied.
