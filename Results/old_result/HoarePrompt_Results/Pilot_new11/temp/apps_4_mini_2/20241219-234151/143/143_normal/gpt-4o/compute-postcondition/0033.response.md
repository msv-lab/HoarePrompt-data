Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30; `dp[i]` is initialized for `1 ≤ i ≤ 30`. If `L` is greater than or equal to `2^{28}`, then `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + dp[28]`, `answer` is updated to min(previous_answer, current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[29]), and `L` is decreased by 2.***
