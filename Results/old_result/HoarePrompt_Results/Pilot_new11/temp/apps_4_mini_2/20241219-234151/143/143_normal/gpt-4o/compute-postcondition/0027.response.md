After analyzing the initial state and evaluating the impact of the provided code, we can summarize the following:

1. The variable `L` is decremented by `1 << i`, where `i` is currently 29. The expression `1 << 29` is equivalent to \(2^{29}\). Therefore, we have `L = L - 2^{29}`.
2. All other variables (`n`, `dp[i]`, `answer`, `current_cost`) remain unchanged by this operation, as this specific line only affects `L`.

Given that `L` will be decreased and all other conditions remain intact, the Output State will reflect the revised value of `L` but retain the integrity of the other conditions.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30; `dp[i]` is initialized for `1 ≤ i ≤ 30`; `answer` is the minimum of its previous value and `current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[30]`; `current_cost` remains unchanged; `i` is 29; `L` is decreased by `2^{29}`.**
