#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, L is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9, and costs is a list of n integers where each integer c_i (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9) represents the cost of a bottle of type i.
def func_1(n, L, costs):
    max_cost = 10 ** 18
    dp = [max_cost] * 31
    c = costs + [max_cost] * (31 - len(costs))
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], c[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30; `i` is `n-1`; `dp[i]` is updated to min(`dp[i]`, `c[i]`) for all 0 ≤ i < n; `dp` contains the minimum values from `c` for the first `n` indices and retains the original value of 10^18 for the rest.
    for i in range(1, 31):
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] * 2)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `dp[i]` is the minimum value calculated through the loop for `1 ≤ i ≤ 30`, retaining the updated minimums based on prior values, original values for `dp[i]` for `i < n`, and `dp[i]` above `n` has retained its value or the minimum from `c` for those indices.
    answer = max_cost
    current_cost = 0
    for i in range(30, -1, -1):
        if L >= 1 << i:
            current_cost += dp[i]
            L -= 1 << i
        
        answer = min(answer, current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: When the loop is fully executed, we observe:
    #- `current_cost` is the sum of `dp[i]` for all `i` where \(2^i\) was deducted from `L`.
    #- `answer` is the minimum of its original value and the final computed `current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[0]`.
    #- `L` will reflect any deductions made during the loop.
    #
    #Therefore, the final output can be summarized as:
    #Output State:
    return answer
    #The program returns the minimum of `answer`'s original value and `current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[0]`, where `current_cost` is the sum of `dp[i]` for all `i` where \(2^i\) was deducted from `L`, and `L` reflects any deductions made during the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: `n`, a positive integer indicating the number of different bottle types; `L`, a positive integer representing the total amount available for spending; and `costs`, a list of integers detailing the cost of each bottle type. The function calculates and returns the minimum cost required to buy bottles such that the total volume of the bottles meets or exceeds `L`.

The function operates as follows:
1. It initializes a dynamic programming list, `dp`, to track the minimum cost of bottles for volumes from 0 up to 30 (with 31 indices) and fills it with a maximum cost placeholder.
2. It updates the `dp` list to reflect the minimum costs for the first `n` bottle types.
3. It then iterates through the `dp` list, updating it to account for the doubling of previous values to compute costs for additional volumes.
4. Finally, it computes the minimum cost by checking how many different volume powers of two can be used to meet the requirement `L`, updating the `current_cost` accordingly, and considers additional costs based on any remaining `L`.

The function ultimately returns the minimum value between the initially set maximum answer and a calculated total that considers how many bottles can be purchased with the provided budget based on their respective costs. Edge cases include scenarios where `L` is larger than what can be achieved with available bottle types, as well as cases where `n` could be at its minimum or maximum limits. The function ensures that the total costs remain within the bounds of available costs, and it handles situations where some bottle types may not be necessary for achieving the desired volume due to cost constraints.
