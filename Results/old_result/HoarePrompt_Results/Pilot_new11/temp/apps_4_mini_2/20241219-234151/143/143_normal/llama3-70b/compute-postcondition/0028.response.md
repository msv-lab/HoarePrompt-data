Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `L` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ `L` ≤ 10^9, `costs` is a list of integers from input, `j` is 1, and `vol` is 1. If `vol` is less than or equal to `i`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the minimum of its current value or `dp[i - 1] + costs[1]`.***
