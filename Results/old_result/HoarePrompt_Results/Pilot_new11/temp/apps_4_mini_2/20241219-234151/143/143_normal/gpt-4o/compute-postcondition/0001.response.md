`dp` is initialized as a list of size 31, and each element is assigned the value of `max_cost`. The value of `max_cost` is `10^18`. Therefore, all the elements in the `dp` list become `10^18`. Other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9, `costs` is a list of n integers where each integer c_i (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9), `max_cost` is 10^18, and `dp` is a list of 31 integers all equal to 10^18.**
