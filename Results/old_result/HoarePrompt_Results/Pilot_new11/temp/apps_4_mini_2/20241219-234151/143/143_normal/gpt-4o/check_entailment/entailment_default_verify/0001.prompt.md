You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A New Year party is not a New Year party without lemonade! As usual, you are expecting a lot of guests, and buying lemonade has already become a pleasant necessity.

Your favorite store sells lemonade in bottles of n different volumes at different costs. A single bottle of type i has volume 2^{i} - 1 liters and costs c_{i} roubles. The number of bottles of each type in the store can be considered infinite.

You want to buy at least L liters of lemonade. How many roubles do you have to spend?


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and L (1 ≤ n ≤ 30; 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9) — the number of types of bottles in the store and the required amount of lemonade in liters, respectively.

The second line contains n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_{n} (1 ≤ c_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the costs of bottles of different types.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the smallest number of roubles you have to pay in order to buy at least L liters of lemonade.

-----Note-----

In the first example you should buy one 8-liter bottle for 90 roubles and two 2-liter bottles for 30 roubles each. In total you'll get 12 liters of lemonade for just 150 roubles.

In the second example, even though you need only 3 liters, it's cheaper to buy a single 8-liter bottle for 10 roubles.

In the third example it's best to buy three 1-liter bottles for 10 roubles each, getting three liters for 30 roubles.
Program:
```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    L = int(data[1])
    costs = list(map(int, data[2:2 + n]))
    print(func_1(n, L, costs))

def func_1(n, L, costs):
    max_cost = 10 ** 18
    dp = [max_cost] * 31
    c = costs + [max_cost] * (31 - len(costs))
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], c[i])
    for i in range(1, 31):
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] * 2)
    answer = max_cost
    current_cost = 0
    for i in range(30, -1, -1):
        if L >= 1 << i:
            current_cost += dp[i]
            L -= 1 << i
        answer = min(answer, current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[i])
    return answer


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the given Python program for the specified problem description, let's analyze how the program works and whether it adheres to the requirements. 

The goal is to calculate the minimum cost required to buy at least L liters of lemonade using bottles of different types, each having a specific volume and price.

### Breakdown of the Code:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads input values `n`, `L`, and the list of costs.

2. **Data Preparation**:
   - `max_cost` is set to `10^18` to initialize the dynamic programming array.
   - A list `dp` of size 31 (for volumes from `0` to `30` liters which corresponds to `2^{i} - 1` where `i` is from 1 to 30) is initialized with `max_cost`.
   - Costs are assigned to `dp`, taking care to fill in the maximum possible costs for types that weren't provided.

3. **Dynamic Programming to Generate Minimum Costs**:
   - The program computes the minimum cost to supply different volume needs by leveraging previous computed values.

4. **Calculating the Final Answer**:
   - The program iterates in reverse through possible bottle types, checking if the required liters can be satisfied by available volumes and accumulating costs.

### Edge Cases and Corrections:

Let's analyze some edge cases to find potential errors:

- Consider the case where `L` = `1` and `n` = `1` with the cost list as `[1]`. The expected output should be `1` because we can buy one 1-liter bottle.

- What if `L` is `10^9` and we only have one type of bottle available, which can only match the required liters by purchasing an excessive number of 1-liter bottles versus more economical bottles of larger capacities?

The program's logic seems sound under typical cases and should correctly process through dynamic programming to derive the optimal solutions. 

However, the algorithm may fail in scenarios where selecting higher volume bottles directly without covering smaller unfulfilled amounts could yield a suboptimal choice due to the accumulation of costs. 

### Faulty Case Identification:
If we test the program with significantly large `L` and adequately defined costs, we may face actual costs greater than `10^18` leading to incorrect computations due to integer overflows. Given Python's handling of integers, dynamic calculations may yield incorrect results if not computed beforehand correctly.

Here is a specific problematic case:

- **Case**: `3 8` with costs `[10, 20, 50]`.

In this case, using this method, the expected behavior of using 2x (5-liter) + 1x (2-liter) should ideally yield lower costs than directly utilizing a single larger sum. 

However, through manual computation, it appears the algorithm would encourage utilization of duplicated excess sums.

### Final Judgement:
Based on careful assessment:

**Correctness: False**

The program does not consistently deliver on all scenarios, particularly configurations that demand larger sizes optimally decreasing cost totals. 

A manual review failed to surface assurance of consistent correctness across varying volumes leading toward the final purchase decisions. Specifically, there are instances where a strategic choice for a high capacity large bottle results as costly as smaller cumulative bottles which must be managed dynamically. This exploration admits that in those instances, utilizing smaller segments significantly alters the total accounted costs unexpectedly.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts three parameters: `n`, a positive integer indicating the number of different bottle types; `L`, a positive integer representing the total amount available for spending; and `costs`, a list of integers detailing the cost of each bottle type. The function calculates and returns the minimum cost required to buy bottles such that the total volume of the bottles meets or exceeds `L`.

The function operates as follows:
1. It initializes a dynamic programming list, `dp`, to track the minimum cost of bottles for volumes from 0 up to 30 (with 31 indices) and fills it with a maximum cost placeholder.
2. It updates the `dp` list to reflect the minimum costs for the first `n` bottle types.
3. It then iterates through the `dp` list, updating it to account for the doubling of previous values to compute costs for additional volumes.
4. Finally, it computes the minimum cost by checking how many different volume powers of two can be used to meet the requirement `L`, updating the `current_cost` accordingly, and considers additional costs based on any remaining `L`.

The function ultimately returns the minimum value between the initially set maximum answer and a calculated total that considers how many bottles can be purchased with the provided budget based on their respective costs. Edge cases include scenarios where `L` is larger than what can be achieved with available bottle types, as well as cases where `n` could be at its minimum or maximum limits. The function ensures that the total costs remain within the bounds of available costs, and it handles situations where some bottle types may not be necessary for achieving the desired volume due to cost constraints.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
