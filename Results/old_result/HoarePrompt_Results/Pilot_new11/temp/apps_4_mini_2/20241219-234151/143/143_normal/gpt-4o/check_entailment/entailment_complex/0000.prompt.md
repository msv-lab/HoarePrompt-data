You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: A New Year party is not a New Year party without lemonade! As usual, you are expecting a lot of guests, and buying lemonade has already become a pleasant necessity.

Your favorite store sells lemonade in bottles of n different volumes at different costs. A single bottle of type i has volume 2^{i} - 1 liters and costs c_{i} roubles. The number of bottles of each type in the store can be considered infinite.

You want to buy at least L liters of lemonade. How many roubles do you have to spend?


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and L (1 ≤ n ≤ 30; 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9) — the number of types of bottles in the store and the required amount of lemonade in liters, respectively.

The second line contains n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_{n} (1 ≤ c_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the costs of bottles of different types.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the smallest number of roubles you have to pay in order to buy at least L liters of lemonade.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 12
20 30 70 90

Output
150

Input
4 3
10000 1000 100 10

Output
10

Input
4 3
10 100 1000 10000

Output
30

Input
5 787787787
123456789 234567890 345678901 456789012 987654321

Output
44981600785557577



-----Note-----

In the first example you should buy one 8-liter bottle for 90 roubles and two 2-liter bottles for 30 roubles each. In total you'll get 12 liters of lemonade for just 150 roubles.

In the second example, even though you need only 3 liters, it's cheaper to buy a single 8-liter bottle for 10 roubles.

In the third example it's best to buy three 1-liter bottles for 10 roubles each, getting three liters for 30 roubles.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    L = int(data[1])
    costs = list(map(int, data[2:2 + n]))
    print(func_1(n, L, costs))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, L is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9, and costs is a list of n integers where each integer c_i (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9) represents the cost of a bottle of type i.
def func_1(n, L, costs):
    max_cost = 10 ** 18
    dp = [max_cost] * 31
    c = costs + [max_cost] * (31 - len(costs))
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], c[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30; `i` is `n-1`; `dp[i]` is updated to min(`dp[i]`, `c[i]`) for all 0 ≤ i < n; `dp` contains the minimum values from `c` for the first `n` indices and retains the original value of 10^18 for the rest.
    for i in range(1, 31):
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] * 2)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `dp[i]` is the minimum value calculated through the loop for `1 ≤ i ≤ 30`, retaining the updated minimums based on prior values, original values for `dp[i]` for `i < n`, and `dp[i]` above `n` has retained its value or the minimum from `c` for those indices.
    answer = max_cost
    current_cost = 0
    for i in range(30, -1, -1):
        if L >= 1 << i:
            current_cost += dp[i]
            L -= 1 << i
        
        answer = min(answer, current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: When the loop is fully executed, we observe:
    #- `current_cost` is the sum of `dp[i]` for all `i` where \(2^i\) was deducted from `L`.
    #- `answer` is the minimum of its original value and the final computed `current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[0]`.
    #- `L` will reflect any deductions made during the loop.
    #
    #Therefore, the final output can be summarized as:
    #Output State:
    return answer
    #The program returns the minimum of `answer`'s original value and `current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[0]`, where `current_cost` is the sum of `dp[i]` for all `i` where \(2^i\) was deducted from `L`, and `L` reflects any deductions made during the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: `n`, a positive integer indicating the number of different bottle types; `L`, a positive integer representing the total amount available for spending; and `costs`, a list of integers detailing the cost of each bottle type. The function calculates and returns the minimum cost required to buy bottles such that the total volume of the bottles meets or exceeds `L`.

The function operates as follows:
1. It initializes a dynamic programming list, `dp`, to track the minimum cost of bottles for volumes from 0 up to 30 (with 31 indices) and fills it with a maximum cost placeholder.
2. It updates the `dp` list to reflect the minimum costs for the first `n` bottle types.
3. It then iterates through the `dp` list, updating it to account for the doubling of previous values to compute costs for additional volumes.
4. Finally, it computes the minimum cost by checking how many different volume powers of two can be used to meet the requirement `L`, updating the `current_cost` accordingly, and considers additional costs based on any remaining `L`.

The function ultimately returns the minimum value between the initially set maximum answer and a calculated total that considers how many bottles can be purchased with the provided budget based on their respective costs. Edge cases include scenarios where `L` is larger than what can be achieved with available bottle types, as well as cases where `n` could be at its minimum or maximum limits. The function ensures that the total costs remain within the bounds of available costs, and it handles situations where some bottle types may not be necessary for achieving the desired volume due to cost constraints.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
