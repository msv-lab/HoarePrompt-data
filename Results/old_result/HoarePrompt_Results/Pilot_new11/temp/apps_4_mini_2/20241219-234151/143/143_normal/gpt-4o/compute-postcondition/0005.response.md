According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, which means the loop has executed once for `i = 0`. Since `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. This means `i` will be 1 for the next iteration.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must remain greater than 1 because `i` will be 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 < `n` ≤ 30, `i` is 1**
