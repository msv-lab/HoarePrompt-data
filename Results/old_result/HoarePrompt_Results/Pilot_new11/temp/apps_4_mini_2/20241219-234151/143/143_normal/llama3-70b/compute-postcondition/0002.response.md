The code initializes the variable `dp` as a list containing `L + 1` elements, all set to `float('inf')`. The initial states of `n`, `L`, and `costs` remain unchanged. The only variable affected is `dp`, which now holds a list of dimensions based on the value of `L`.

Output State: **`n` is now an input integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 30; `L` is now an input integer within the range 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9; `costs` is now a list of integers from input; `dp` is a list of integers with `L + 1` elements, all set to `float('inf')`.**
