The variable `L` is decreased by `1 << i`, which is equal to 2 raised to the power of `i`. Since `i` is 28, this means `L` is updated as `L -= 2**28`. The precondition states that `L` should not be less than 0 after this operation, but specific values for `L` have not been provided. The states of `n`, `dp`, `current_cost`, `answer`, and the last updated values are retained.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30; `dp[i]` is initialized for `1 ≤ i ≤ 30; current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + dp[28]`; `i` is 28; `answer` is updated to min(previous_answer, current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[29]); `L` is decreased by 2**28.**
