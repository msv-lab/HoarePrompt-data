Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30; `dp[i]` is initialized for `1 ≤ i ≤ 30`; `answer` is the minimum of its previous value and `current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[30]`; `current_cost` remains unchanged; `i` is 29; if `L` is greater than or equal to `2^{29}`, then `L` is decreased by `2^{29}`.***
