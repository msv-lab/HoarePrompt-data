Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic used to compute how many bottles to buy based on the required liters `L` has crucial shortcomings.

1. The program assumes that doubling the previously considered costs will cover all necessary volumes. However, there are cases where the required volume `L` cannot be effectively achieved by simply doubling smaller volumes. The computations do not adequately account for scenarios where using smaller bottles as a combination becomes more optimal than strictly the larger available bottles.

2. The current implementation may lead to scenarios where it chooses a more expensive combination of bottles without considering all potential combinations (especially with smaller bottles that could be purchased multiple times). 

For example, consider the following case:
Input:
```
4 5
10 20 30 40
```
A potential optimal decision would be to buy five 1-liter bottles for 10 roubles each (totaling 50 roubles). However, the program may not evaluate this correctly, depending on the logic of `current_cost` and `dp` update rules. 

Additionally, the program may fail to correctly compute costs when `L` is relatively small compared to the volumes of available bottles and their costs, opting instead for a more inefficient strategy.

3. The function does not adequately differentiate scenarios where a combination of smaller and larger bottles can yield a lesser cost, often leading to inflated total costs.

Thus, due to these failures to correctly compute the minimum costs in certain situations, the program is determined to be incorrect.
