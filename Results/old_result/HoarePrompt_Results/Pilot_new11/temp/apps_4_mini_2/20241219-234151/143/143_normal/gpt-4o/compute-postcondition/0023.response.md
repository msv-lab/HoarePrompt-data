Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `dp[i]` is initialized for `1 ≤ i ≤ 30`, `answer` is equal to `max_cost`, and `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + dp[30]` if `L` is greater than or equal to \(2^{30}\). Additionally, `i` remains 30, and `L` is decreased by \(2^{30}\) after the operation.***
