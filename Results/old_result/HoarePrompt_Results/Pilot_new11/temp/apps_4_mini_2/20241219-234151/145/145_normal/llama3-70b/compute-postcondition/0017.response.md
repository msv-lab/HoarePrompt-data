Postcondition: ***`ticket` is a string of digits with a length between 2 and 100, `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket` and is an even number, `target_sum` is equal to `total_sum // 2`. If `curr_sum` equals `target_sum`, then `segments` is updated to `segments + 1` and `curr_sum` is reset to 0.***
