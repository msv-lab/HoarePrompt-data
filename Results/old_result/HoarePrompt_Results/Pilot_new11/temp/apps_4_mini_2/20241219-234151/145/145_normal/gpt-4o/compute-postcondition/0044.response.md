Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `ticket` is a string of exactly `n` digits. After all iterations of the loop, `current_sum` is equal to 0 if `current_sum` was reset to 0 at least once during the iterations, indicating that `segment_count` is the total number of segments whose sum equals `target_sum`. If `current_sum` was not equal to `target_sum` at the end of the loop, it could be any accumulated value from the remaining digits processed. `segment_count` represents the total number of segments whose sum equals `target_sum`, and `segment_length` remains 2. The final value of `i` will be `n-1`.**
