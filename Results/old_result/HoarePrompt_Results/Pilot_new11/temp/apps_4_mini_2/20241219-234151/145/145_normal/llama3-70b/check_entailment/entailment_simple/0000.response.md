Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly implements the requirement stated in the problem description for determining if a ticket is lucky based on the provided digits. Here is the validation of the program against the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n`, which represents the number of digits and then reads the digits which are stored in a list named `ticket`. This aligns perfectly with the problem description which stipulates that the input will consist of a number of digits between 2 and 100.

2. **Checking the Total Sum**: The program calculates the total sum of the digits in the list. If the sum is odd, it immediately returns `False`, since an odd sum cannot be split into two segments with equal sum. This follows the logic that if the total sum is not even, a division into equal segments is impossible.

3. **Defining Target Sum and Iterating through Digits**: The target sum is calculated as half of the total sum, and the program initializes `curr_sum` to accumulate segment sums as it iterates through the digits. It checks whether the current segment's sum matches the target sum, and if it does, it resets `curr_sum` and increments the segment count (`segments`).

4. **Final Evaluation**: After iterating through all digits, the function checks whether at least two segments that meet the target sum were found (i.e., `segments >= 2`). If so, it returns `True`, which means that the ticket can be considered lucky.

5. **Output**: The main program evaluates the result of `func_1` and prints "YES" if it's lucky, or "NO" otherwise.

With the above evaluations, all scenarios that can arise from the problem description — both valid and edge cases — are appropriately handled by the program. It ensures that the function meets the requirement of being able to determine if the ticket can be split into two valid segments with equal sums.

Overall, every step in the program serves to fulfil the problem's requirements, demonstrating that it works correctly for any valid input as specified. Thus, the correctness of the program is affirmed.
