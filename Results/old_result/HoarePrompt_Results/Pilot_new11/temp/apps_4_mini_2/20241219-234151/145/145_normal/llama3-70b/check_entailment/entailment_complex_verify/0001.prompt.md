You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Recently Vasya found a golden ticket — a sequence which consists of $n$ digits $a_1a_2\dots a_n$. Vasya considers a ticket to be lucky if it can be divided into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums. For example, ticket $350178$ is lucky since it can be divided into three segments $350$, $17$ and $8$: $3+5+0=1+7=8$. Note that each digit of sequence should belong to exactly one segment.

Help Vasya! Tell him if the golden ticket he found is lucky or not.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 100$) — the number of digits in the ticket.

The second line contains $n$ digits $a_1 a_2 \dots a_n$ ($0 \le a_i \le 9$) — the golden ticket. Digits are printed without spaces.


-----Output-----

If the golden ticket is lucky then print "YES", otherwise print "NO" (both case insensitive).


-----Examples-----
Input
5
73452

Output
YES

Input
4
1248

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example the ticket can be divided into $7$, $34$ and $52$: $7=3+4=5+2$.

In the second example it is impossible to divide ticket into segments with equal sum.
Program:
```
n = int(input())
ticket = list(map(int, input()))
if func_1(ticket):
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')

def func_1(ticket):
    total_sum = sum(ticket)
    if total_sum % 2 != 0:
        return False
    target_sum = total_sum // 2
    curr_sum = 0
    segments = 0
    for digit in ticket:
        curr_sum += digit
        if curr_sum == target_sum:
            segments += 1
            curr_sum = 0
    return segments >= 2


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, I will analyze its logic in the context of the problem description, which requires determining if a sequence of digits can be divided into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums.

1. The program first calculates the total sum of the digits.
2. If the total sum is odd, it cannot be split into equal integer segments, and the program immediately returns "NO".
3. If the total sum is even, it calculates the target sum, which is half of the total sum.
4. The program then iterates through the digits, maintaining a cumulative sum (`curr_sum`). Each time this cumulative sum matches the target sum, it increments a `segments` counter and resets `curr_sum`.
5. Finally, the program checks if at least 2 segments were found before concluding with "YES" or "NO".

Next, I will assess potential cases that the code might not handle correctly:

### Potential Problematic Case:
- Consider the input:
  ```
  5
  00000
  ```
  Here, even though the total sum is 0 (even) and can theoretically have an infinite number of segments each equal to 0, the program will only find one segment (the entire sequence of zeros), and hence it will return "NO". According to the problem, it should be possible to form two segments from zeros, making the ticket lucky. 

This indicates that the program fails for this input case because it does not recognize that zeros can be segmented.

### Conclusion:
The program does not adhere to the problem description in all potential cases due to the mentioned edge case where it cannot discern the scenario with multiple zeros.

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
n = int(input())
ticket = list(map(int, input()))
if func_1(ticket):
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: ticket is a string of digits with a length n, where 2 <= n <= 100 and each digit is between 0 and 9 inclusive.
def func_1(ticket):
    total_sum = sum(ticket)
    if (total_sum % 2 != 0) :
        return False
        #The program returns False because total_sum, which is the sum of the digits in 'ticket', is odd.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`ticket` is a string of digits with a length `n`, where `2 <= n <= 100`, and each digit is between `0` and `9`; `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket`, and `total_sum` is an even number.
    target_sum = total_sum // 2
    curr_sum = 0
    segments = 0
    for digit in ticket:
        curr_sum += digit
        
        if curr_sum == target_sum:
            segments += 1
            curr_sum = 0
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `ticket` is a string of digits with a length between 2 and 100, `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket` and is an even number, `target_sum` is equal to `total_sum // 2`, `curr_sum` is 0, and `segments` is the number of segments in `ticket` such that the sum of the digits within each segment equals `target_sum`.
    return segments >= 2
    #The program returns True if the number of segments in 'ticket' with a sum of digits equal to 'target_sum' is greater than or equal to 2; otherwise, it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `ticket` composed exclusively of digits with a length between 2 and 100. It calculates the sum of the digits in `ticket`. If this sum is odd, the function immediately returns False. If the sum is even, it checks for the existence of segments within the `ticket` string where the sum of the digits in each segment is equal to half of the total sum. The function counts how many such segments are formed, and it returns True if at least two segments are found; otherwise, it returns False. Notably, the function assumes that all characters in `ticket` are numerical digits and does not explicitly handle non-digit characters or empty strings, leading to assumptions about input validity.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
