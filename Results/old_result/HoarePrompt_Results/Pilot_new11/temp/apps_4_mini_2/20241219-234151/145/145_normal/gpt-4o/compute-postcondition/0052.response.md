According to the code, the loop executes `n` times, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 100. This means that the loop will start with `i` initialized to 0 and will iterate until `i` is less than `n`. Before the loop begins, certain variables are already defined, but we need to identify their initial states and any necessary conditions for `i`.

At the start of the loop:
- The loop variable `i` starts at 0.
- `n` should be at least 2 (which it is, as per the state definition).

There are no other constraints that would prevent the loop from executing, given the provided state. However, we should note the initial conditions of other relevant variables (`current_sum`, `segment_count`, `segment_length`, and `target_sum`), but they primarily affect the loop body and not whether the loop itself executes.

Thus, the states that need to be confirmed before the loop can execute include:

1. `i` must start from 0.
2. `n` is between 2 and 100 as per initial conditions.

Since there are no modifications needed to the state for execution conditions, the final state showing the readiness for the loop to execute is as follows:

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `ticket` is a string of exactly `n` digits, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 0, `segment_length` remains 2, `target_sum` is equal to `segment_sum(0, 1), i is 0`**
