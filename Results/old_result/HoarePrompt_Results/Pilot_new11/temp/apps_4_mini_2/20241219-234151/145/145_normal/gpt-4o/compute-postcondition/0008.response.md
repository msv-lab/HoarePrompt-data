The value of `segment_count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `segment_count` was 0 and thus the new value will be 1. The values of all other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100; `ticket` is a string of exactly `n` digits; `segment_length` is 1; `target_sum` is equal to the integer value of the first digit of `ticket`; `current_sum` is 0; `segment_count` is 1; `i` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100; `ticket` is a string of exactly `n` digits; `segment_length` is 1; `target_sum` is equal to the integer value of the first digit of `ticket`; `current_sum` is 0; `segment_count` is 1; `i` is 0.**
