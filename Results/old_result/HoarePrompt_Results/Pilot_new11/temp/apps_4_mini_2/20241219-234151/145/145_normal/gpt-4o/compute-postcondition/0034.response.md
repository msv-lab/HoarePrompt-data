According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the integer `n`. When the loop begins, `i` is incremented by 1 each iteration until it reaches `n`. Currently, `i` is 0, and since `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be increased to 1. 

Therefore, the states must be adjusted as follows:

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, so for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` must be 1. The other variables remain unchanged since they are not affected by the loop execution.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `ticket` is a string of exactly `n` digits, `current_sum` equals `target_sum` set to 0, `segment_count` is 1, `segment_length` remains 2, `target_sum` is the sum of the first two digits of `ticket`, `i` is 1**
