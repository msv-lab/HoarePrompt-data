The variable `current_sum` is assigned the value `0`, overriding its previous value which was `int(ticket[1])`. All other variables retain their previous states. Therefore, the Output State, reflecting the updated values and valid information from the initial state, is as follows:

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `ticket` is a string of exactly `n` digits, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is updated to 1, `segment_length` remains 2, `target_sum` equals to `segment_sum(0,1)`, `i` is 1**.
