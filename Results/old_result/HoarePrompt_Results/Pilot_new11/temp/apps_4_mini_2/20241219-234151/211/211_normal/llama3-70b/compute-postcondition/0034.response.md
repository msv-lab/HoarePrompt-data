Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `a` is a list of `n` integers, and `prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[0]` is 0 and `prefix_sum[k]` is equal to the sum of the first `k` elements of `a` for `1 ≤ k ≤ n`. If `prefix_sum[n]` is 0, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, `k` counts valid indices where `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, `l` is the last valid index `r`, and `r` equals `n`. The `prefix_sum` reflects the calculated sums of the elements of `a`.***
