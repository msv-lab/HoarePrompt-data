The code `prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + a[i]` updates the `prefix_sum` array at the index `i + 1` with the value of `prefix_sum[i]` plus the element `a[i]`. Given that `i` is currently 2, this translates to `prefix_sum[3] = prefix_sum[2] + a[2]`.

From the initial state:
- `prefix_sum[2]` is equal to `a[0] + a[1]`
- `a[i]` is equal to `a[2]` since `i` is 2.

Thus, the updated value of `prefix_sum[3]` will be:
- `prefix_sum[3] = (a[0] + a[1]) + a[2]`, which simplifies to `prefix_sum[3] = a[0] + a[1] + a[2]`.

Since `n` remains unchanged and still falls within the range of 1 to 100, we sum up the valid information after the execution.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum[0]` is 0, `prefix_sum[1]` is equal to `a[0]`, `prefix_sum[2]` is equal to `a[0] + a[1]`, `prefix_sum[3]` is equal to `a[0] + a[1] + a[2]`, `i` is 2**.
