According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop will keep iterating as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and since `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, the loop can execute again for `i` equal to 1. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1. The variable `n` remains unchanged and still needs to be a positive integer.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[0]` is 0 and `prefix_sum[1]` is equal to `a[0]`, `i` is 1**
