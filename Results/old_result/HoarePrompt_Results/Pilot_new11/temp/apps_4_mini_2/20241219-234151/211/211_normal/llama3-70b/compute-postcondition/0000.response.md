The value of `n` is assigned the result of `int(input())`, which accepts an input and converts it to an integer. The nature of `n` is known to be a positive integer within the specified range (1 to 100), but its exact value is based on user input. The list `A` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and A is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies -1000 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000; `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())` which is an input positive integer**.
