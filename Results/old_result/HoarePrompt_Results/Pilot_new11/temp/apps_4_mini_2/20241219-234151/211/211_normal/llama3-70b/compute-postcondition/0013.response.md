The code executes a print statement, which outputs the string 'YES' to the output. Since the print function does not alter any variables or affect any previous states, the initial conditions remain unchanged aside from the action of printing. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[0]` is 0 and `prefix_sum[k]` is equal to the sum of the first `k` elements of `a` for `1 ≤ k ≤ n`, `i` is `n - 1`, and the sum of all elements in `a` is not equal to 0. 'YES' has been printed.**
