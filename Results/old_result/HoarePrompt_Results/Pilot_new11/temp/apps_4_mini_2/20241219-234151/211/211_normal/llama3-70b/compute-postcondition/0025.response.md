After executing the code `l = r`, the variable `l` is assigned the value of `r`, which is 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum[0]` is 0, `prefix_sum[k]` represents the sum of the first `k` elements of `a` for `1 ≤ k ≤ n`, the sum of all elements in `a` is not equal to 0, 'YES' has been printed, `k` is 3, `l` is 2, `r` is 2; the output is (3, 2, 2).

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum[0]` is 0, `prefix_sum[k]` represents the sum of the first `k` elements of `a` for `1 ≤ k ≤ n`, the sum of all elements in `a` is not equal to 0, 'YES' has been printed, `k` is 3, `l` is 2, `r` is 2; the output is (3, 2, 2).**
