To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we consider the code provided and the structure of the variables.

The loop iterates over a range defined by `n`, which is a positive integer. During each iteration, the current index `i` is used to update the `prefix_sum` list, such that each position `i + 1` in `prefix_sum` contains the sum of the first `i + 1` elements from the list `a`.

After all iterations of the loop complete (which occur from `i = 0` to `i = n - 1`), the following results will be true:

- `prefix_sum[0]` will remain 0 because it was initialized that way.
- For every index `k` from 1 to `n`, `prefix_sum[k]` will contain the sum of the first `k` elements of `a`, which follows from our looping logic.
- At the end of the loop, `i` will be equal to `n - 1`, as it iterates from 0 up to (but not including) `n`.

Considering these points, the final output state after all iterations will express the state of the variables as follows:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[0]` is 0 and `prefix_sum[k]` is equal to the sum of the first `k` elements of `a` for `1 ≤ k ≤ n`, and `i` is `n - 1`.**
