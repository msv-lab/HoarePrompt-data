The variable `total_sum` is assigned the value of the sum of all integers in the list `A`. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it still represents the length of the list `A`. The previous value of `total_sum` is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is a list of integers where each integer satisfies -1000 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000; `n` is equal to the length of the list `A`; `total_sum` is equal to the sum of the elements in `A`.

Output State: **`A` is a list of integers where each integer satisfies -1000 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000; `n` is equal to the length of the list `A`; `total_sum` is equal to `sum(A)`.**
