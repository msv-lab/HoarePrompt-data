The `print('YES')` statement outputs the string 'YES' to the console, but it does not change any of the variables in the program. The values of `A`, `n`, and `total_sum` remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects that the string 'YES' has been printed, but the variable states themselves are unaffected.

Output State: **`A` is a list of integers where each integer satisfies -1000 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000; `n` is equal to the length of the list `A`; `total_sum` is equal to `sum(A)`; the current value of `total_sum` is not equal to 0; 'YES' has been printed.**
