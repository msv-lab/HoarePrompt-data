The code `break` does not change the values of any of the variables, but it causes the program to exit the most internal loop or conditional statement it is currently in. Since it is indicated that 'YES' and '2' have been printed, it is likely that the program is in a context where these statements were executed before the `break`. Therefore, after executing the `break` statement, the output state reflects that we have exited from that loop or conditional structure.

Output State: **`A` is a list of integers, `n` must be greater than 1, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 1, 'YES' has been printed, '2' has been printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
