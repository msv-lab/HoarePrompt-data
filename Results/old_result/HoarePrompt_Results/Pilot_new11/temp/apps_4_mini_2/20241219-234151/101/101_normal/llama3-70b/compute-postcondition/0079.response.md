The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables or return any new values. It simply skips the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of all variables remain unchanged, and we maintain the condition that `j` must be less than `m`.

Output State: **`n, m, i, j is m, min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y` remain unchanged; `j` must be less than `m`.**
