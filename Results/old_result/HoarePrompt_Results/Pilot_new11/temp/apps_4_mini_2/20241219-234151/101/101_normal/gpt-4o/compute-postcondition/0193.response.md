Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 2000, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `screen` is a list of strings, and `result` is a modified list of lists of characters. If `i` is equal to `top`, `bottom`, or `j` is equal to `left`, or `j` is equal to `right`, then if `result[i][j]` is '.', it is set to '+', otherwise, the state of `result` remains unchanged. The indices are constrained by `i` being equal to `bottom + 1`, `top` being less than or equal to `bottom + 1`, and `left` being less than or equal to `right`.***
