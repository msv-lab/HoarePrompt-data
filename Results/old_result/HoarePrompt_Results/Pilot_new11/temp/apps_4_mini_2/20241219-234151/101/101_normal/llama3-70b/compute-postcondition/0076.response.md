Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` remain unchanged. If `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or (j == max_y))` and `pixels[2][0]` is '.', then `pixels[2][0]` is updated to '+'. If `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, `pixels[2][0]` remains '.' while the other variables remain unchanged.***
