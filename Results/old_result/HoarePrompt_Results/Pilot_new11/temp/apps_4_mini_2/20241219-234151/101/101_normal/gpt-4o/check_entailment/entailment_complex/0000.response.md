To determine the correctness of the annotated program based on the provided problem description, let's analyze the requirements specified in the problem and how the program implements those requirements.

### Problem Requirements:
1. The program must identify a square frame of white pixels ('w') that has a width of 1 pixel (the frame formed by '+' characters).
2. The frame must not go beyond the borders of the monitor.
3. All white pixels must be located on the frame.
4. Among all potential frames that satisfy the above conditions, the program must find the smallest one.
5. If no frame exists that can be formed around the white pixels, the program should return -1.

### Program Analysis:
- The program starts by reading the resolution of the monitor (n, m) and the state of the screen into a list of strings.
- It then enters the function `func_1` which:
  - Initializes variables to keep track of the boundaries (top, bottom, left, right) of white ('w') pixels.
  - Iterates through the screen to find the minimum and maximum indices of 'w' characters, establishing the bounding box.
  - If there are no 'w' characters, it returns -1 (this satisfies the requirement to check for presence of 'w').
  - If the height or width of the bounding box is less than 2, it also returns -1 (which satisfies the requirement for a frame of width 1 pixel).
  - If a valid bounding box is found with height and width both at least 2, it creates a new 2D list `result` and replaces the pixels on the border of the bounding box with '+' characters, while preserving the 'w' characters.

### Correctness Validation:
1. The program properly identifies the bounding box around the 'w' characters.
2. It checks if this bounding box can form a proper square frame (i.e., its height and width are both at least 2) and returns -1 if it cannot.
3. It modifies the result array correctly by replacing the border pixels of the bounding box with '+' where they are originally '.'.
4. Finally, it returns the result array or -1 when appropriate.

### Edge Cases Considered:
- The program handles cases where only one row or one column of 'w' exists, as it checks for the minimum height and width conditions before attempting to form a frame.
- If the bounding box precisely contains 'w' pixels, it returns these positions with '+' as requested by the problem.
  
### Conclusion:
The annotated program adheres to the requirements laid out in the problem description and covers all necessary edge cases. Thus, it produces expected results for all inputs as specified.

Correctness: **True**
