Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000; `screen` is a list of strings; `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged; `frame_height` is equal to `bottom - top + 1`, and `frame_width` is equal to `right - left + 1`; the current value of `frame_height` is less than 2 or the current value of `frame_width` is less than 2.***
