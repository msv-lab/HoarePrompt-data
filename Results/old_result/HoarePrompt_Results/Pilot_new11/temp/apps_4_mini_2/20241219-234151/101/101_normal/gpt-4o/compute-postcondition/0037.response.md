The line of code `left = right = j` assigns the value of `j` to both `left` and `right`. Since `left` is previously equal to 1, it will now be set to the value of `j`, and `right` will also be set to the same value. The states of `n`, `m`, `screen`, `top`, and `bottom` are not affected. 

Therefore, if `j` is defined and has a value, both `left` and `right` will take that value. The final conditions depend on the value of `j`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000; `screen` is a list of strings; `top` is equal to `i`; `bottom` is equal to `i`; `left` is equal to `j`; `right` is equal to `j`.**
