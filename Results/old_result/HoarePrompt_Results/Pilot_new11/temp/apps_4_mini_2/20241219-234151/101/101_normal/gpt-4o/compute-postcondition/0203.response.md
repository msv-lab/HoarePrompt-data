Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 2000, `screen` is a list of strings, and `result` is a modified list of lists of characters. All entries in `result` that correspond to the indices where `i` is equal to `top` or `bottom`, or `j` is equal to `left` or `right`, which were originally '.', are now updated to '+'. The `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` indices remain unchanged within their specified bounds, and any original entries in `result` not affected by this update remain unchanged.**
