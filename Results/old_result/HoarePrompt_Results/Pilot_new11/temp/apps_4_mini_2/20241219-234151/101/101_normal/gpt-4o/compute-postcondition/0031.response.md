`right` is assigned the value of `j`, which is 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged, including `n`, `m`, `screen`, `i`, `bottom`, and `left`. The conditions regarding `top` do not change the value as the code only assigns a value to `right` without affecting the others.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000; `screen` is a list of strings; `i` is 0; `j` is 1; `bottom` is 0; `left` is 1; `right` is 1; if `j` is less than `left`, then `top` remains unchanged because `i` is not greater than `bottom`. If `i` is less than `top`, then `top` is updated to 0.**
