To determine the adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the current values of `i` and `j` as well as the range of `m`.

Given that `j` is the loop variable in the `for` loop and it iterates through the range defined by `m`, the important points are:

- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0.
- The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `m`.

Since `j` is currently 0, in order for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the next value of `j` will be 1. 

The loop will run with `j` equal to 1 as long as it is still less than `m`. 

Thus, to summarize the adjustments required:

- Increment `j` by 1, changing it from 0 to 1.
- The conditions regarding `n`, `m`, `white_pixels`, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` remain unchanged.

State: **`n` and `m` are integers in the range [1, 2000], `i` is still 0, `j` is 1, while preserving the conditions on `white_pixels`, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` unchanged.**
