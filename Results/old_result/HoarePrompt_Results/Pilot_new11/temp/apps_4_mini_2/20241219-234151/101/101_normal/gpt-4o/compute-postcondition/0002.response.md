According to the code, the loop executes over the range of `m`. Given that `m` is an integer between 1 and 2000 (inclusive), the loop can execute as long as `m` is at least 1. The state of `i`, which is set to 0, does not affect the execution of the loop. At the end of the last iteration, `j` will represent the index of the last execution, which will be `m - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `m` must be at least 1, and `j` starts at 0.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, `screen` is a list of strings, `i` is 0, `j` is 0**
