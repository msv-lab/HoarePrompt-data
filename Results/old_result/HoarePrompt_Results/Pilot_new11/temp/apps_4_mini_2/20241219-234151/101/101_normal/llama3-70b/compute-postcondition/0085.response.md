The `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the rest of its body and proceed to the next iteration. It does not modify any variables or change any conditions of the variables defined in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `i`, `j` is `j_last + 1`, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` must be such that `m` is greater than `j_last + 1`**
