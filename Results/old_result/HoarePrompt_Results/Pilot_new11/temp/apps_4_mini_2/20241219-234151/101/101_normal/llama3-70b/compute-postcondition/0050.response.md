The value of `pixels[i][j]` is updated to `'.'`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. The specific updates are:

- `pixels[i][j]` is now `'.'`.

Since no other variables are affected, the remaining conditions about `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, and the boundaries stay the same.

Output State: **`n` is unchanged, `m` is unchanged, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, the boundaries defined by `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` are unchanged, the indices `i` and `j` are not equal to any boundary values, `pixels[i][j]` is '.'**
