Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, and `screen` is a list of strings. If `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `bottom` is updated to `i`, while `top`, `left`, `right`, and `j` remain unchanged. If `i` is less than or equal to `bottom`, then `bottom` remains unchanged, while `top`, `left`, `right`, and `j` remain unchanged.***
