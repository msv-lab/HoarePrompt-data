Postcondition: ***`n` must be at least `n`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `screen` is a list of strings, `top` equals `n`, `bottom` is the maximum row index, `left` is the minimum column index, `right` is the maximum column index, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is 0, the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w', and if `i` is less than `top`, the current value of `i` remains less than `top`.***
