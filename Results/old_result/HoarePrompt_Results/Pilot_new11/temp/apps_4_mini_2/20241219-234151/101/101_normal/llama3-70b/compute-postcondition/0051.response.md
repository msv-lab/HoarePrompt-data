Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` remain unchanged, and the indices `i` and `j` retain their values of 1 and 0 respectively, alongside the unchanged boundaries defined by `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y`. If `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', the program state is unchanged. Otherwise, `pixels[i][j]` is set to '.' while retaining the previously stated conditions.***
