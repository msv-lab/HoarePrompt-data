The `print(-1)` statement outputs the value `-1`, but it does not change the values of any variables. Thus, all the variables remain unchanged in their previous values as stated in the initial conditions.

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range [1, 2000]; `m` is an integer in the range [1, 2000]; `white_pixels` must contain at least one tuple of (x, y); `min_x` is the minimum x-coordinate of all tuples in `white_pixels`; `min_y` is the minimum y-coordinate of all tuples in `white_pixels`; `max_x` is the maximum x-coordinate of all tuples in `white_pixels`; `max_y` is the maximum y-coordinate of all tuples in `white_pixels`; the current value of `frame_size` (which is equal to `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`) is greater than the maximum of `n` and `m`; -1 has been printed.**
