Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers in the range [1, 2000]. If `pixels[0][1]` is '+', then the conditions on `white_pixels`, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` remain unchanged. Otherwise, if `pixels[0][1]` is 'w', the same conditions persist. If `pixels[0][1]` is '.', then `n` and `m` still remain integers in the range [1, 2000], with `i` as 0, `j` as 1, and the conditions on `white_pixels`, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` also remain unchanged.***
