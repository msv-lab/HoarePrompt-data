The code assigns the value of `i` to both `top` and `bottom`. Given that `i` is `i_end + 1`, we can say that both `top` and `bottom` will be equal to `i_end + 1`. Consequently, the previous values of `top` and `bottom`, which were `None`, are now replaced by this new integer value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, `screen` is a list of strings, `top` is `i_end + 1`, `bottom` is `i_end + 1`, `left` remains out of bounds, `right` remains out of bounds, `i` is `i_end + 1`, `j` is 0, the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w'.**
