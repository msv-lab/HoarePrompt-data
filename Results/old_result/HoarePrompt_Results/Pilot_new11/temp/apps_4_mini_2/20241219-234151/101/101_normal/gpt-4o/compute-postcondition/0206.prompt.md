You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000, and screen is a list of strings, each string consisting of exactly m characters where each character is either '.' (indicating a black pixel) or 'w' (indicating a white pixel).
def func_1(n, m, screen):
    top = bottom = left = right = None
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if screen[i][j] == 'w':
                if top is None:
                    top = bottom = i
                    left = right = j
                else:
                    if i < top:
                        top = i
                    if i > bottom:
                        bottom = i
                    if j < left:
                        left = j
                    if j > right:
                        right = j
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000; `screen` is a list of strings; `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` will represent the bounding box of all 'w' characters in the `screen` if any are present, where `top` is the minimum row index, `bottom` is the maximum row index, `left` is the minimum column index, and `right` is the maximum column index. If no 'w' characters are found, `top` and `bottom` will remain None, and `left` and `right` will remain out of bounds.
    if (top is None or bottom is None or left is None or right is None) :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000; `screen` is a list of strings; `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are all integers representing the bounding box of all 'w' characters in the `screen`, and none of these values are None. In this case, `top` is the minimum row index of the 'w' characters, `bottom` is the maximum row index, `left` is the minimum column index, and `right` is the maximum column index.
    frame_height = bottom - top + 1
    frame_width = right - left + 1
    if (frame_height < 2 or frame_width < 2) :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1, indicating that the current value of `frame_height` is less than 2 or the current value of `frame_width` is less than 2.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000; `screen` is a list of strings; `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged; `frame_height` is greater than or equal to 2; `frame_width` is greater than or equal to 2.
    result = [list(row) for row in screen]
    for i in range(top, bottom + 1):
        for j in range(left, right + 1):
            if i == top or i == bottom or j == left or j == right:
                if result[i][j] == '.':
                    result[i][j] = '+'
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 2000, `screen` is a list of strings, and `result` is a modified list of lists of characters. All entries in `result` that correspond to the indices where `i` is equal to `top` or `bottom`, or `j` is equal to `left` or `right`, which were originally '.', are now updated to '+'. The `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` indices remain unchanged within their specified bounds, and any original entries in `result` not affected by this update remain unchanged.
    return result
    #The program returns the modified list 'result' where entries corresponding to the indices defined by 'top', 'bottom', 'left', and 'right' are updated to '+' if they were originally '.'
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two integers `n` and `m` (with 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000) and a list of strings `screen`. It may return -1 based on certain conditions or a modified list `result` based on specific indices.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns -1

Case_2: The program returns -1, indicating that the current value of `frame_height` is less than 2 or the current value of `frame_width` is less than 2.

Case_3: The program returns the modified list 'result' where entries corresponding to the indices defined by 'top', 'bottom', 'left', and 'right' are updated to '+' if they were originally '.'


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
