The `continue` statement will skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop, allowing the iteration to proceed to the next one. However, since the `continue` statement itself does not change any variable values directly, the output state will reflect that the current iteration of the loop is being skipped without altering the values of `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, or `max_y`.

Output State: **`n` remains unchanged, `m` remains unchanged, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `min_x` remains unchanged, `min_y` remains unchanged, `max_x` remains unchanged, `max_y` remains unchanged, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
