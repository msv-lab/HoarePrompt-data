The code assigns the character `'+'` to the 2D list `pixels` at the position specified by the current values of `i` and `j`. Since `j` is incremented by 1 (as stated in the initial conditions), the value of `j` will now be one greater than its previous value. The variables `n`, `m`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new value of `j` after the increment, while keeping the other variables the same.

Output State: **`n` remains unchanged, `m` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is incremented by 1, and `pixels[i][j]` is assigned the value '+'**.
