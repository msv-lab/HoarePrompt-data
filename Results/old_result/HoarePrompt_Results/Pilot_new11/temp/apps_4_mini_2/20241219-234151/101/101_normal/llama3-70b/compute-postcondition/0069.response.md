The value of `pixels[i][j]` changes from `'.'` to `'+'`. The initial state confirms that `i` is 2 and `j` is 0, while `n`, `m`, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` remain unchanged. The conditions concerning the values of `i`, `j`, and the values of `pixels[i][j]` are satisfied as `pixels[i][j]` was previously a `'.'`. 

Output State: **`n` remains unchanged, `m` remains unchanged, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `min_x` remains unchanged, `min_y` remains unchanged, `max_x` remains unchanged, `max_y` remains unchanged, `pixels[2][0]` is '+'**
