The variables `left` and `right` are both assigned the value of `j`. The value of `j` is stated to be equal to `k + 1`. Therefore, both `left` and `right` will now be equal to `k + 1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be at least `n`, `m` must be greater than `k + 1`, `screen` is a list of strings, `j` is `k + 1`, `top` is equal to `i`, `bottom` is equal to `i`, `left` is equal to `k + 1`, `right` is equal to `k + 1`**
