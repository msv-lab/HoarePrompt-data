Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 2000, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `screen` is a list of strings, and `result` is a modified list of lists of characters. If `result[i][j]` is '.', then `result[i][j]` is assigned '+', where `j` is equal to `left + 1` and `j` is less than or equal to `right`. Otherwise, if `result[i][j]` is not '.', no changes are made to `result`.***
