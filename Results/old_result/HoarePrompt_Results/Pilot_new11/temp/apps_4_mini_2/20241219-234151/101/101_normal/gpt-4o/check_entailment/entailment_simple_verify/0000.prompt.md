You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Innocentius has a problem — his computer monitor has broken. Now some of the pixels are "dead", that is, they are always black. As consequence, Innocentius can't play the usual computer games. He is recently playing the following game with his younger brother Polycarpus.

Innocentius is touch-typing a program that paints a white square one-pixel wide frame on the black screen. As the monitor is broken, some pixels that should be white remain black. Polycarpus should look at what the program displayed on the screen and guess the position and size of the frame Innocentius has painted. Polycarpus doesn't like the game but Innocentius persuaded brother to play as "the game is good for the imagination and attention".

Help Polycarpus, automatize his part in the gaming process. Write the code that finds such possible square frame that:  the frame's width is 1 pixel,  the frame doesn't go beyond the borders of the screen,  all white pixels of the monitor are located on the frame,  of all frames that satisfy the previous three conditions, the required frame must have the smallest size. 

Formally, a square frame is represented by such pixels of the solid square, that are on the square's border, that is, are not fully surrounded by the other pixels of the square. For example, if the frame's size is d = 3, then it consists of 8 pixels, if its size is d = 2, then it contains 4 pixels and if d = 1, then the frame is reduced to a single pixel.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the resolution of the monitor as a pair of integers n, m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000). The next n lines contain exactly m characters each — the state of the monitor pixels at the moment of the game. Character "." (period, ASCII code 46) corresponds to the black pixel, and character "w" (lowercase English letter w) corresponds to the white pixel. It is guaranteed that at least one pixel of the monitor is white.


-----Output-----

Print the monitor screen. Represent the sought frame by characters "+" (the "plus" character). The pixels that has become white during the game mustn't be changed. Print them as "w". If there are multiple possible ways to position the frame of the minimum size, print any of them.

If the required frame doesn't exist, then print a single line containing number -1.

screen = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]
result = func_1(n, m, screen)
if result == -1:
    print(-1)

def func_1(n, m, screen):
    top = bottom = left = right = None
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if screen[i][j] == 'w':
                if top is None:
                    top = bottom = i
                    left = right = j
                else:
                    if i < top:
                        top = i
                    if i > bottom:
                        bottom = i
                    if j < left:
                        left = j
                    if j > right:
                        right = j
    if top is None or bottom is None or left is None or (right is None):
        return -1
    frame_height = bottom - top + 1
    frame_width = right - left + 1
    if frame_height < 2 or frame_width < 2:
        return -1
    result = [list(row) for row in screen]
    for i in range(top, bottom + 1):
        for j in range(left, right + 1):
            if i == top or i == bottom or j == left or (j == right):
                if result[i][j] == '.':
                    result[i][j] = '+'
    return result

Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code in the context of the specified requirements.

The program aims to construct the smallest possible square frame on a 2D monochrome "screen" where some pixels may be dead (black, represented by '.') and some are white (represented by 'w'). The frame itself is made up of '+' characters, located at the borders of the square that encompasses all 'w' pixels.

Here are the key points I will examine:

1. **Identifying the Bounds of the Frame**: The code scans through the `screen` to find the minimum and maximum coordinates of 'w' pixels. This approach is theoretically sound; however, we need to ensure that it correctly identifies the frame's boundaries.

2. **Frame Validity**: The function checks if the height and width of the frame are sufficient (both greater than or equal to 2). The problem allows for a frame of size 1 when there are no additional locations for '+' surrounding the 'w' pixels. The program does not account for frames of size 1 correctly.

3. **Constructing the Frame**: After determining the coordinates, the program builds the frame by iterating through the determined boundaries. It replaces the appropriate pixels with '+'. However, there is a risk of constructing invalid frames if the identified location for the frame coincides with 'w' pixels.

4. **Edge Cases**: Consider cases like:
   - A screen where the white pixels form a single line but cannot create a surrounding frame since it would be invalid (e.g., `2 6`, `w..w.w`, `...w..`).
   - An "L" shaped formation of white pixels that is impossible to frame properly.

Let’s analyze the fourth input case from the example — `5 6`, `w....`, `......`, `..w...`, `......`:

- The function will identify that there is one white pixel at the top (row 0, column 0) and another at row 2, column 2. The program correctly identifies those `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` coordinates. However, upon determining that the frame size is too small for a valid rectangle, it should output '-1'.

Now let’s test this logic against the program:

For the screen:
```
w....w
......
...w..
......
```

Results in:
- Identifying top at 0, bottom at 4, left at 0, right at 5, size > 2 x 2.
- However, it cannot create a frame due to the console dimensions. 

The output will not be as expected because the frame cannot surround the given pixels adequately.

Hence, I conclude that the function does not properly handle cases where the frame doesn't exist around the 'w' pixels as required.

Therefore, the final determination of the output is:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not account for situations where no valid frames can be formed properly around the 'w' pixels according to the problem description, particularly in edge cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
(n, m) = map(int, input().split())
screen = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]
result = func_1(n, m, screen)
if result == -1:
    print(-1)
else:
    for row in result:
        print(''.join(row))

def func_1(n, m, screen):
    top = bottom = left = right = None
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):

                if top is None:
                    top = bottom = i

                    if j < left:
                        left = j
