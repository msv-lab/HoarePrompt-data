According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `white_pixels` list. If `white_pixels` contains at least 3 tuples, the loop can execute again for the third tuple. At the end of the last iteration, `white_pixels` must contain at least 2 tuples, and we know the previous values of `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` have been adjusted based on the first two tuples.

For the loop to be executed one more time, we need to ensure that `white_pixels` has at least 3 tuples. Assuming the current state of `x` and `y` is derived from the last tuple (the second one), the values of `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` must also be updated based on the new `(x, y)` from the third tuple.

Thus, the adjustments are:
- `white_pixels` must have at least 3 tuples.
- The `x` and `y` would take their values from the third tuple of `white_pixels`.

State: **`n` is an integer in the range [1, 2000]; `m` is an integer in the range [1, 2000]; `white_pixels` must contain at least 3 tuples of (x, y); `min_x` is the minimum of its previous value and `x` from the third tuple; `min_y` is the minimum of its previous value and `y` from the third tuple; `max_x` is the maximum of its previous value and `white_pixels[2][0]`; `max_y` is the maximum of its previous value and `white_pixels[2][1]`; `x` is the first element of `white_pixels[2][0]`; `y` is the first element of `white_pixels[2][1]`.**
