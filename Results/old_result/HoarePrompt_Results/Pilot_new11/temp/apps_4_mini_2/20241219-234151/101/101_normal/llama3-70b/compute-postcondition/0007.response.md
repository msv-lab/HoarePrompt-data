According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `white_pixels` collection. In the last iteration, `white_pixels` must contain at least one tuple, which it currently does. At the end of the last iteration, `x` and `y` represent the first element of the first tuple in `white_pixels`. 

As the loop iterates over `white_pixels`, it will proceed to the next tuple during each iteration. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `white_pixels` contains at least two tuples.

Since `x` and `y` represent the first tuple's elements, they will be updated to reflect the second tuple in the next iteration. 

Therefore:
- To execute one more time, `white_pixels` must have at least 2 tuples.
- The variables `x` and `y` will take the values of the first elements of the second tuple in `white_pixels`.

State: **`n` is an integer in the range [1, 2000]; `m` is an integer in the range [1, 2000]; `white_pixels` must contain at least 2 tuples of (x, y); `min_x` is equal to `x`; `min_y` is equal to `y`; `max_x` is equal to `x`; `max_y` is equal to `y`; `x` is the first element of `white_pixels[1][0]`; `y` is the first element of `white_pixels[1][1]`**
