Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers within 1 to 2000, `screen` is a list of strings, and `result` is a list of lists of characters. Every position in `result` that corresponds to either `i` equal to `top` or `bottom`, or `j` equal to `left` or `right`, and was originally '.', is now updated to '+'. The values for `top`, `bottom`, `frame_height`, `frame_width`, `left`, and `right` continue to satisfy their respective conditions, ensuring the integrity of the loop execution.**
