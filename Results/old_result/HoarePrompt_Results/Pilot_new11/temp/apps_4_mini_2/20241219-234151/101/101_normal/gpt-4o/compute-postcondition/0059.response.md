Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, `screen` is a list of strings, `top` was updated to `i`, `bottom` remains None, `left` and `right` are out of bounds, `i` is `i_end + 1` where `i_end` < `n - 1, `j` is 0, the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w', and the current value of `i` is greater than `bottom`.***
