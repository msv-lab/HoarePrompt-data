Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` remain unchanged, if either `i` equals `min_x`, `max_x`, or `j` equals `min_y`, or `j` equals `max_y`, and `pixels[i][j]` was originally '.', it is now '+'. Otherwise, if `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', the program state is unchanged; for all other cases, `pixels[i][j]` is set to '.' with `i` and `j` retaining their values of 1 and 0, respectively, and the boundaries defined by `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` remain unchanged.***
