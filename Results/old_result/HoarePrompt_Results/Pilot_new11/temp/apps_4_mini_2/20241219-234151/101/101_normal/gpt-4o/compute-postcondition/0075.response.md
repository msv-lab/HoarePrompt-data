The value of `bottom` is assigned the value of `i`. The condition states that if `i` is less than `top`, then `top` is assigned the value of `i`, but since we are only executing the line `bottom = i`, we do not change `top`, `left`, or `right`. The initial state of `n`, `m`, `screen`, and `j` remains unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, `screen` is a list of strings, `top` is unchanged, `bottom` is `i`, `left` is unchanged, `right` is unchanged, and `j` is 1. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, `screen` is a list of strings, `top` is unchanged, `bottom` is `i`, `left` is unchanged, `right` is unchanged, `j` is 1.**
