After carefully analyzing the problem description, the original assessment, and the provided annotated code, I can conclude the following:

1. **Problem Description**: Innocentius must draw a square frame around white pixels such that all white pixels are on the border of this frame. The frame's full boundaries must be accounted without going beyond the screen's edges, and it should be the smallest possible frame that performs this task. If no appropriate frame can be drawn, the program must return -1.

2. **Original Assessment**: The original assessment claimed that the program is not correct because it might not properly account for edges and isolated white pixels when constructing the frame.

3. **Annotated Code Review**:
   - The program correctly identifies the white pixels and determines their min and max positions.
   - It subsequently calculates the required frame size based on these positions.
   - The program validates whether a frame can fit within the screen, returning `-1` if it exceeds the dimensions.
   - It modifies the grid to create a frame with '+' characters around the determined white pixels.

4. **Issues Identified**: 
   - The original assessment raised valid concerns about configurations of white pixels that could lead to a frame not meeting the required condition of having all white pixels on the frame's edge, specifically for layouts that are not rectangular or have isolated white pixels. 
   - However, the programâ€™s fundamental approach does ensure that it will always output either the appropriate frame or '-1', even in complex scenarios based on the coordinates of white pixels.

Taking into account both the original assessment and the detailed annotation analysis, I believe the following:

- The program's handling of the frames is generally sound, ensuring that if it cannot form a proper surrounding frame, it will correctly output `-1`.
- Although the concerns regarding isolated white pixels affecting the final output are valid, the annotation and corresponding checks maintain the program's integrity for valid input scenarios.

Based on this comprehensive evaluation, I must maintain that the original assessment noted potential shortcomings; however, the inherent logic of the program does provide a solution according to the specified problem constraints and events during execution. 

Therefore, the final correctness assessment is:

Final: **False**
