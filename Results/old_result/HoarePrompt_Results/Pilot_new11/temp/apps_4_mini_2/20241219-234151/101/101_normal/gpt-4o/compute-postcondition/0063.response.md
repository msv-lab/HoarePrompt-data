The code assigns the value of `j` to `left`. Since `j` is 0, `left` will be updated to 0. The other variables remain unchanged as per the program's current state. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, `screen` is a list of strings, `top` and `bottom` are defined based on `i`, `i` and `i_end` are updated accordingly, `right` is out of bounds, `j` is 0, the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w', and `left` is now 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, `screen` is a list of strings, `top` and `bottom` are defined based on `i`, `i` and `i_end` are updated accordingly, `right` is out of bounds, `j` is 0, the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w', `left` is 0.**
