The variable `left` is assigned the value of `j`. Since `j` is initially 1, `left` will also be set to 1. The states of other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000; `screen` is a list of strings; `i` is 0; `j` is 1; `bottom` is 0; if `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `top` remains unchanged; otherwise, if `i` is less than `top`, then `top` is updated to 0; `left` is 1.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000; `screen` is a list of strings; `i` is 0; `j` is 1; `bottom` is 0; if `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `top` remains unchanged; otherwise, if `i` is less than `top`, then `top` is updated to 0; `left` is 1.**
