Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, `screen` is a list of strings. If `j` is greater than `right`, then `top` and `bottom` are defined based on `i`, `left` and `right` are out of bounds, `i` is updated to `i_end + 1` where `i_end` < `n - 1`, `j` is set to 0, the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w', and `right` is equal to `j` which is 0. Otherwise, no changes occur to any variables, maintaining their initial values.***
