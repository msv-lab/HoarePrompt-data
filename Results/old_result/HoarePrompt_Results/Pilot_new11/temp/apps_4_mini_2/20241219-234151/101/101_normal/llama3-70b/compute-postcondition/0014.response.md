The expression for `frame_size` is calculated as the maximum difference between the x and y coordinates of the tuples in `white_pixels`, increased by 1. The variables `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` are directly involved in this calculation.

Since `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` remain unchanged after the execution of the code, we can state that:

- `frame_size` is assigned the value `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`.

As a result, `frame_size` will be a value that represents the larger extension of the bounding box that encapsulates the `white_pixels`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range [1, 2000]; `m` is an integer in the range [1, 2000]; `white_pixels` must contain at least one tuple of (x, y); `min_x` is the minimum x-coordinate of all tuples in `white_pixels`; `min_y` is the minimum y-coordinate of all tuples in `white_pixels`; `max_x` is the maximum x-coordinate of all tuples in `white_pixels`; `max_y` is the maximum y-coordinate of all tuples in `white_pixels`; `frame_size` is equal to `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`.**
