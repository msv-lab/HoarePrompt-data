The variables `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` are initialized to placeholder values: `min_x` and `min_y` are set to positive infinity, while `max_x` and `max_y` are set to negative infinity. This means they will be ready to store minimum and maximum coordinates from the list of `white_pixels`. 

No values of `n`, `m`, or `white_pixels` are altered by this code snippet; instead, the focus is on the initialization of these four variables. The initial ranges remain unchanged as the code merely assigns initial values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range [1, 2000]; `m` is an integer in the range [1, 2000]; `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (i, j) for each (i, j) where `pixels[i][j]` is 'w'; `min_x` is float('inf'), `min_y` is float('inf'), `max_x` is float('-inf'), `max_y` is float('-inf')**
