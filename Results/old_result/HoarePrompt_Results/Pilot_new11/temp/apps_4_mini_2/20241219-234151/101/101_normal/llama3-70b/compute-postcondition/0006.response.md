The code assigns new values to `max_x` and `max_y`. The previous values are `max_x` (which is float('-inf')) and `max_y` (which is also float('-inf')). The values of `x` and `y` are taken from `white_pixels`[0], where `x` is `white_pixels[0][0]` and `y` is `white_pixels[0][1]`.

Since `max_x` is updated to be the maximum of its current value (float('-inf')) and `x`, it will take the value of `x`. Similarly, `max_y` is updated to be the maximum of its current value (float('-inf')) and `y`, so it will take the value of `y`.

Therefore, after the execution of the code, `max_x` will equal `x`, and `max_y` will equal `y`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `white_pixels`, `min_x`, `min_y`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range [1, 2000]; `m` is an integer in the range [1, 2000]; `white_pixels` must not be empty and should contain tuples of (x, y); `min_x` is equal to `x`; `min_y` is equal to `y`; `max_x` is equal to `x`; `max_y` is equal to `y`; `x` is the first element of `white_pixels`[0][0]; `y` is the first element of `white_pixels`[0][1]**.
