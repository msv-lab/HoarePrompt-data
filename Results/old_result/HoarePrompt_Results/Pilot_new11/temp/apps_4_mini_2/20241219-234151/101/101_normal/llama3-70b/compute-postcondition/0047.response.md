Postcondition: ***`n` is unchanged, `m` is unchanged, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and the boundaries defined by `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` are unchanged. The indices `i` and `j` are not equal to any boundary values (i.e., `i` is neither `min_x` nor `max_x`, and `j` is neither `min_y` nor `max_y`). The current value of `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', and `pixels[i][j]` is not equal to '.'***
