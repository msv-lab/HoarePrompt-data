Functionality: The function accepts two integers `n` and `m` (where \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2000\)) and a list of strings `screen`, with each string containing exactly `m` characters that are either '.' (black pixel) or 'w' (white pixel). The function identifies the bounding box of all 'w' characters in the `screen`. If no 'w' characters are found or if the constructed bounding box has a width or height less than 2, the function returns -1. If 'w' characters are present and the bounding box dimensions are valid, the function produces a modified list `result`, where the border of the bounding box (top, bottom, left, right) is updated from '.' to '+'. Variables `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` represent the bounding box's limits and are determined based on the locations of 'w' pixels. If the bounding box is valid, the function returns the modified `result`; otherwise, it returns -1. The function does not account for edge cases if `screen` contains non-standard characters (characters other than '.' or 'w').
