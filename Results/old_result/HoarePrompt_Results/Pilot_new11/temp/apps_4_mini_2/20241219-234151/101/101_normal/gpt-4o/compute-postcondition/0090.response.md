`left` is assigned the value of `j`, which is equal to `m`. The values of `n`, `m`, `screen`, `bottom`, `top`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, `screen` is a list of strings, `j` is equal to `m`, `left` is equal to `m`, and if `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `bottom` is set to `i` and if `i` is less than `top`, then `top` is equal to `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, `screen` is a list of strings, `j` is equal to `m`, `left` is equal to `m`, and if `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `bottom` is set to `i` and if `i` is less than `top`, then `top` is equal to `i`.**
