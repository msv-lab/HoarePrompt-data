To determine the new output state after executing the code `row = n - full_rows`, we first evaluate how this impacts the variables based on the initial state provided.

1. We have `n`, which is an integer where \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^9 \) and is always even.
2. We also have `full_rows`, which is defined as `k // (m - 1)` and is stated to be an even integer.

From the operation `row = n - full_rows`:
- `row` will be calculated as the difference between `n` and `full_rows`.

Since `full_rows` is derived from `k`, and is even, we know:
- If `n` is even and `full_rows` is even, then `n - full_rows` is also even.

Thus, `row` will hold an integer value which results from the subtraction of these two even integers, ensuring that `row` is also even.

Since the other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `full_rows`, `remaining_steps`) are not directly modified, they will retain their initial conditions except for `row`.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^9; `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k` is greater than or equal to `k - (n - 1)` and less than `n·m`; `full_rows` is an even non-negative integer equal to `k // (m - 1)`; `remaining_steps` is equal to `k % (m - 1)`; `row` is equal to `n - full_rows`.**
