#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9 and n is always even, k is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k < n·m.
def func_1(n, m, k):
    if (k < n - 1) :
        print(k + 1, 1)
    else :
        k -= n - 1
        full_rows = k // (m - 1)
        remaining_steps = k % (m - 1)

            row = n - full_rows
            col = 2 + remaining_steps

        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^9, and `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k` is greater than or equal to `k - (n - 1)` and less than `n·m`. If `full_rows` is an even non-negative integer, then `row` is equal to `n - full_rows`, which is even, and `col` is equal to `2 + remaining_steps`. Otherwise, if `full_rows` is an odd integer, then `row` is equal to `n - full_rows`, which is odd, and `col` is equal to `m - remaining_steps`.
        print(row, col)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 10^9 and `n` is always even. If `k` is less than `n - 1`, the printed values are `k + 1` and `1`. Otherwise, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1` and less than `n·m`; the values printed for `row` and `col` are determined by the evenness of `full_rows`, with `row` as `n - full_rows` and `col` based on `remaining_steps`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, an even integer between 2 and 10^9; `m`, an integer between 2 and 10^9; and `k`, a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `k` < n·m. It performs the following actions: If `k` is less than `n - 1`, it prints the coordinates `(k + 1, 1)`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, it updates `k` by subtracting `n - 1`, calculates how many full rows are crossed using `(m - 1)`, and determines the remaining steps across the columns. The function then derives the `row` and `col` coordinates based on the parity of `full_rows`. It finally prints these coordinates `(row, col)`, which will have valid bounds derived from the calculations based on `k`. Potential edge cases include handling maximum values of `k`, ensuring the calculations remain valid within the specified ranges, and the guarantee that `n` is even and `k` is non-negative. The function guarantees valid outputs for the conditions specified.
