The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `k`. Parameter `n` is an even integer between 2 and \(10^9\), inclusive. Parameter `m` is an integer between 2 and \(10^9\), inclusive. Parameter `k` is a non-negative integer such that it is between 0 and \(n \cdot m - 1\), inclusive. The function returns an output based on the values of these parameters, but specific output conditions are not provided in the prompt.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (even integer), m (integer), and k (non-negative integer) and operates within the specified constraints.**
