The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters; instead, the input constraints indicate that the function operates based on certain variables, namely `n`, `m`, and `k`. 

- `n` is an integer that must be even and lies between 2 and \(10^9\) (inclusive).
- `m` is an integer that lies between 2 and \(10^9\) (inclusive).
- `k` is a non-negative integer that must be in the range of 0 to \(n \cdot m - 1\) (inclusive).

The output behavior of the function is not provided, so the exact return value cannot be determined from the given information. Therefore, the functionality can be described generically based on the parameters and constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but operates based on integers n (even and between 2 and 10^9), m (between 2 and 10^9), and k (a non-negative integer between 0 and nÂ·m - 1), and returns a value based on these inputs.**
