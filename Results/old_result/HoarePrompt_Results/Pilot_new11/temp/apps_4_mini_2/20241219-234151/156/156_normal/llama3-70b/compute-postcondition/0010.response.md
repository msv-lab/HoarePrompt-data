Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer within the range of `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`, and `m` is an integer within the same range. If `k` is less than `n - 1`, then 'k + 1' has been printed alongside '1'. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, and `k` is less than `n * 2 - 2`, the first output will be `n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1` and the second output will be `(k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1` and `k` is greater than or equal to `n * 2 - 2`, the outputs will be 1 and 2.***
