Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer within the range of `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`, `m` is an integer within the same range, and `k` is an integer such that `0 ≤ k < n · m` and `k ≥ n - 1`. If `k < n * 2 - 2`, the first output is `n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1` and the second output is `(k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1`. Otherwise, the outputs are 1 and 2.***
