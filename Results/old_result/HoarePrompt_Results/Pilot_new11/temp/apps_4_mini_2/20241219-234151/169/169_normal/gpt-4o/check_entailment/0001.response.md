Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the logic required to determine the minimal possible number of stones after all operations. Specifically, it does not account for the requirement that the pile must have been non-empty before any `-` operation, which implies that if there are more `-` operations than `+` operations, it's not possible to start with fewer stones than the number of `-` operations.

For instance, consider the input case:
```
5
----- 
```
In this scenario, the program would start with `0` stones, execute `5` `-` operations, and end up with `0` stones, which does not satisfy the condition of having enough stones available to perform the subtraction operations.

Instead, based on the operations provided, at least `5` stones would be needed to ensure that all operations can be legally performed. Hence, the minimum possible number of stones after these operations would be `0`, since it's impossible to start with fewer than `5`.

Thus, the program does not fulfill the problem's requirements for all input cases.
