According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will iterate over each character in the string `s`. Since `n` is defined as an integer such that `1 <= n <= 100`, it implies that `s` must consist of exactly `n` characters. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to confirm that `s` is indeed a string of length `n`, which must be between 1 and 100.

Before the loop starts, `stones` is initialized to 0. The state needs to account for the current character being operated on in `s`. The first operation in the loop will be with the first character in `s`. Thus, the following adjustments and conditions are needed:

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `s` is a string of length n consisting of '-' or '+', `stones` is 0, `operation` is the first character in `s**.
