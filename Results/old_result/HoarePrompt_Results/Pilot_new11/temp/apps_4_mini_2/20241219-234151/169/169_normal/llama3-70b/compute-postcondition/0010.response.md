Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` (where 1 <= n <= 100) and a string `s` of length `n` that consists only of the characters "-" and "+". It counts the occurrences of the "-" and "+" characters in the string. If the count of "-" is greater than the count of "+", it outputs 0. Otherwise, it outputs the difference between the count of "+" and the count of "-". The function does not return a value but prints the result directly. It does not handle cases where the input format is incorrect or where `n` does not match the length of `s`.**
