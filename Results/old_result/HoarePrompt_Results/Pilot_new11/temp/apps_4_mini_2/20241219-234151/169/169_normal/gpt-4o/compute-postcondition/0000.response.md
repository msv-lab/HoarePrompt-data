The value of `n` is assigned the input value converted to an integer. Since it was previously stated that `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, the output state is that `n` is now an input integer that meets the criteria. The string `s` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and `s` is a string consisting of n characters, each character being either '-' or '+'.**
