Functionality: **The function reads a positive integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` from the input, which consists exclusively of the characters '-' and '+'. It processes the string to calculate the total number of 'stones' based on these rules: each '+' increments a counter (stones) by 1, while each '-' decrements it by 1, ensuring that the counter does not drop below 0. After processing the string, the function prints the final count of stones. The function effectively handles edge cases, such as multiple consecutive '-' characters, by ensuring that stones do not become negative. However, it assumes valid input as per the specified constraints but does not handle cases where input does not meet those constraints.**
