The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input which will still be a positive integer satisfying the condition that `1 <= n <= 100`. The string `s` remains unchanged, but the state of `n` can now be any positive integer within the specified range based on user input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 (now updated to user input), `s` is a string of length n consisting only of the characters "-" and "+".**
