To evaluate the conditions for the for loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the variable `s` and its relationship with the loop's iteration. The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`, where `operation` takes on each character in the string sequentially.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), meaning the string `s` has a length of `n`. Given that the for loop processes each character in the string `s`, the loop has processed `operation` for the characters up to the length of `s`.

Since the string `s` has a length of `n` at the end of the last iteration, let's assume it has been fully processed. If `operation` has taken the value of the last character in `s`, for the loop to execute one more time, `operation` needs to take on the next character in `s`, which doesn't exist.

If `n` is such that it has fully iterated through every single character in `s` (i.e., if `s` has `n` characters), then to loop again, we only have to ensure that `n` is increased, keeping within the specified range. However, it is also valid that `n` remains unchanged based on other context but we must account for the next loop's entry to consider what might change next.

Therefore:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `s` is a string of length `n+1` consisting of '-' or '+', and `operation` is the new last character in string `s` that was not evaluated.**
