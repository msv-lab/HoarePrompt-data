Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `s` is a string of length `n+1` consisting of '-' or '+', and `operation` is the new last character in string `s`. If `operation` is '+', `stones` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `operation` is '-', `stones` is equal to max(0, stones - 1).***
