The variable `plus_count` is assigned the value of `s.count('+')`, which counts the number of occurrences of the character '+' in the string `s`. The variable `n` signifies the length of `s`, which consists only of the characters '-' and '+'. Therefore, `minus_count`, which is the count of '-' in `s`, can be calculated as `n - plus_count`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100; `s` is an input string of length `n` consisting only of the characters "-" and "+"; `minus_count` is the count of '-' in `s`; `plus_count` is the count of '+' in `s`.**
