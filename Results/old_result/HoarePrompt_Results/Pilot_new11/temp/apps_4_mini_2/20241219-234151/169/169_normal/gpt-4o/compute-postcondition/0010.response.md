Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of '-' or '+'; if the first character of `s` is '+', then `stones` is increased to 1. If the first character of `s` is '-', `stones` remains 0 as the operation attempts to decrement it but is bounded by the max function, preventing it from going below zero.***
