You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has a pile, that consists of some number of stones. $n$ times he either took one stone from the pile or added one stone to the pile. The pile was non-empty before each operation of taking one stone from the pile.

You are given $n$ operations which Vasya has made. Find the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after making these operations.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one positive integer $n$ — the number of operations, that have been made by Vasya ($1 \leq n \leq 100$).

The next line contains the string $s$, consisting of $n$ symbols, equal to "-" (without quotes) or "+" (without quotes). If Vasya took the stone on $i$-th operation, $s_i$ is equal to "-" (without quotes), if added, $s_i$ is equal to "+" (without quotes).


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after these $n$ operations.


-----Examples-----

Output
3


-----Note-----

In the first test, if Vasya had $3$ stones in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to $0$. It is impossible to have less number of piles, so the answer is $0$. Please notice, that the number of stones at the beginning can't be less, than $3$, because in this case, Vasya won't be able to take a stone on some operation (the pile will be empty).

In the second test, if Vasya had $0$ stones in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to $4$. It is impossible to have less number of piles because after making $4$ operations the number of stones in the pile increases on $4$ stones. So, the answer is $4$.

In the third test, if Vasya had $1$ stone in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to $1$. It can be proved, that it is impossible to have less number of stones after making the operations.

In the fourth test, if Vasya had $0$ stones in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to $3$.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    minus_count = s.count('-')
    plus_count = s.count('+')
    if minus_count > plus_count:
        print(0)
    else:
        print(plus_count - minus_count)


```
Output hints: The function accepts a positive integer `n` (where 1 <= n <= 100) and a string `s` of length `n` that consists only of the characters "-" and "+". It counts the occurrences of the "-" and "+" characters in the string. If the count of "-" is greater than the count of "+", it outputs 0. Otherwise, it outputs the difference between the count of "+" and the count of "-". The function does not return a value but prints the result directly. It does not handle cases where the input format is incorrect or where `n` does not match the length of `s`.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
