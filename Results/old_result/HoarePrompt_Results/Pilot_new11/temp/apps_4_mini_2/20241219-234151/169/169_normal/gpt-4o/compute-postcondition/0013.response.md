The variable `stones` is updated with the value `max(0, stones - 1)`. This indicates that if `stones` is greater than 0, it will decrease by 1; if `stones` is 0 or already less than 1, it will remain 0. The other variables, `n` and `s`, are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of '-' or '+'; `stones` is max(0, stones - 1)**.
