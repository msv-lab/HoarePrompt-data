Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's an explanation of why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n`, which represents the number of operations, and a string `s` that consists of `n` symbols ('+' or '-') as described in the problem. The constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) ensure that the input will always be within valid bounds.

2. **Logic Implementation**:
   - The program initializes a variable `stones` to 0. This keeps track of the current number of stones in the pile.
   - It processes each operation in the string `s`. For each '+' encountered, the program correctly increments the `stones` count by 1. For each '-' encountered, it decreases the `stones` count by 1 but ensures that it does not go below 0 using the `max(0, stones - 1)` expression.
   - This handling ensures that the program simulates the operations in such a way that Vasya never attempts to take a stone from an empty pile, as required by the problem description. The count of stones remains non-negative throughout.

3. **Output**: After processing all operations, the program prints the final count of `stones`, which represents the minimal possible number of stones remaining after executing all operations. This result aligns with the expectations described in the problem statement.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program effectively manages potential edge cases, such as multiple consecutive '-' operations, by ensuring that the `stones` count will not become negative.

In conclusion, the program adheres strictly to the problem description and handles all specified conditions correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is validated as **True**.
