Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the case when the maximum integer in the sequence `a` is larger than `x * y`. In the nested loop, the condition `if x * y > max(a): break` is not a correct way to determine the feasibility of possible values of `x` and `y`. 

For example, if `n = 2` with the sequence `a = [1, 10]`, the code could potentially find values for `x` and `y`, but those values would not actually support moving from the cell containing `1` to the cell containing `10` with the constraints of valid moves in the matrix. The function `func_1` only checks for adjacent cell movement using calculated `nx` and `ny`, but it lacks a comprehensive check to determine if it's possible to fill the entire matrix such that each number corresponds correctly to its respective cell.

Additionally, the matrix dimensions `x` and `y` being derived from the indices are never validated against actual boundaries of the path taken. In scenarios where valid `x` and `y` values do not exist to allow for the entire traversal described in `a`, the program should print `NO`, but it only does this after checking up to `1000000`, which might take an overly long time and may yield incorrect results if sequences are not properly validated for their ranges against feasible dimensions.

Thus, there are scenarios where the output could incorrectly suggest a valid path when it doesn't exist, leading to incorrect behavior as per the problem requirements.
