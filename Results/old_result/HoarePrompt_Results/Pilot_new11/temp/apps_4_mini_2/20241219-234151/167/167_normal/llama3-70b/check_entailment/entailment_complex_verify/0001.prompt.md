You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There is a matrix A of size x × y filled with integers. For every $i \in [ 1 . . x ]$, $j \in [ 1 . . y ]$ A_{i}, j = y(i - 1) + j. Obviously, every integer from [1..xy] occurs exactly once in this matrix. 

You have traversed some path in this matrix. Your path can be described as a sequence of visited cells a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} denoting that you started in the cell containing the number a_1, then moved to the cell with the number a_2, and so on.

From the cell located in i-th line and j-th column (we denote this cell as (i, j)) you can move into one of the following cells: (i + 1, j) — only if i < x;  (i, j + 1) — only if j < y;  (i - 1, j) — only if i > 1;  (i, j - 1) — only if j > 1.

Notice that making a move requires you to go to an adjacent cell. It is not allowed to stay in the same cell. You don't know x and y exactly, but you have to find any possible values for these numbers such that you could start in the cell containing the integer a_1, then move to the cell containing a_2 (in one step), then move to the cell containing a_3 (also in one step) and so on. Can you choose x and y so that they don't contradict with your sequence of moves?


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000) — the number of cells you visited on your path (if some cell is visited twice, then it's listed twice).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the integers in the cells on your path.


-----Output-----

If all possible values of x and y such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9 contradict with the information about your path, print NO.

Otherwise, print YES in the first line, and in the second line print the values x and y such that your path was possible with such number of lines and columns in the matrix. Remember that they must be positive integers not exceeding 10^9.


-----Examples-----
Input
8
1 2 3 6 9 8 5 2

Output
YES
3 3

Input
6
1 2 1 2 5 3

Output
NO

Input

4 9



-----Note-----

The matrix and the path on it in the first test looks like this: [Image] 

Also there exist multiple correct answers for both the first and the third examples.
Program:
```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
dx = [0, 1, 0, -1]
dy = [1, 0, -1, 0]
for x in range(1, 1000001):
    for y in range(1, 1000001):
        if x * y > max(a):
            break
        if all((1 <= v <= x * y for v in a)) and func_1(x, y):
            print('YES')
            print(x, y)
            exit()
print('NO')

def func_1(x, y):
    (px, py) = (0, 0)
    for v in a:
        (nx, ny) = ((v - 1) // y, (v - 1) % y)
        if abs(nx - px) + abs(ny - py) != 1:
            return False
        (px, py) = (nx, ny)
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program has several issues that lead to incorrect behavior for certain inputs:

1. **Unbounded Search Range**: The nested loops iterating over `x` and `y` from 1 to 1,000,000 (1 million) can lead to inefficiencies and unhandled edge cases. Notably, it will not cover scenarios where larger values of `x` and `y` are required to accommodate inputs exceeding that range.

2. **Incorrect Matrix Position Calculation**: The function `func_1` calculates the new indices `(nx, ny)` based on the formula used in the problem statement. However, when it checks the movement condition, it treats the algorithm as if the indices start from `(0, 0)`, which is incorrect since the problem describes the matrix as starting from `(1, 1)`.

3. **Incorrect Path Validation**: The validation of paths only checks if the absolute difference in indices corresponds to a valid move (to adjacent cells). For inputs where non-adjacent cells are visited or the path involves revisiting already visited cells, it produces false negatives. For example, the inputs `1 2 1 2 5 3` could potentially be arranged in a valid manner inside a sufficient matrix.

4. **Output Logic**: The logic for printing “NO” relies entirely on the search reaching the maximum iterations rather than validating all potential `x` and `y` configurations dynamically based on input patterns.

In summary, the program may fail for cases like `1 2 1 2 5 3` where valid movement across a sufficiently sized matrix is conceivable but is incorrectly rejected due to the program's limitations in verifying the path. Thus, the correct checking mechanism is not implemented thoroughly, and the aforementioned factors lead to flaws in function.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
dx = [0, 1, 0, -1]
dy = [1, 0, -1, 0]
for x in range(1, 1000001):
    for y in range(1, 1000001):
        if x * y > max(a):
            break
        if all((1 <= v <= x * y for v in a)) and func_1(x, y):
            print('YES')
            print(x, y)
            exit()
print('NO')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer in the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, and a is a list of n integers such that each integer a_i is in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(x, y):
    px, py = 0, 0
    for v in a:
        nx, ny = (v - 1) // y, (v - 1) % y
        
        if abs(nx - px) + abs(ny - py) != 1:
            return False
        
        px, py = nx, ny
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is in the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `px` is equal to `nx` after processing the last element in `a`, `py` is equal to `ny` after processing the last element in `a`, `v` is the last element of `a`, `nx` is `(a[n-1] - 1) // y`, `ny` is `(a[n-1] - 1) % y`, and for every pair of consecutive elements in `a`, the condition `abs(nx - px) + abs(ny - py) == 1` has held true.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that the condition abs(nx - px) + abs(ny - py) == 1 holds true for the last processed pair of consecutive elements in list 'a'.
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`, and processes a list `a` of `n` integers (with constraints on its size and integer values). It iterates through this list and calculates two derived values, `nx` and `ny`, for each element based on the formulae `(v - 1) // y` and `(v - 1) % y` respectively. The function checks whether the Manhattan distance between the current and previous derived positions (`nx`, `ny` and `px`, `py`) equals 1 for each pair of consecutive elements in `a`. If this condition fails at any point during the iteration, the function returns `False`. If the loop completes without returning `False`, it ultimately returns `True`, confirming that the conditions held true throughout the processing of the list. 

The function does not utilize the parameters `x` nor does it handle edge cases where the list may be empty, or where values in `a` may not meet the specified constraints, which could lead to unexpected behavior. Thus, the final state indicates success or failure based solely on the traversal of list `a` and the derived conditions without taking `x` or potential invalid inputs into consideration.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
