Output State: **`n` is in the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `px` is equal to `nx` after processing the last element in `a`, `py` is equal to `ny` after processing the last element in `a`, `v` is the last element of `a`, `nx` is `(a[n-1] - 1) // y`, `ny` is `(a[n-1] - 1) % y`, and for every pair of consecutive elements in `a`, the condition `abs(nx - px) + abs(ny - py) == 1` has held true.**
