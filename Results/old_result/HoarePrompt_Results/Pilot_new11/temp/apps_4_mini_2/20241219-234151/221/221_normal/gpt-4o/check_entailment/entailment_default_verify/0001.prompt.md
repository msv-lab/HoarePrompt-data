You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Two positive integers a and b have a sum of s and a bitwise XOR of x. How many possible values are there for the ordered pair (a, b)?


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers s and x (2 ≤ s ≤ 10^12, 0 ≤ x ≤ 10^12), the sum and bitwise xor of the pair of positive integers, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer, the number of solutions to the given conditions. If no solutions exist, print 0.


-----Examples-----
Input
9 5

Output
4

Input
3 3

Output
2

Input
5 2

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first sample, we have the following solutions: (2, 7), (3, 6), (6, 3), (7, 2).

In the second sample, the only solutions are (1, 2) and (2, 1).
Program:
```
def func():
    a = b ^ x
    b = a ^ x


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) that meet the conditions specified in the problem description. In fact, the program does not contain the necessary logic to derive the values of a and b from the input parameters s and x. 

To illustrate a specific case where the program fails, take the input:

```
s = 9
x = 5
```

According to the problem, the valid pairs (a, b) must satisfy both the equations:
1. a + b = s
2. a XOR b = x

Calculating paired combinations for the given inputs, we find valid pairs (2, 7), (3, 6), (6, 3), and (7, 2), leading to a total of 4 valid pairs.

However, the program has a logic that initializes variables a and b as follows:

```python
a = b ^ x
b = a ^ x
```

This code is fundamentally incorrect for calculating the number of solutions, as it does not perform any actual computation based on the inputs s and x.

Thus, since the program fails to solve the problem as defined and produces no output related to counting the pairs, we conclude that the correctness is false.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two parameters: `s`, a positive integer within the range [2, 10^12], and `x`, a non-negative integer within the range [0, 10^12]. It performs a series of XOR operations on two implicit variables, `a` and `b`, though `b` is not initialized or defined before being used. This suggests that the function may not operate correctly as written. After execution, while the final values of `a` and `b` depend on their states prior to the function call, at least one value (`b`) is left in an undefined state, suggesting potential errors. Importantly, the function does not return a value, indicating that its primary purpose may be the manipulation of variables or side effects rather than producing an output. Additionally, since there are no explicit actions regarding `s`, its handling remains completely unaddressed in the function, leaving its impact unexplored.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
