The annotated program aims to compute the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to transform an equilateral triangle of side length \( x \) into one of side length \( y \). The transformation should keep the triangle non-degenerate, which for an equilateral triangle means all sides must remain non-negative integers.

The key points from the program are:

1. **Input Constraints**: The program starts by reading two integers \( x \) and \( y \) and assumes they are bound by \( 3 \leq y < x \leq 100,000 \).

2. **Logic of the Calculation**: The function computes \((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) \% 2\), which effectively calculates the ceiling of half of the difference between \( x \) and \( y \). This formula is intended to determine the minimum number of side modifications needed because:
   - The part \((x - y) // 2\) gives the number of full side reductions that can be made in pairs.
   - The addition of \((x - y) \% 2\) accounts for any remaining side length that needs to be adjusted after the pairs are handled.

3. **Correctness of the Formula**: The logic of the formula works because at each step:
   - If \( x \) is decremented by 2, it can be repeated while maintaining the other sides the same until \( y \) is reached. If the difference is odd, one additional operation to decrease a side to match \( y \) will be needed.
   - The constraints ensure we never make a side zero or negative since \( y < x \).

Thus, the formula calculates the exact number of seconds needed based on how many total adjustments (each affecting a side) are required to move from \( x \) (the starting length) down to \( y \) (the target length) in a way that maintains the triangle's properties.

Therefore, the logic correctly adheres to the requirements imposed by the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
