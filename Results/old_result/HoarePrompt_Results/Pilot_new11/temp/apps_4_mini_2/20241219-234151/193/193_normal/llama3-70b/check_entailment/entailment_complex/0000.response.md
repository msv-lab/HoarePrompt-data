The program provided does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description. 

### Problem Description Requirements:
- The program must calculate the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to change the side length of an equilateral triangle from x to y while ensuring that at every moment:
  - The triangle remains a non-degenerate triangle (meaning all sides must be positive integers).
  - The program must consider how many modifications are necessary to go from (x, x, x) to (y, y, y).

### Annotated Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    print(abs(x - y))
```
- The function reads two integers, x and y.
- It computes and prints the absolute difference between the two integers (`abs(x - y)`).
- While the absolute difference gives a numerical value representing how far apart x and y are, it does not account for the requirement of maintaining the integrity of the triangle while making the changes.

### Key Mistakes:
1. **No Consideration for Triangle Validity:** The function only computes the difference between x and y without considering the fact that multiple steps may be required to ensure non-degenerate triangles during the modification.
2. **Minimum Number of Seconds Miscalculation:** The output of `abs(x - y)` does not represent the "minimum number of seconds‚Äù needed to transform the triangle from side length x to side length y. The actual process involves multiple steps, reducing the sides progressively while ensuring that all sides remain greater than zero and valid for a triangle.

Based on these points, the program does not implement a logic that adheres to the requirements set forth in the problem description.

Thus, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
