The variables `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` are all assigned new integer values based on the input provided by the user, where each variable must still satisfy the conditions that `1 ≤ n ≤ 100`, `1 ≤ pos ≤ n`, and `1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n`. Other variables remain unaffected by this assignment.

The new values of `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` will depend on the user input which is not specified. Thus, after the assignment, the output must reflect their new values but without specific knowledge of what those values are.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `pos` is an integer such that 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, `l` is an integer such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n, and `r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n.**
