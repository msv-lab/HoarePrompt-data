You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Luba is surfing the Internet. She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.

Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.

What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.


-----Output-----

Print one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].


-----Examples-----
Input
6 3 2 4

Output
5

Input
6 3 1 3

Output
1

Input
5 2 1 5

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.

In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.

In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, pos, l, r) = map(int, input().split())
    if l == 1 and r == n:
        print(0)
    elif l == 1:
        print(abs(pos - r) + 1)
    elif r == n:
        print(abs(pos - l) + 1)
    else:
        move_to_l = abs(pos - l)
        move_to_r = abs(pos - r)
        close_both_sides = min(move_to_l + (r - l + 2), move_to_r + (r - l + 2))
        print(close_both_sides)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its logic against the problem description.

The program is intended to compute the minimum number of seconds Luba requires to close the tabs not in the range [l, r]. The logic has various cases based on the position of l and r relative to the total number of tabs n and the current cursor position pos:

1. If l is 1 and r is n, the function correctly prints 0 because all tabs are already within the desired range.
2. If l is 1 but r is not n, it calculates the time to move to r and close tabs to the right.
3. If r is n but l is not 1, it calculates the time to move to l and close tabs to the left.
4. If neither l nor r cover all tabs, it computes the minimum time required to close the tabs on both sides.

Now let's check if the logic holds for all edge cases:

- Test Case: (n=6, pos=3, l=3, r=4). 
  - Expected Output: 1 (Close to the right from position 3).
  - Calculation: 
    - Moving to left side is not needed (abs(pos - l) + 1) => 0 + 1 = 1.
    - Moving to right side and closing (abs(pos - r) + 1) => 0 + 0 = 0.
    - Result: 1, which is correct.

- Test Case: (n=6, pos=3, l=5, r=6).
  - Expected Output: 5 (Close to the left from position 3, Move to 5, Close both sides).
  - Calculation:
    - Move to l (abs(pos - l) + 1) => 2 + 1 = 3; Move to r (abs(pos - r) + 1) => 3 + 1 = 4. Closing cost is (r - l + 2) => (6 - 5 + 2) = 3.
    - Total: 4 (move to l) + 3 (closing both sides) = 5, which is also correct.

- Test Case: (n=5, pos=2, l=1, r=5).
  - Expected Output: 0 (No action needed).
  - Calculation: 
    - Both sides are within the range, so it prints 0, which is correct.

After testing multiple cases and scenarios, all outputs align with the expected behavior outlined in the problem description.

However, let's look at a potential edge case: 

- Test Case: (n=100, pos=50, l=50, r=100).
  - The program would need to compute the time to move to 50, which is 0 seconds, and then it needs to close all tabs on the left from 50 to 49 (1 second), while tabs on the right will not take any time since they already align with (l, r).
  - Expected Output: The output here must be 1, as the program needs to close the tabs before 50.

In this case, the program fails to account for the edges correctly when `l` and `r` don't encapsulate all tabs perfectly – the closing action should be reflected and added to the output correctly. 

Thus, due to this failure to manage edge cases properly, the correctness of this program does not align with the problem description.

Final conclusion:
Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer between 1 and 100, pos is an integer between 1 and n, l is an integer between 1 and n, and r is an integer between l and n, representing the segment of tabs that need to remain open.
def func():
    n, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())
    if (l == 1 and r == n) :
        print(0)
    else :
        if (l == 1) :
            print(abs(pos - r) + 1)
        else :
            if (r == n) :
                print(abs(pos - l) + 1)
            else :
                move_to_l = abs(pos - l)
                move_to_r = abs(pos - r)
                close_both_sides = min(move_to_l + (r - l + 2), move_to_r + (r - l + 2))
                print(close_both_sides)
            #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`; `l` is an integer between 1 and `n` and greater than 1; `r` is an integer between `l` and `n` and is less than `n`. If `r` is equal to `n`, the output of the calculation is `abs(pos - l) + 1`. Otherwise, `move_to_l` is equal to `abs(pos - l)`, `move_to_r` is equal to `abs(pos - r)`, and `close_both_sides` is equal to `min(move_to_l + (r - l + 2), move_to_r + (r - l + 2))`, which has been printed.
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`; `l` is an integer equal to 1; `r` is an integer between `l` and `n` which is not both equal to `1` and `n`, then the output is `abs(pos - r) + 1`, which evaluates to an integer greater than or equal to 1. If `l` is greater than 1, `r` is an integer between `l` and `n` and less than `n`; if `r` is equal to `n`, the output is `abs(pos - l) + 1`. Otherwise, `move_to_l` is equal to `abs(pos - l)`, `move_to_r` is equal to `abs(pos - r)`, and `close_both_sides` is equal to `min(move_to_l + (r - l + 2), move_to_r + (r - l + 2)`, which has been printed.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`; `l` is an integer equal to 1; `r` is an integer between `l` and `n`. If `l` is 1 and `r` is equal to `n`, the output is 0. If `l` equals 1 and `r` is not equal to `n`, the output is `abs(pos - r) + 1`, which is an integer greater than or equal to 1. If `l` is greater than 1 and `r` is equal to `n`, the output is `abs(pos - l) + 1`. If `l` is greater than 1 and `r` is less than `n`, the values `move_to_l` equals `abs(pos - l)`, `move_to_r` equals `abs(pos - r)`, and the value `close_both_sides` equals `min(move_to_l + (r - l + 2), move_to_r + (r - l + 2)` have been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads four integers from input: `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r`. It calculates and prints the minimum number of moves required to make a segment of tabs defined by indices `l` to `r` closed, based on the current position `pos`. The function handles special cases: if the entire range [1, n] is open, it prints 0; if only one end (either `l` or `r`) is at the bounds, it computes moves accordingly. For cases where both `l` and `r` are not on the edges, it calculates the moves required to close both ends of the segment and prints the minimum moves considering the distance to both edges. The output is always a non-negative integer, representing the number of actions needed to achieve the desired state.
