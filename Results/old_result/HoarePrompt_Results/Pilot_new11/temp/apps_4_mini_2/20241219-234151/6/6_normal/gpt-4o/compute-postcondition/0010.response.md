The variable `move_to_l` is assigned the value of `abs(pos - l)`, which calculates the absolute difference between `pos` and `l`. Given the constraints, `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `l` is an integer between 1 and `n`, and since `l` is greater than 1, both `pos` and `l` are valid values within their defined ranges. The absolute difference ensures that `move_to_l` will always be a non-negative integer.

Since the states of `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` do not change, we include all of the information still valid after the code has been executed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`; `l` is an integer between 1 and `n`; `r` is an integer between `l` and `n`; `l` is greater than 1; `r` is less than `n`; and `r` is not equal to `n`; `move_to_l` is equal to `abs(pos - l)`.**
