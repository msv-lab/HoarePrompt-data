The function `func` accepts four parameters: `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r`. The parameter `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. The parameter `pos` is an integer such that 1 ≤ pos ≤ n. The parameters `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n. 

Based on these inputs, the functionality of the function is to perform operations constrained by these parameters. However, since the output description is not provided, we cannot specify the exact return values or conditions based on them.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, pos, l, and r, where n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), pos is an integer (1 ≤ pos ≤ n), and l and r are integers (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n).**
