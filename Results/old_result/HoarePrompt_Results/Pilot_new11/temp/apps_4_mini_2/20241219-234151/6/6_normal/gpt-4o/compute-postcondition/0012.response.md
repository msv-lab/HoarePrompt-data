The value of `close_both_sides` is assigned the minimum of two expressions: `move_to_l + (r - l + 2)` and `move_to_r + (r - l + 2)`. The variables `move_to_l` and `move_to_r` are previously defined as `abs(pos - l)` and `abs(pos - r)` respectively. Thus, `close_both_sides` is calculated based on the absolute differences between `pos` and the boundaries defined by `l` and `r`, along with the difference `r - l + 2`.

After execution, `close_both_sides` is updated based on the given calculations while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`; `l` is an integer between 1 and `n`; `r` is an integer between `l` and `n`; `l` is greater than 1; `r` is less than `n`; `r` is not equal to `n`; `move_to_l` is equal to `abs(pos - l)`; `move_to_r` is equal to `abs(pos - r)`; `close_both_sides` is equal to `min(move_to_l + (r - l + 2), move_to_r + (r - l + 2))`.**
