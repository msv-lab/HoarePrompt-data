The code `print(abs(pos - l) + 1)` calculates the absolute difference between `pos` and `l`, adds 1 to it, and outputs the result. 

Now, let's analyze the initial state:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 100.
- `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`.
- `l` is an integer between 1 and `n` and greater than 1.
- `r` is an integer between `l` and `n`, less than `n`, and `r` is currently equal to `n`.

Given that `r` equals `n`, this implies that the value of `r` does not affect the calculation. 

The other variables, `pos` and `l`, remain unchanged, while the expression `abs(pos - l) + 1` will produce a specific result that is not further specified in terms of numerical values. Therefore, the output state does not include specific outcomes of these calculations but retains the relationships as per the initial conditions.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`; `l` is an integer between 1 and `n` and greater than 1; `r` is an integer equal to `n`; the output of the calculation is `abs(pos - l) + 1`.**
