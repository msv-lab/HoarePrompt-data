#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100000, cakes is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers r and h (1 ≤ r, h ≤ 10000) representing the radius and height of each cake.
def func_1(n, cakes):
    volumes = [(math.pi * r * r * h) for r, h in cakes]
    dp = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i] = volumes[i]
        
        for j in range(i):
            if volumes[j] < volumes[i]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + volumes[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `dp` contains the maximum volume obtainable for each cake considering all valid stackings, and `volumes` is a list of calculated volumes from the input cakes.
    return max(dp)
    #The program returns the maximum value from the list 'dp', which contains the maximum volume obtainable for each cake considering all valid stackings.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n`, which represents the number of cakes, and a list `cakes` containing tuples of two integers (representing the radius `r` and height `h` of each cake). It calculates the volume of each cake and uses dynamic programming to determine the maximum possible volume obtainable by stacking the cakes, ensuring that a cake can only be placed on top of another if its volume is greater. After iterating through all cakes, the function returns the maximum volume obtainable from the list `dp`, which holds the maximum volume for each cake considering all valid stackings. The function does not handle the case where `n` is zero explicitly, but given the constraints (1 ≤ n), this is not an edge case in practice. The function assumes all inputs follow the specified constraints.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of cakes, and cakes is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers r_i and h_i (radius and height of the i-th cake), such that 1 ≤ r_i, h_i ≤ 10,000 for all i in the range [0, n-1].
def func_2():
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    cakes = [(int(data[2 * i + 1]), int(data[2 * i + 2])) for i in range(n)]
    result = func_1(n, cakes)
    print(f'{result:.6f}')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` processes input data to read the number of cakes and their respective dimensions (radius and height). It accepts input in a specific format, converts this data into a structured list of tuples, and then calls another function `func_1` with the number of cakes and the list of cake dimensions. The result from `func_1` is formatted as a floating-point number with six decimal places and printed. However, it does not handle potential issues related to invalid input formats or values outside the expected range. Additionally, the behavior of `func_1` is not specified, so the output of `func_2` depends on its implementation, which is not detailed here. There is also no error handling for cases where the input might not adhere to the expected structure, which could lead to runtime errors.
