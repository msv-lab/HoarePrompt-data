According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Given that `n` is a positive integer within the range (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), we know that it is guaranteed to be at least 1 when the loop begins. The variable `cakes` is an empty list prior to the loop. 

Since we expect the loop to execute `n` times, no further adjustments are necessary for `n`. The loop will begin with the iteration index set to the first iteration (which is implied as `_` for a `for` loop). 

State: **`n` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), `cakes` is an empty list, and the loop will execute `n` times starting from the first iteration.**
