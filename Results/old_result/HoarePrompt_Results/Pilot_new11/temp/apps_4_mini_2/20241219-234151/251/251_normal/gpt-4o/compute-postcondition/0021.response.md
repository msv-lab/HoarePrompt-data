According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `i` is `i_prev + 1`. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must increment by 1, so it will be 1 in the next iteration. Therefore, for the loop to continue executing, the condition must hold that `j` (which will be 1) is still less than `i`. 

Additionally, since `volumes` is being accessed with `j` and `i`, we need to consider that `i` has not changed and `volumes[i]` must remain valid for this increment.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `j` is 1**
