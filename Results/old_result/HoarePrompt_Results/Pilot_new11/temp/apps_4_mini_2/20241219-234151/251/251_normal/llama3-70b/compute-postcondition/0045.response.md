In this case, the line of code `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + cakes[i][0])` assigns a maximum value to `dp[i]` based on the current value of `dp[i]` and the value of `dp[j]` plus the first element of the `cakes` array corresponding to `i`. 

Given:
- `dp` remains unchanged at all other indices.
- `i` is greater than 0.
- `j` is 0.
- The condition on the `cakes` array indicates that `cakes[i][1]` is less than `cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2]` is less than `cakes[j][2]`.

The only variable affected is `dp[i]`. Its new value will be the maximum of its previous value and the value of `dp[j] + cakes[i][0]`. Since `j` is 0 and is used to access `dp[0]` and the values from `cakes[i]`, we can see that the output state will reflect the updated value of `dp[i]` but not change any other variables.

Output State: **`dp` remains unchanged for all other indices, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and `dp[i]` is updated to max(dp[i], dp[0] + cakes[i][0])**
