You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: As you know, every birthday party has a cake! This time, Babaei is going to prepare the very special birthday party's cake.

Simple cake is a cylinder of some radius and height. The volume of the simple cake is equal to the volume of corresponding cylinder. Babaei has n simple cakes and he is going to make a special cake placing some cylinders on each other.

However, there are some additional culinary restrictions. The cakes are numbered in such a way that the cake number i can be placed only on the table or on some cake number j where j < i. Moreover, in order to impress friends Babaei will put the cake i on top of the cake j only if the volume of the cake i is strictly greater than the volume of the cake j.

Babaei wants to prepare a birthday cake that has a maximum possible total volume. Help him find this value.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of simple cakes Babaei has.

Each of the following n lines contains two integers r_{i} and h_{i} (1 ≤ r_{i}, h_{i} ≤ 10 000), giving the radius and height of the i-th cake.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum volume of the cake that Babaei can make. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 6}.

Namely: let's assume that your answer is a, and the answer of the jury is b. The checker program will consider your answer correct, if $\frac{|a - b|}{\operatorname{max}(1, b)} \leq 10^{-6}$.


-----Examples-----
Input
2
100 30
40 10

Output
942477.796077000

Input
4
1 1
9 7
1 4
10 7

Output
3983.539484752



-----Note-----

In first sample, the optimal way is to choose the cake number 1.

In second sample, the way to get the maximum volume is to use cakes with indices 1, 2 and 4.
Program:
```
import math

def func():
    n = int(input())
    cakes = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (r, h) = map(int, input().split())
        cakes.append((math.pi * r * r * h, r, h))
    cakes.sort(reverse=True)
    dp = [0.0] * n
    dp[0] = cakes[0][0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        dp[i] = cakes[i][0]
        for j in range(i):
            if cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1] and cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + cakes[i][0])
    print(dp[-1])


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program contains a logical flaw regarding the conditions under which cakes can be stacked. According to the problem description, cake i can be placed on top of cake j if and only if the volume of cake i is strictly greater than the volume of cake j. However, in the code, the conditions for stacking compare only the radii and heights of the cakes:

```python
if cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1] and cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]:
```

This condition checks if both the radius and height of cake i are smaller than those of cake j, which does not ensure that the volume condition is met. Consequently, it is possible for volumes to be incorrectly compared if the cakes have different dimensions that lead to cake i having a greater volume than cake j despite having a smaller radius and height.

For example, consider an input with the following cakes:

```
2
2 1
3 1
```

Calculating the volumes:
- Volume of cake 1: \( V_1 = \pi \times (2^2) \times 1 = 4\pi \)
- Volume of cake 2: \( V_2 = \pi \times (3^2) \times 1 = 9\pi \)

Here, the volume of cake 2 is greater than that of cake 1, but in the code's current logic, since the radius of cake 1 (2) is not less than the radius of cake 2 (3) and the height of both cakes is the same, neither cake can be stacked, violating the volume requirement outlined in the problem statement.

Thus, the program fails to guarantee that only cakes with strictly greater volumes are stacked properly, leading to incorrect calculations in the final output.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), and for each cake i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), r_i and h_i are integers representing the radius and height of the cake, respectively, where (1 ≤ r_i, h_i ≤ 10,000).
def func():
    n = int(input())
    cakes = []
    for _ in range(n):
        r, h = map(int, input().split())
        
        cakes.append((math.pi * r * r * h, r, h))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000); `cakes` is a list containing `n` tuples of the form `(math.pi * r * r * h, r, h)` for each input pair of integers `r` and `h`.
    cakes.sort(reverse=True)
    dp = [0.0] * n
    dp[0] = cakes[0][0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        dp[i] = cakes[i][0]
        
        for j in range(i):
            if cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1] and cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + cakes[i][0])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `dp` is a list containing `n` elements where `dp[i]` is the maximum value achievable by considering all previous `cakes[j]` for `j` in the range of [0, i-1] such that `cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]`, initialized such that `dp[0]` equals `cakes[0][0]` and all other `dp[j]` for `j` in the range [1, n-1] contain the best achievable values based on the comparisons; if no valid `j` exists for any `i`, `dp[i]` retains its initialized value `cakes[i][0]`.
    print(dp[-1])


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
