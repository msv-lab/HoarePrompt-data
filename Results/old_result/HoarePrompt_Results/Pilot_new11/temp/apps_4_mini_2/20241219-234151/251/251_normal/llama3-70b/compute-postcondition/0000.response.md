The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and converts it to an integer. This means that `n` will now hold what is taken from user input but still must be within the constraint (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000). Other variables are not affected, so the output state is with regards to the variable `n` being updated. 

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000)**
