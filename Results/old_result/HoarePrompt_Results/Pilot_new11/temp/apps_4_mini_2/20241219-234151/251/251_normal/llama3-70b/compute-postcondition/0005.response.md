According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `n`, which determines how many times the loop will run. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is still the same positive integer as before, and the loop iterates until `_` reaches `n - 1`. Based on the structure of the for loop, if `n` is a positive integer in the range of 1 to 100,000, we need to adjust the states as follows:

Since the loop variable `_` is not used, we do not track it in this context. However, since the loop iterates from 0 to `n - 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be greater than the current number of completed iterations.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` remains the same, but to execute the loop one more time, `n` must remain unchanged. Also, since `cakes`, `r`, and `h` are provided but not modified in terms of their role in the loop, their values would need to be unmodified for the loop to continue processing correctly.

Thus, all relevant states remain unchanged for the next possible execution:

State: **`n` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000); `cakes` is a list containing the tuple `(math.pi * r * r * h, r, h)`; `r` is an input integer; `h` is an input integer**
