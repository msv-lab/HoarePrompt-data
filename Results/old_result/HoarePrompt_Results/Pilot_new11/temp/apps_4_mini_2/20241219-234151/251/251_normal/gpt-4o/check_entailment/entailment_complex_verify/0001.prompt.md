You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: As you know, every birthday party has a cake! This time, Babaei is going to prepare the very special birthday party's cake.

Simple cake is a cylinder of some radius and height. The volume of the simple cake is equal to the volume of corresponding cylinder. Babaei has n simple cakes and he is going to make a special cake placing some cylinders on each other.

However, there are some additional culinary restrictions. The cakes are numbered in such a way that the cake number i can be placed only on the table or on some cake number j where j < i. Moreover, in order to impress friends Babaei will put the cake i on top of the cake j only if the volume of the cake i is strictly greater than the volume of the cake j.

Babaei wants to prepare a birthday cake that has a maximum possible total volume. Help him find this value.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of simple cakes Babaei has.

Each of the following n lines contains two integers r_{i} and h_{i} (1 ≤ r_{i}, h_{i} ≤ 10 000), giving the radius and height of the i-th cake.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum volume of the cake that Babaei can make. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 6}.

Namely: let's assume that your answer is a, and the answer of the jury is b. The checker program will consider your answer correct, if $\frac{|a - b|}{\operatorname{max}(1, b)} \leq 10^{-6}$.


-----Examples-----
Input
2
100 30
40 10

Output
942477.796077000

Input
4
1 1
9 7
1 4
10 7

Output
3983.539484752



-----Note-----

In first sample, the optimal way is to choose the cake number 1.

In second sample, the way to get the maximum volume is to use cakes with indices 1, 2 and 4.
Program:
```
import sys
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(n, cakes):
    volumes = [math.pi * r * r * h for (r, h) in cakes]
    dp = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i] = volumes[i]
        for j in range(i):
            if volumes[j] < volumes[i]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + volumes[i])
    return max(dp)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    cakes = [(int(data[2 * i + 1]), int(data[2 * i + 2])) for i in range(n)]
    result = func_1(n, cakes)
    print(f'{result:.6f}')


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's break down the requirements and the implementation.

### Problem Requirements
1. We are tasked with stacking cakes, following the rules:
   - Cake \( i \) can be placed on Cake \( j \) if \( j < i \).
   - Cake \( i \) can only be placed on Cake \( j \) if the volume of Cake \( i \) is strictly greater than that of Cake \( j \).
2. We need to compute the maximum total volume of cakes that can be stacked based on the constraints above.

### Program Analysis
1. **Volume Calculation**: The program computes the volume using the formula for the volume of a cylinder: 
   \[
   V = \pi r^2 h
   \]
   This calculation appears to be correctly implemented in `func_1`.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: 
   - The `dp` array stores the maximum volume that can be achieved by using each cake as the topmost cake.
   - The logic inside the nested loops correctly compares the volumes of cakes and updates the maximum possible volume for the current cake.
   
3. **Return Value**: The function returns the maximum value in the `dp` array, which represents the maximum volume of the stacked cakes.

### Edge Cases Consideration
Let's consider whether there might be any edge cases not handled by the implementation:

1. **Minimum Input**: 
   If \( n = 1 \), the output should simply be the volume of that single cake. The program handles this correctly since it initializes the `dp` with volume value of the only cake.

2. **Identical Cakes**:
   If there are multiple cakes with the same dimensions:
   - For example:
     ```
     3
     2 3
     2 3
     2 3
     ```
   The volumes are all the same and should yield a correct maximum of 18 (since each cannot be placed atop another). The program remains correct in this case because no stacking is possible.

3. **Strict Comparison Issue**:
   However, a potential edge case causing incorrect behavior might arise from the strictly greater condition in the loops. If two cakes have volumes that are equal, the program does not consider them for stacking, which aligns with the description. As per the problem description though, the implementation's constraint is correct in not allowing equal volumes.

4. **Handling Precision**: 
   The program formats the output correctly to six decimal places, ensuring that it meets the requirement for precision.

### Final Consideration
After reviewing the program against the requirements and the potential edge cases, no errors were identified that could lead to incorrect outputs against the problem description.

### Conclusion
Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the maximum volume of cakes that can be stacked according to the specified constraints, handling all expected edge cases appropriately.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import sys
import math

input = sys.stdin.read
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100000, cakes is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers r and h (1 ≤ r, h ≤ 10000) representing the radius and height of each cake.
def func_1(n, cakes):
    volumes = [(math.pi * r * r * h) for r, h in cakes]
    dp = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i] = volumes[i]
        
        for j in range(i):
            if volumes[j] < volumes[i]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + volumes[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `dp` contains the maximum volume obtainable for each cake considering all valid stackings, and `volumes` is a list of calculated volumes from the input cakes.
    return max(dp)
    #The program returns the maximum value from the list 'dp', which contains the maximum volume obtainable for each cake considering all valid stackings.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n`, which represents the number of cakes, and a list `cakes` containing tuples of two integers (representing the radius `r` and height `h` of each cake). It calculates the volume of each cake and uses dynamic programming to determine the maximum possible volume obtainable by stacking the cakes, ensuring that a cake can only be placed on top of another if its volume is greater. After iterating through all cakes, the function returns the maximum volume obtainable from the list `dp`, which holds the maximum volume for each cake considering all valid stackings. The function does not handle the case where `n` is zero explicitly, but given the constraints (1 ≤ n), this is not an edge case in practice. The function assumes all inputs follow the specified constraints.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of cakes, and cakes is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers r_i and h_i (radius and height of the i-th cake), such that 1 ≤ r_i, h_i ≤ 10,000 for all i in the range [0, n-1].
def func_2():
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    cakes = [(int(data[2 * i + 1]), int(data[2 * i + 2])) for i in range(n)]
    result = func_1(n, cakes)
    print(f'{result:.6f}')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` processes input data to read the number of cakes and their respective dimensions (radius and height). It accepts input in a specific format, converts this data into a structured list of tuples, and then calls another function `func_1` with the number of cakes and the list of cake dimensions. The result from `func_1` is formatted as a floating-point number with six decimal places and printed. However, it does not handle potential issues related to invalid input formats or values outside the expected range. Additionally, the behavior of `func_1` is not specified, so the output of `func_2` depends on its implementation, which is not detailed here. There is also no error handling for cases where the input might not adhere to the expected structure, which could lead to runtime errors.
