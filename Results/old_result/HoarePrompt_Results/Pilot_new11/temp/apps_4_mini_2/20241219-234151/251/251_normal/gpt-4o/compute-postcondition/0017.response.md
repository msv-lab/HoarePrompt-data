In this case, the loop is controlled by the variable `j`, which iterates from `0` to `i - 1` (since `range(i)` generates numbers starting from `0` up to, but not including, `i`). 

The provided state indicates that `n` is a positive integer, meaning it has a value of at least `1`. The variable `i` is defined as `i_prev + 1`, suggesting that it has a value greater than `0` if `i_prev` is non-negative (as it typically would be in most contexts where state variables are used). 

For the loop to execute, `i` must be at least `1`, which falls in line with what we have (since `i` is `i_prev + 1` and positive). The loop should start with `j` initialized at `0`, which is the starting point of its iteration.

Therefore, we need to ensure:
1. `i` is at least `1` (which it is, since `n` is positive and `i_prev` is presumably non-negative).
2. On the first iteration, `j` should be `0`.

Based on the understanding of the states, we can summarize the necessary adjustments.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `j` is 0,  `dp[i]` is equal to `volumes[i]`**
