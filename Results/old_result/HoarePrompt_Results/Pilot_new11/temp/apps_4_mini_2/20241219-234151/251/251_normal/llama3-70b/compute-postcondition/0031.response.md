Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list where `dp[0] = cakes[0][0]`, `dp[1] = cakes[1][0]`, and `dp[n-1] = cakes[n-1][0]`; `dp[j]` for `j` in the range of 2 to `n-2` remains `0.0`; `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` starts from 0, and the current value of `cakes[i][1]` is less than `cakes[j][1]` and the current value of `cakes[i][2]` is less than `cakes[j][2]`.***
