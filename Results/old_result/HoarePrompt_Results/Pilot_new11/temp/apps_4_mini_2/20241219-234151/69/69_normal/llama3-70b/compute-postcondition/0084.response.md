Postcondition: ***`ux` is equal to the number of 'R' in `ops` minus the number of 'L' in `ops`; `uy` is equal to the number of 'U' in `ops` minus the number of 'D' in `ops`; `dx` is equal to `x - ux`; `dy` is equal to `y - uy`; if either `dx` or `dy` is less than 0, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, `res` is printed reflecting the count of invalid operations in `ops`.***
