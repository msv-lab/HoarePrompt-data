`final_y` is incremented by 1. The initial state hasn't specified the previous value of `final_y`, but it is adjusted based on the operation given by `op`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200000), `operations` is a string of length `n`, `op` is the next character in `operations`, `final_y` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200000), `operations` is a string of length `n`, `op` is the next character in `operations`, `final_y` is increased by 1.**
