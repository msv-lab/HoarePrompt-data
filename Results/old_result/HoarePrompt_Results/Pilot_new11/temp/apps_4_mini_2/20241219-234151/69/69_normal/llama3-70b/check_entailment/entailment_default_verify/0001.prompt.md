You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has got a robot which is situated on an infinite Cartesian plane, initially in the cell $(0, 0)$. Robot can perform the following four kinds of operations:   U — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x, y + 1)$;  D — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x, y - 1)$;  L — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x - 1, y)$;  R — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x + 1, y)$. 

Vasya also has got a sequence of $n$ operations. Vasya wants to modify this sequence so after performing it the robot will end up in $(x, y)$.

Vasya wants to change the sequence so the length of changed subsegment is minimum possible. This length can be calculated as follows: $maxID - minID + 1$, where $maxID$ is the maximum index of a changed operation, and $minID$ is the minimum index of a changed operation. For example, if Vasya changes RRRRRRR to RLRRLRL, then the operations with indices $2$, $5$ and $7$ are changed, so the length of changed subsegment is $7 - 2 + 1 = 6$. Another example: if Vasya changes DDDD to DDRD, then the length of changed subsegment is $1$. 

If there are no changes, then the length of changed subsegment is $0$. Changing an operation means replacing it with some operation (possibly the same); Vasya can't insert new operations into the sequence or remove them.

Help Vasya! Tell him the minimum length of subsegment that he needs to change so that the robot will go from $(0, 0)$ to $(x, y)$, or tell him that it's impossible.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer number $n~(1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5)$ — the number of operations.

The second line contains the sequence of operations — a string of $n$ characters. Each character is either U, D, L or R.

The third line contains two integers $x, y~(-10^9 \le x, y \le 10^9)$ — the coordinates of the cell where the robot should end its path.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the minimum possible length of subsegment that can be changed so the resulting sequence of operations moves the robot from $(0, 0)$ to $(x, y)$. If this change is impossible, print $-1$.


-----Examples-----
Input
5
RURUU
-2 3

Output
3

Input
4
RULR
1 1

Output
0

Input
3
UUU
100 100

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example the sequence can be changed to LULUU. So the length of the changed subsegment is $3 - 1 + 1 = 3$.

In the second example the given sequence already leads the robot to $(x, y)$, so the length of the changed subsegment is $0$.

In the third example the robot can't end his path in the cell $(x, y)$.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ops = input()
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    (ux, uy, lx, ly) = (0, 0, 0, 0)
    for op in ops:
        if op == 'U':
            uy += 1
        elif op == 'D':
            uy -= 1
        elif op == 'R':
            ux += 1
        elif op == 'L':
            ux -= 1
    (dx, dy) = (x - ux, y - uy)
    if dx < 0 or dy < 0:
        print(-1)
    else:
        res = 0
        for op in ops:
            if op == 'U' and dy > 0:
                dy -= 1
            elif op == 'D' and dy < 0:
                dy += 1
            elif op == 'R' and dx > 0:
                dx -= 1
            elif op == 'L' and dx < 0:
                dx += 1
            else:
                res += 1
        print(res)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze whether it meets the requirements laid out in the problem description.

**Key requirements given:**
1. The robot needs to start at the origin (0, 0).
2. It should be able to carry out operations that can be altered minimally to get to a target position (x, y).
3. If no changes are needed, the output should be `0`.
4. If it's impossible to reach (x, y) with the given operations, the output should be `-1`.

**Testing the provided code:**

1. **Accumulate movement counts:**
   - The code first counts the effective movements (ux, uy) the robot can make based on the operations string. This part seems correct.
   
2. **Calculate the remaining distance:**
   - It calculates the difference `dx` and `dy` which represent how many more movements in the respective directions are needed to reach (x, y).

3. **Validation logic:**
   - The code checks if `dx` or `dy` is less than zero, which would indicate that it requires more of a direction than what's available. This logic is also correct but it assumes that if `dx < 0` or `dy < 0`, then the movement is impossible, which may lead to incorrect behavior for certain inputs.

4. **Counting required changes:**
   - The robot iterates through the operations and modifies them as needed to minimize the changes. However, this approach does not keep track of the indices of changes directly, which could lead to incorrect results in measuring the length of the changed segment.

**Potential failing case:**
Given the following input:
```
3
RRR
1 1
```
- The robot should be able to reach (1, 1) with minimal changes. However, the current solution counts 3 movements (towards R) and can't provide the correct output which should indicate that all operations have to change from RRR to RU and hence should output `2`. 

Therefore, because the program shows inconsistencies, particularly in calculating the length of the changed subsegment and validating the changes needed to reach (x, y), I conclude that the program does not fully implement the required logic for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func` accepts an integer `n`, a string `ops` consisting of the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R', and two integers `x` and `y`. It tracks movements based on the instructions in `ops`. It calculates two values `ux` and `uy`, which represent the net horizontal and vertical movements from the starting point based on the operations given. It computes the difference `dx` and `dy`, which are the remaining movements required to reach a target position `(x, y)` from the current position. If either `dx` or `dy` is negative after computing, it outputs `-1`, indicating that it's impossible to reach the target based on the operations. If reaching the target is feasible, it counts how many operations in `ops` cannot contribute to a valid movement towards the target (given the current conditions) and outputs that count. Lastly, if no operations can fulfill the movement requirements, `res` will reflect that, potentially outputting the total number of operations that remain redundant. The function properly considers various edge cases, such as when movements cannot make the required adjustments to reach `(x, y)`, and it ensures to evaluate each operation relevantly.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
