Postcondition: ***`final_x` is the result of the net movements in the horizontal direction calculated as (number of 'R' - number of 'L'); `final_y` is the result of the net movements in the vertical direction calculated as (number of 'U' - number of 'D'); `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200000); `operations` is a string of length `n`; `dx` is equal to `x - final_x`; `dy` is equal to `y - final_y`. The current value of `dx` is 0 and the current value of `dy` is 0.***
