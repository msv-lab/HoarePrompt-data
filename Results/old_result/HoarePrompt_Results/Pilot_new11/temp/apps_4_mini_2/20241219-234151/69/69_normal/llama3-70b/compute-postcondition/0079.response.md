Postcondition: ***`ux` is the number of 'R' minus 'L' in `ops`, `uy` is the number of 'U' minus 'D' in `ops`. If `op` is 'R' and `dx` is greater than 0, then `dx` is updated to `x - ux - 1` and `dy` remains equal to `y - uy`, with `res` still equal to 0 and at least one operation remaining in `ops`. If the `op` is not 'R', and if `op` is 'L' while `dx` is less than 0, `dx` is updated to `x - ux + 1`, `dy` remains equal to `y - uy`, and `res` remains 0 with at least one operation left in `ops`. Otherwise, `dx` remains `x - ux`, `dy` remains `y - uy`, and `res` is set to 1, with at least one operation remaining in `ops.***
