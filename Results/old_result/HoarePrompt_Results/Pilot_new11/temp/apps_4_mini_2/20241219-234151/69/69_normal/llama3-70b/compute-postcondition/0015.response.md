The variable `ux` is decremented by 1. The other variables `n`, `ops`, and `op` remain unchanged. The information about these variables indicates that `n` is greater than 0 and that `op` is 'L', which remains valid. Thus, the output state is updated accordingly to reflect the change in `ux`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `ops` is a string of length `n`, `op` is the first character of `ops`, `op` is not equal to 'U', `op` is not equal to 'D', `op` is not equal to 'R', current value of `op` is 'L', `ux` has been decremented by 1.**
