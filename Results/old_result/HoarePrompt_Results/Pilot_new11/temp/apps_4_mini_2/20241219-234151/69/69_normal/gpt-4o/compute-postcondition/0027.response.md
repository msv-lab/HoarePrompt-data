According to the code, the loop processes each character in the `operations` string. Since `n` is a positive integer representing the number of operations, and the loop iterates over each operation in the string, the loop can execute again as long as the current index of iteration is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, we know that all operations have been processed until the last one if we assume that the iteration is complete. Thus, for it to execute one more time, `op` would need to represent the next character in the `operations` string. Since we've processed all characters, there would be no further operations left to process.

The states must be adjusted as follows:
- To permit the continuation of the loop, `operations` must have one more character, thereby requiring `n` to be at least one more.

Thus, since `n` is currently `n` (1 <= n <= 200000), for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least `n + 1`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200001), and `operations` is a string of length `n + 1`.**
