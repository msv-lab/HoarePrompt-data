Postcondition: ***`ux` is the number of 'R' minus 'L' in `ops`, `uy` is the number of 'U' minus 'D' in `ops`, `dx` will be equal to `x - ux`, and `dy` will be equal to `y - uy` with at least one more operation remaining in `ops`. If `op` is 'U' and `dy` is greater than 0, then `dy` is decreased by 1. If `op` is 'D' and `dy` is less than 0, then `dy` is updated to `y - uy + 1`. If `op` is 'R' and `dx` is greater than 0, then `dx` is updated to `x - ux - 1`. If `op` is 'L' and `dx` is less than 0, then `dx` is updated to `x - ux + 1`. Otherwise, `dx` remains `x - ux`, `dy` remains `y - uy`, and `res` is set to 1. The value of `res` remains 0 if the first condition was true, and it reflects whether any of the other conditions were met.***
