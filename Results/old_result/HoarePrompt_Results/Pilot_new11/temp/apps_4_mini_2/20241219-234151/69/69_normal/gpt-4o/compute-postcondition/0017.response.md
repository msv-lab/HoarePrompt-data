Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200000), `operations` is a string of length `n`, `x` is the initial x-coordinate, and `y` is the initial y-coordinate. If the first character of `operations`, `op`, is 'U', then `final_x` is 0 and `final_y` is 1. If `op` is 'D', `final_x` is 0 and `final_y` is -1. If `op` is 'L', `final_x` is -1 and `final_y` is 0. Otherwise, if `op` is 'R', then `final_x` is 1 and `final_y` remains 0.***
