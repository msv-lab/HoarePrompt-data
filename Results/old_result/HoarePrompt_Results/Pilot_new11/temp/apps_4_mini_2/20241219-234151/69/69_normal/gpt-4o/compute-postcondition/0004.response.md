The value of `final_y` is incremented by 1 due to the upward movement indicated by the operation 'U'. The initial preconditions state that `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200000), and since `final_y` is initially 0, it will now take the value of 1. Other variables remain unchanged in this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200000), `operations` is a string of length `n`, `x` is the initial x-coordinate, `y` is the initial y-coordinate, `final_x` is 0, `final_y` is 1, and the first character of `operations`, `op`, is equal to 'U'**.
