Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200000), and `operations` is a string of length `n`. If `op` is 'U', then `final_y` is increased by 1. If `op` is 'D', `final_y` is decreased by 1; if `op` is 'L', `final_x` is decreased by 1 and `final_y` remains unchanged; if `op` is 'R', `final_x` is incremented by 1 while `final_y` remains unchanged. If `op` is neither 'L', 'R', nor 'D', `final_x` and `final_y` remain unchanged.***
