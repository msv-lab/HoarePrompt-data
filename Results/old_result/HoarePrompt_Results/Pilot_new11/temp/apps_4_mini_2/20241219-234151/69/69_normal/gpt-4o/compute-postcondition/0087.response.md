Postcondition: ***`final_x` and `final_y` are the results of net movements, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`. If `operations[i]` is 'D', `current_y` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, if `operations[i]` is 'L', `current_x` is decreased by 1; if `operations[i]` is 'R', `current_x` is increased by 1, reflecting the updated state of the program with the modified value of `current_x`.***
