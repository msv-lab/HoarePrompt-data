`final_x` is decremented by 1, making it `final_x = -1`. The other variables remain unchanged since they are not affected by the operation. The values of the variables prior to this operation were: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200000), `operations` is a string of length `n`, `x` is the initial x-coordinate, `y` is the initial y-coordinate, and `final_y` remains 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200000), `operations` is a string of length `n`, `x` is the initial x-coordinate, `y` is the initial y-coordinate, `final_x` is -1, `final_y` is 0**.
