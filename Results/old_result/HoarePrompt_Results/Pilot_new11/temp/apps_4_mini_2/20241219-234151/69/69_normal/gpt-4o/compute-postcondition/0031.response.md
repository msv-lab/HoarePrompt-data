The value of `final_x` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `final_x` is unknown, so we cannot specify the exact value it holds after the operation. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200001), and `operations` is a string of length `n + 1`; `final_x` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200001), `operations` is a string of length `n + 1`, `final_x` is increased by 1**
