The `print(res)` statement outputs the value of `res`, which counts the operations in `ops` that could not make a valid movement according to the conditions of the loop. The values of `ux`, `uy`, `dx`, and `dy` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the print statement. Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged variables alongside the value of `res`.

Output State: **`ux` is the number of 'R' in `ops` minus the number of 'L' in `ops`, `uy` is the number of 'U' in `ops` minus the number of 'D' in `ops`, `dx` is equal to `x - ux`, `dy` is equal to `y - uy`, `res` is printed with its value reflecting the count of invalid operations in `ops`.**
