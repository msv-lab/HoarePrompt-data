The function `func` does not explicitly take any parameters as per the provided definition; however, it relies on two input types: `n`, an integer, and `ops`, a string consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R'. It also uses two integers `x` and `y`. 

The constraints for these inputs are:
- `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 200000.
- `ops` is a string of length `n` made up of the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R'.
- `x` and `y` are integers that can range from -10^9 to 10^9.

While the specific behavior of the function is not detailed in terms of return values, based on the output constraints, it indicates that the function performs certain operations based on the characters in the `ops` string and possibly modifies the coordinates `x` and `y`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n`, a string `ops`, and two integers `x` and `y`, and it performs movements based on the characters in `ops` while operating within the specified constraints.**
