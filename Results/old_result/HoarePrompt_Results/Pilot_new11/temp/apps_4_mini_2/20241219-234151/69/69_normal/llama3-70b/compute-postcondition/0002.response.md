The code assigns values to `x` and `y` using input values that are split and converted to integers. The initial state indicates that `n` is an input integer and does not limit the possible values for `x` and `y`, which could have been initialized previously. Hence, both `x` and `y` are assigned new integer values based on the user input. 

Since the initial input values of `x` and `y` are unknown, we simply note that they are replaced by new values from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer; `ops` is a string of length `n`; `x` and `y` are input integers.**
