The operation `dy -= 1` decrements the value of `dy` by 1. Given that the current value of `dy` is greater than 0, the resulting value of `dy` will still be a positive integer after the operation.

The other variables `ux`, `uy`, `dx`, `x`, `y`, `ops`, `res`, and `op` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`ux` is the number of 'R' in `ops` minus the number of 'L' in `ops`, `uy` is the number of 'U' in `ops` minus the number of 'D' in `ops`, `dx` is equal to `x - ux`, `dy` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `ops` must be a non-empty string of length greater than 0, `res` is 0, `op` is 'U'**.
