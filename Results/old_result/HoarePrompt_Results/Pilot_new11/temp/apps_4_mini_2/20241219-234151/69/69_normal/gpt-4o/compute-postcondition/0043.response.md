The value of `current_x` is assigned the value of `0`. The initial states of the other variables remain unaffected as they do not influence `current_x`. Therefore, the Output State is: `final_x` is the result of the net movements in the horizontal direction calculated as (number of 'R' - number of 'L'); `final_y` is the result of the net movements in the vertical direction calculated as (number of 'U' - number of 'D'); `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200000); `operations` is a string of length `n`; `dx` is equal to `x - final_x`; `dy` is equal to `y - final_y`; either `dx` is not equal to 0 or `dy` is not equal to 0; `min_length` is set to positive infinity (float('inf')); `current_x` is 0.
