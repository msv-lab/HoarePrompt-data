To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze how the variables `ux` and `uy` are affected by each operation in the `ops` string. 

1. **Initial Assessments**:
   - `n` is an integer representing the length of the string `ops`.
   - `ux` and `uy` are initialized to 0.
   - The loop iterates over each character in `ops`, and for every character, the state of `ux` or `uy` changes based on whether the character is 'U', 'D', 'R', or 'L'.

2. **Output States**:
   - For each character in `ops`, if it is 'U', `uy` will be increased by 1. If it is 'D', `uy` will be decreased by 1. If 'R', `ux` is increased by 1, and if 'L', `ux` is decreased by 1.

3. **Final Output State**:
   - After processing all characters in `ops`, `uy` will be equal to the difference between the count of 'U' and 'D' operations, and `ux` will be the difference between the count of 'R' and 'L' operations.
   - If the loop does not execute (i.e., if `n` is 0), then `ux` and `uy` will remain 0.

Putting this together, we conclude that:

- When the loop has executed zero times (thus `n` is 0): `ux` is 0, `uy` is 0.
- After all iterations of the loop execute, `ux` and `uy` are dependent on the counts of respective operations in `ops`.

Therefore, the final output state will reflect these changes:

Output State: **`ux` is equal to the number of 'R' in `ops` minus the number of 'L' in `ops`; `uy` is equal to the number of 'U' in `ops` minus the number of 'D' in `ops`; `ops` is a string of length `n`, and `n` is a non-negative integer.**
