The code updates the `position_map` dictionary by setting the key `(current_x, current_y)` to the value `i`. This means that the position `(current_x, current_y)` is now associated with the index `i` in `position_map`. The values of `final_x`, `final_y`, `n`, `min_length`, and `target_pos` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`final_x` and `final_y` are the results of net movements; `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200000); `position_map` now includes the key `(current_x, current_y)` with the value `i`; `min_length` remains unchanged.**
