The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a single integer representing the number of squares that Sofia wants to draw, where 1 <= n <= 10^9. Since the function does not have a given return value stated in the provided information, the specific output is not described. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept an integer `n` that indicates the number of squares to be drawn, adhering to the constraint that `n` must be between 1 and 10^9. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n representing the number of squares Sofia wants to draw, where 1 <= n <= 10^9.**
