The problem requires us to find the minimum number of segments that Sofia will have to draw without a guide in order to create `n` squares on a grid. The provided program calculates the perimeter of potential rectangular configurations based on the factors of `n`, minimizing the known segments drawn with a ruler.

Let's analyze the program and its output hints:

1. **Understanding the Code**:
   - The function `func_1(n)` iterates over possible dimensions `a` that represent one side of the rectangle. The other side `b` is calculated as the ceiling of `n / a`.
   - For each divisor pair `(a, b)`, it computes `segments_needed`, which is essentially twice the sum of `a` and `b` (the perimeter of the rectangle). It tracks the minimum of these values.

2. **Output Hints**: 
   - According to the output hints, the function correctly computes the minimum number of segments for all positive integers `n`.

3. **Examples Provided**:
   - For `n = 1`, the expected output is `2`, which corresponds to drawing two segments forming a square.
   - For `n = 2`, the minimum segments needed is `3`, as described in the example.
   - For `n = 4`, the minimum segments return `4`, which indeed corresponds to the perimeter drawn by those squares.

4. **Assumptions**: 
   - The code does not handle non-positive integers or invalid input types, which would not be necessary in the context of the problem since the input constraints guarantee that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`.

5. **Code Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - All edge cases based on specifications seem to be correctly handled by adjusting for factor pairs. The inner workings ensure a correct calculation for the minimum segments needed without drawing unnecessary guides.

Based on the above, the provided code fulfills all conditions set forth in the problem description and analyzes the requirements fully. Therefore, I am concluding that the program is correct:

Correctness: **True**. 

Explanation: The code successfully computes the minimum number of segments needed for any positive integer `n` that corresponds to drawing squares, aligning with expected outputs from the problem description. It effectively evaluates possible factor pairs to minimize the segment count as required.
