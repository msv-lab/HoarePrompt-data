You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Little Sofia is in fourth grade. Today in the geometry lesson she learned about segments and squares. On the way home, she decided to draw $n$ squares in the snow with a side length of $1$. For simplicity, we assume that Sofia lives on a plane and can draw only segments of length $1$, parallel to the coordinate axes, with vertices at integer points.

In order to draw a segment, Sofia proceeds as follows. If she wants to draw a vertical segment with the coordinates of the ends $(x, y)$ and $(x, y+1)$. Then Sofia looks if there is already a drawn segment with the coordinates of the ends $(x', y)$ and $(x', y+1)$ for some $x'$. If such a segment exists, then Sofia quickly draws a new segment, using the old one as a guideline. If there is no such segment, then Sofia has to take a ruler and measure a new segment for a long time. Same thing happens when Sofia wants to draw a horizontal segment, but only now she checks for the existence of a segment with the same coordinates $x$, $x+1$ and the differing coordinate $y$.

For example, if Sofia needs to draw one square, she will have to draw two segments using a ruler:  [Image] 

After that, she can draw the remaining two segments, using the first two as a guide:  [Image] 

If Sofia needs to draw two squares, she will have to draw three segments using a ruler:  [Image] 

After that, she can draw the remaining four segments, using the first three as a guide:  [Image] 

Sofia is in a hurry, so she wants to minimize the number of segments that she will have to draw with a ruler without a guide. Help her find this minimum number.


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^{9}$), the number of squares that Sofia wants to draw.

Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its logic against the described problem. 

The problem requires us to find the minimum number of segments that Sofia has to draw using a ruler for drawing `n` unit squares. As per the examples given in the problem description, we can summarize the expected outputs:

- For `n = 1`, the expected output is `2`.
- For `n = 2`, the expected output is `3`.
- For `n = 4`, the expected output is `4`.

Let's delve into the code:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    print(2 * (n.bit_length() - 1) + 2)
```

### Code function breakdown:
1. `n.bit_length()` calculates the number of bits necessary to represent `n` in binary, effectively giving us the index of the highest bit that is set.
2. The expression `n.bit_length() - 1` gives the maximum power of 2 less than or equal to `n`.
3. The calculation then multiplies this by 2 and adds 2.

### Assessing the logic behind the formula:
The formula used in the program seems to attempt to compute the number of segments that may need to be drawn based on the number of squares. However, let's analyze:
- For `n = 1`: 
  - Expected: 2; Calculation: `2 * (1.bit_length() - 1) + 2` -> `2 * (1 - 1) + 2 = 0 + 2 = 2`.
- For `n = 2`:
  - Expected: 3; Calculation: `2 * (2.bit_length() - 1) + 2` -> `2 * (2 - 1) + 2 = 2 + 2 = 4` (Incorrect).
- For `n = 3`:
  - Expected: 4; Calculation: `2 * (3.bit_length() - 1) + 2` -> `2 * (2 - 1) + 2 = 2 + 2 = 4`.
- For `n = 4`:
  - Expected: 4; Calculation: `2 * (4.bit_length() - 1) + 2` -> `2 * (3 - 1) + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6` (Incorrect).

The output for `n = 2` and `n = 4` does not match the required outputs: it outputs 4 and 6, where the expected outputs are 3 and 4.

### Conclusion:
Since we found that the program does not produce the correct results for all inputs (specifically for `n = 2` and `n = 4`), the program is **not** correct.

Correctness: **False** 

The program fails for the input `n = 2` where it should output `3` but outputs `4`, and also fails for `n = 4` where it should output `4` but outputs `6`.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads an integer input `n` from the user, which represents the number of squares Sofia wants to draw (where 1 <= n <= 10^9). It then calculates and prints the perimeter length of a square arrangement based on the bit length of `n` by using the formula `2 * (n.bit_length() - 1) + 2`. However, the function does not return this value nor does it provide any handling for cases where the input might be out of the specified range or invalid. The final state of the program will be that it outputs an integer representing a calculated value based on the input `n`, but it does not store or return this result for further use.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
