According to the code, the loop iterates over the `marks`. The current state indicates that `i` is the original value of `n-1`, and `marks` contains previously processed entries. Since the loop is based on `marks`, for the loop to execute another time, `i` must represent the next item in `marks`. The last value of `i` is the last item processed in the previous loop iteration. Thus, `i` should increase by 1 to the next index, and we must also ensure that there are still items left in `marks` to process.

Since `i` is currently the index of the last element processed in `marks`, we need to ensure that the next value of `i` stays within the bounds of `marks`. If `marks` is non-empty and `i` is currently at value `n-1`, then the next index will be `n`, which is out of bounds, considering `i` should be less than the size of `marks`.

However, if the loop is designed to process all elements in `marks`, then for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented and `marks` must contain at least `n` items. Therefore, we also need to ensure that `additional_marks` can still take new values.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `l` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `l` <= 10^9; `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` < `y` <= `l`; `y` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` < `y` <= `l`; `i` is the next index after current `i`, `marks` must contain at least `n` elements.**
