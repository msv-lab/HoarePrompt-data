Output State: **`n` is a positive integer in the range [2, 100000]; `i` is 1; `j` is `n`; `need_x` is True if there exists at least one `j` such that `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `x`, otherwise it is False; `need_y` is True if there exists at least one `j` such that `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `y`, otherwise it is False; `marks` is the same as the initial set of integers from the input.**
