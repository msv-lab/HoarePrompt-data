According to the code, the loop will execute based on the variable `j` which ranges from `i` to `n - 1`. Since the initial state has `i` set to 1, the loop will start with `j` equal to 1 and continue until `j` is equal to `n - 1`. This means for the loop to execute at least one iteration, `n` must be at least 2.

Since `n` is already stated to be a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, this condition is satisfied. Importantly, there's nothing else in the provided states that needs to be adjusted as they all are consistent with the loopâ€™s execution.

Thus, we need to clarify that:

- The value of `j` will be 1 at the start of the loop, representing the second element in the `marks` set (since `i` is 1). 

No additional conditions need to be made on `need_x` and `need_y` variables, as they don't directly affect whether the loop can execute; they likely contribute to the logic within the loop but don't affect the loop's ability to start.

State: **`n` is a positive integer in range [2, 100000], `i` is 1, `j` is 1**
