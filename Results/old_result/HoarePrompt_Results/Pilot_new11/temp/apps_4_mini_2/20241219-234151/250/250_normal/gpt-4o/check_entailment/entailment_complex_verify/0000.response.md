Upon analyzing the annotated version of the program and the problem description, it appears that the program's logic does not properly ensure that both required jump distances `x` and `y` can be measured from the existing marks. The original assessment pointed out weaknesses in the program's checks for existing marks and the potential oversight in the conditions that lead to adding new marks.

The original assessment correctly highlighted that the program might not adequately handle scenarios where both distances need to be covered collectively. Specifically, if one distance is found but the other is not, the program does not consider whether the addition of marks could actually fulfill both requirements simultaneously. 

In the annotations provided, several points emphasize conditions where only one of the distances may be identified. If `x_found` is True and `y_found` is False, or vice versa, the program attempts to establish a new mark based on combinations that may not suffice to ensure that both distances can be measured. 

Using the example from the original assessment:
- For input:
   ```
   3 100 60 80
   0 60 100
   ```
   The program would find `x` but not `y`. The current logic does not appropriately extend the evaluation to ensure that both potential distances can be validated together.

Therefore, the reasoning in the original assessment stands valid, indicating that there are fundamental flaws in the program's approach to add necessary marks for both jump distances and cover all possible edge cases.

Final: **False**
