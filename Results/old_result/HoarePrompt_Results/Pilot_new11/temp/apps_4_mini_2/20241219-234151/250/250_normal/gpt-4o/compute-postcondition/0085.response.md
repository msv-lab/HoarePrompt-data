The code appends the value of `y` to the `result` list. Since `y_found` is currently False, the condition for appending holds true. Other states remain as they were.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `l` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9; `x` and `y` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`, with 0 < `a[i]` < `l` for 1 ≤ `i` < `n`; `marks` is a list of integers; `marks_set` is a set of unique elements from `marks`; `new_marks` is an empty list; `x_found` is False; `y_found` is False; `result` now includes the value of `x` if `x_found` was False; `result` includes the value of `y since y_found` is False.**
