The variable `need_x` is assigned the value `True`, and none of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `j`, `marks`) are affected by this assignment. The initial state information remains valid after the execution, but the state of `need_x` is now explicitly set to `True`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer in the range [2, 100000], `i` is 1, `j` is 1, the difference between `marks[j]` and `marks[i]` is equal to `x`, and `need_x` is True.**
