The operation `new_marks.add(mark + x)` updates the `new_marks` set by adding a new element which is the sum of `mark` and `x`. The variable `mark` is derived from the `marks` list, and `x` is a positive integer that is less than `y`. Since the values of `mark` and `x` are not explicitly defined in the initial state, `mark` takes its current value from the `marks` list while `x` remains a defined positive integer.

The key components of the output state are:
- `new_marks` now contains an additional element which is `mark + x`. 
- The previous elements in `new_marks` are retained, and no other variables are affected.
- All previous information about the variables remains valid.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `l` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9; `x` and `y` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`, with 0 < `a[i]` < `l` for 1 ≤ `i` < `n`; `marks` is a list of integers; `marks_set` is a set of unique elements from `marks`; `new_marks` now includes the value `mark + x` along with its previous elements.*
