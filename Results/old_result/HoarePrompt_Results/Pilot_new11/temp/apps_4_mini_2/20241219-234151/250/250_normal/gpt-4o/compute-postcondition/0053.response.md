According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `marks` list. At the end of the last iteration, the loop was processing the current `mark` from the `marks` list. Since the loop iterates over all elements in `marks`, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to move to the next `mark`. 

Given that `marks` is non-empty, if we are currently processing a `mark`, to check for the next iteration, we can infer that in the next iteration, it will process the next `mark` in the list. The loop's index (or the item being processed) would increase by 1.

As there is no explicit variable to track the index of the `mark` being processed, we can presume that the context of the loop will handle the iteration of `mark` as it naturally progresses to the next element.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, there remains no change in the other states, and we can expect to process the next `mark` in the `marks` list. Subsequently, the state will indicate that we will have the next `mark` for the upcoming iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `l` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9; `x` and `y` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`, with 0 < `a[i]` < `l` for 1 ≤ `i` < `n` and the sequence is strictly increasing; `marks` is a non-empty list of integers; `marks_set` is a set containing the unique elements from `marks`; if `y_found` is False and for some `mark` in `marks_set`, either `mark + y + x`, `mark + y - x`, or `mark - y + x` exists in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` includes `mark + y`. Otherwise, if either `mark - y + x` or `mark - y - x` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` includes `mark - y; currently processing mark is the next mark in `marks`.**
