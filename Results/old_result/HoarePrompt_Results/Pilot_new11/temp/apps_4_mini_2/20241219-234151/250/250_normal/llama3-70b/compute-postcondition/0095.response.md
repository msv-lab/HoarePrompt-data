The code appends the value of `i + j` to the list `additional_marks`. The conditions state that `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and not an element in `marks`, so there are no contradictions in the operation. The values of `i`, `j`, and `additional_marks` are affected.

After executing the code, `additional_marks` will now contain one additional value, which is `i + j`. The other variables remain unchanged based on the provided conditions.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `l` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `l` <= 10^9, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` < `y` <= `l`, `y` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` < `y` <= `l`, `i` is less than `n`, `marks` contains at least `n` elements, `additional_marks` contains at least one element, `j` is the first element in `additional_marks`, `additional_marks` now contains `i + j`.**
