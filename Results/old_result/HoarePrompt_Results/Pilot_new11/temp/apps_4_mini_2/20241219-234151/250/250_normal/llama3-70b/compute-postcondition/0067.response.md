Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `l` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `l` <= 10^9; `x` and `y` are positive integers such that 1 <= `x` < `y` <= `l`; `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the marks on the ruler with `a[0]` being 0 and `a[n-1]` being `l`; `marks` is a set of integers from the input; if `need_y` is False, then `need_x` is also False, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `n-1`, and `additional_marks` includes the integers `x` and `y`, with `y` appended to `additional_marks`.***
