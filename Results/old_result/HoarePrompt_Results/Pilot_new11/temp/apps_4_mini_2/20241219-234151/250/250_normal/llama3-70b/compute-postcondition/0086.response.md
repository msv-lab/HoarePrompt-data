Evaluating the code snippet provided, `additional_marks.append(i + j)` adds the result of the expression `i + j` to the list `additional_marks`. Since `additional_marks` must contain at least 2 elements and `j` is defined as the next element in `additional_marks`, the operation modifies the list `additional_marks`.

The variables `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, and `marks` remain unchanged as the code does not affect them. 

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `l` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `l` <= 10^9, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` < `y` <= `l`, `y` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` < `y` <= `l`, `i` is the next index after the current `i`, `marks` contains at least `n` elements, `additional_marks` now contains at least 3 elements with the last element being `i + j`.**
