To determine the necessary adjustments for the given for loop to execute, we must analyze the input state and the conditions required for the loop to function correctly.

Here are the relevant components derived from the provided state:
- `marks` is a list of integers which needs at least one element for the loop to execute.
- The properties of `marks` suggest it must be non-empty, and since `marks_set` contains unique elements from `marks`, there should also be at least one unique element in `marks_set`.

The key points to ensure that the loop executes are:
1. **`marks` should not be empty**: If there are no elements in `marks`, the loop would not run. Therefore, we need to establish a condition where `marks` contains at least one integer.
2. **`x_found` and `y_found`** must be set up such that their initial state does not prevent the logic of the loop from progressing. However, since the requirement states that either `x_found` or `y_found` is False, we can assume that one of them is initially False, which is acceptable and does not need modification.
3. The existing conditions of `n`, `l`, and the properties of `a` do not impact the execution of the loop itself, as they are unrelated to the `marks` list.

Given this analysis:

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `l` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9; `x` and `y` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`, with 0 < `a[i]` < `l` for 1 ≤ `i` < `n` and the sequence is strictly increasing; `marks` is a non-empty list of integers; `marks_set` is a set containing the unique elements from `marks`; `x_found` or `y_found` is False; `new_marks` is an empty set.**
