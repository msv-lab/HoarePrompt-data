Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer in the range [4, 100000]; `i` is 2; `j` is 4; `need_x` is True; `need_y` is True or False; `marks` remains the same as the initial set of integers from the input. If the difference between `marks[j]` and `marks[i]` equals `y`, the condition is satisfied; otherwise, no further operations are performed.***
