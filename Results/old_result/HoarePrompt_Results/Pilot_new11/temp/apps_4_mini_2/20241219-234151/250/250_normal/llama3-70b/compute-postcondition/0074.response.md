The code `additional_marks.append(i + j)` appends a new element, which is the sum of `i` and `j`, to the list `additional_marks`. The values of `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are not changed with this operation, but `additional_marks` is updated to include the new sum. At this point, there is no information about the specific values of `i`, `j`, or the existing contents of `additional_marks`, except that `additional_marks` must have integers for the loop to execute again.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `l` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `l` <= 10^9; `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` < `y` <= `l`; `y` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` < `y` <= `l`; `additional_marks` has a new integer which is `i + j` appended to it; `j` is the next value in `additional_marks`.**
