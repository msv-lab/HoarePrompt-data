The code outputs a string that is a space-separated list of the elements in `additional_marks`. No variables are modified in their previous values, as the operation only affects the output of the code execution. Since `marks` is unchanged and contains at least `n` elements, and `additional_marks` is referred to in the print statement, we assume `additional_marks` has been defined prior to this output operation. The length of `additional_marks` can be inferred to allow for this operation to occur.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `l` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `l` <= 10^9; `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` < `y` <= `l`; `y` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` < `y` <= `l`; `marks` is unchanged and contains at least `n` elements; `additional_marks` is an iterable with elements; the length of `additional_marks` is printed.**
