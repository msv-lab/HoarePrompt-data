Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `l` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9; `x` and `y` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`, with 0 < `a[i]` < `l` for 1 ≤ `i` < `n` and the sequence is strictly increasing; `marks` is a non-empty list of integers; `marks_set` is a set containing the unique elements from `marks`; `x_found` is False, and `y_found` is False; and for some `mark` in `marks_set`, one of the following holds true: `mark + y + x` is in `marks_set`, or `mark + y - x` is in `marks_set`, or `mark - y + x` is in `marks_set`. The values of the variables remain unchanged except for possible modifications to `new_marks`.***
