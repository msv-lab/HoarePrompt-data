According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `additional_marks` list. The loop will continue to iterate as long as there are elements in `additional_marks`. At the end of the last iteration, we have the variables `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `i`, and a list `additional_marks`. 

Since we don't have the explicit value of `j` used in the last iteration or the remaining elements in `additional_marks`, we must consider the conditions for one more iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `additional_marks` must still have at least one element left to iterate through.

Assuming `additional_marks` contained at least one element during the last iteration, we need to incrementally handle the following:
- `j` in the loop will take values from `additional_marks`, so for one more iteration, we want `j` to be the next available element in `additional_marks`.

However, without knowing the state of `additional_marks` beyond its ability to have elements, we do not modify the intrinsic states. Instead, our aim is to represent that there may still be elements in `additional_marks` for at least one more iteration. Thus, if `additional_marks` originally contained a certain number of elements, it must still have elements greater than the previous loop count.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `l` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `l` <= 10^9; `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` < `y` <= `l`; `y` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` < `y` <= `l`; `additional_marks` must contain at least one more element**
