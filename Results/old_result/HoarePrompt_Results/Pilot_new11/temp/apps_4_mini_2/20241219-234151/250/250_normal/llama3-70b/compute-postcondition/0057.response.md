The value of `need_y` is set to True, but it does not impact any other variables that are defined in the initial state. Therefore, all other variable states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer in the range [4, 100000]; `i` is 2; `j` is 4; `need_x` is True; `need_y` is True; `marks` is the same as the initial set of integers from the input.**
