The code `new_state = list(current)` converts `current` (which is presumably a string) into a list of its characters. The variable `new_state` will hold this list representation of the `current` string. The previous values of `current`, `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `new_row`, `new_col`, and `new_pos` are unaffected after this operation.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing three characters from {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X'; `directions` has at least one remaining direction to process; `current` is the state removed from the front of `queue`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`; `empty_row` is r; `empty_col` is c; `new_row` is r + dr; `new_col` is c + dc; `new_pos` is `new_row * 2 + new_col`; `new_state` is a list of characters from `current`.**
