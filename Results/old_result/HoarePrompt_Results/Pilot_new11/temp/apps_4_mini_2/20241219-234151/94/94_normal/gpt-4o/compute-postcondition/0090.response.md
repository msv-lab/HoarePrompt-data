The operation `queue.append(new_state_str)` adds `new_state_str` to the `queue`. Given that `visited` currently includes `new_state_str`, we know that `new_state_str` is now added to `queue`. The other variable states remain unchanged and valid as per the initial conditions.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing three characters from {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X'; `visited` includes `new_state_str`; `queue` now includes `new_state_str` and is not empty; `current` is a specific string representation of a state; `empty_pos` corresponds to `new_pos`; `new_state` is the list representation of `current` with swapped values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos`.**
