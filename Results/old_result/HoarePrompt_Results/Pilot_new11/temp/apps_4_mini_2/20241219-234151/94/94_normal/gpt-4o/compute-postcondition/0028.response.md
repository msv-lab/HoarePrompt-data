Postcondition: ***`start` is a string of length 4 containing three characters from {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X'; if `0 <= new_row < 2 and 0 <= new_col < 2`, then if `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, it is added to `visited` and included in `queue`. If `new_state_str` is already in `visited`, no changes are made to `visited` or `queue`.***
