The variables `new_row` and `new_col` are assigned values based on the current values of `empty_row` and `empty_col`, along with the offsets `dr` and `dc`. The initial state does not provide specific values for `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `dr`, or `dc`, so we cannot determine the exact results for `new_row` and `new_col`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged, and the specifics about `start` remain valid. 

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing three characters from {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X', if there are still unvisited directions available; `new_row` is assigned the value of `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is assigned the value of `empty_col + dc`.**
