`new_state` is a list containing characters from the string `current`, and the code swaps the elements at indices `empty_pos` and `new_pos`. The variable `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, and `new_pos` is calculated based on `new_row` and `new_col`. The state of `current` is not modified directly, but `new_state` will reflect the result of this swap, effectively updating one position to 'X' and the other to its corresponding character from `current`.

After the execution, the values of `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` have changed. The other variables (`start`, `directions`, `current`, `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `new_row`, and `new_col`) remain unaffected.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing three characters from {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X'; `directions` has at least one remaining direction to process; `current` is the state removed from the front of `queue`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`; `empty_row` is r; `empty_col` is c; `new_row` is r + dr; `new_col` is c + dc; `new_pos` is `new_row * 2 + new_col`; `new_state` has the values swapped at indices `empty_pos` and `new_pos`.**
