To determine the output state, we need to consider the variables involved and the impact of the statement:

1. **Input Variables**:
   - `start`: a string of length 4 containing three characters from {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X'.
   - `empty_row`, `empty_col`: variables that represent the position of 'X' in the `start` string, we will assume they hold valid indices (either 0 or 1).
   - `(dr, dc)`: a pair of values representing the direction in which the new position is calculated.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The code `new_row, new_col = empty_row + dr, empty_col + dc` updates `new_row` and `new_col` based on the current position of 'X' (indicated by `empty_row` and `empty_col`) and the direction provided by `(dr, dc)`.

Based on the impact of the code, we will present the updated values for `new_row` and `new_col`. The initial state of `start`, `empty_row`, and `empty_col` remains unchanged. Their current values will set the bounds for updating `new_row` and `new_col`, but since their specific values are not provided, we will focus more on the relational update.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing three characters from {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X'; `new_row` is updated to `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is updated to `empty_col + dc`.**
