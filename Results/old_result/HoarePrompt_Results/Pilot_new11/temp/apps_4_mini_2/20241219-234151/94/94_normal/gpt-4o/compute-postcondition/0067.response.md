The code assigns `new_row` and `new_col` the values of `empty_row + dr` and `empty_col + dc` respectively. Given that `empty_row` is `r` and `empty_col` is `c`, the new values are calculated based on those variables and the direction increments `dr` and `dc`. 

Since all other variables remain unchanged, we retain their previous states while updating `new_row` and `new_col` accordingly. Therefore, the output state includes the new values of `new_row` and `new_col` based on the provided increments.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing three characters from {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X'; `directions` has at least one remaining direction to process; `current` is the state removed from the front of `queue`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`; `empty_row` is r; `empty_col` is c; `new_row` is r + dr; `new_col` is c + dc.**
