To determine the correctness of the given program against the problem description, we can analyze its structure and the functionality it provides.

The program attempts to solve the problem of determining whether two sliding puzzles can be transformed into the same configuration. The main components of the program are two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. 

1. **Functionality of `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` simply concatenates the two rows of the puzzle into a single string. This could be part of the state representation, but by itself, it does not help in solving the problem.

2. **Functionality of `func_2`:**
   - `func_2` uses breadth-first search (BFS) to explore all reachable configurations of a given puzzle starting from a given state. It tracks visited states and generates new states by sliding the tiles adjacent to the empty space ('X').
   - The directions for movement of tiles are handled using the coordinate changes defined in `directions`.

The key issue with this program lies in its incompleteness; it only implements the movement and tracking for one puzzle configuration but does not compare the reachable states of Bessie’s puzzle with Elsie’s after moving the tiles. 

To further illustrate this, consider the following potential cases:

**Case 1:**
- Input:
    ```
    AB
    XC
    AC
    BX
    ```
  Expected output: "NO" (since `AB/XC` and `AC/BX` cannot be transformed into the same configuration).
  
- `func_2` would generate all possible configurations from Bessie's puzzle but would not compare them to the configurations generated from Elsie's puzzle. Hence the program is incomplete.

**Conclusion:**
- Given this logic, the program does not meet the requirement of determining if both puzzles can reach the same configuration because it lacks the comparison between the two sets of reachable states.

Therefore, based on this analysis, we can conclude:

Correctness: **False**
