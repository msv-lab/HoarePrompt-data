According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `queue`. If `queue` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the state indicates that `queue` contains all reachable unique states generated during the loop execution. Therefore, to ensure the loop can run one more time, `queue` must contain at least one state at the end of the last iteration.

As the current state does not indicate that `queue` is empty, it is assumed that there are still states left in `queue` for the loop to process in the next iteration. Therefore, there are no adjustments needed in the current state.

State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing three characters from {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X'; `visited` contains all unique states formed by valid swaps of 'X' with its adjacent characters; `queue` contains all reachable unique states from `start` that were generated during the loop execution; `current` is the last state removed from the front of `queue`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`; `empty_row` is the integer division of `empty_pos` by 2; `empty_col` is the remainder of `empty_pos` divided by 2; all possible adjacent states have been explored based on `directions`.**
