To determine the required modifications to the states for the loop to execute, we need to consider the role of the `directions` variable in the loop.

The loop iterates over each tuple `(dr, dc)` in the `directions` list, which currently contains four tuples representing movement direction changes (up, down, left, right). Thus, for the loop to execute at least once, the `directions` list must have entries. In the provided state, `directions` is already defined and contains four elements, so it is sufficient for the loop execution.

Next, we analyze the other states which may be relevant during the iterations of this loop, particularly concerning the potential use of `current`, `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, and `empty_col`. However, these states do not hinder the loop's execution itself; they are more about the loop's body execution.

So, to summarize, since `directions` already contains the necessary tuples for the loop to iterate through, no additional states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing three characters from the set {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X'; `queue` is empty; `visited` contains the value of `start`; `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]; `current` is `start`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X'; `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`; `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`**
