The code adds `new_state_str` to the `visited` set. Since `visited` is a set, `new_state_str` will be included in it if it's not already present. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Thus, the output state includes the unchanged variables and notes that `new_state_str` has been added to the `visited` set. 

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing three characters from {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X'; `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is equal to `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`; `new_state_str` is the string formed by joining all elements of `new_state`; `new_state_str` has been added to `visited`.**
