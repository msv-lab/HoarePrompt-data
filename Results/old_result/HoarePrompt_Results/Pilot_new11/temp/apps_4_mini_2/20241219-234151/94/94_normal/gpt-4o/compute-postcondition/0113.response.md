Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing three characters from {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X'; `visited` contains all unique valid states formed by swapping 'X' with its adjacent characters; `queue` contains all newly formed unique states that can be reached from `start`, reflecting any valid moves performed during the loop; `current` is the last state processed from `queue`; `empty_pos` represents the final index of 'X', which has been adjusted through the loop operations, `empty_row` and `empty_col` give the final coordinates of 'X'.**
