The code computes the new position of 'X' in the grid based on its current position using the direction offsets represented by `dr` and `dc`. The variables `empty_row` and `empty_col` provide the current row and column of 'X'. The values of `new_row` and `new_col` will be derived from these current indices.

Since `new_row` and `new_col` are calculated as:
- `new_row = empty_row + dr`
- `new_col = empty_col + dc`

The output state will reflect that `new_row` and `new_col` represent the potential new indices for 'X' in the grid after applying the direction offsets.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing three characters from {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X'; `visited` contains all unique states formed by valid swaps of 'X' with its adjacent characters; `queue` must not be empty; `current` is the last state removed from the front of `queue`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`; `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`; `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`; `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`; directions must contain at least 1 element.**
