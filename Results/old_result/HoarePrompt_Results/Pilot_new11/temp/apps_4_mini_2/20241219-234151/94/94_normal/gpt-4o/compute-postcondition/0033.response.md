The line of code swaps two elements within the `new_state` list at positions `empty_pos` and `new_pos`. The values at these two indices in the `new_state` list will be exchanged. 

1. `new_state` is a list created from `current`, so its initial contents depend on what is in `current`. 
2. `empty_pos` is the index of the empty slot in the list defined by the variable `empty_row` and `empty_col`.
3. `new_row` and `new_col` are calculated based on `empty_row + dr` and `empty_col + dc` respectively, indicating the new position in the context of some directional movement.
4. `new_pos` calculates the new position as `new_row * 2 + new_col`, which depends on the values of `dr` and `dc`.

After performing the swap:

- The value at index `empty_pos` gets the value of index `new_pos`, and the value at index `new_pos` gets the value of index `empty_pos`.

The other variables (`start`, `new_row`, `new_col`, `new_pos`) remain unchanged; we only focus on the `new_state` due to the swap operation. 

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing three characters from {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X'; `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is equal to `new_row * 2 + new_col`; `new_state` has elements at indices `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped.**
