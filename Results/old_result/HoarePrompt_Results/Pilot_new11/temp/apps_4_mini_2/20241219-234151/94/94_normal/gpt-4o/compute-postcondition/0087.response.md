The `new_state_str` is assigned the value that results from joining the elements of `new_state` into a single string. The variable `new_state` holds a list representation of the `current` state with values swapped at `empty_pos` and `new_pos`. Since `new_state` is derived from `current`, `new_state_str` will reflect the new arrangement of characters after the swap.

The other variables (`start`, `visited`, `queue`, `current`, `empty_pos`, and `new_pos`) remain unchanged as this line of code only affects `new_state_str`.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing three characters from {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X'; `visited` contains all unique states formed by valid swaps of 'X' with its adjacent characters; `queue` must not be empty; `current` is a specific string representation of a state; `empty_pos` now corresponds to `new_pos`; `new_state` is the list representation of `current` with swapped values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos`; `new_state_str` is the string formed by joining the elements of `new_state`.**
