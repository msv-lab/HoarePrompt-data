The code appends `new_state_str` to the `queue`. The variable `queue` now includes `new_state_str`. The variables `new_state`, `current`, and `visited` are updated with `new_state_str` added to `visited`, but their specific values are not provided. The state of the initial variables remains intact, with changes only to `queue` and `visited`.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing three characters from {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X'; `new_state`, `current`, `visited` are updated with `new_state_str` added to `visited`, and `new_state_str` is added to `queue`.**
