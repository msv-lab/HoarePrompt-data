The variable `new_state_str` is assigned the value of `''.join(new_state)`, which joins all elements of the list `new_state` into a single string. The other variables retain their previous values. Therefore, the output state reflects the string representation of the new state and the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing three characters from {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X'; `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is equal to `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`; `new_state_str` is the string formed by joining all elements of `new_state`.**
