You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Bessie the cow and her best friend Elsie each received a sliding puzzle on Pi Day. Their puzzles consist of a 2 × 2 grid and three tiles labeled 'A', 'B', and 'C'. The three tiles sit on top of the grid, leaving one grid cell empty. To make a move, Bessie or Elsie can slide a tile adjacent to the empty cell into the empty cell as shown below: $\rightarrow$ 

In order to determine if they are truly Best Friends For Life (BFFLs), Bessie and Elsie would like to know if there exists a sequence of moves that takes their puzzles to the same configuration (moves can be performed in both puzzles). Two puzzles are considered to be in the same configuration if each tile is on top of the same grid cell in both puzzles. Since the tiles are labeled with letters, rotations and reflections are not allowed.


-----Input-----

The first two lines of the input consist of a 2 × 2 grid describing the initial configuration of Bessie's puzzle. The next two lines contain a 2 × 2 grid describing the initial configuration of Elsie's puzzle. The positions of the tiles are labeled 'A', 'B', and 'C', while the empty cell is labeled 'X'. It's guaranteed that both puzzles contain exactly one tile with each letter and exactly one empty position.


-----Output-----

Output "YES"(without quotes) if the puzzles can reach the same configuration (and Bessie and Elsie are truly BFFLs). Otherwise, print "NO" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
AB
XC
XB
AC

Output
YES

Input
AB
XC
AC
BX

Output
NO



-----Note-----

The solution to the first sample is described by the image. All Bessie needs to do is slide her 'A' tile down.

In the second sample, the two puzzles can never be in the same configuration. Perhaps Bessie and Elsie are not meant to be friends after all...
Program:
```
from collections import deque
#Function 1:
def func_1(puzzle):
    return puzzle[0] + puzzle[1]

#Function 2:
def func_2(start):
    queue = deque([start])
    visited = set([start])
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while queue:
        current = queue.popleft()
        empty_pos = current.index('X')
        (empty_row, empty_col) = divmod(empty_pos, 2)
        for (dr, dc) in directions:
            (new_row, new_col) = (empty_row + dr, empty_col + dc)
            if 0 <= new_row < 2 and 0 <= new_col < 2:
                new_pos = new_row * 2 + new_col
                new_state = list(current)
                (new_state[empty_pos], new_state[new_pos]) = (new_state[new_pos], new_state[empty_pos])
                new_state_str = ''.join(new_state)
                if new_state_str not in visited:
                    visited.add(new_state_str)
                    queue.append(new_state_str)
    return visited


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the given program against the problem description, we can analyze its structure and the functionality it provides.

The program attempts to solve the problem of determining whether two sliding puzzles can be transformed into the same configuration. The main components of the program are two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. 

1. **Functionality of `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` simply concatenates the two rows of the puzzle into a single string. This could be part of the state representation, but by itself, it does not help in solving the problem.

2. **Functionality of `func_2`:**
   - `func_2` uses breadth-first search (BFS) to explore all reachable configurations of a given puzzle starting from a given state. It tracks visited states and generates new states by sliding the tiles adjacent to the empty space ('X').
   - The directions for movement of tiles are handled using the coordinate changes defined in `directions`.

The key issue with this program lies in its incompleteness; it only implements the movement and tracking for one puzzle configuration but does not compare the reachable states of Bessie’s puzzle with Elsie’s after moving the tiles. 

To further illustrate this, consider the following potential cases:

**Case 1:**
- Input:
    ```
    AB
    XC
    AC
    BX
    ```
  Expected output: "NO" (since `AB/XC` and `AC/BX` cannot be transformed into the same configuration).
  
- `func_2` would generate all possible configurations from Bessie's puzzle but would not compare them to the configurations generated from Elsie's puzzle. Hence the program is incomplete.

**Conclusion:**
- Given this logic, the program does not meet the requirement of determining if both puzzles can reach the same configuration because it lacks the comparison between the two sets of reachable states.

Therefore, based on this analysis, we can conclude:

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : The function accepts a string parameter `start`, representing the initial configuration of a sliding puzzle on a 2 × 2 grid, containing three characters from the set {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X'. It performs a breadth-first search to explore all unique states that can be reached by swapping the position of 'X' with its adjacent characters (up, down, left, right). It maintains a set called `visited` to track all unique configurations encountered during this exploration. The function ultimately returns the `visited` set, which includes all valid unique states formed by these swaps. If no valid swaps are possible, the `visited` set will only contain the original state `start`. The function does not account for scenarios where the input string is not valid or does not meet the length requirement.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
