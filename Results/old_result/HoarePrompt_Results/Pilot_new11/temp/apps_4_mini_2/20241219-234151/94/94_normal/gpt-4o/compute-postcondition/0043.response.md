`empty_row` and `empty_col` are assigned the results of the `divmod` function, which divides `empty_pos` by 2 and returns both the quotient and the remainder as a tuple. This means that `empty_row` will represent the row index of 'X' in a 2-row grid, and `empty_col` will represent the column index of 'X'. The previous values of `start`, `visited`, `queue`, and `current` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing three characters from {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X'; `visited` contains all unique states obtained by swapping 'X' with its adjacent characters in the grid; `queue` must contain at least one reachable state from `start`; `current` is the state removed from the front of `queue`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`; `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`.**
