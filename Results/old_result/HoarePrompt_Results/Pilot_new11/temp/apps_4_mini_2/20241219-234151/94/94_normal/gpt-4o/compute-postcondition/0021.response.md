The variable `new_pos` is assigned the value of `new_row * 2 + new_col`. The preconditions state that `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr` and `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`. Therefore, we can express `new_pos` as:

```
new_pos = (empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)
```

While we do not have specific values for `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `dr`, and `dc`, we understand that `new_pos` will be an expression derived from those variables. Other variables in the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing three characters from {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X'; `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is equal to `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`**.
