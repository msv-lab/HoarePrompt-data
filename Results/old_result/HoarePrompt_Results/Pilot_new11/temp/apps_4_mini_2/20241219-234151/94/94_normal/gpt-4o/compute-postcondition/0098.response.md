The variable `new_state_str` is assigned the value of `''.join(new_state)`, which converts the list or collection `new_state` into a string by concatenating all its elements. Since `new_state` has been updated with swapped values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos`, `new_state` is likely to be a string or list of characters, which matches the format of `start`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing three characters from {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X'; `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is equal to `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`; `new_state_str` is the string resulting from joining `new_state`.**
