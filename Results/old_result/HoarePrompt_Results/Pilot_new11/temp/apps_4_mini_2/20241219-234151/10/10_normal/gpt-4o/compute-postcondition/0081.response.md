According to the code, the execution of the loop is controlled by the variable `j` which iterates from 0 to `d-1`. At the end of the last iteration, the variable `j` is 0 and the value of `d` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1, resulting in `j` being 1. 

Since `d` is greater than or equal to 2, the loop can still execute with `j` being 1, as that is still a valid index within the range defined by `d`.

State: **`d` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is unchanged, `j` is 1**
