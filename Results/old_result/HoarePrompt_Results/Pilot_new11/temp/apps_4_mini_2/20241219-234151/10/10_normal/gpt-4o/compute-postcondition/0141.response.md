The value of `right_count[i]` is incremented by 1. Other variables are not affected by this operation, so they remain in their initial states. The preconditions regarding `j`, `d`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, and `x2_j`, `y2_j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is `current_j + 1`; `d` is greater than `current_j + 1`; `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned the values from `sofas[current_j + 1]`; `right_count[i]` is increased by 1.**
