The provided code `sofas.append((x1, y1, x2, y2))` adds a tuple `(x1, y1, x2, y2)` to the list `sofas`. The variable `sofas` already has at least two elements prior to this operation. The values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are defined by previous inputs.

Thus, the main effect of this code is to increase the length of the `sofas` list by one, adding a new tuple with the values provided by the inputs `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`. The initial state of `sofas` before the operation isn't directly affected in terms of its contents aside from the addition of the new tuple.

Output State: **`d` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5), `n` is defined by input, `m` is defined by input, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are non-negative integers (0 ≤ cnt_{l}, cnt_{r}, cnt_{t}, cnt_{b} ≤ d - 1), `sofas` has at least three elements now, including `((x1, y1, x2, y2))`, where `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are input integers.**
