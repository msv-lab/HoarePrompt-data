Postcondition: ***`d` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned the values from `sofas[1]`. If `y1` is greater than `y2_j` and `y2` is also greater than `y2_j`, then `top_count[i]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `bottom_count[i]` is increased by 1 if `y1` is less than `y1_j` and `y2` is also less than `y1_j`, with no changes made to `top_count[i]`.***
