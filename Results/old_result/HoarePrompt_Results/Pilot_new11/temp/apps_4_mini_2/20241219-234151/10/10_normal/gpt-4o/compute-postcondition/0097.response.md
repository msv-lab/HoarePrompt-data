Initial State: `d` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is unchanged, `j` is 2, `right_count` is an array where `right_count[i]` is some integer value.

```
right_count[i] += 1
```

Now, please think step by step: 
- The code increments the value of `right_count[i]` by 1.
- The other variables `d`, `i`, `j`, and the previous value of `right_count[i]` remain unchanged except for `right_count[i]`, which increases by 1.

Output State: **`d` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is unchanged, `j` is 2, `right_count[i]` is increased by 1.**
