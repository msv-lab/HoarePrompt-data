According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `d`. The loop executes as long as `j` is less than `d`. At the end of the last iteration, the values are such that `j` remains 0, and since `d` is a positive integer, the loop can execute if `j` is increased by 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to 1, and hence it must satisfy `d` being greater than 1 for the loop to continue. Therefore, the new states will be:
- `j` is 1,
- `d` must be greater than 1.

State: **`d` must be greater than 1, `j` is 1**
