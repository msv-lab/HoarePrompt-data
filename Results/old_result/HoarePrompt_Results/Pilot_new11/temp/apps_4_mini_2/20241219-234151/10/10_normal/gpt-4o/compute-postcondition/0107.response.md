The code assigns the values from the `sofas` list corresponding to the index `i` to the variables `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`. It is stated that `d` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2 and must be greater than `i + 1`. Therefore, the range of valid indices for accessing `sofas` will be constrained by the value of `d`. Since `d` must be greater than `i + 1`, it indicates that `i` must be less than `d - 1`, affecting the accessible indices of the `sofas` list.

Specifically, the states of the affected variables are:
- `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` will now hold the values extracted from `sofas[i]`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the output state will reflect the new assignments and the conditions of `d` and `i`.

Output State: **`d` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `i + 1`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are assigned values from `sofas[i]`, where `d` is greater than `i + 1`.**
