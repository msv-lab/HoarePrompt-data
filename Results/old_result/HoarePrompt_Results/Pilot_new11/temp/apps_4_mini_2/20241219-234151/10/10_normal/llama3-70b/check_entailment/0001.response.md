Correctness: **False**

The program contains a logical error in the `func_1` function where it checks the conditions for determining which sofas are to the left, right, top, and bottom of the given sofa. The current implementation only checks for the position based on the top-left coordinate `(x1, y1)` of the sofas and does not consider the full extent of the sofas since they occupy two cells in the matrix.

For instance, if we have a case where two sofas occupy the following positions:
- Sofa A at (1,1) and (1,2)
- Sofa B at (2,1) and (2,2)

In this setup, Sofa B is directly below Sofa A, but the program does not correctly account for the full dimensions of the sofas when calculating relative positions. Instead, it only compares the top-left corners, which will lead to incorrect results.

Also, there is a missing recognition for when the sofas occupy two different rows or columns. This could lead to a scenario where the condition needed to determine the count of sofas in the respective orientations is incorrectly computed.

To illustrate, consider a case with the following input:
```
2
3 2
1 1 1 2  # Sofa A
2 1 2 2  # Sofa B
1 1 0 0  # Requirements: 1 to the left, 0 to the right, 0 above, and 0 below
```

The expected output should be `1`, since there is indeed 1 sofa to the left of the first sofa (the second one). 

However, if the program were to run this input, it would mistakenly think there are only sofas to the right or some incorrect placement due to its faulty logic, leading to an inappropriate response.

Thus, due to these logical flaws, the program fails to consistently meet the requirements as specified in the problem description.
