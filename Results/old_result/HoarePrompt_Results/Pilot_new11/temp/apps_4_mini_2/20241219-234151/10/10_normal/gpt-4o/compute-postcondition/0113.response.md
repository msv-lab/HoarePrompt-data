Postcondition: ***`d` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` remains 0, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are assigned values from `sofas[i]`, and `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned values from `sofas[0]`. The current value of `x1` is less than `x1_j`, and the current value of `x2` is less than `x1_j`.***
