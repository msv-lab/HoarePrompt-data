Postcondition: ***`sofa` is an index representing a valid sofa, `sofas` is a list of tuples that contains at least one tuple, and `s` is the first tuple in `sofas`. If `s` is not equal to `sofa`, then if the first element of `sofa` is greater than the first element of `s` and the second element of `sofa` is equal to the second element of `s`, `bottom` is incremented by 1 while `left` and `right` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `left` and `right` remain unchanged with no changes to `bottom`. If `s` is equal to `sofa`, there are no modifications to `left`, `right`, or `bottom`.***
