According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `d`. After the last iteration, `j` is 1. The loop executes as long as `j` is less than `d`. Since `d` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must increment from its current value of 1 to 2. 

Thus, for the next iteration, we need to ensure that `j` is now set to 2 and still ensure that the condition regarding `d` holds. The variable `d` must remain greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to proceed to the next iteration.

State: **`d` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is unchanged, `j` is 2, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the respective values from `sofas[2]` if it exists**
