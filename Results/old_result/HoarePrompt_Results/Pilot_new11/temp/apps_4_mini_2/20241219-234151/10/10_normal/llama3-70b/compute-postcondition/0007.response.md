The value of `right` is incremented by 1. The previous condition states that `left` has already been incremented by 1, but no other variables are affected. Since `right` wasn't mentioned before, its previous value is unspecified, but we know it will now be one unit greater than it was. The output will indicate the change in the value of `right`.

Output State: **`sofa` is an index representing a valid sofa, `sofas` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `s` is the first tuple in `sofas`, the current value of `s` is not equal to `sofa`, the first element of `sofa` is greater than the first element of `s`, the second element of `sofa` is equal to the second element of `s`, `left` has been incremented by 1, and `right` has been incremented by 1.**
