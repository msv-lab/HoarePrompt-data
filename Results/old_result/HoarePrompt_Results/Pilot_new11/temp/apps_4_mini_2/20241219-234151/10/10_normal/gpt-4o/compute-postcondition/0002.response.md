The line of code initializes an empty list `sofas`. It does not affect any of the other variables (`d`, `n`, `m`, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b`), which retain their original states. Hence, the output state reflects the unchanged values of these variables alongside the new definition of `sofas`.

Output State: **`d` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5), `n` is defined by input, `m` is defined by input, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are non-negative integers (0 ≤ cnt_{l}, cnt_{r}, cnt_{t}, cnt_{b} ≤ d - 1), `sofas` is an empty list.**
