The line of code assigns values to `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` from `sofas[j]`. The variable `j` has a value of 2, so these variables are set to the values of `sofas[2]`. The other variables (`d`, `i`) remain unchanged, and since `i` is not stated to equal `j`, it doesnâ€™t affect the control flow in this case.

Output State: **`d` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, `x1_j, y1_j, x2_j, y2_j` are assigned the values from `sofas[2]`.**
