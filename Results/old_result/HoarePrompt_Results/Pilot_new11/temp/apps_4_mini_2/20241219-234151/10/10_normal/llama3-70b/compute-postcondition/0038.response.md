The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `sofa` and `sofas`. The parameter `sofa` is an integer representing the index of a sofa, while `sofas` is a list of tuples, with each tuple containing four integers that represent the coordinates of the sofas. The function returns four integers, `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom`, which remain unchanged from their initial state of 0, as there are no sofas in the list `sofas` that correspond to the specified sofa index. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept an integer `sofa` and a list of tuples `sofas`, and return 0 for left, right, top, and bottom when there are no corresponding sofas. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `sofa` and a list of tuples `sofas`, returning 0 for left, right, top, and bottom if there are no sofas corresponding to the specified sofa index.**
