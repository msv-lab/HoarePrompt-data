Postcondition: ***`sofa` is an index representing a valid sofa, `sofas` is a list of tuples containing at least one tuple, and `s` is the second tuple in `sofas`. If `s` is not equal to `sofa`, and if `sofa[0][1]` is greater than `s[0][1]` and `sofa[0][0]` is equal to `s[0][0]`, then `top` and `right` remain unchanged while `bottom` is increased by 1. If the condition is not met, `top`, `right`, and `bottom` all remain unchanged.***
