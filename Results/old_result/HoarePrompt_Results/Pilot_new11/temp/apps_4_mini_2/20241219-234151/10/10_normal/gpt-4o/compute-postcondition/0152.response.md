To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the provided information:

1. The loop iterates `d` times, where `d` is a positive integer. This indicates that the loop will execute for values of `i` from 0 to `d-1`.
2. In this scenario, the variable `i` will represent the index of a sofa in the list of `d` sofas. 
3. The loop's behavior is dependent on the array size matching `d`, meaning that `sofas` should have exactly `d` elements (tuples of coordinates) so that the index `i` is valid.
4. The value of `target_sofa`, which is currently -1, may imply that there is a target sofa that is missing or invalid initially. However, the execution of the loop does not directly depend on `target_sofa`.

Given this analysis, the necessary adjustments to the state before the loop can be outlined as follows:

- Ensure that `sofas` has exactly `d` tuples, which confirms that there are enough sofas for the loop to iterate through.
- Set `i` to 0 to initialize the loop variable for its first iteration.

Hence, to allow the loop to execute correctly, the following state adjustments are required:

State: **`d` is a positive integer, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples (positions of sofas), `i` is 0**.
