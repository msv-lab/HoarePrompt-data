Postcondition: ***`sofa` is an index representing a valid sofa, `sofas` is a list containing at least 3 tuples, and `s` is the third tuple in `sofas`. If `s` is not equal to `sofa`, and if `sofa[0][1]` is greater than `s[0][1]` while `sofa[0][0]` equals `s[0][0]`, then `bottom` is increased by 1; otherwise, `bottom` remains unchanged. If `s` is equal to `sofa`, there is no change made to `bottom`.***
