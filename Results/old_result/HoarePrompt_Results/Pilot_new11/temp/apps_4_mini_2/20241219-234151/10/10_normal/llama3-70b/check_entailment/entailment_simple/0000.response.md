To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the relevant components of both.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input Specifications:**
   - The program reads the number of sofas (`d`), dimensions of the storehouse (`n` and `m`), the coordinates of each sofa, and the counts of sofas relative to any potential sofa belonging to Grandpa Maks (`cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b`).
  
2. **Counting Logic:**
   - The function `func_1` is intended to calculate how many sofas are positioned left, right, above, and below a given sofa by checking their coordinates:
     - Left: Check if the x-coordinate of the current sofa is less than another sofa's x-coordinate and that they share the same y-coordinate.
     - Right: Similar logic but the opposite for x-coordinates.
     - Top: Check if the y-coordinate is less.
     - Bottom: Similar logic but the opposite for y-coordinates.
     
3. **Output Requirements:**
   - The program must find and print the one sofa that matches the counts provided as input. If no such sofa exists, it should print `-1`.

### Program Analysis:
- The program initializes correctly by reading the input.
- It uses a loop to evaluate each sofa against the expected counts of surrounding sofas.
- It effectively calls `func_1` which is responsible for calculating the counts.

### Issues Within the Program:
1. **Function Logic:**
   - The way `func_1` is structured relies on a fragile assumption. The coordinates for the sofas are tuples containing the corners of the sofas which should be represented and compared properly ensuring the correct definition of left/right/top/bottom relative counts. It only considers one end of the sofa rather than both, which might lead to overlooking some sofas.
     - The conditions checked are strictly for the first coordinate of one end of the sofa. For proper functioning, it should check relative positions of both sets of coordinates of each sofa.
  
2. **Use of Coordinates:**
   - The coordinates `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` are used as direct indicators of placement without verifying the entirety of the sofa relative to its given dimensions.

### Conclusion:
- Given the points above, the logic implemented in the `func_1` is incomplete and incorrect since it does not accurately reflect the relative positions of all sofas properly based on the two coordinates input for each respective sofa. It primarily checks each sofa based on incomplete boundary conditions, which may lead to incorrect counts.
- Therefore, the program does not adequately solve the problem as stated in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
