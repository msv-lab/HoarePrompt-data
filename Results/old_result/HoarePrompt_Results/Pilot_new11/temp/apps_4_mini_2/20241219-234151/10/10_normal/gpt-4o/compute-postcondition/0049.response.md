According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `d`. If `j` is less than `d`, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `d` is greater than 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` will increase by 1, making it 2, and `d` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`d` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned the values from `sofas[2]`.**
