Postcondition: ***`d` is a positive integer. If `x1 > x2_j` and `x2 > x2_j`, then `i` is set to 1, `j` remains 0, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned the values from `sofas[0]`, `right_count[0]` is incremented by 1, and `left_count[1]` is incremented by 1. The current value of `y1` is less than `y1_j`, and the current value of `y2` is less than `y1_j`. If the condition is not met, the values remain unchanged.***
