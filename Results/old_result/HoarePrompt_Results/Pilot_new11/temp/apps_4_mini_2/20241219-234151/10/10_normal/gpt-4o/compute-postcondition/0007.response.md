In this case, the variables `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are assigned values based on the input. Since `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are defined by user input and can take any integer values, their specific values remain unknown after the assignment, but they are now set as the values that were input.

The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated assignments for `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`, while retaining all the information about the other variables.

Output State: **`d` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5), `n` is defined by input, `m` is defined by input, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are non-negative integers (0 ≤ cnt_{l}, cnt_{r}, cnt_{t}, cnt_{b} ≤ d - 1), `sofas` is a list with one element `((x1, y1, x2, y2))`, where `x1, y1, x2, y2` are assigned values from user input**.
