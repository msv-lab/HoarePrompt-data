Postcondition: ***`d` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is unchanged, `j` is 0, `right_count[i]`, `left_count[i]`, `bottom_count[i]`, `top_count[i]` are unchanged, `x1` and `y1` are the first two values of `sofas[i]`, `x2` and `y2` are the next two values of `sofas[i]`, and the current value of `i` is equal to `j` (which is 0).***
