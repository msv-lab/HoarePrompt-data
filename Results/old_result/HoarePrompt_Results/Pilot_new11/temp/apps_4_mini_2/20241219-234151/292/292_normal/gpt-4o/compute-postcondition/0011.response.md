`a` gets multiplied by `3`. Given that `a` is initially between `3` and `90`, the new value of `a` will now be between `9` and `270`. The value of `b` remains unchanged but must still satisfy the condition of being at least `2 * a`, so after the operation `a *= 3`, `b` should at least be `2 * (3 to 90)`, which would be `at least 18` for maintaining the loop (as the loop condition states `b` must remain greater than or equal to `a`). 

After multiplying `a` by `3`, we update `a` to its new calculated range, keeping in mind that our initial conditions need to hold. 

Output State: **`a` is between `9` and `270`, `b` is at least `2 * a` and still remains greater than or equal to `a` for the loop to execute one more time.**
