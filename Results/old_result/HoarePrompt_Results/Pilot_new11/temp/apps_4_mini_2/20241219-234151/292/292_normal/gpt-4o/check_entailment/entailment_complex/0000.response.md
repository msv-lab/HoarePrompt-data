The annotated program seems to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Here's an analysis confirming its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by accepting two integers, `a` and `b`, which represent Limak's weight and Bob's weight, respectively. The problem description guarantees that `1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10`. The program relies on valid input according to these constraints.

2. **Weight Growth Logic**: In the loop, the program runs while Limak's weight (`a`) is less than or equal to Bob's weight (`b`). In each iteration:
   - Limak's weight is tripled (`a *= 3`).
   - Bob's weight is doubled (`b *= 2`).

3. **Year Counting**: The program maintains a counter (`years`) to track the number of years (iterations of the loop) it takes for Limak's weight to become strictly greater than Bob's weight. This aligns perfectly with the problem requirements which state that we need the number of years until Limak is strictly heavier.

4. **Termination Condition**: The loop continues until `a` becomes greater than `b`. As per the problem description, we expect that eventually Limak will become heavier since the input guarantees that Limak starts lighter than or equal to Bob.

5. **Output**: After exiting the loop, the program prints the number of years, which is the expected output as per the problem description.

6. **Example Validation**: The examples provided in the problem description have been effectively handled by the program, confirming that it correctly computes the number of years for various initial weights of Limak and Bob.

Since the program accurately reflects the specifications and logic described in the problem, we can conclude that it correctly fulfills the task.

Therefore, the final assessment is:

Correctness: **True**
