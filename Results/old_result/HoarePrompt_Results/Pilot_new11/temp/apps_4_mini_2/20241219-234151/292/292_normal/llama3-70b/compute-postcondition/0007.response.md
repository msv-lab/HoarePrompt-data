The value of `a` is multiplied by 3. Since it was previously required that `a` must be less than or equal to `b`, and `b` is an input integer within the range 6 to 20, the new value of `a` must still satisfy the condition `a <= b`. The variable `years` remains unchanged at the value of 1. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is now `3 * a`, `b` is an input integer such that `6 ≤ b ≤ 20`, and `years` is 1.

Output State: **`a` is now `3 * a`, `b` is an input integer such that `6 ≤ b ≤ 20`, `years` is 1**
