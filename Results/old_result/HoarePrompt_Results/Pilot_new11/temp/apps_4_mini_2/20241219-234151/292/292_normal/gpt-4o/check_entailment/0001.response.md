Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the case where Limak's and Bob's weights are initially equal. For the input (1, 1), Limak's weight becomes 3 and Bob's weight becomes 2 after one year, and the program outputs 1, which is misleading because it suggests Limak became strictly larger after one year. The problem asks for Limak to be strictly larger than Bob, meaning it should return 0 years for the input (1, 1) since Limak should already be considered strictly larger at the start.

Therefore, the program fails to handle the case correctly where both Limak and Bob have the same weight initially. It doesn't account for the possibility that Limak should not count any years if he is already equal and only needs to become strictly larger.
