You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Bear Limak wants to become the largest of bears, or at least to become larger than his brother Bob.

Right now, Limak and Bob weigh a and b respectively. It's guaranteed that Limak's weight is smaller than or equal to his brother's weight.

Limak eats a lot and his weight is tripled after every year, while Bob's weight is doubled after every year.

After how many full years will Limak become strictly larger (strictly heavier) than Bob?


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10) — the weight of Limak and the weight of Bob respectively.


-----Output-----

Print one integer, denoting the integer number of years after which Limak will become strictly larger than Bob.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 7

Output
2

Input
4 9

Output
3

Input
1 1

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first sample, Limak weighs 4 and Bob weighs 7 initially. After one year their weights are 4·3 = 12 and 7·2 = 14 respectively (one weight is tripled while the other one is doubled). Limak isn't larger than Bob yet. After the second year weights are 36 and 28, so the first weight is greater than the second one. Limak became larger than Bob after two years so you should print 2.

In the second sample, Limak's and Bob's weights in next years are: 12 and 18, then 36 and 36, and finally 108 and 72 (after three years). The answer is 3. Remember that Limak wants to be larger than Bob and he won't be satisfied with equal weights.

In the third sample, Limak becomes larger than Bob after the first year. Their weights will be 3 and 2 then.
Program:
```
def func():
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    years = 0
    while a <= b:
        a *= 3
        b *= 2
        years += 1
    print(years)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Limak's weight is tripled each year, while Bob's weight is doubled. The condition `while a <= b` ensures that the loop continues until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's weight. The increment of the `years` counter is done properly after both weights are updated. 

Here’s a breakdown of why it is correct for all possible inputs (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10):

1. **Input (1, 1)**: 
   - Year 1: Limak -> 3, Bob -> 2, Output: 1 (Correct).
   
2. **Input (4, 7)**: 
   - Year 1: Limak -> 12, Bob -> 14
   - Year 2: Limak -> 36, Bob -> 28, Output: 2 (Correct).

3. **Input (4, 9)**: 
   - Year 1: Limak -> 12, Bob -> 18
   - Year 2: Limak -> 36, Bob -> 36
   - Year 3: Limak -> 108, Bob -> 72, Output: 3 (Correct).

All edge cases within the specified bounds produce the expected results, confirming that the code functions correctly for every scenario outlined in the problem description. Thus, the correctness of the program is affirmed.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads two integers, a and b, which represent Limak's and Bob's initial weights, respectively, where 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10. It then enters a loop, multiplying Limak's weight by 3 and Bob's weight by 2 in each iteration until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's weight. The function counts the number of iterations, `years`, until this condition is met. Finally, it prints the total number of years it took for Limak's weight to exceed Bob's weight. The function's output reflects the number of iterations needed, which should account for the growth rates of both weights. The function does not handle cases where invalid input (e.g., non-integers) is provided or where the initial weights do not conform to the specified constraints.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
