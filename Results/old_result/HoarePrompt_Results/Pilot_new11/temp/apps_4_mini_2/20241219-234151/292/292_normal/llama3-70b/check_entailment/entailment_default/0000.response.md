The provided program appears to implement the problem correctly. The function reads two integers representing the weights of Limak and Bob, respectively, and it continues to multiply Limak's weight by 3 and Bob's weight by 2 until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's weight. It also counts the number of years until this condition is met.

The output hints explain that the function will continue this multiplication process and count the years, which aligns with the problem description. Additionally, the function accounts for all scenarios where Limak's initial weight may be less than or equal to Bob's weight, and it correctly identifies when Limak's weight surpasses Bob's weight.

Upon reviewing the examples provided in the problem description:
1. For the input `4 7`, the output is `2`, which matches the example where Limak's weight (12) becomes greater than Bob's weight (14) after two years.
2. For the input `4 9`, the output is `3`, where Limak's weight becomes greater than Bob's weight after three years as shown in the example.
3. For the input `1 1`, the output is `1`, confirming that after the first year Limak's weight (3) exceeds Bob's weight (2).

All cases lead to correct results, and since the input constraints ensure that the inputs will be valid integers within the given range, it seems that no edge cases violate the expected behavior of the program.

Correctness: **True**.
