The function `func` accepts two parameters: `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are integers, with the constraints that 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10, where `a` represents Limak's initial weight and `b` represents Bob's initial weight. After executing the function body, based on the defined logic, the function will return a result related to the weights of Limak and Bob. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two integers, a (Limak's initial weight) and b (Bob's initial weight), where 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10. It returns a result based on the relationship between Limak's and Bob's weights.**
