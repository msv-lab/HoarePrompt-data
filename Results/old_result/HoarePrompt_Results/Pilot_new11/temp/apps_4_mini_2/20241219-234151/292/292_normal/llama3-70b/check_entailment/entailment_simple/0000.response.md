To determine the correctness of the annotated program based on the provided problem description, we analyze the function step by step.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Inputs**: The program reads two integers `a` (Limak's weight) and `b` (Bob's weight).
2. **Background**: Limak's weight triples every year, while Bob's weight doubles.
3. **Goal**: We need to find the number of full years until Limak's weight (`a`) becomes strictly greater than Bob's weight (`b`).

### Program Logic:
- The function initializes a variable `years` to 0 and enters a `while` loop, which continues as long as Limak's weight is less than or equal to Bob's weight.
- Inside the loop:
  - Limak's weight is updated by multiplying it by 3.
  - Bob's weight is updated by multiplying it by 2.
  - The `years` counter is incremented.
- The loop condition ensures that the process continues until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's weight.
- Finally, it prints the number of years required for Limak to weigh more than Bob.

### Program Evaluation:
1. **Initialization**: The weights are read correctly.
2. **Condition and Update**: The condition `a <= b` ensures that the loop will run until Limak's weight surpasses Bob's. The update logic accurately reflects the problem by tripling Limak's weight and doubling Bob's weight.
3. **Output**: It correctly outputs the number of years after the loop ends, representing the time taken for Limak's weight to exceed Bob's.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic outlined in the problem description and adheres to the rules regarding how weights change over time.

Thus, the program accurately calculates how many years it will take for Limak to become strictly heavier than Bob for any valid input within the defined constraints.

### Final Verdict:
Correctness: **True**
