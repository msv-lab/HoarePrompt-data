The variables `a` and `b` are updated with the values of `b` and `a % b` respectively. 

- `a` is assigned the value of `a % b`, which is the remainder when `a` is divided by `b`. Since `a` is guaranteed to be between 1 and 1500, and `b` is greater than 0, `a % b` will also fall within the range 0 to `b-1`. Consequently, `a` will now be a non-negative integer that is less than `b`.

- `b` takes the original value of `a`.

Thus, the output state reflects the updates to `a` and `b` based on the operations performed. The conditions on `c` remain unchanged and are still valid.

Output State: **`a` is an integer such that 0 ≤ a < `b`, `b` is an integer such that `b` must be greater than 0 and is the original `a`, `c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 1500**.
