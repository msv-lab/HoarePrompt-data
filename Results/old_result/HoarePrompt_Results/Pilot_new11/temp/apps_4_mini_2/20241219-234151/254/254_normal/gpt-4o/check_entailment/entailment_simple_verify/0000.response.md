Final: **False**

The original assessment accurately identified a critical flaw in the logic of the program. The GCD approach used to determine if all garlands can be lit effectively fails to account for the potential configurations of the starting moments to ensure continuous lighting. Specifically, the correlation between GCD and the ability to cover all integers does not hold universally. The provided examples and the program's output do not align correctly with the intent of the problem description, confirming that there may be instances where the program outputs 'YES' incorrectly when it should output 'NO', such as in the case of (4, 2, 3), where the intervals share a common divisor.

The annotated version provides no new evidence to change the conclusion drawn from the original assessment, affirming that the logic does not sufficiently meet the requirements laid out in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is still in question and remains determined as false based on the relevant analysis.
