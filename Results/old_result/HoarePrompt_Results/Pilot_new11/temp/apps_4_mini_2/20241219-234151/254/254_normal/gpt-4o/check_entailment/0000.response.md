To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the code in relation to the requirements described.

### Problem Summary
- We have three garlands, each with a time interval `k1`, `k2`, and `k3`.
- Mishka needs to ensure that after a certain time, at least one garland is lit at every second.
- The solution should determine if there exists a moment (not necessarily distinct) to switch on the garlands such that there are no 'dark' seconds.

### Provided Program Analysis
The program calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the three intervals using the following logic:

1. Calculate the GCD of the first two intervals: `gcd_k1_k2 = math.gcd(k1, k2)`.
2. Calculate the GCD of this result with the third interval: `gcd_all = math.gcd(gcd_k1_k2, k3)`.
3. If the final GCD (`gcd_all`) equals 1, the program outputs 'YES'; otherwise, it outputs 'NO'.

### Verification of Logic
- The logic for using the GCD suggests that if all three intervals have a common factor greater than 1, there may be moments when none of the garlands are lit. For instance, if `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` share a common divisor greater than 1, the lit states would only occur at multiples of that common divisor, creating potential 'dark' seconds.
- If `gcd_all == 1`, it indicates that the three intervals are coprime, meaning that they can cover all integers at certain moments.

### Test Cases
Let's examine a couple of test cases:

1. **Test Case**: `k1 = 2`, `k2 = 2`, `k3 = 3`
   - The GCDs would yield `1` as they can indeed cover all moments:
     - Output: 'YES' (Correct)
   
2. **Test Case**: `k1 = 4`, `k2 = 2`, `k3 = 3`
   - The GCD here would yield `1`. This suggests that they can cover all moments:
     - Output: 'YES' (but the provided example states 'NO', indicating an issue with the logic related to coverage).

### Conclusion
When running through various cases, the program does not correctly match the problem statement, as it depends solely on the computation of GCD to verify the coverage capability. The reasoning does not take into account valid configurations where multiple garlands might be lit with strategic starting times.

Therefore, we have a counterexample where the program gives 'YES' while the intended answer would be 'NO.'

Correctness: **False**.
