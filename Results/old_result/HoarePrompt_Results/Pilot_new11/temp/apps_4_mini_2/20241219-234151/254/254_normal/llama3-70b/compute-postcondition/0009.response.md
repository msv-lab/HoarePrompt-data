Functionality: **The function calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two input integers `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. After executing, the function guarantees that `b` will be 0 and `a` will hold the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`. The function does not use parameter `c`, which is mentioned in the annotations and is irrelevant to its operation. Since the inputs are constrained between 1 and 1500, it safely computes the GCD without any additional checks for validity or zero values for `a` or `b`.**
