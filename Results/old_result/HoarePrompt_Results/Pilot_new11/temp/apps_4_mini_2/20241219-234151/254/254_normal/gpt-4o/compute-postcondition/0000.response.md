The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `k1`, `k2`, and `k3`. The initial state specifies that `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` are integers within the range from 1 to 1500. The input will determine their final values. The states of other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`k1`, `k2`, and `k3` are integers such that 1 â‰¤ `k1`, `k2`, `k3` â‰¤ 1500, with `k1`, `k2`, `k3` assigned as input integers.**
