Given the initial conditions where `a` is an integer such that \(0 \leq a < b\), `b` is greater than 0 and is equal to the original value of `a`, and `c` is an integer such that \(1 \leq c \leq 1500\), the code swaps the values of `a` and `b`, and assigns to `a` the value of \(a \mod b\).

1. The original value of `b` is greater than 0 and is the same as the original value of `a` (since it must be greater than 0 and `a < b`).
2. After the execution of `a, b = b, a % b`, the values are updated:
   - `b` takes on the old value of `a`.
   - `a` is updated to the result of \(a \mod b\).
3. Since `b` was the original value of `a` and \(a < b\), \(a \mod b\) will simply return `a` because any number modulo itself is zero.

After executing the code:
- `a` remains unchanged, as \(a \mod b\) results in `a`.
- `b` becomes the original value of `a`.

Thus, the new values of `a` and `b` are:
- `a` is unchanged.
- `b` is equal to the original `a`.

Output State: **`a` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `a` < `b`, `b` is equal to the original value of `a`, and `c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `c` ≤ 1500.**
