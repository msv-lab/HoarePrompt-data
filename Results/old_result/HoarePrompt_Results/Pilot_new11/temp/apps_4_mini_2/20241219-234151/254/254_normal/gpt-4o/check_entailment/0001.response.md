Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the scenarios under which at least one garland is lit at all times after switching them on. The logic used is based on the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the intervals, but this approach is flawed.

For example, consider the input `4 2 3`. The program would calculate the GCD of `4`, `2`, and `3`. The GCD of `4` and `2` is `2`, and the GCD of `2` and `3` is `1`. Hence, the program will output "YES". However, in reality, with these intervals, it's impossible to have at least one garland lit at all times after the second garland (with interval `2`) is switched on. 

In contrast, a valid choice for `x_1`, `x_2`, and `x_3` is not possible in this case, so the correct output should be "NO". 

Therefore, the program does not cover all cases correctly, particularly when looking at the inputs and the intervals provided.
