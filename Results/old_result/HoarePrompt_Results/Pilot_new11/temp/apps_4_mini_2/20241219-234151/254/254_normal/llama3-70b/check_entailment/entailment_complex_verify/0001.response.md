The original assessment stated the program's correctness as **False**, primarily because it incorrectly calculates the least common multiple (LCM) using the function intended to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD). 

Upon analyzing the provided annotations and the logic of the program, the following points stand out:

1. **GCD versus LCM Calculation**: The annotated code indeed confirms that the `func_1` function calculates the GCD correctly. The issue arises in the main logic where the program calculates `lcm` using the wrong method. The correct calculation of LCM should be `lcm(a, b) = abs(a*b) // gcd(a, b)` and should be applied among all three values, which this program does not accomplish.

2. **Conditional Checks**: The conditional statements that check whether `lcm % k1 == 0`, `lcm % k2 == 0`, and `lcm % k3 == 0` rely on the incorrect LCM value. Therefore, any outcome generated by these checks is likely erroneous.

3. **Output Reliability**: As noted in the original assessment, odd configurations like `1 1 1` may return false negatives (returning "NO" when "YES" is expected). Given that the patterns of lit garlands depend heavily on LCM calculations, any miscalculation directly impacts whether valid "YES" or "NO" outputs are produced.

The annotated version does not provide any evidence that would reverse the original correctness assessment. The annotations support the conclusion that the underlying logic in the LCM calculation is flawed.

Thus, upon careful examination of the program, its logic, and the annotations, it is clear that the original assessment pointing to the inconsistencies in logic and the resulting correctness status is accurate. 

Therefore, the final assessment of the program's correctness remains:

Final: **False**
