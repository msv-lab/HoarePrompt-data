Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a non-empty string of length `n`, and `char` is the first character of `s`. If `char` is a lowercase letter, then `current_set` will contain `char`, and `current_count` will be set to 1. If `char` is not a lowercase letter, then `current_set` remains empty, and `current_count` is 0.***
