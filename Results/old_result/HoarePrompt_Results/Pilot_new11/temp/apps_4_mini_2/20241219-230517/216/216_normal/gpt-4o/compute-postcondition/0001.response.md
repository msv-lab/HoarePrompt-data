The variable `s` is assigned the value of input, which should be a string consisting of both lowercase and uppercase Latin letters, and its length should match the new value of `n`. The previous value of `n` as a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) remains valid, but the value of `s` will now reflect the new input received.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200); `s` is an input string of length equal to the new value of `n`.**
