`current_set` is modified by adding `char`, which is the third character of the non-empty string `s`. The values of `n`, `s`, `current_count`, and `max_count` remain unchanged. The output will now reflect that `current_set` includes the character `char`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a non-empty string of length `n`, `char` is the third character of `s`, `current_set` has `char` added to it, `current_count` remains unchanged, `max_count` remains unchanged.**
