Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a non-empty string of length `n`, `char` is the second character of `s`, if `char` is a lowercase letter and is not already in `current_set`, then `current_set` includes `char` and `current_count` is set to 2. If `char` is a lowercase letter but is already in `current_set`, `current_count` remains 1. If `char` is not a lowercase letter, then if it's not in `current_set`, `current_count` is set to 1. Otherwise, `current_count` remains unchanged. If `char` is not a lowercase letter, `current_set` is empty and `current_count` is 0, while `max_count` remains unchanged.***
