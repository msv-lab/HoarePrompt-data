The provided Python program aims to determine the maximum number of unique lowercase letters in a "pretty" set of positions according to the specified criteria from the problem description. Here's an analysis of the program's correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The program begins by reading an integer `n` and a string `s`, which is correct as per the problem's requirement.

2. **Logic to Determine Pretty Set**:
   - The program initializes `max_count` to track the maximum number of unique lowercase letters found consecutively, `current_set` to hold the distinct lowercase letters currently being considered, and `current_count` to count them.
   - It iterates through each character in `s`. 
   - If the character is lowercase, it checks if it is already in `current_set`. If not, it adds the character to `current_set` and increments `current_count`.
   - If an uppercase character is encountered, it compares `current_count` with `max_count` to potentially update `max_count` and then resets `current_set` and `current_count` since uppercase letters break the sequence.

3. **Final Comparison**: After processing all characters, the program performs a final comparison between `current_count` and `max_count` to ensure that any distinct lowercase letters at the end of the string are also counted.

4. **Output**: Finally, the program prints `max_count`, which is intended to represent the maximum number of unique lowercase letters in the valid "pretty" sets of positions.

### Correctness Evaluation:
The program addresses all requirements specified in the problem description. It correctly counts unique lowercase letters while adhering to the restriction that uppercase letters cannot separate these lowercase letters. The logic efficiently handles cases where:
- No lowercase letters are present, resulting in a count of 0.
- Multiple sequences of lowercase letters exist, ensuring correct detection and counting of maximum unique letters between uppercase letters.
- Sequences with mixed cases are appropriately handled by resetting counts upon encountering uppercase letters.

Given all the points mentioned above, the program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description for all possible input cases.

Correctness: **True**
