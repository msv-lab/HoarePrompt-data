The code snippet provided is a print statement. It retrieves and displays the value of `max_count`, but does not alter the state of any variable. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a string of length `n`, `max_count` is the maximum of original `max_count` and `current_count`, `current_set` is empty, `current_count` is 0, and the value of `max_count` has been printed.**
