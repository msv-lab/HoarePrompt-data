Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `v` is the second element of the list `a`, and `nx`, `ny`, `px`, `py` are derived from `v` such that the sum of the absolute differences `abs(nx - nx)` and `abs(ny - ny)` is equal to 1. If the sum of the absolute differences `abs(nx - px) + abs(ny - py)` is not equal to 1, the function returns False. If that condition is not met, the function completes without returning anything.***
