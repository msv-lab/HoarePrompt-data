The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `x` and `y`. Both `x` and `y` are positive integers not exceeding 10^9. After executing the function body, the function can return different values based on specific conditions:

- Case 1: The function returns `False`, indicating that the sum of the absolute differences between `nx` and `px`, and between `ny` and `py` is not equal to 1.
- Case 2: The function returns `False`.
- Case 3: The function returns `False`.
- Case 4: The function returns `True`, indicating that the loop executing the condition with coordinates derived from the last element of list 'a' was successful.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `x` and `y` and return either `True` or `False` based on specific conditions related to these inputs. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`, which are positive integers not exceeding 10^9, and returns `True` if a specific condition is successful based on the coordinates derived from the list; otherwise, it returns `False`.**
