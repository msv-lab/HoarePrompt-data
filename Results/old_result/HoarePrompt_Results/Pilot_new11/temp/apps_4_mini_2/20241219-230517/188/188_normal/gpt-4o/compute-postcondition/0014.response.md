The function `func` accepts a parameter `n` which is an even integer between 2 and 100 inclusive. Additionally, it accepts a parameter `cards`, which is a list containing `n` integers, where each integer is between 1 and 100 inclusive. The specific output of the function is not provided, so it is not possible to describe any return values based on this information. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept an even integer `n` within the specified range and a list of `n` integers that fall within the defined limits. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an even integer parameter n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 100 inclusive.**
