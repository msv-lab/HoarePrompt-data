Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate due to the flawed logic in the program's calculation of the least common multiple (LCM) of the time intervals of the garlands. The program checks whether the LCM is divisible by each time interval in order to determine if all garlands can be lit continuously. However, this condition is insufficient to guarantee that there won't be gaps in the times when at least one garland is lit, as illustrated in the example with inputs of `6, 8, 10`, where there are indeed moments in time when no garland is lit. 

The evaluation of the program's logic, supported by the annotations, reinforces the idea that the current implementation does not successfully fulfill the requirements of the problem description. The use of GCD to derive LCM within the program's logic does not adequately ensure that at least one garland will be lit during every second after the maximum chosen start times, demonstrating an incomplete solution that invalidates the program's correctness.
