According to the code, whether the `while` loop can execute depends entirely on the value of `b`. The loop will execute as long as `b` is non-zero (truthy). 

Right before the loop, `b` is an integer, and it is not specified to be zero, but we cannot confirm whether it is non-zero based on the given context. As such, we need to ensure that `b` is greater than 0 for the loop to run at least once. 

The values of `a` and `c` do not influence the execution of the loop in this case. Therefore, for the loop to proceed at least one time, we only need to modify the state of `b`.

State: **a, b must be greater than 0, and c is an integer representing the time intervals (1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1500)**
