The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer satisfying `1 ≤ n ≤ a + b`; `a` is an integer satisfying `1 ≤ a ≤ 100`; `b` is an integer satisfying `1 ≤ b ≤ 100`; `x` is equal to `min(n, a, b) - 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
