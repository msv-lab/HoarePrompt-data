Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer satisfying `1 ≤ n ≤ a + b`, `a` is an integer satisfying `1 ≤ a ≤ 100`, `b` is an integer satisfying `1 ≤ b ≤ 100`, and `x` is equal to `min(n, a, b) - 1`. If `a >= x`, `b >= x`, and `(a - x + (b - x) >= x)` hold true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged because there is no else part.***
