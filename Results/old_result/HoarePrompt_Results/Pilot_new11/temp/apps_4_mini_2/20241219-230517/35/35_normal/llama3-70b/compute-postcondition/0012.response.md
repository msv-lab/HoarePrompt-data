The values of the variables do not change since we only encounter a `break` statement, which indicates that we exit the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `x` remain unchanged after this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer satisfying `1 ≤ n ≤ a + b`, `a` is an integer satisfying `1 ≤ a ≤ 100`, `b` is an integer satisfying `1 ≤ b ≤ 100`, and `x` is equal to `min(n, a, b) - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`n` is an integer satisfying `1 ≤ n ≤ a + b`, `a` is an integer satisfying `1 ≤ a ≤ 100`, `b` is an integer satisfying `1 ≤ b ≤ 100`, `x` is equal to `min(n, a, b) - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
