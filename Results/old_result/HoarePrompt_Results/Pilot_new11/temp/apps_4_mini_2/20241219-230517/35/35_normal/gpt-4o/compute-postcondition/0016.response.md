The value of `high` is assigned the value of `mid`. Given that `mid` is expressed as `(low + high) // 2`, we can see that `high` will be updated to this value. It’s important to note that the range of `n` has not affected `low`, and the constraints on `n`, `high`, and `low` remain valid. Therefore, the states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a + b`, `high` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, and `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`.**
