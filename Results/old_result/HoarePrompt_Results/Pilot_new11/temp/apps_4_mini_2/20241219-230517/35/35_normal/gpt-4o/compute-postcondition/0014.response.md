The value of `mid` is computed using the formula `(low + high) // 2`, which represents the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high`. Since it is given that `high` must be greater than `low`, we can conclude that the value of `mid` will be strictly between `low` and `high`. The values of `n`, `low`, and `high` are not directly modified, but the newly computed value of `mid` is dependent on `low` and `high`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a + b`, `high` must be greater than `low`, and `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`.**
