You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: It's New Year's Eve soon, so Ivan decided it's high time he started setting the table. Ivan has bought two cakes and cut them into pieces: the first cake has been cut into a pieces, and the second one — into b pieces.

Ivan knows that there will be n people at the celebration (including himself), so Ivan has set n plates for the cakes. Now he is thinking about how to distribute the cakes between the plates. Ivan wants to do it in such a way that all following conditions are met:  Each piece of each cake is put on some plate;  Each plate contains at least one piece of cake;  No plate contains pieces of both cakes. 

To make his guests happy, Ivan wants to distribute the cakes in such a way that the minimum number of pieces on the plate is maximized. Formally, Ivan wants to know the maximum possible number x such that he can distribute the cakes according to the aforementioned conditions, and each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.

Help Ivan to calculate this number x!


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers n, a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b) — the number of plates, the number of pieces of the first cake, and the number of pieces of the second cake, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible number x such that Ivan can distribute the cake in such a way that each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 2 3

Output
1

Input
4 7 10

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the first example there is only one way to distribute cakes to plates, all of them will have 1 cake on it.

In the second example you can have two plates with 3 and 4 pieces of the first cake and two plates both with 5 pieces of the second cake. Minimal number of pieces is 3.
Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, a, b):
    (low, high) = (1, min(a, b) + 1)

    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if can_distribute(mid):
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
    return low - 1

#Function 2:
def can_distribute(x):
    return a // x + b // x >= n


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze both the problem requirements and the provided code.

### Problem Requirements:
1. There are `n` plates.
2. There are `a` pieces of the first cake and `b` pieces of the second cake.
3. Each piece of cake must be placed on a plate.
4. Each plate must have at least one piece of cake.
5. No plate can have pieces from both cakes.
6. We need to maximize the minimum number of pieces on each plate.

### Given Program:
```python
#Function 1:
def func_1(n, a, b):
    (low, high) = (1, min(a, b) + 1)

    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if can_distribute(mid):
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
    return low - 1

#Function 2:
def can_distribute(x):
    return a // x + b // x >= n
```

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Low and High Initialization**:
   - `low` is initialized to 1 (the minimum number of pieces that can be on a plate).
   - `high` is initialized to `min(a, b) + 1`. This indicates that at most each plate can have pieces equal to the smaller cake quantity plus one (which is not inclusive).

2. **Binary Search**:
   - The loop continues while `low` is less than `high`.
   - The midpoint `mid` is calculated to check whether it's possible to distribute `mid` pieces on each plate using the `can_distribute` function.
   - If distribution is possible (`can_distribute(mid)` is true), `low` is adjusted to `mid + 1`; otherwise, `high` is adjusted to `mid`.

3. **Distribution Check (`can_distribute`)**:
   - The `can_distribute` function calculates how many plates can be filled if each plate has at least `x` pieces, summing available pieces divided by `x` for both cakes.
   - It checks if this sum is at least `n`, the number of plates.

### Finding Edge Cases:
- The potential error in the program arises from the use of global variables `a` and `b` inside the `can_distribute` function without passing them as parameters. If `a` and `b` are not defined as global variables or not passed to the function explicitly, this could raise an error.
- Additionally, with the initialization of `high`, there is a scenario where `min(a, b)` becomes `0`. For example, if `a = 0` and `b = x`, this could lead to incorrect handling because `high` would be `1`, but logically, you can't distribute cakes since one type has no pieces.

### Practical Test Cases:
1. **Input:** `2 0 5`
   - Expected Output: Cannot place any pieces since one cake has 0.
   - The code would potentially throw an error due to `a` and `b` not being accessible, leading to incorrect results.

2. **Input:** `5 2 1`
   - Expected Output: 0, since only 3 pieces total are available, and 5 plates need pieces.
   - The answer would be off as in the current implementation, it would not be able to handle that case correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program has critical flaws, particularly regarding variable accessibility and handling the case where one of the cakes has zero pieces. 

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
(n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(n, a, b))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b, a is an integer representing the number of pieces of the first cake where 1 ≤ a ≤ 100, and b is an integer representing the number of pieces of the second cake where 1 ≤ b ≤ 100.
def func_1(n, a, b):
    low, high = 1, min(a, b) + 1
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        if can_distribute(mid):
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `low` is equal to `high`, which is the value where `can_distribute(low - 1)` returned false. `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a + b`, with `a` being an integer where 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 100 and `b` being an integer where 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 100. If `can_distribute(mid)` returned true during the iterations, then `mid` would reflect a successful condition of distribution up to the last tested midpoint. If executed in the loop, `low` was incremented until it reached the final value of `high`, which is `min(a, b) + 1` or less based on previous checks and updates. If the function `can_distribute(mid)` never returned true, `high` would eventually become `1` and `low` would remain `1`, thus concluding with `low` equaling `high`.
    return low - 1
    #The program returns low - 1, where low equals high, which is the value where can_distribute(low - 1) returned false, indicating that no successful distribution could be made.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers representing the number of pieces of the two cakes, n is an integer representing the number of plates such that 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b, and x is a positive integer representing the minimum number of pieces on each plate.
def can_distribute(x):
    return a // x + b // x >= n
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the total number of pieces that can be placed on plates (a // x + b // x) is greater than or equal to the number of plates n, where 'a' and 'b' are the numbers of pieces of the two cakes, 'n' is the number of plates, and 'x' is the minimum number of pieces on each plate.



Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
