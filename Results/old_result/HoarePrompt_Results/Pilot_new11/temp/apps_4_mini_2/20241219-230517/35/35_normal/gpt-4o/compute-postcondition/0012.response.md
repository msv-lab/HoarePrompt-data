Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a + b`. If the function `can_distribute(mid)` returns true, `low` is updated to `mid + 1` while `high` remains unchanged, and `mid` is recalculated as (low + high) // 2. Otherwise, `low` remains unchanged, `high` is updated to `mid`, and `mid` remains as (low + high) // 2.***
