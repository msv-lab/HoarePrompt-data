Postcondition: ***`node` is an integer representing a valid index for `graph` and `graph[node]` has at least one unvisited neighbor left. If `func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack)` returns True, then it indicates that there is at least one unvisited neighbor left for the given `node` in `graph`.***
