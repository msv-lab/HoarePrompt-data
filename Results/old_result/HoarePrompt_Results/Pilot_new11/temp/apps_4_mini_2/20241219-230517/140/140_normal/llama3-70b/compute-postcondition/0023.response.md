Postcondition: ***`node` is an integer representing a valid index for `graph`, and `graph[node]` has at least one unvisited neighbor left. If `visited[neighbor]` is False and `func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack)` returns True, then it indicates that there is at least one unvisited neighbor left for the given `node` in the graph. Otherwise, if `rec_stack[neighbor]` is True, the function returns True, indicating that the current node has at least one unvisited neighbor left in the graph.***
