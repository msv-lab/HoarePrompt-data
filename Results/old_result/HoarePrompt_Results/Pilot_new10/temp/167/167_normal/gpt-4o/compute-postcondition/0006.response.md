The variables `px` and `py` are assigned the values of `nx` and `ny`, respectively. The value of `nx` is calculated as `(a[0] - 1) // y`, and `ny` is calculated as `(a[0] - 1) % y`. Since the sum of the absolute differences `abs(nx - px) + abs(ny - py)` equals 1, either `px` or `py` must change by 1 while the other remains the same.

Thus, after executing the code snippet, `px` becomes `(a[0] - 1) // y` and `py` becomes `(a[0] - 1) % y`. The values of `n`, `a`, `v`, and their previous original conditions remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of integers of length n, `px` is (a[0] - 1) // y, `py` is (a[0] - 1) % y, `v` is the first element in the list a, `nx = (a[0] - 1) // y`, `ny = (a[0] - 1) % y`, and the sum of the absolute differences `abs(nx - px) + abs(ny - py)` equals 1.**
