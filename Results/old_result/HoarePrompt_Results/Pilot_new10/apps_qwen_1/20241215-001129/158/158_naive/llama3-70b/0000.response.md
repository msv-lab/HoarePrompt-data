Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the maximum number of lemons, apples, and pears that can be used in the compote according to the specified ratio. It determines the limiting factor by taking the minimum value among the number of lemons, half the number of apples, and a quarter of the number of pears. This ensures that the fruits are used in the ratio 1:2:4 without breaking them into pieces. The program handles all given examples correctly and should work for any valid input within the constraints provided.
