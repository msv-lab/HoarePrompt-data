Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic required to determine the maximum number of fruits that can be used in the compote while maintaining the ratio 1:2:4 for lemons, apples, and pears respectively. The program calculates the maximum number of lemons (`max_lemons`) that can be used based on the constraints given by the number of apples and pears, and then computes the total number of fruits accordingly. This logic ensures that the program works correctly for all valid inputs within the specified ranges, as demonstrated by the provided examples.
