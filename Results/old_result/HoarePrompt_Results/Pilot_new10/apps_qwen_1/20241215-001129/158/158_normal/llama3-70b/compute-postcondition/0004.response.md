The code calculates the value of `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4` using the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are input by the user, and `min_lemon` is the minimum value among these three. After calculating the expression, the result is printed. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged, but `min_lemon` is used in the calculation.

Let's denote `min_lemon` as the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. The expression to be evaluated is `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`, which simplifies to `7 * min_lemon`.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not specified, we keep them as they are, and the output of the print statement is `7 * min_lemon`.

Output State: **`a` is an integer input by the user, `b` is an integer input by the user, `c` is an integer input by the user, `min_lemon` is the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, and the output of the print statement is `7 * min_lemon`.**
