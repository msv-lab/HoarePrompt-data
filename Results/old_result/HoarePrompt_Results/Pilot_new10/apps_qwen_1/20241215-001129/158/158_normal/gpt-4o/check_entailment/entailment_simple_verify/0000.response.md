Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code, the original assessment appears to be accurate. The annotated code clearly shows that `a`, `b`, and `c` are non-negative integers within the range of 1 to 1000. The logic in the program correctly calculates the maximum number of lemons, apples, and pears that can be used in the compote while maintaining the required ratio. The annotated version confirms that the program correctly implements the necessary logic without any issues, thus supporting the original assessment of correctness.
