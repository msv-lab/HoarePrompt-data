The function reads three non-negative integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) from the user, where each integer is between 1 and 1000 inclusive. It then calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be obtained from these integers under the following conditions: \(a\) lemons can be taken directly, \(\frac{b}{2}\) lemons can be obtained from half of \(b\) apples, and \(\frac{c}{4}\) lemons can be obtained from one-fourth of \(c\) oranges. The function prints the total number of fruits (lemons) that can be obtained based on these conditions.
