Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of fruits that can be used in the compote according to the specified ratio. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are indeed non-negative integers within the specified range, and the program uses the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4` to determine the maximum number of sets of fruits that can be used. The calculation `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4` correctly computes the total number of fruits used in the compote. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
