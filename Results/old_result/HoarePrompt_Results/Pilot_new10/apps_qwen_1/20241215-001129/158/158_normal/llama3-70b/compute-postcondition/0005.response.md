The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to return a value based on some unspecified conditions involving non-negative integers a, b, and c, where 1 <= a, b, c <= 1000.

However, since no specific logic or return conditions are provided in the problem statement, we can only describe the parameters that are supposed to be involved but are not actually passed to the function.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters but involves non-negative integers a, b, and c (where 1 <= a, b, c <= 1000) and returns a value based on certain conditions.**
