Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It reads the number of lemons, apples, and pears from the input, then determines the maximum number of lemons, apples, and pears that can be used in the compote according to the specified ratio (1:2:4). The code calculates the maximum number of sets of the required ratio that can be formed from the available fruits and then computes the total number of fruits used. The logic in the code aligns with the problem description and handles all potential cases within the given constraints. There are no examples or hints suggesting that the code fails to meet the requirements for any input.
