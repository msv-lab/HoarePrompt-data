Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the case where the number of apples or pears is not sufficient to maintain the required ratio. Specifically, the code calculates `min_lemon` as the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. However, this approach does not ensure that the actual number of fruits used maintains the ratio 1:2:4. For example, consider the following input:

- Lemons (a): 2
- Apples (b): 3
- Pears (c): 7

According to the problem description, Nikolay can use 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears, which maintains the ratio. However, the current code would incorrectly calculate `min_lemon` as 1 (since `b // 2` is 1 and `c // 4` is also 1), and then compute the total as `1 + 1*2 + 1*4 = 7`. This is incorrect because only 2 apples and 4 pears are available, not 1 apple and 4 pears.

To fix this, the code should ensure that the number of apples and pears used is exactly twice and four times the number of lemons, respectively. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    c = int(input()
    max_lemons = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)
    print(max_lemons * 7)  # 1 lemon + 2 apples + 4 pears


```

This corrected version ensures that the ratio 1:2:4 is maintained correctly.
