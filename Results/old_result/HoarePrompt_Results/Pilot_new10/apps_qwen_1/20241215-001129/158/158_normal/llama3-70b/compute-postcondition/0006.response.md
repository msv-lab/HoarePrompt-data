Let's analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions step by step.

### Annotated Code Analysis:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    c = int(input())
    min_lemon = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)
    print(min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4)
```

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads three non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from user input.
   - These integers are constrained to be between 1 and 1000.

2. **Min Calculation**:
   - `min_lemon` is calculated as the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.

3. **Output**:
   - The function prints the result of `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`.

### Return Postconditions:
- The function does not explicitly return anything, but it prints the result of the calculation.

### Potential Edge Cases and Missing Logic:
- The code does not handle cases where the inputs might not be integers or might not fall within the specified range.
- There is no explicit handling for invalid input types or values outside the range [1, 1000].

### Functionality Summary:
The function `func` reads three non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from user input, where each integer is constrained to be between 1 and 1000. It calculates `min_lemon` as the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. Finally, it prints the result of the expression `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`.

### Final Functionality Summary:
Functionality: **The function reads three non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c` (where 1 <= a, b, c <= 1000), calculates `min_lemon` as the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, and prints the result of the expression `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`.**
