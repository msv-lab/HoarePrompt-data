The code `a = int(input())` assigns the value obtained from `input()` to the variable `a`. Since `input()` reads a string, and `int()` converts it to an integer, the variable `a` will hold the integer value entered by the user. The variables `b` and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is an integer input by the user, `b` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= b <= 1000, `c` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= c <= 1000**
