Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program takes three inputs `a`, `b`, and `c` representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears respectively. Each input is constrained to the range 1 to 1000, which matches the problem description.

2. **Ratio Check and Maximum Calculation**: The program calculates the maximum number of complete sets of the required ratio (1 lemon, 2 apples, 4 pears) using the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. This ensures that the number of lemons, apples, and pears used adheres to the specified ratio without breaking any fruits. This is correct because:
   - `a` represents the number of lemons available.
   - `b // 2` represents the maximum number of complete pairs of apples that can be used (since 1 lemon requires 2 apples).
   - `c // 4` represents the maximum number of complete quartets of pears that can be used (since 1 lemon requires 4 pears).

3. **Total Fruits Calculation**: The program then computes the total number of fruits that can be used by multiplying the maximum number of complete sets (`max_lemons`) by the required quantities (1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears).

4. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the total number of fruits used, which is the sum of lemons, apples, and pears from the complete sets.

### Example Cases:

- **Example 1**: 
  - Input: `2` (lemons), `5` (apples), `7` (pears)
  - Output: `7` (1 lemon + 2 apples + 4 pears)
  
- **Example 2**: 
  - Input: `4` (lemons), `7` (apples), `13` (pears)
  - Output: `21` (3 lemons + 6 apples + 12 pears)
  
- **Example 3**: 
  - Input: `2` (lemons), `3` (apples), `2` (pears)
  - Output: `0` (no valid set of fruits can be used)

In all cases, the program correctly determines the maximum number of fruits that can be used while maintaining the required ratio, ensuring compliance with the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
