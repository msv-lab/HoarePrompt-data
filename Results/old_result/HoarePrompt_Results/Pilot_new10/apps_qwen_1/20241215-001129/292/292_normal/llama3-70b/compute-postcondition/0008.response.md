The initial state indicates that `a` is 9 and `b` is 2 times an integer `b_original` which is between 1 and 5, and `b` must be at least 6. Therefore, `b` could be 6, 8, or 10, depending on the value of `b_original`.

The code snippet `b *= 2` doubles the value of `b`.

Let's analyze each possible case:

1. If `b_original` is 3 (so `b` is 6), then `b` becomes 12.
2. If `b_original` is 4 (so `b` is 8), then `b` becomes 16.
3. If `b_original` is 5 (so `b` is 10), then `b` becomes 20.

In all cases, `a` remains 9.

Output State: **`a` is 9, `b` is 12, 16, or 20**
