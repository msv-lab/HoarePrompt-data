Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It initializes the weights of Limak and Bob, and then iteratively triples Limak's weight and doubles Bob's weight each year, incrementing a counter until Limak's weight becomes strictly greater than Bob's weight. The code handles all potential cases within the given constraints (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10) and will produce the correct number of years required for Limak to become strictly larger than Bob.
