Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input, ensuring they meet the constraints \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10\).

2. **Loop Logic**: 
   - The program initializes `years` to 0.
   - It enters a loop that continues as long as `a` is less than or equal to `b`.
   - Inside the loop, both `a` and `b` are updated by tripling `a` and doubling `b`, respectively.
   - Each iteration of the loop increments the `years` counter.
   
3. **Termination Condition**: The loop terminates when `a` becomes strictly greater than `b`.

4. **Output**: The program prints the number of years it took for `a` to become strictly greater than `b`.

### Why it works for all cases:
- The loop ensures that `a` is tripled each year and `b` is doubled each year.
- Since `a` starts smaller than or equal to `b` and grows exponentially faster (tripling vs. doubling), `a` will eventually surpass `b`.
- The number of years required for this to happen is correctly counted and printed.

### Example Walkthroughs:
- **Example 1**: Input: `4 7`
  - Year 1: \(a = 4 \times 3 = 12\), \(b = 7 \times 2 = 14\)
  - Output: 2 (correct, as Limak becomes larger than Bob after 2 years)

- **Example 2**: Input: `4 9`
  - Year 1: \(a = 4 \times 3 = 12\), \(b = 9 \times 2 = 18\)
  - Year 2: \(a = 12 \times 3 = 36\), \(b = 18 \times 2 = 36\)
  - Year 3: \(a = 36 \times 3 = 108\), \(b = 36 \times 2 = 72\)
  - Output: 3 (correct, as Limak becomes larger than Bob after 3 years)

- **Example 3**: Input: `1 1`
  - Year 1: \(a = 1 \times 3 = 3\), \(b = 1 \times 2 = 2\)
  - Output: 1 (correct, as Limak becomes larger than Bob after 1 year)

The program correctly simulates the growth of Limak and Bob's weights over time and accurately counts the number of years until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's. Therefore, the program is correct.
