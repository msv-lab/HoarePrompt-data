Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It takes two integers `a` and `b` as input, representing the initial weights of Limak and Bob, respectively. The program then enters a loop where Limak's weight is tripled and Bob's weight is doubled each year, incrementing the `years` counter until Limak's weight becomes strictly greater than Bob's weight. The program correctly outputs the number of years required for this condition to be met. Since the problem constraints and examples provided match the behavior of the code, the program works correctly for all potential cases within the given range.
