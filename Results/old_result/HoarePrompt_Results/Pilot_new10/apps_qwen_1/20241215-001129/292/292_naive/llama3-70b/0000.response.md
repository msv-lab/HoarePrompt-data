Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine after how many full years Limak will become strictly larger than Bob. The program iterates, tripling Limak's weight and doubling Bob's weight each year until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's. The loop continues incrementing the `years` counter until this condition is met. Given the constraints (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10), the program will always find a solution within a reasonable number of iterations. All provided examples and the general logic ensure the program works as expected for all valid inputs.
