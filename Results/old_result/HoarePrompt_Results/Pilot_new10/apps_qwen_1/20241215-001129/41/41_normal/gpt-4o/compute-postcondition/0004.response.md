According to the code, the loop will execute based on the value of `n`. Since `n` is the input integer within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 2.

Here are the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute:

- `n` must be within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000.
- `a_i` and `b_i` are not yet defined, but since the loop body is omitted, these variables might be defined within the loop.
- `ratings` is an empty list, and this is fine as the loop will append elements to this list.
- `is_unrated` is `False`, and this state does not affect the loop's execution directly.

Therefore, the key adjustment needed is ensuring that `n` is within the specified range for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `a_i` and `b_i` are not yet defined, `ratings` is an empty list, `is_unrated` is `False`**
