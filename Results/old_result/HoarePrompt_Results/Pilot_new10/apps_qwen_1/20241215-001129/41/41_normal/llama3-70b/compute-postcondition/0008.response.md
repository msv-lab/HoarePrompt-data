`a` and `b` are assigned the values from `input().split()`, which are converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The values of `n` and `ratings_before` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 999; `ratings_before` is `[a]`; `ratings_after` is `[b]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 999; `ratings_before` is `[a]`; `ratings_after` is `[b]`**
