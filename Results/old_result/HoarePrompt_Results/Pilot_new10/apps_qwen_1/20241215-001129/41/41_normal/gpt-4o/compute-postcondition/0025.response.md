The code `break` does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the loop or the most internal loop or conditional statement we were inside. Since there is no loop or conditional statement that `break` is explicitly part of in the given code snippet, the only thing that happens is that the program will exit the current loop or conditional statement.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `ratings` is a list containing exactly `n` tuples \((a_i, b_i)\), `is_unrated` is `True`, `is_rated` is `False`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
