`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` is now known, but the initial state's description of `n` being an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000 remains valid. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`n` is the integer entered, 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000**
