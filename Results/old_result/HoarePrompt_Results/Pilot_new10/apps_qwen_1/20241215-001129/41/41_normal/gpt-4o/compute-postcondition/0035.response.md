Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 1, `ratings` is a list containing exactly `n` tuples \((a_i, b_i)\), `is_unrated` is `True`, `is_rated` is `False`.**

### Explanation:
1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`.
2. **Break Condition**: The loop breaks if `ratings[i-1][0] < ratings[i][0]` for any `i`.

Since the loop continues to increment `i` until it reaches `n-1` without breaking (assuming the condition `ratings[i-1][0] < ratings[i][0]` is never met), `i` will eventually become `n` when the loop completes all its iterations.

After the loop finishes executing, the value of `i` will be `n`, and the condition `ratings[i-1][0] < ratings[i][0]` will not be checked because `i` is now `n`, which is out of bounds for the list indices (as list indices are `0` to `n-1`). Therefore, `is_unrated` remains `True` and `is_rated` remains `False`.

The list `ratings` and the value of `n` remain unchanged.
