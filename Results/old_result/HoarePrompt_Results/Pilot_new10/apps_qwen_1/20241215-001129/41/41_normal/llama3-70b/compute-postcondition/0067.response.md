The code `break` does not assign any new values to variables. Instead, it is used to exit a loop. Since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the variables `unrated`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`unrated` is `False`, `i` is `0`, `j` is `2`**
