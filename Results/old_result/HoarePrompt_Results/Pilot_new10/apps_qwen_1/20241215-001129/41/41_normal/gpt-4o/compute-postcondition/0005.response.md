`a` and `b` are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input using `map(int, input().split())`. This means that the user will input two integers separated by a space, which will be converted to integers and assigned to `a` and `b` respectively. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is within the range 2 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 1000, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `a_i` and `b_i` are not yet defined, `ratings` is an empty list, `is_unrated` is `False`**
