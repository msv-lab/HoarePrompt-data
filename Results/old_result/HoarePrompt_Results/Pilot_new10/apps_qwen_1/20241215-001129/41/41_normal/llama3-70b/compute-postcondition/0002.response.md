The code `ratings_after = []` initializes an empty list for `ratings_after`. This does not affect the value of `n` or `ratings_before`. Therefore, the output state remains as follows:

Output State: **`n` is the integer entered, 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `ratings_before` is an empty list; `ratings_after` is an empty list**
