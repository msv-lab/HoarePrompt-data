Let's think through this step-by-step:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop `for i in range(1, n)` will start from `i=1` and go up to `i=n-1`.

2. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000.
   - `ratings` is a list containing exactly `n` tuples \((a_i, b_i)\).
   - `is_unrated` is `False`.
   - `is_rated` is `False`.
   - The condition `(not is_rated)` is satisfied.

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be within the range defined by `range(1, n)`, meaning `1 <= i < n`.
   - Since the loop starts from `i=1` and goes up to `n-1`, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - The initial value of `i` is not specified in the given state, but it will start from `1` during the first iteration of the loop.
   - Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `i` starts from `1` and `n` must be greater than `1` (since `1 <= i < n`).

5. **Additional Considerations**:
   - The condition `(not is_rated)` being satisfied means that `is_rated` is `False` at the start of the loop.
   - The `ratings` list should contain exactly `n` tuples as given.

Based on these considerations, the required adjustments are:
- `i` must start from `1`.
- `n` must be greater than `1` (since the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`).

So, the final state adjustment is:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, ratings is a list containing exactly `n` tuples \((a_i, b_i)\), `is_unrated` is `False`, `is_rated` is `False`.**
