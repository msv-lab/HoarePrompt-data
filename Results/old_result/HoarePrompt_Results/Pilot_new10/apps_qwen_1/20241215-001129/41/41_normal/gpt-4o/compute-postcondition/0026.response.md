Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `ratings` is a list containing exactly `n` tuples \((a_i, b_i)\), `is_unrated` is `True`, `is_rated` is `False`. If `ratings[i-1][0] < ratings[i][0]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains unchanged if the condition is not met.***
