Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables and Conditions:**
   - The loop iterates over a range from `i + 1` to `n`, where `j` is the loop variable.
   - The initial value of `i` is given as `0`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to start, the condition `j` should be within the range `[i+1, n)`.
   - Since `i` is `0`, the loop will start if `j` is between `0 + 1` (which is `1`) and `n` (inclusive).

3. **Current State:**
   - `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 1000.
   - `ratings_before` is a list of `n` integers.
   - `ratings_after` is a list of `n` integers.
   - `rated` is `False`.
   - `unrated` is `True`.
   - `maybe` is `True`.
   - `i` is `0`.

4. **Adjust the State for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will start when `j` is at least `1` and `j < n`.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that there exists at least one valid `j` that satisfies `1 <= j < n`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `n` must be at least 2 (since `i` is 0, and `j` must be at least 1).
- `i` is already `0`.
- `j` must be at least `1` and less than `n`.

However, since the loop will start as long as `j` is within the range `[1, n)`, and `n` is already constrained to be at least 2, the main adjustment needed is to ensure that `n` is at least 2.

**Final State:**

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 0, `ratings_before` is a list of `n` integers, `ratings_after` is a list of `n` integers, `rated` is `False`, `unrated` is `True`, `maybe` is `True`**
