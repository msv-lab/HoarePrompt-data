Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop:**
   - The loop variable `_` (an underscore) is used as a placeholder in the loop. It does not hold any specific value within the loop itself, but the loop still requires `n` to be a positive integer to determine how many iterations to perform.

2. **Determine the Initial Conditions for the Loop:**
   - Since the loop is defined as `for _ in range(n):`, the loop will run `n` times.
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. Given that `2 ≤ n ≤ 1000`, we know `n` is already within this valid range.

3. **Check Other Variables:**
   - `ratings_before` is initially an empty list.
   - `ratings_after` is initially an empty list.
   - There are no other variables mentioned in the provided code snippet that affect the loop's execution.

4. **State the Required Adjustments:**
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is ensuring that `n` is a positive integer, which it is given the constraints \(2 \leq n \leq 1000\).

Given the above analysis, the required state adjustments are:

State: **`n` is a positive integer between 2 and 1000, `ratings_before` is an empty list, `ratings_after` is an empty list**
