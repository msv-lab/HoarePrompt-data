Postcondition: ***`unrated` remains `False`, `j` is `i + 2`, and there exists an index `j > i + 2` such that `ratings_before[i + 2] < ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i + 2] > ratings_after[j]`. Additionally, if `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken.***

Explanation: Since the else part is not provided and the if condition is met, the postcondition follows directly from the if part. The if condition ensures that if the specified conditions are true, the most internal loop or if statement is broken, which is the only change mentioned in the if part's postcondition. The other variables (`unrated`, `j`) remain unchanged as per the precondition and the absence of modifications in the if part.
