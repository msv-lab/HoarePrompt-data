The code `print('maybe')` simply prints the string 'maybe' to the console and does not affect any of the variables in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `n`, `ratings`, `is_unrated`, and `is_rated` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `ratings` is a list containing exactly `n` tuples \((a_i, b_i)\), `is_unrated` is `False`, and `is_rated` is `False`. A string 'maybe' was printed to the console.**
