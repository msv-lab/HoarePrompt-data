`ratings_before` is appended with `a`, which means `a` is added to the list. The value of `n` and `ratings_after` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 999; `ratings_before` is `[a, a]`; `ratings_after` is `[b]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 999; `ratings_before` is `[a, a]`; `ratings_after` is `[b]`**
