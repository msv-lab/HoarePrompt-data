The code `is_unrated = False` assigns the value `False` to the variable `is_unrated`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is the input integer within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `a_i` and `b_i` are not yet defined, `ratings` is an empty list, `is_unrated` is `False`**
