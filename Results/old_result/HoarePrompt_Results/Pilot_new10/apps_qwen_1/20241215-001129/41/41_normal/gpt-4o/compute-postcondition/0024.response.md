`is_unrated` is set to `True`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `ratings` is a list containing exactly `n` tuples \((a_i, b_i)\), `is_unrated` is `True`, `is_rated` is `False`. The current value of \( ratings[i-1][0] \) is less than the current value of \( ratings[i][0] \).**
