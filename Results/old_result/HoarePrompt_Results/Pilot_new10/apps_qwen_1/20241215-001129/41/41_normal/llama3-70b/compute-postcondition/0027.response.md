The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or conditional statement. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional statement directly preceding the `break` statement in the given code snippet, the `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply indicates that execution will exit the current loop or conditional block.

The initial state remains unchanged because the `break` statement does not assign new values to any variables or alter their conditions.

Output State: **`ratings_before` is a list of integers, `ratings_after` is a list of integers, `i` is the same as the previous iteration, `j` is `i + 2`, `unrated` is `False**, and we break out of the most internal loop or conditional statement.
