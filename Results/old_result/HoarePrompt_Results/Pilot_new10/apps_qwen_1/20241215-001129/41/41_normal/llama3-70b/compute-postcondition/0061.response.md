Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `unrated` is `False`
   - `i` is `0`
   - `j` is `n`
   - For all `j` in the range `[i+1, n-1]`, the condition `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j] and ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]` remains false.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs over `j` in the range `[i+1, n)`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `0` and `j` is `n`.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be in the range `[i+1, n)`.
   - Since `i` is `0`, the loop will run for `j` values from `1` to `n-1` (if `n > 1`).

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - `i` remains `0` as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `j` must be set to `1` (the smallest possible value in the new range) for the loop to execute again.
   - The condition `ratings_before[0] < ratings_before[j] and ratings_after[0] > ratings_after[j]` must remain false for the next value of `j`.

5. **Final State**:
   - `unrated` is still `False` as no unrated condition was met.
   - `i` is `0`.
   - `j` is `1` (as the smallest value in the new range).
   - The condition `ratings_before[0] < ratings_before[j] and ratings_after[0] > ratings_after[j]` must remain false for `j = 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`unrated` is `False`, `i` is `0`, `j` is `1`**
