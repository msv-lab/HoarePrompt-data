Postcondition: ***`unrated` is `False`, `i` is `0`, `j` is `n`. For all `j` in the range `[i+1, n-1]`, the condition `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j] and ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]` remains false. Additionally, if the condition `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j] and ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]` is true, then the process breaks out of the most internal loop or conditional block.***
