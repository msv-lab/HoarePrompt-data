According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop will continue as long as `j` is within the specified range, which is from `i + 1` to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `unrated` is `False`, `i` is `0`, and `j` is `1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 (since it starts from `i + 1` and increments implicitly with each iteration). Therefore, `j` will become `2` in the next iteration.

Since there are no conditions given that would change `unrated` or `i` based on the loop's execution, these values remain the same.

State: **`unrated` is `False`, `i` is `0`, `j` is `2`**
