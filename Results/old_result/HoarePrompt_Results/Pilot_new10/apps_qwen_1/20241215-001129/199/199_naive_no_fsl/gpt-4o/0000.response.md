Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the remaining length after the first two cuts cannot be divided into two unequal parts. For example, consider the input `20`. According to the problem description, there are four valid ways to cut the stick:

1. `{1, 1, 9, 9}`
2. `{2, 2, 8, 8}`
3. `{3, 3, 7, 7}`
4. `{4, 4, 6, 6}`

However, the program only checks if `rem` (the remaining length after the first two cuts) is greater than 0 and if it is even, without ensuring that `rem` can be split into two unequal parts. This results in missing some valid cases. Specifically, the program does not handle the case where the remaining length can be split into two equal parts, which violates the condition of not being able to form a square.

For instance, in the case of `20`, the program would miss the valid way `{5, 5, 5, 5}` because it does not check if the remaining length can be split into two equal parts while still forming a rectangle.
