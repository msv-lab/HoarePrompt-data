`ways` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `ways` is either 1 or 2, so after incrementing by 1, the new value of `ways` will be either 2 or 3. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `ways` is either 2 or 3, `a` is less than or equal to `n // 2`, `a` is not equal to `b`, and twice the sum of `a` and `b + 1` equals `n`.**
