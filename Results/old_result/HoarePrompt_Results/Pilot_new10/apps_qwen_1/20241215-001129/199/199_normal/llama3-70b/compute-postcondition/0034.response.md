`ways` is incremented by 1. The value of `n` is still greater than or equal to 3, and the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged since they are not affected by the code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `a` is \(\frac{n}{2} + 2\), `b` is the next value such that \(a \neq b\) and \(2 \times (a + b) = n\) plus 1 (if any), and `ways` is increased by 1.
