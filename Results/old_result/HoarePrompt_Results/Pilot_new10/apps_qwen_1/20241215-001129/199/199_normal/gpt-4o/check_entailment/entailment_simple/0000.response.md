Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `n` from the input, ensuring it is a positive integer within the specified range \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^9\).
   - The function `func_1` is then called with this value of `n`.

2. **Function Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` starts by checking if `n` is less than 6. If it is, the function immediately returns 0 because it's impossible to split the stick into four parts where each part has a positive integer length.
   - For `n` values greater than or equal to 6, the function initializes a counter `count` to zero.
   - It then iterates over all possible values of `a` from 1 to `n // 4`. This ensures that the parts are split into four segments where each segment is at least 1 unit long and no more than `n // 4`.
   - For each value of `a`, it calculates the remaining length `rem` after accounting for two segments of length `a` each.
   - It checks if `rem` is positive and even, and ensures that `a` is not equal to half of `rem` (which would indicate a square). This ensures that a rectangle can be formed but not a square.
   - If the conditions are met, it increments the `count`.

3. **Output**:
   - The function finally returns the count, which represents the number of valid ways to split the stick into four parts that can form a rectangle but not a square.

The program correctly handles all the constraints and conditions specified in the problem description. It checks for the possibility of forming a rectangle while ensuring that no configuration forms a square. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for any valid input within the specified range.
