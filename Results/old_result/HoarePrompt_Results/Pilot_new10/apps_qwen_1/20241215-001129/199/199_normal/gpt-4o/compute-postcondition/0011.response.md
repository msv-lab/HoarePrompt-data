Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^9\) and \(n \geq 6\), `count` is 1, `b` is undefined, `rem` is undefined, and the remainder of some operation is greater than 0 and even, assuming the condition `a != rem // 2` holds true. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains as described in the if part.***
