Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the program does not correctly handle the conditions required to form a rectangle with different side lengths. The output hints confirm that the function `func_1` only counts pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 ≤ a ≤ n/2`, `a ≠ b`, and `2 * (a + b) = n`. However, this does not ensure that the remaining lengths can form a rectangle with different side lengths. For example, for `n=20`, the function would miss valid combinations like `{1, 1, 9, 9}`, `{2, 2, 8, 8}`, `{3, 3, 7, 7}`, and `{4, 4, 6, 6}` because it only checks for pairs `(a, b)` where `a` and `b` are different and their sum is half of `n`. Therefore, the program needs to be modified to properly account for all valid rectangle configurations that do not form a square.
