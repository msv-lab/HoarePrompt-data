Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `a` is \(\frac{n}{2} + 2\), `b` is the last value such that \(a \neq b\) and \(2 \times (a + b) = n\) (if any), and `ways` is the count of valid pairs \((a, b)\) satisfying the conditions within the loop, ensuring \(a \leq (n - a) // 2 + 1\); if \(a \neq b\) and \(2 \times (a + b) = n\), `ways` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the value of `ways` remains unchanged.***
