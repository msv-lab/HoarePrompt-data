Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^9\) and \(n \geq 6\), `count` is the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` where \(a\) and \(b\) are integers such that \(1 \leq a \leq n//4\) and \(n - 2(a + b)\) is positive and even, and \(a \neq (n - 2(a + b)) // 2\), `b` is undefined, `rem` is undefined, and `a` is undefined.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over values of `a` from 1 to `n // 4`.
- For each value of `a`, `b` is initialized to `a`.
- `rem` is calculated as `n - 2 * (a + b)`.
- If `rem` is greater than 0 and even, and `a` is not equal to `rem // 2`, then `count` is incremented by 1.
- The loop continues to iterate until all possible values of `a` have been checked.

After all iterations of the loop, `count` will hold the total number of valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the conditions specified in the loop. The values of `b`, `rem`, and `a` will be undefined because they are only defined within the scope of the loop. The initial state of `n` and `count` will remain as given in the initial state.
