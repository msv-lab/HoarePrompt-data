According to the code, the loop depends on the variable `a`. The loop will continue as long as `a` is within the range from 1 to `n // 2 + 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states were true:
- `n` is greater than or equal to 3
- `a` is \(\frac{n}{2} + 1\)
- `b` is the last value such that \(a \neq b\) and \(2 \times (a + b) = n\)
- `ways` is the count of valid pairs \((a, b)\) satisfying the conditions within the loop.

For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must be increased by 1 and still be within the range. Therefore, the new value of `a` will be \(\frac{n}{2} + 2\).

To determine the new values for `b` and `ways`, we need to recalculate based on the new value of `a`:
- Since \(a = \frac{n}{2} + 1\) at the end of the previous iteration, the new `a` will be \(\frac{n}{2} + 2\).
- To find `b` such that \(a \neq b\) and \(2 \times (a + b) = n\), we substitute \(a = \frac{n}{2} + 2\):
  \[
  2 \left( \frac{n}{2} + 2 + b \right) = n
  \]
  Simplifying the equation:
  \[
  n + 4 + 2b = n
  \]
  \[
  4 + 2b = 0
  \]
  \[
  2b = -4
  \]
  \[
  b = -2
  \]

However, since `b` must be a positive integer, this indicates that no valid pair exists when \(a = \frac{n}{2} + 2\). Therefore, the count of valid pairs `ways` remains unchanged.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `a` is \(\frac{n}{2} + 2\), `b` is -2 (which is invalid, so no change in `b`), and `ways` is the count of valid pairs \((a, b)\) satisfying the conditions within the loop.**

Since `b` being -2 is invalid, we should consider that no new valid pair is added, and thus `ways` remains the same as the previous count.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `a` is \(\frac{n}{2} + 2\), `b` is the last value such that \(a \neq b\) and \(2 \times (a + b) = n\) (if any), and `ways` is the count of valid pairs \((a, b)\) satisfying the conditions within the loop.**
