`count` is incremented by 1. The value of `n` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^9\) and \(n \geq 6\). The values of `b` and `rem` remain undefined, and the remainder of some operation is greater than 0 and even, with the current value of `a` not equal to `rem` divided by 2.

Output State: **`count` is 1, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^9\) and \(n \geq 6\), `b` is undefined, `rem` is undefined, the remainder of some operation is greater than 0 and even, and the current value of `a` is not equal to `rem` divided by 2**
