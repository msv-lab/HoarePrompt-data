`ways` is incremented by 1. The value of `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `ways` is initially 0, `a` is less than or equal to `n // 2`, `a` is not equal to `b`, and twice the sum of `a` and `b` equals `n`. After the code executes, `ways` is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `ways` is 1, `a` is less than or equal to `n // 2`, `a` is not equal to `b`, and twice the sum of `a` and `b` equals `n`**
