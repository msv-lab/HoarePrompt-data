Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^9\) and \(n \geq 6\), `count` is 2, `b` is \(n // 4 + 1\), `rem` is \(\frac{n}{2} - 2\), and `a` is \(n // 4 + 1\). This state occurs if and only if `a` is not equal to `rem // 2`. If the condition is not met, the state remains unchanged as there is no else part specified.***
