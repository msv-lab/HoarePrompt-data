According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop starts from `a = 1` and continues as long as `a` is less than or equal to `n // 2`.

Given that `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\), for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 3 because the loop starts at 1 and goes up to `n // 2`. This means `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.

The variable `ways` is initialized to 0, and this value does not directly affect the loop's execution but may be modified within the loop body.

So, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `ways` is 0**
