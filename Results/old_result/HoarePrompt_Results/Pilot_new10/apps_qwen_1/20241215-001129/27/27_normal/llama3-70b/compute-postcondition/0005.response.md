`a5` is assigned the value of `y ** x ** z`. Given the initial state, `x` is `a`, `y` is `b`, and `z` is `c`, the expression `y ** x ** z` evaluates to `b ** a ** c`. The value of `a5` becomes `b ** a ** c`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`x` is `a`, `y` is `b`, `z` is `c`, `a1` is `a`, `a2` is `a`, `a4` is `(a ** c) ** b`, `a5` is `b ** a ** c`.**
