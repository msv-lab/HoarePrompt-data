The code `a2 = x ** z ** y` calculates `a2` as `x` raised to the power of `z ** y`. Given the initial state where `x` is `a`, `y` is `b`, and `z` is `c`, we substitute these values into the expression:

- `z ** y` is `c ** b`.
- Then, `x ** (z ** y)` is `a ** (c ** b)`.

The value of `a1` remains unchanged and is still `a`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`x` is `a`, `y` is `b`, `z` is `c`, `a1` is `a`, `a2` is `a ** (c ** b)`**.
