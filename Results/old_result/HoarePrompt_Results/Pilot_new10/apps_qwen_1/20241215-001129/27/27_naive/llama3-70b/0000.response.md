Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to evaluate all 12 possible expressions and returns the one that has the maximum value. The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. It reads three real numbers with one decimal place, calculates each of the 12 possible expressions, finds the maximum value among them, and prints the corresponding expression in the required format. Since the program follows the problem description accurately for every potential case, it is considered correct.
