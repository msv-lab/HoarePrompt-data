Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It evaluates all 12 possible expressions and prints the one with the maximum value along with its corresponding string representation. The program handles the constraints and examples provided:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads three real numbers with one decimal place as specified.
2. **Expression Evaluation**: It evaluates all 12 expressions and stores them along with their string representations in a list of tuples.
3. **Max Value Calculation**: It finds the maximum value among the evaluated expressions.
4. **Correct Output**: It prints the expression corresponding to the maximum value, following the specified format.

Since the program correctly handles all given examples and potential cases within the constraints, it meets the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
