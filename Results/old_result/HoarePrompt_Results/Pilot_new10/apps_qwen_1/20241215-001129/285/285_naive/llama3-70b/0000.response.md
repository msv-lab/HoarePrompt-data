Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program checks all possible combinations of houses, cars, and computers that Kolya could have bought to see if they sum up to his initial game-coin score `n`. 

- It iterates over possible values of `a` (number of houses), `b` (number of cars), and calculates `c` (number of computers) accordingly.
- For each combination, it checks if the total cost matches `n`.
- If a valid combination is found, it prints "YES" and exits.
- If no valid combination is found after checking all possibilities, it prints "NO".

Since the program systematically checks all possible combinations within the given constraints, it will correctly determine whether Kolya could have spent all of his initial `n` game-coins buying only houses, cars, and computers. There are no apparent edge cases or logical flaws in the provided code that would cause it to fail under any input.
