The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately without further execution of the code. This means that no variables are updated, and the program does not proceed to the next line of code.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1234567, `a` is 1, `b` is the previous value of `b` plus 1, `c` is \((n - 1 * 1234567 - (b + 1) * 123456) // 1234\), and the string 'YES' is printed.**
