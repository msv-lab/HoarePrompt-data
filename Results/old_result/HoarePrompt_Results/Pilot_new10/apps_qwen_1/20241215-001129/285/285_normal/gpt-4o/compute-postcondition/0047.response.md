The code assigns `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost` to `remaining_after_cars`. Here, `b` is known to be 2, but `remaining_after_houses` and `car_cost` are not specified in the initial state. Since `b` is 2, `b * car_cost` becomes `2 * car_cost`. However, without knowing the exact value or expression of `remaining_after_houses` and `car_cost`, we can only express `remaining_after_cars` as `remaining_after_houses - 2 * car_cost`.

The states of the other variables (`a` and `b`) are not affected.

Output State: **`a` is 1, `b` is 2, `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - 2 * car_cost`**
