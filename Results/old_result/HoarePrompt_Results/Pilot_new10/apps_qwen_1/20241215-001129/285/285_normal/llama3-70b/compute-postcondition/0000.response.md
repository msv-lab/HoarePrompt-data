`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which means `n` is now an integer input from the user. The initial condition that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9` is preserved, but the specific value of `n` is now determined by user input. Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user, 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9**
