Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variable and Its Initial State**: The loop variable `b` is initialized within the range function, so we don't need to adjust its initial value directly. Instead, we focus on the range function arguments.

2. **Analyze the Range Function Arguments**:
   - The start of the range is implicitly `0` (as the range function typically starts from `0` if no start value is specified).
   - The stop value is `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1`.
   - The step value is `1` (default value).

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, the range function's stop value must be greater than `0`.
   - Therefore, `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1 > 0`.

4. **Evaluate the Expression `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1`**:
   - `remaining_after_houses` is defined as `remaining_after_houses`, which is the same as the initial state.
   - `car_cost` is an unspecified variable, but it doesn't affect our adjustment since we are focusing on ensuring the loop condition.
   - To ensure the loop runs, `remaining_after_houses` must be at least `car_cost`.

5. **Consider Other Relevant Variables**:
   - `a` is set to `1` initially and does not affect the loop execution directly.
   - `remaining_after_houses` is defined as `n - house_cost`, which means it is already in the correct form based on the given information.
   - `b` remains `0` initially, but as noted, this is the starting point of the loop and doesn't need adjustment.

Given these considerations, the key state to adjust for the loop to execute is that `remaining_after_houses` must be greater than or equal to `car_cost`.

**Final State Adjustment**:
State: **`a` is 1, `remaining_after_houses` must be greater than or equal to `car_cost`, `b` remains 0, `remaining_after_houses` is `n - house_cost`**
