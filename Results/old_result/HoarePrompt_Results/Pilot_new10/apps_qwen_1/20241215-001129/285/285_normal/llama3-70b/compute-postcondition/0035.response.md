Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1234567, `a` is 1, `b` is `b_prev + 1`, `c` is \(\left( n - 1234567 - (b_prev + 1) * 123456 \right) // 1234\). If the condition \(a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234 == n\) holds, the function does nothing. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.***
