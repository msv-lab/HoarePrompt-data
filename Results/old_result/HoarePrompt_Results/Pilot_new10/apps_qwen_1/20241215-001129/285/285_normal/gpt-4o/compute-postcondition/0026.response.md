Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `remaining_after_houses` must be greater than or equal to 0.
   - `b` is 0.
   - `a` is 1.
   - `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `remaining_after_houses`.
   - `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost` is not equal to 0.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `b` in the range `range(remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1)`.
   - This means the loop will run as long as `b < remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1`.

3. **Current Values:**
   - `b` is currently 0.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `b` needs to be incremented and still satisfy the loop condition.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since `b` starts from 0 and the loop runs based on `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1`, we need to determine if `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1` is greater than 0.
   - Given `remaining_after_houses` must be greater than or equal to 0 and `car_cost` is a positive value, `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1` will be at least 1.
   - Therefore, the loop will execute at least once.

5. **New State After Incrementing `b`:**
   - `b` will be incremented from 0 to 1.
   - All other variables (`remaining_after_houses`, `a`, `remaining_after_cars`, and `computer_cost`) remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop body (which is omitted).

6. **Final Adjusted State:**
   - `b` will be 1.
   - The other variables remain the same as in the previous state.

**Final Answer:**

State: **`remaining_after_houses` must be greater than or equal to 0, `b` is 1, `a` is 1, `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `remaining_after_houses`, and `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost` is not equal to 0**
