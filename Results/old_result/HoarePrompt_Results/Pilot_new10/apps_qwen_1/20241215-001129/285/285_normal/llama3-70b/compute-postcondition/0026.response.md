Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1234567
- `a` is 1
- `c` is \((n - 1 * 1234567 - b * 123456) // 1234\)
- If \(a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234\) equals `n`, then 'YES' is printed to the console. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.

### For Loop Statement:
```
for b in range((n - a * 1234567) // 123456 + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for values of `b` starting from 0 up to \(\left\lfloor \frac{n - a \times 1234567}{123456} \right\rfloor\).

2. **Current State**:
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1234567
   - `a` is 1
   - `c` is \((n - 1 * 1234567 - b * 123456) // 1234\)

3. **Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, the value of `b` must be within the range specified by the loop condition. That is, \(b\) should be less than \(\left\lfloor \frac{n - 1 \times 1234567}{123456} \right\rfloor\).

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `b` was one value lower than the upper limit of the loop. Therefore, for the next iteration, `b` needs to be increased by 1.
- The new value of `b` will be the current value of `b` plus 1.
- Since `a` and `c` depend on the value of `b`, we need to update their values based on the new value of `b`.

### New State:
- `n` must still be greater than or equal to 1234567
- `a` remains 1 (since it doesn't change within the loop)
- The new value of `b` is the previous value of `b` plus 1.
- The new value of `c` is calculated as \((n - 1 * 1234567 - (b + 1) * 123456) // 1234\)

### Final State:
State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1234567, `a` is 1, `b` is the previous value of `b` plus 1, `c` is \((n - 1 * 1234567 - (b + 1) * 123456) // 1234\)**
