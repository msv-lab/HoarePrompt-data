Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided code still has an issue where it does not correctly handle the case where `n` is exactly divisible by the cost of a single house (1,234,567). For example, consider the input `n = 1234567`. The program should return "YES" because Kolya could have bought exactly one house and no cars or computers. However, the current implementation does not account for this scenario, leading to an incorrect result. The output hints also confirm that the function should check if it's possible to buy a combination of houses, cars, and computers such that the total cost exactly matches `n`, which includes cases where only houses are purchased.
