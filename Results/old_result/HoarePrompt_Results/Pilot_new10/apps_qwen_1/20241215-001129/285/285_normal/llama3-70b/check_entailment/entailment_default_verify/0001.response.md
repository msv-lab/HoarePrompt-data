Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program correctly checks all possible combinations of houses, cars, and computers to determine if Kolya could have spent all of his initial n game-coins. The output hints confirm that the function iterates through all potential values of `a`, `b`, and `c` to find a valid combination that sums up to `n`. Since the program handles all potential cases within the given constraints, the original assessment is correct.
