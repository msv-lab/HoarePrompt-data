The code assigns the value `123456` to the variable `car_cost`. This assignment does not affect the value of `n` or `house_cost`. Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `house_cost` is 1234567; `car_cost` is 123456**
