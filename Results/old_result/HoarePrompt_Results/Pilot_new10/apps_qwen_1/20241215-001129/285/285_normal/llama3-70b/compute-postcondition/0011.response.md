The code `exit()` does not modify any variable values but instead terminates the program. Given the initial state where `n` must be greater than or equal to 123456, `c` is -98, and `b` is equal to \((n - a \times 1234567) // 123456 + 1\), these conditions and the value of `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 123456, `c` is -98, `b` is equal to \((n - a \times 1234567) // 123456 + 1**
