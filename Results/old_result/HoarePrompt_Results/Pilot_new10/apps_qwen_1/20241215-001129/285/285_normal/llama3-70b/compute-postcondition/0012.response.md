Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than or equal to 123456, `c` is -98, `b` is equal to \((n - a \times 1234567) // 123456 + 1. If the condition `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234 == n` is true, the postcondition remains the same. If the condition is false, the postcondition also remains the same since there is no additional change in the variables.***
