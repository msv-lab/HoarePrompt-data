Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the initial state at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - If the loop returns 'YES':
     - `remaining_after_houses` is >= 0
     - `b` is the last value of `b` where `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost != 0`
     - `a` is incremented to the final value
     - `remaining_after_cars` is the final value of `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`
     - `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0`
   - If the loop does not return 'YES':
     - `remaining_after_houses` is >= 0
     - `b` remains 0
     - `a` is 1
     - `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `remaining_after_houses`
     - `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost != 0`

2. **Understand the for loop:**
   ```python
   for a in range(n // house_cost + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Determine the new values at the start of the next iteration:**
   - The loop iterates over values of `a` from 0 to `n // house_cost`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, we need to determine the starting values for `a` and `remaining_after_cars`.

4. **Analyze the conditions:**
   - If the loop returned 'YES':
     - `a` is incremented to the final value.
     - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `a` should be the final value of `a` from the previous iteration plus 1.
     - `remaining_after_cars` is updated as `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`.
   - If the loop did not return 'YES':
     - `a` is set to 1.
     - `remaining_after_cars` is set to `remaining_after_houses`.
     - `b` remains 0.

5. **Combine the conditions:**
   - If the loop returned 'YES', the next `a` would be the previous `a` + 1.
   - If the loop did not return 'YES', `a` is 1 and `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses`.

Since the exact condition (whether 'YES' was returned) is not specified, we need to consider both scenarios. However, typically, if the loop did not return 'YES', it means the initial conditions were not met, and we reset to the base case.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
- `a` is 1 (if the loop did not return 'YES')
- `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses` (if the loop did not return 'YES')

Given the general scenario where the loop might not have returned 'YES' unless explicitly stated otherwise, we will assume the non-'YES' case for the next iteration.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`a` is 1, `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses`, `b` remains 0**
