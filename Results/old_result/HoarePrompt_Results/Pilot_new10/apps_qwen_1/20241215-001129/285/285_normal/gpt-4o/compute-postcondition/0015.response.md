The initial state provides us with two equations:
- `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - (2(b + 1) + 1) * car_cost`
- `b` is `b + 1`

The code snippet changes the value of `remaining_after_cars` to `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`.

Let's analyze this step-by-step:

1. **Initial State Variables:**
   - `remaining_after_cars` is calculated as `remaining_after_houses - (2(b + 1) + 1) * car_cost`.
   - `b` is updated to `b + 1`.

2. **Code Execution Impact:**
   - The code updates `remaining_after_cars` to `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`.
   - This means the new value of `remaining_after_cars` is now `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`, where `b` is the updated value of `b + 1`.

3. **Updating Values:**
   - The updated value of `b` from the initial state is `b + 1`.
   - Therefore, the new value of `remaining_after_cars` becomes `remaining_after_houses - (b + 1) * car_cost`.

Given the above, the output state should reflect the updated value of `remaining_after_cars` and the updated value of `b`.

Output State: **`remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - (b + 1) * car_cost`, and `b` is `b + 1`.**
