Output State: **`a` is the maximum value of `a` for which the loop can execute, `b` is the maximum value of `b` for which the loop can execute, `remaining_after_houses` is the final value of `remaining_after_houses` after the loop ends, `remaining_after_cars` is the final value of `remaining_after_cars` after the loop ends, and `n` is the original value of `n`.** 

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over possible values of `a` (number of houses) and `b` (number of cars) to check if the remaining amount (`remaining_after_cars`) is divisible by `computer_cost`.
- The loop continues to increment `a` and `b` until it either finds a combination where `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0` or exhausts all possible combinations.
- If the loop finds such a combination, it returns `'YES'`, and the values of `a`, `b`, `remaining_after_houses`, and `remaining_after_cars` will be those corresponding to the successful combination.
- If the loop does not find such a combination, it will return nothing, and the values of `a`, `b`, `remaining_after_houses`, and `remaining_after_cars` will be the maximum values they reached during the execution of the loop.

In both cases, the original value of `n` remains unchanged because the loop only modifies `a` and `b` and calculates intermediate values like `remaining_after_houses` and `remaining_after_cars`.
