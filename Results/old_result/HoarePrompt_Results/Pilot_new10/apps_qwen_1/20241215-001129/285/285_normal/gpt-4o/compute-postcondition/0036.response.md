The code assigns the value of `n - a * house_cost` to `remaining_after_houses`. Given that `a` is 1 and `house_cost` is assumed to be a variable (since its value is not provided), the expression simplifies to `n - 1 * house_cost` or simply `n - house_cost`. The other variables `a`, `remaining_after_cars`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is 1, `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses`, `b` remains 0, `remaining_after_houses` is `n - house_cost`**
