`remaining_after_cars` is assigned the value of `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`. Given that `b` is 0 and `car_cost` is not specified but the multiplication of `b` (which is 0) with any value of `car_cost` will result in 0, the equation simplifies to `remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - 0`, which means `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `remaining_after_houses`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `remaining_after_houses` must be greater than or equal to 0, `b` is 0, `a` is 1, `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `remaining_after_houses`.
Output State: **`remaining_after_houses` must be greater than or equal to 0, `b` is 0, `a` is 1, `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `remaining_after_houses`**
