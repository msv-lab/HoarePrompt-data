The `exit()` function call terminates the program immediately without further execution of any subsequent code. This means that no further changes to variables occur after this point. The conditions and values before the `exit()` call remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 123456, `c` is equal to (n - a * 1234567 - b * 123456) // 1234, and the equation (a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234) equals `n', and 'YES' is printed to the console.**
