To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given information and the for loop statement step by step.

### Given Information
- State at the end of the previous iteration:
  - \( n \) is at least 2,469,134.
  - \( a \) is 2.
  - \( b \) is \( b_k + 1 \).
  - \( c \) is \(-b \times 100\).
  - The condition \( a \times 1234567 + b \times 123456 + c \times 1234 = n \) either holds true or does not change.

### For Loop Statement
```
for b in range((n - a * 1234567) // 123456 + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for values of \( b \) starting from \( b_k + 1 \) up to \( (n - a \times 1234567) // 123456 \).

2. **Current Values**:
   - \( n \geq 2,469,134 \)
   - \( a = 2 \)
   - \( b = b_k + 1 \)
   - \( c = -b \times 100 \)

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - To enter the next iteration, the current value of \( b \) must satisfy the range condition.
   - The next value of \( b \) would be \( b + 1 \).

### Updated State
- Since the loop runs based on the range calculation, the loop will continue as long as the new value of \( b \) (which is \( b + 1 \)) is within the range.
- Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, \( b \) will be \( b + 1 \).

### Adjusted State
- \( n \) remains at least 2,469,134.
- \( a \) remains 2.
- \( b \) is updated to \( b + 1 \).
- \( c \) remains \(-b \times 100\), but since \( b \) changes, \( c \) will be \(-(b + 1) \times 100\).

### Final Answer
State: **`n` is at least 2,469,134, `a` is 2, `b` is \( b_k + 2 \), `c` is \(-(b_k + 2) \times 100\)**.
