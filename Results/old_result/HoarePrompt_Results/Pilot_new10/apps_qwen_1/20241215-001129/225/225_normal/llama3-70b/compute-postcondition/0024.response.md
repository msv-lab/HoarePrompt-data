`last_vowel` is assigned the value `i`. This changes the value of `last_vowel` to the current value of `i`, but does not affect `max_jump`. The previous conditions for setting `max_jump` are not directly impacted by this assignment, as they were determined before this line of code.

Output State: **`max_jump` is an integer. If `last_vowel` is -1, `max_jump` remains 3. Otherwise, if the character at index 1 is a vowel, `max_jump` is set to 2; if the character at index 1 is not a vowel, `max_jump` is set to 1. In both cases, `max_jump` is then updated to `max(max_jump, (i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1)`. `last_vowel` is now `i`.**
