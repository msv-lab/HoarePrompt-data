The code sets `prev_pos` to the value of `i`. The previous value of `prev_pos` was `i + 2`, and now it is updated to `i`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string, `i` is the index `i + 2` within the string `s`, `prev_pos` is `i`, and `max_jump` is the maximum of its original value and 0.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `i` is the index `i + 2` within the string `s`, `prev_pos` is `i`, and `max_jump` is the maximum of its original value and 0.**
