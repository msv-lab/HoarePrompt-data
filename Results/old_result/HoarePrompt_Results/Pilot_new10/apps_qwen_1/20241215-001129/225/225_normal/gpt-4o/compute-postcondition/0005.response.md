The code snippet `max_jump = max(max_jump, i - prev_pos)` updates the value of `max_jump` to be the maximum of its current value and the difference between the current index `i` and the previous position `prev_pos`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

To calculate the updated value of `max_jump`, we need to know the values of `max_jump`, `i`, and `prev_pos`. However, since these values are not provided, we can express the output state in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`max_jump` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `i - prev_pos`, `s` is a string, `i` is an index within the string `s`, and the character at index `i` in string `s` is one of the vowels; `prev_pos` retains its previous value.**
