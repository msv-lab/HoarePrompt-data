Output State: **`s` is a string, `i` is `len(s)`, `prev_pos` is the last index where a vowel was found in the string `s`, and `max_jump` is the maximum distance between any two consecutive vowels in the string `s`.** 

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`.
- If the character is a vowel, `max_jump` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the difference between the current index `i` and the previous position of a vowel (`prev_pos`).
- After all characters in the string have been processed, `i` will be `len(s)` because the loop increments `i` for each iteration until the end of the string.
- `prev_pos` will be the index of the last vowel encountered in the string `s`.
- `max_jump` will be the maximum distance between any two consecutive vowels in the string `s`. If there are no vowels in the string, `max_jump` will remain its original value (1).

In the case where the loop does not execute (i.e., there are no vowels in the string `s`), the values will be:
- `i` is 0 (or the length of the string, depending on how the loop is implemented).
- `prev_pos` is -1 (since no vowels were found).
- `max_jump` is 1 (its initial value).
