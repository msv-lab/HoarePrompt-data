Postcondition: ***`s` is the user input string, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s`, `max_jump` is 1, `last_vowel` is either -1 or a non-negative integer, `i` is 0, `s[i]` is a vowel, `n` must be greater than 0. If `last_vowel` was -1 before the if-else block, it remains -1. Otherwise, `last_vowel` is updated to 0.***
