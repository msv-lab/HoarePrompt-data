`max_jump` is updated to be the maximum value between its current value and `i - prev_pos`. Given that `i` is the index `i + 2` within the string `s`, and `prev_pos` is `i + 2`, the value of `i - prev_pos` simplifies to `(i + 2) - (i + 2)`, which equals 0. Since `max_jump` remains unchanged in this operation unless the new value (0) is greater than the current value of `max_jump`, and without knowing the initial value of `max_jump`, we can only say that `max_jump` is now the maximum of its original value and 0.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `i` is the index `i + 2` within the string `s`, `prev_pos` is `i + 2`, and `max_jump` is the maximum of its original value and 0.**
