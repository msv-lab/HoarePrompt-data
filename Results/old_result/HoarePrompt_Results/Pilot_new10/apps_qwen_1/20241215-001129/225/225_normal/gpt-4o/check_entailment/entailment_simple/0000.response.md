Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads a string from the input, which is as per the problem statement.
2. **Vowel Identification**: The program identifies vowels as 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', and 'Y'. This matches the given set of vowels in the problem description.
3. **Jump Calculation**:
   - The program iterates through the string to find the maximum distance between consecutive vowels. This ensures that the Grasshopper can jump over any non-vowel characters.
   - The variable `max_jump` is updated to keep track of the maximum distance encountered between consecutive vowels.
   - After the loop, it accounts for the distance from the last vowel to the end of the string, ensuring the Grasshopper can reach the end.
4. **Return Value**: The function returns the calculated `max_jump`, which represents the minimum jump ability required for the Grasshopper to reach the end of the string, jumping only on vowels.

The logic is sound and handles all edge cases, such as strings containing no vowels or multiple consecutive vowels. The function `func_1` correctly computes the required jump ability based on the given rules.

Therefore, the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description.
