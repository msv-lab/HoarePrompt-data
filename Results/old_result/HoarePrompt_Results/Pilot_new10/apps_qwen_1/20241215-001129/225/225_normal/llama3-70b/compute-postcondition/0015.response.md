The code updates the value of `max_jump` to be the maximum between its current value (`max_jump`) and the sum of `i` and 1. Initially, `i` is 1. Therefore, `max_jump` will be updated to be the maximum of its current value and 2.

Since `max_jump` is initially set to 1, the new value of `max_jump` will be 2 (as 2 is greater than 1).

Output State: **`s` is the user input string, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s`, `max_jump` is 2, `last_vowel` is 0, `i` is 1**
