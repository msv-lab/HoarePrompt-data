Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the given problem. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads a non-empty string `s` consisting of capital English letters, which is consistent with the problem statement.
   - It then calls the function `func_1(s)` and prints the result.

2. **Function `func_1(s)`**:
   - The function initializes `vowels` with the set of vowel characters.
   - It initializes `max_jump` to 1 and `prev_pos` to -1. The variable `max_jump` will store the maximum jump length needed to reach the next vowel.
   - It iterates through the string `s` using a for loop and checks if the current character is a vowel.
     - If it is a vowel, it updates `max_jump` to be the maximum of its current value and the difference between the current index `i` and the previous vowel index `prev_pos`. This step ensures that `max_jump` keeps track of the longest gap between any two consecutive vowels.
     - It then updates `prev_pos` to the current index `i`.
   - After the loop, it updates `max_jump` to account for the final segment of the string from the last vowel to the end of the string.
   - Finally, it returns `max_jump`.

3. **Logic and Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles strings with no vowels by returning the length of the string plus one, as per the problem statement.
   - It correctly identifies the maximum jump length required to reach the end of the string, considering only jumps on vowels.
   - The program ensures that the jump ability (maximum jump length) is calculated accurately by keeping track of the longest gaps between vowels.

Given that the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all cases appropriately, the program is correct. Therefore, the output will be `True`.
