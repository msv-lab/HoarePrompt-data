`prev_pos` is assigned the value of `i`. The `max_jump` remains unchanged, `s` is a string, `i` is an index within the string `s`, and the character at index `i` in string `s` is one of the vowels. The value of `prev_pos` is now updated to the current value of `i`.

Output State: **`max_jump` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `i - prev_pos`, `s` is a string, `i` is an index within the string `s`, and the character at index `i` in string `s` is one of the vowels; `prev_pos` is now `i`.**
