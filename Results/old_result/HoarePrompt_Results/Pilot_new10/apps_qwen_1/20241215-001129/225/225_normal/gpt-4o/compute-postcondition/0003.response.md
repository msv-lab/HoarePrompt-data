Let's break down the given information and determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute.

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100.
   - `vowels` is a set containing {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}.
   - `max_jump` is 1.
   - `prev_pos` is -1.

2. **For Loop:**
   ```
   for i in range(len(s)):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The for loop iterates over the indices of the string `s`.
   - The condition for the loop to execute is that the range function should provide valid indices, i.e., there should be at least one index in the range from 0 to `len(s) - 1`.

4. **Determining Necessary Adjustments:**
   - Since `s` is a non-empty string, its length (`len(s)`) must be at least 1.
   - Therefore, the loop will start with `i = 0` and continue as long as `i < len(s)`.
   - Given that `len(s)` is at least 1, the loop will execute at least once.

5. **Final State After Adjustment:**
   - `s` must be a non-empty string.
   - `vowels` remains unchanged.
   - `max_jump` remains unchanged.
   - `prev_pos` remains unchanged.

Since the initial conditions already ensure that the loop can execute (as `s` is non-empty and its length is at least 1), no additional state adjustments are needed beyond confirming that `s` is non-empty.

**State:**
**`s` is a non-empty string, `vowels` is a set containing {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `max_jump` is 1, `prev_pos` is -1**
