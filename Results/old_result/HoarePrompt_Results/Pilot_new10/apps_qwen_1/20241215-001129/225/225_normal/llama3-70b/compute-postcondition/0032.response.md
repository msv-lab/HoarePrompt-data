Let's analyze the annotated code step by step to determine the functionality of the function `func`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting of capital English letters, and its length does not exceed 100.
   - Vowels are defined as 'AEIOUY'.
   
2. **Initialization**:
   - `n` is set to the length of the string `s`.
   - `max_jump` is initialized to 0.
   - `last_vowel` is initialized to -1.

3. **For Loop Execution**:
   - The function iterates over each character in the string `s`.
   - If the current character is a vowel:
     - If `last_vowel` is -1 (meaning no vowel has been encountered yet), `max_jump` is updated to the current index plus one.
     - If `last_vowel` is not -1, `max_jump` is updated to the maximum of its current value and half the distance between the last vowel and the current vowel, plus one.
     - `last_vowel` is updated to the current index.

4. **Final Check**:
   - After the loop, if `last_vowel` is not the last index of the string, `max_jump` is updated to the maximum of its current value and half the distance from the last vowel to the end of the string, plus one.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the value of `max_jump`.

### Potential Edge Cases and Missing Logic:
- The function does not explicitly handle the case where the string does not contain any vowels.
- The function does not return anything explicitly. Instead, it prints the result, which means it doesn't conform to the typical return-based postconditions.

### Corrected Postconditions Based on the Code:
- The function processes a non-empty string and finds the maximum possible "jump" distance between vowels in the string.
- If the string contains no vowels, `max_jump` would be based on the final update from the `if` condition outside the loop.

### Functionality Summary:
The function `func` accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting of capital English letters, and its length does not exceed 100. The function calculates the maximum possible "jump" distance between vowels in the string. If the string contains no vowels, it calculates the distance from the last non-vowel position to the end of the string. The function prints the result of this calculation.

### Final Summary:
Functionality: **The function accepts a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters and calculates the maximum possible "jump" distance between vowels in the string. If no vowels are present, it calculates the distance from the last non-vowel position to the end of the string and prints the result.**
