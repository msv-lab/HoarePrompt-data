The code sets `last_vowel` to the current value of `i`. Previously, `last_vowel` was either -1 or 0 depending on the initial condition. Now, `last_vowel` is updated to the value of `i`, which is 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is the user input string, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s`, `max_jump` is 1, `last_vowel` is 1, `i` is 1. If `last_vowel` is -1, then `max_jump` is set to 2. Otherwise, `max_jump` remains 1.**
