Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `s` is a string.
   - `i` is an index within the string `s`.
   - `prev_pos` is updated to `i`.
   - If the character at index `i` in string `s` is a vowel, `max_jump` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `i - prev_pos`. Otherwise, `max_jump` remains unchanged.

2. **Current Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < len(s)`.

3. **State Adjustments for the Next Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the index where we processed the character (which could be a vowel or not).
   - For the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - `prev_pos` is updated to the new value of `i`.
   - `max_jump` remains unchanged if the current character is not a vowel, otherwise it is updated as described.

4. **Final States at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` will be `i + 1` (the next index in the string).
   - `prev_pos` will be `i + 1` (since it gets updated to the new `i`).
   - `max_jump` remains unchanged unless the new character at `i + 1` is a vowel.

Given these steps, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`s` is a string, `i` is the index `i + 1` within the string `s`, `prev_pos` is updated to `i + 1`, and `max_jump` remains unchanged.**
