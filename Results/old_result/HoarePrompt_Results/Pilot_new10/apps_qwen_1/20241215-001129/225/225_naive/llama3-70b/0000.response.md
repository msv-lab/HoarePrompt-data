Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the minimum jump ability required for the Grasshopper to jump from the beginning of the string to the end, landing only on vowels. The logic iterates through the string, tracking the last vowel seen and calculating the necessary jump length between vowels. If the last vowel seen is not at the end of the string, it correctly accounts for the final jump. The program handles all given examples and potential cases as described in the problem statement.
