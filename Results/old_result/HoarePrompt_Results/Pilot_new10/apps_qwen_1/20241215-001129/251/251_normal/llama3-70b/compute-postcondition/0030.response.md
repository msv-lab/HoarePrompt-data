Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial States:**
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `j` is a value between `0` and `i-1`.
   - `n` is a positive integer greater than `0`.
   - `dp[i]` is `cakes[i][0]`.
   - `cakes` remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `j` from `0` to `i-1`.

3. **Ensuring the Loop Can Execute:**
   - For the loop to execute, the initial value of `j` must be within the range `0` to `i-1`.
   - Since `i` is `n`, `j` must be between `0` and `n-1`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `i` should be set to `n` (which is already given).
   - `j` must be initialized to a value within the range `[0, n-1]`.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state such that `j` is initialized to a value within the valid range and `i` is correctly set to `n`.

**Final State:**
- `i` is `n`.
- `j` must be a value between `0` and `n-1`.
- `n` is a positive integer greater than `0`.
- `dp[i]` is `cakes[i][0]`.
- `cakes` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the required state to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

State: **`i` is `n`, `j` must be a value between `0` and `n-1`, `n` is a positive integer greater than `0`, `dp[i]` is `cakes[i][0]`, `cakes` remains unchanged.**
