You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: As you know, every birthday party has a cake! This time, Babaei is going to prepare the very special birthday party's cake.

Simple cake is a cylinder of some radius and height. The volume of the simple cake is equal to the volume of corresponding cylinder. Babaei has n simple cakes and he is going to make a special cake placing some cylinders on each other.

However, there are some additional culinary restrictions. The cakes are numbered in such a way that the cake number i can be placed only on the table or on some cake number j where j < i. Moreover, in order to impress friends Babaei will put the cake i on top of the cake j only if the volume of the cake i is strictly greater than the volume of the cake j.

Babaei wants to prepare a birthday cake that has a maximum possible total volume. Help him find this value.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of simple cakes Babaei has.

Each of the following n lines contains two integers r_{i} and h_{i} (1 ≤ r_{i}, h_{i} ≤ 10 000), giving the radius and height of the i-th cake.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum volume of the cake that Babaei can make. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 6}.

Namely: let's assume that your answer is a, and the answer of the jury is b. The checker program will consider your answer correct, if $\frac{|a - b|}{\operatorname{max}(1, b)} \leq 10^{-6}$.


-----Examples-----
Input
2
100 30
40 10

Output
942477.796077000

Input
4
1 1
9 7
1 4
10 7

Output
3983.539484752



-----Note-----

In first sample, the optimal way is to choose the cake number 1.

In second sample, the way to get the maximum volume is to use cakes with indices 1, 2 and 4.
Program:
```
import sys
import math

input = sys.stdin.read
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

def func_1(n, cakes):
    volumes = [math.pi * r * r * h for (r, h) in cakes]
    dp = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i] = volumes[i]
        for j in range(i):
            if volumes[j] < volumes[i]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + volumes[i])
    return max(dp)

def func_2():
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    cakes = [(int(data[2 * i + 1]), int(data[2 * i + 2])) for i in range(n)]
    result = func_1(n, cakes)
    print(f'{result:.6f}')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the dynamic programming solution to find the maximum volume of the special cake that can be made under the given constraints. The program reads the input, calculates the volumes of the cakes, and uses dynamic programming to find the maximum possible total volume. The logic ensures that each cake is placed on a smaller cake or directly on the table, and the volumes are compared to ensure the correct placement. Since the implementation follows the problem description accurately and handles all given examples correctly, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
input = sys.stdin.read
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

import sys
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100000, and cakes is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers representing the radius (r_i) and height (h_i) of the i-th cake such that 1 <= r_i, h_i <= 10000.
def func_1(n, cakes):
    volumes = [(math.pi * r * r * h) for r, h in cakes]
    dp = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i] = volumes[i]
        
        for j in range(i):
            if volumes[j] < volumes[i]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + volumes[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State:
    return max(dp)
    #The program returns the maximum value among the elements in the list 'dp'

1. **Parameters and Input**:
   - The function `func_1` accepts two parameters:
     - `n`: A positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100000\).
     - `cakes`: A list of tuples, where each tuple contains two positive integers representing the radius (\(r_i\)) and height (\(h_i\)) of a cake. Specifically, \(1 \leq r_i, h_i \leq 10000\).

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The first line calculates the volume of each cake using the formula \( \pi r^2 h \) and stores these volumes in a list called `volumes`.
   - A dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` is initialized with zeros.
   - For each cake (indexed by `i`), the volume of the current cake is added to `dp[i]`.
   - For each previous cake (indexed by `j`), if the volume of the previous cake is less than the current cake, the value of `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the sum of `dp[j]` and the volume of the current cake.

3. **Return Statement**:
   - The function returns the maximum value among the elements in the list `dp`.

4. **Annotations vs. Actual Code**:
   - The annotations suggest that the code calculates the maximum value considering some form of dependency between cakes, but the actual code only sums the volumes without considering dependencies.
   - The `dp` array is used to store the cumulative maximum volume achievable up to each cake index without explicitly considering the dependency mentioned in the annotations.

5. **Functionality Summary**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the maximum possible volume that can be achieved by selecting a subset of the given cakes, where the selection order is irrelevant.
   - It initializes a DP array to store the maximum volume achievable up to each cake.
   - For each cake, it updates the DP array by considering the volume of the current cake and the maximum volume achievable up to the previous cake.

Given the above analysis, the correct summary of the function's functionality is:

**Functionality: The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of tuples representing cakes with their radii and heights. It calculates the maximum possible volume that can be achieved by selecting a subset of the given cakes, without considering any dependencies between the selections. It returns the maximum value among the elements in the DP array.**

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 000, and cakes is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing the radius and height of the i-th cake, such that 1 <= radius[i], height[i] <= 10 000 for all 0 <= i < n.
def func_2():
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    cakes = [(int(data[2 * i + 1]), int(data[2 * i + 2])) for i in range(n)]
    result = func_1(n, cakes)
    print(f'{result:.6f}')


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
