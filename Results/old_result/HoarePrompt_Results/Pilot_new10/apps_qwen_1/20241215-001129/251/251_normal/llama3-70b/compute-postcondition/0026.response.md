Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `j` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0. If `cakes[i][1]` is less than `cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2]` is less than `cakes[j][2]`, then `dp[1]` is the maximum of its original value and `dp[0] + cakes[1][0]`. Otherwise, the value of `dp[1]` remains unchanged.***
