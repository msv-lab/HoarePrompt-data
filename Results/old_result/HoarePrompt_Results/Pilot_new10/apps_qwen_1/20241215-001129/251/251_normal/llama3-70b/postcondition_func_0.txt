The function accepts a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two positive integers representing the radius and height of a simple cake. It calculates the volume of each cake and sorts the cakes in descending order by volume. Then, it uses dynamic programming to find the maximum total volume of non-overlapping cakes, where a cake can only be chosen if its radius and height are both smaller than those of the previously chosen cake. Finally, it prints the maximum total volume.
