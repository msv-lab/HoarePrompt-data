The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, and assigns this list to the variable `data`. The initial state values of `n` and the `cakes` list remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `data` and retains the initial values of `n` and `cakes`.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting an input line; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 000; `cakes` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing the radius and height of the i-th cake such that 1 <= radius[i], height[i] <= 10 000 for all 0 <= i < n.**
