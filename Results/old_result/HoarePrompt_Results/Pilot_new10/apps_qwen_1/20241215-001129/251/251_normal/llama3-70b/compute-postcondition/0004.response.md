`cakes` is appended with a tuple containing the volume of a cake (calculated as `math.pi * r * r * h`), the radius `r`, and the height `h`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not involved in this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer value entered by the user and must be greater than 0, `cakes` is a list containing one tuple `(math.pi * r * r * h, r, h)`, `r` is an integer from input, `h` is an integer from input**
