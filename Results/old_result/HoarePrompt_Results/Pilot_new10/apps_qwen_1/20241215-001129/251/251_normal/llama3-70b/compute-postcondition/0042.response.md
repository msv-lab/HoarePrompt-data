The code `dp[i] = cakes[i][0]` assigns the value of `cakes[i][0]` to `dp[i]`. This updates the value of `dp[i]` but does not affect the values of `i`, `j`, `n`, or the `cakes` list. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `dp[i]`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` ranges from 0 to n-1, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `dp[i]` is `cakes[i][0]`, `cakes` remains unchanged.**
