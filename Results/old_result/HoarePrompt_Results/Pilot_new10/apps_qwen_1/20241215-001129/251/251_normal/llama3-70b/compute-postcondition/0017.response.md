Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is a positive integer greater than 0.
   - `dp[1]` is `cakes[1][0]`.

2. **For Loop**:
   ```python
   for j in range(i):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - The `range(i)` function generates numbers from 0 to `i-1`.
   - Given that `i` is 1, `range(1)` will generate only one number: 0.

4. **Required Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute, there must be at least one iteration.
   - Since `i` is 1, the loop will execute if `j` takes the value 0.

5. **State Adjustment**:
   - The variable `i` is already set to 1, so no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - The variable `j` needs to be initialized to 0 for the loop to execute its single iteration.

### Final State Adjustment:
- `i` is already 1.
- `j` must be 0 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `j` must be 0.

### Answer:
State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `dp[1]` is `cakes[1][0]`**
