Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code in `func_2` does not correctly handle the problem constraints. Specifically, it does not ensure that the cakes are placed in an order where the volume of a higher cake is strictly greater than the volume of the lower cake. Instead, it simply calculates the maximum possible volume without considering the dependency between the cakes' volumes.

To illustrate why the code is incorrect, consider the following example:

**Input:**
```
4
1 1
9 7
1 4
10 7
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3983.539484752
```

However, the current implementation of `func_1` does not enforce the condition that the volume of a cake placed on top must be strictly greater than the volume of the cake below it. Therefore, it will consider all possible combinations of volumes, which may lead to an incorrect maximum volume.

For instance, in the given example, the correct way to maximize the volume would be to place cakes with volumes 659.734457253 and 3983.539484752, resulting in a total volume of 3983.539484752. However, the current implementation may consider other combinations that do not meet the problem constraints, leading to an incorrect result.

Thus, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case, making the correctness **False**.
