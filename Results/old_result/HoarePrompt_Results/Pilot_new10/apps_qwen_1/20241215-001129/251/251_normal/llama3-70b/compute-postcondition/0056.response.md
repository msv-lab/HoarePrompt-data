The function `func` accepts a parameter which is a list of tuples. Each tuple in the list contains two positive integers representing the radius and height of a simple cake. The length of the list is a positive integer `n` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), and for each tuple \((r_i, h_i)\), \(1 \leq r_i, h_i \leq 10,000\). The function does not return an error message but instead returns a specific value based on the input list. 

Given the output cases are not specified, we can only state the input and return type without further details.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers representing the radius and height of a simple cake, and then return a specific value based on the input list.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two positive integers representing the radius and height of a simple cake, and returns a specific value based on the input list.**
