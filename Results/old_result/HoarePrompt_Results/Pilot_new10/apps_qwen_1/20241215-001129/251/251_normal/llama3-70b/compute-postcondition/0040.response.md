Output State: **`i` is `n`, `j` ranges from `0` to `n-1`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `dp[n]` is the maximum value obtained by iterating through all possible `j` such that `(cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1] and cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2])` and updating `dp[i]` accordingly, and `cakes` remains unchanged.**
