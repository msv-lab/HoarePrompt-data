To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze how the loop modifies the variables and conditions.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `dp[i]` is an integer.
- If `cakes[i][1]` is less than `cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2]` is less than `cakes[j][2]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to `max(dp[i], dp[j] + cakes[i][0])`.
- Otherwise, the value of `dp[i]` remains unchanged.

The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `i-1`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `dp[i]` is an integer.
   - The condition for updating `dp[i]` involves comparing `cakes[i][1]` and `cakes[i][2]` with `cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[j][2]` respectively.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - For each `j` in the range `0` to `i-1`, the loop checks if `cakes[i][1] > cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2] > cakes[j][2]`.
   - If both conditions are true, then `dp[i]` is updated to `max(dp[i], dp[j] + cakes[i][0])`.
   - Otherwise, `dp[i]` remains unchanged.

3. **State at the Start of Next Iteration:**
   - The loop is about to start with `j = i-1` and will continue decrementing `j` until `j = 0`.
   - Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration (when `j` is `i-1`) will depend on whether the loop updates `dp[i]` or not.

4. **Conditions for Updating `dp[i]`:**
   - If `cakes[i][1] > cakes[i-1][1]` and `cakes[i][2] > cakes[i-1][2]`, then `dp[i]` will be updated to `max(dp[i], dp[i-1] + cakes[i][0])`.
   - Otherwise, `dp[i]` will remain unchanged.

5. **Final State:**
   - If the loop updates `dp[i]`, then the new value of `dp[i]` will be `max(dp[i], dp[i-1] + cakes[i][0])`.
   - If the loop does not update `dp[i]`, then `dp[i]` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

### Conclusion:

- The state at the start of the next iteration will be the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration if the loop does not update `dp[i]`.
- The state at the start of the next iteration will be `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i-1] + cakes[i][0])` if the loop updates `dp[i]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`dp[i]` is an integer. If `cakes[i][1]` is greater than `cakes[i-1][1]` and `cakes[i][2]` is greater than `cakes[i-1][2]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to `max(dp[i], dp[i-1] + cakes[i][0])`. Otherwise, the value of `dp[i]` remains unchanged.**
