Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cakes` is a list of tuples sorted in descending order by their volume, `dp` is a list of `n` elements where each element is the maximum value of `dp[j] + cakes[i][0]` for all `j < i` where `cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]`. If no such `j` exists, `dp[i]` is `cakes[i][0]`. The loop does not execute if `n` is 1, in which case `dp[1]` is `cakes[1][0]` and all other elements of `dp` remain 0.0.**
