`a` is reassigned the value of `int(input())`, which means it now holds the integer input from the user. The values of `n` and `b` remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer obtained from `int(input())`, `a` is an integer input from the user, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10,000,000.**
