`b` is reassigned the value of `int(input())`, which means the previous value of `b` is replaced by the new integer input. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it was set in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer obtained from `int(input())`, `a` is an integer input from the user, `b` is an integer obtained from `int(input())`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer obtained from `int(input())`, `a` is an integer input from the user, `b` is an integer obtained from `int(input())**
