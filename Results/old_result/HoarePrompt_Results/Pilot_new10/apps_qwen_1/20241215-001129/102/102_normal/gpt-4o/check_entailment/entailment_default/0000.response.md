Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem. It iterates over possible values of \( x \) (the number of Ber-Cola bottles) up to \( \frac{n}{a} \), and checks if the remaining amount \( n - x \cdot a \) is divisible by \( b \). If such \( x \) and \( y \) are found, it prints 'YES' followed by the values of \( x \) and \( y \). If no such \( x \) and \( y \) are found, it prints 'NO'. This approach ensures that the code covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement. The output hints confirm that the code correctly finds \( x \) and \( y \) if they exist and correctly identifies when they do not exist. Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case.
