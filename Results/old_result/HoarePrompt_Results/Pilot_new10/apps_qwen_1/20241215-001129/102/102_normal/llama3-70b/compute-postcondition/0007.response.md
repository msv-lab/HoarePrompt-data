The code prints the values of `x` and `y`. Since `x` is already defined as 0 and `y` is defined as `n // b`, these values are printed directly. After printing, the values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged. The states of `n` and `b` are not affected.

Output State: **`x` is 0, `y` is `n // b', `n` is an integer obtained from `int(input())`, `a` is an integer input from the user, and the output is 'YES'.**
