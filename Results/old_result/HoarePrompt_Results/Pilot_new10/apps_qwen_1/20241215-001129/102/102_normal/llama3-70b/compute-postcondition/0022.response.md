To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the loop step by step.

### Loop Analysis

1. **Loop Initialization**:
   - The loop runs for `x` in the range `range(n // a + 1)`. This means `x` takes values from `0` to `n // a`.
   - For each `x`, `y` is calculated as `y = (n - x * a) // b`.

2. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition `x * a + y * b == n` is checked.
   - If the condition is true, `print('YES')`, `print(x, y)`, and the loop exits using `exit()`.

3. **Post-loop State**:
   - If the loop completes without finding a pair `(x, y)` such that `x * a + y * b == n`, the loop will terminate without printing anything.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

- **Case 1: Loop Executes**:
  - If the loop finds a pair `(x, y)` such that `x * a + y * b == n`, it prints `YES` and the pair `(x, y)`, and exits.
  - At this point, the variables `x` and `y` will be the values that satisfy the condition `x * a + y * b == n`.

- **Case 2: Loop Does Not Execute**:
  - If no such pair is found, the loop will complete all its iterations without printing anything.
  - At this point, `x` will be `n // a` (the last value `x` takes in the loop), and `y` will be `(n - x * a) // b` (which simplifies to `0` because `x * a + y * b == n` is never satisfied).

### Final Output State

- **If the loop executes**:
  - `x` and `y` are the values that satisfy `x * a + y * b == n`.
  - `n` is the integer obtained from `int(input())`.
  - `a` is the integer input from the user.
  - `b` is the integer obtained from `int(input())`.

- **If the loop does not execute**:
  - `x` is `n // a`.
  - `y` is `0`.
  - `n`, `a`, and `b` retain their initial values.

### Conclusion

Given the above analysis, the final output state of the loop after all iterations have finished is:

Output State: **``x` is either the value that satisfies `x * a + y * b == n` or `n // a`, `y` is either the value that satisfies `x * a + y * b == n` or `0`, `n` is an integer obtained from `int(input())`, `a` is an integer input from the user, and `b` is an integer obtained from `int(input())**.
