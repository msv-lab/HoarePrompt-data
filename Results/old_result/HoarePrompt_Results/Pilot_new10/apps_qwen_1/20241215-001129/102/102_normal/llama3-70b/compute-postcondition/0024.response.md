The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to return a value based on some internal logic or inputs that are not provided within the function definition itself. However, given the constraints, it seems the function might internally use or process the integers `n`, `a`, and `b` within the specified range.

Since no specific output cases or return conditions are provided, the most accurate description would be:

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and returns a value based on internal processing of integers n, a, and b within the range 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10 000 000.**
