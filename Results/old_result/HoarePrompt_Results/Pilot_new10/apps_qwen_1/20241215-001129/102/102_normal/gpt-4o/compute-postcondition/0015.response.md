Postcondition: ***`a` is a positive integer, `n` is such that `n // a` is at least 1, and the expression `(n - (n // a + 1) * a) % b != 0` holds true. If `(n - x * a) % b == 0`, the program prints 'YES' and the values of `x` and `y`. Otherwise, the program does not change the values of `x` and `y` and does not print anything.***
