Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly checks if it's possible to buy some number of Ber-Cola bottles and Bars bars to spend exactly `n` burles. It iterates through possible values of `x` (number of Ber-Cola bottles) and calculates the corresponding `y` (number of Bars bars) using the formula `(n - x * a) // b`. If it finds a valid pair `(x, y)` such that `x * a + y * b == n`, it prints "YES" followed by the values of `x` and `y`, and exits. If no such pair is found after checking all possibilities, it prints "NO".

The program handles the constraints and examples given correctly. It exhaustively searches for a solution within the given limits and works for all provided test cases, ensuring it meets the requirements of the problem description.
