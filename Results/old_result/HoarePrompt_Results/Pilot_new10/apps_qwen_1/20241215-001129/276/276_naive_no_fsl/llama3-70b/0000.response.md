Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the conversion of a number from the golden system to its decimal equivalent using the formula \( \sum_{i = 0}^{n} a_{i} \cdot q^{n - i} \), where \( q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \). The program then compares the decimal values of the two input strings and prints the appropriate comparison symbol ('>', '<', or '=').

The function `func_1` iterates through the reversed string, converts each character to an integer, multiplies it by \( q \) raised to the power of its index, and accumulates the result. This correctly handles the golden system conversion.

Since the program follows the problem description accurately and works for all provided examples, it is correct. There are no apparent edge cases or inputs that would cause the program to fail based on the problem statement and the given examples.
