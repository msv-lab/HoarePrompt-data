Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the lengths of the two strings are different. According to the problem description, both inputs are non-empty strings of the same length consisting of '0's and '1's. However, the provided solution only checks the values after converting the strings to decimal and does not account for the possibility of the second string being longer due to leading zeros, which would result in a larger value.

For example, consider the input:
```
10
101
```

The first number `10` in golden system is equivalent to \(1 \cdot q^1 + 0 \cdot q^0 = q \approx 1.618\).
The second number `101` is equivalent to \(1 \cdot q^2 + 0 \cdot q^1 + 1 \cdot q^0 = q^2 + 1 \approx 2.618\).

Since the second number is larger, the output should be `<`. However, the current implementation will incorrectly compare the sums of the coefficients without considering the full representation of the number in the golden system.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that both numbers are represented in the same length by padding shorter numbers with leading zeros before comparison.
