#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters, representing a number in the golden system.
def func_1(s):
    q = (math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2
    decimal = 0
    for (i, c) in enumerate(reversed(s)):
        decimal += int(c) * q ** i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is an empty string, `q` is (math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2, `decimal` is the decimal representation of the binary string `s` when read in reverse order.
    return decimal
    #The program returns the decimal representation of the binary string 's' in reverse order, where 's' is an empty string and therefore its reverse is also an empty string, resulting in decimal 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting of '0' and '1' characters, computes the decimal representation of the reversed binary string, and returns this decimal value. If `s` is an empty string, it should theoretically return 0, but due to the loop iterating over an empty reversed string, the `decimal` remains 0, effectively handling the edge case.
