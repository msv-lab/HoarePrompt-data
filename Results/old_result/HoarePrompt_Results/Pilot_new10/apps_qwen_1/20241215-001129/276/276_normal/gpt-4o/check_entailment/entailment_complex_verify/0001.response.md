Final: **False**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the program does not handle the case where the lengths of the two strings are different. The function `func_1` only considers the positions of '1's in the string and sums up the corresponding powers of \(q\), but it does not account for the possibility of the second string being longer due to leading zeros. As per the problem description, both inputs are non-empty strings of the same length. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate because the program will produce incorrect results if the lengths of the strings are not equal, even though the input is assumed to be valid. The program needs to pad the shorter string with leading zeros before conversion to ensure correct comparison.
