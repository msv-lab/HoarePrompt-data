Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `s` is the reversed string without the last character.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `c` is the next character in the reversed string.
   - `decimal` is updated to `decimal + int(c) * q`.

2. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over the characters of the reversed string using `enumerate`.
   - For each iteration, `i` is the index of the current character `c` in the reversed string.

3. **Adjusting the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, the next character in the reversed string (`c`) will be the character at the next index.
   - To continue the loop, we need to ensure that there is at least one more character in the reversed string for `i` to increment to.

4. **Updating the States:**
   - `s` remains the reversed string without the last character from the previous iteration.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `c` becomes the next character in the reversed string, which means it is now the character at index `i` in the reversed string.
   - `decimal` is updated to include the contribution of the new character `c`.

Given these points, let's adjust the states:

- `s` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `c` is the next character in the reversed string, so it is now the character at index `i` in the reversed string.
- `decimal` is updated to include the contribution of the new character `c`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`s` is the reversed string without the last character, `i` is incremented by 1, `c` is the next character in the reversed string, `decimal` is updated to `decimal + int(c) * q`**.

However, for clarity and to explicitly show the change, we can reformat it as follows:

State: **`s` is the reversed string without the last character, `i` is incremented by 1, `c` is the character at index `i` in the reversed string, `decimal` is updated to `decimal + int(c) * q`**.
