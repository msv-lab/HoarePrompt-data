Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the golden system. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not account for the correct power of \(q\) as defined in the problem description. According to the problem description, the decimal value should be calculated as \(\sum_{i=0}^{n} a_{i} \cdot q^{n - i}\), but the code incorrectly uses \(q^{n - i - 1}\).

For example, consider the input "1000" and "111":
- The correct calculation for "1000" should be \(1 \cdot q^3 = q^3\).
- The correct calculation for "111" should be \(1 \cdot q^2 + 1 \cdot q^1 + 1 \cdot q^0 = q^2 + q + 1\).

Using the provided function, the calculations would be:
- For "1000": \(1 \cdot q^2 = q^2\).
- For "111": \(1 \cdot q^2 + 1 \cdot q^1 + 1 \cdot q^0 = q^2 + q + 1\).

Clearly, \(q^3\) is not equal to \(q^2 + q + 1\), so the code will produce incorrect results. Therefore, the program is not correct for every potential case.
