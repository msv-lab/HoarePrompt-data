The code initializes the variable `q` with the value `(math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2`. This value is known as the golden ratio. The string `s` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it. Therefore, the only change is the introduction of the new variable `q` with its specific value.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters, `q` is `(math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2`**
