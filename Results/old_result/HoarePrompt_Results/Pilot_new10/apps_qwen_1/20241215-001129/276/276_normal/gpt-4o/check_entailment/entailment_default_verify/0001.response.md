Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the program does not correctly handle cases where the lengths of the input strings differ. Specifically, the program converts each string to its decimal value based on the position of '1's and does not account for leading zeros that would affect the true value in the golden system. The provided output hints confirm that the function `func_1` correctly computes the value for a given string, but the main program logic fails to properly compare strings of different lengths. For example, the input "10" and "101" should yield "<", but the program will incorrectly compare their values without padding the shorter string with leading zeros.
