The function accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting of '0' and '1' characters, computes the decimal representation of the reversed binary string, and returns this decimal value. If `s` is an empty string, it should theoretically return 0, but due to the loop iterating over an empty reversed string, the `decimal` remains 0, effectively handling the edge case.
