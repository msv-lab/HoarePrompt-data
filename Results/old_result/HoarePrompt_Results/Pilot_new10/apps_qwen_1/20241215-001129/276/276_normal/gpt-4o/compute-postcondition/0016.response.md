Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting of '0' and '1' characters, representing a number in the golden system. It calculates and returns the sum of \(5^{(n - i - 1)}\) for all indices \(i\) where `s[i]` is '1', with `n` being the length of string `s`.** 

This summary covers the following points:
- The function accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting of '0' and '1' characters.
- It uses the golden ratio `q = (5 ** 0.5 + 1) / 2` in its calculation.
- It iterates over each character in the string `s`.
- For each '1' found, it adds \(5^{(n - i - 1)}\) to the value.
- The function returns the final calculated value, which is the sum of the series described above.
