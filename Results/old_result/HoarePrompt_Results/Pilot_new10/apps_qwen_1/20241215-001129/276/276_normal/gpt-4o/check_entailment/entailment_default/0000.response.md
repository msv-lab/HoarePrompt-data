Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the golden system as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` incorrectly calculates the decimal value of a number in the golden system. The function sums \( q^{n - i - 1} \) for all indices \( i \) where `s[i]` is '1', instead of \( q^{n - i} \).

The correct formula for the decimal value of a number in the golden system is \(\sum_{i = 0}^{n} a_{i} \cdot q^{n - i}\), where \(a_i\) is the digit at position \(i\). The provided code uses \(q^{n - i - 1}\), which leads to an incorrect calculation.

For example, consider the input:
```
1000
111
```
- The first number `1000` should be calculated as \( q^3 \).
- The second number `111` should be calculated as \( q^2 + q + 1 \).

Using the correct formula, the first number evaluates to approximately \( 4.236 \), and the second number evaluates to approximately \( 5.236 \). The provided code, however, will incorrectly evaluate both numbers, leading to incorrect results.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the golden system and does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
