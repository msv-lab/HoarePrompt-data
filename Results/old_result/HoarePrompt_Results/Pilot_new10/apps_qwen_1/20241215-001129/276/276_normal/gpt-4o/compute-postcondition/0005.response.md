`value` is assigned the value of `value + q ** (n - i - 1)`. Given that `q` is 5, the value of `value` is updated by adding `5 ** (n - i - 1)` to its current value. The other variables (`s`, `q`, `n`, `i`) are not affected.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters, `q` is 5, `value` is `value + 5 ** (n - i - 1)`, `n` is greater than 0, the current value of `i` satisfies `s[i] == '1'`**
