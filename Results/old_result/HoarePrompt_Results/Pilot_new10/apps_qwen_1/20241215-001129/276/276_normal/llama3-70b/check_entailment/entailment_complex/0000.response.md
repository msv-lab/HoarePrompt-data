Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic required to compare two numbers represented in the golden system (based on the golden ratio \( q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \)) and determine which has a larger decimal value. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two strings from standard input, each representing a number in the golden system. These strings consist of '0's and '1's and are processed accordingly.

2. **Conversion to Decimal**: The `func_1` function correctly converts a string in the golden system to its decimal equivalent. It iterates over the reversed string, multiplying each digit by \( q^i \) where \( i \) is the index starting from 0 for the least significant digit. This ensures the correct positional value is calculated based on the golden ratio.

3. **Comparison**: After converting both input strings to their decimal equivalents, the program compares these values. If the first decimal value is greater, it prints '>'. If the second is greater, it prints '<'. If they are equal, it prints '='. This logic precisely matches the requirement of determining which of the two numbers is larger in decimal form.

4. **Edge Case Handling**: Although the function does not explicitly handle the case where the input string is empty (which is not possible given the problem constraints since the strings are described as non-empty), the loop in `func_1` will not execute for an empty string, resulting in a decimal value of 0, which is handled implicitly through the comparison logic.

Since the program correctly follows the steps outlined in the problem description and handles all cases as specified, the program is correct.
