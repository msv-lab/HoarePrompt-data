Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the golden system conversion as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the issue lies in the calculation of the value within the `func_1` function.

According to the problem description, the decimal value of a number in the golden system should be calculated using \( q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \) and the formula:
\[ \text{value} = \sum_{i=0}^{n} a_i \cdot q^{n - i} \]

However, in the given program, the function `func_1` incorrectly uses \( 5^{(n - i - 1)} \) instead of \( q^{n - i} \). The constant \( q \) is defined as:
\[ q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \]

This means the correct implementation should use \( q \) in the exponentiation, not 5. Therefore, the line:
```python
value += q ** (n - i - 1)
```
should be corrected to:
```python
value += q ** (n - i)
```

Additionally, the state descriptions after the for loop are misleading because they refer to \( q \) as 5, which is incorrect. \( q \) should be the golden ratio \( \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \).

To fix the program, the `func_1` function should be updated as follows:
```python
def func_1(s):
    q = (5 ** 0.5 + 1) / 2
    value = 0
    n = len(s)
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '1':
            value += q ** (n - i - 1)
    
    return value
```

With this correction, the program will correctly convert a number from the golden system to its decimal value, and thus fulfill the requirements of the problem description.
