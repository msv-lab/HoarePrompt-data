Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to handle the problem correctly based on the given constraints and problem description. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how the code addresses the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of cells `n` and the sequence of integers `a` from the input.

2. **Matrix Constraints Check**: The program checks if the maximum value in the sequence `a` exceeds the product of potential dimensions `x` and `y`. If it does, it breaks out of the loop, ensuring that the dimensions are within the valid range.

3. **Feasibility Check**: The `func_1` function verifies if each move between consecutive cells in the sequence `a` is valid according to the defined movement rules (up, down, left, right). It calculates the positions `(nx, ny)` and `(px, py)` corresponding to the current and previous cells, respectively, and checks if the Manhattan distance between them is exactly 1.

4. **Output Generation**: If a valid pair `(x, y)` is found, the program prints "YES" followed by the dimensions `x` and `y`. If no valid dimensions are found after checking all possibilities, it prints "NO".

Given the complexity of the problem and the comprehensive approach taken by the program, it seems to cover all necessary aspects without missing any logical steps or edge cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
