The code `nx, ny = (v - 1) // y, (v - 1) % y` updates the values of `nx` and `ny` based on the formula provided. The initial state is given as follows:

- `v` is the next value from the list `a`
- `nx` is \((v - 1) // y\)
- `ny` is \((v - 1) \% y\)
- `px` is `nx`
- `py` is `ny`

After running the code, the values of `nx` and `ny` are updated as per the formula, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`v` is the next value from the list `a`; `nx` is \((v - 1) // y\); `ny` is \((v - 1) \% y\); `px` is \((v - 1) // y\); `py` is \((v - 1) \% y\)**
