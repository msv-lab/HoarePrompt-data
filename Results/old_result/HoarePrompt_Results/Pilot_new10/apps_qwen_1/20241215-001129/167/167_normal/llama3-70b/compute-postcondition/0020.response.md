Let's analyze the provided annotated code and return postconditions step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `x` and `y` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\).
   - `a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq n\).

2. **Function Execution**:
   - Two variables `px` and `py` are initialized to 0.
   - A loop iterates over each element `v` in the list `a`.
     - For each `v`, compute `nx` and `ny` as follows:
       - `nx, ny = (v - 1) // y, (v - 1) % y`
       - This computes the coordinates of the cell corresponding to the integer `v` in a grid of size `x` by `y`.

3. **Condition Check**:
   - Inside the loop, check if the Manhattan distance between the current cell `(px, py)` and the new cell `(nx, ny)` is exactly 1.
     - `if abs(nx - px) + abs(ny - py) != 1:`

4. **Return Statement**:
   - If the condition is not met (i.e., the Manhattan distance is not 1), return `False`.
   - If the loop completes without returning `False`, return `True`.

5. **Post-Loop State**:
   - The final state of the program after the loop is executed depends on whether the condition was met for all elements in `a`.

### Return Postconditions:
- The function returns `False` if at any point the Manhattan distance between consecutive cells is not 1.
- The function returns `True` if the Manhattan distance between consecutive cells is always 1 throughout the entire loop.

### Potential Edge Cases and Missing Logic:
- The function assumes that the list `a` is valid and contains integers within the specified range.
- There are no explicit checks for invalid inputs like non-integer values, or values outside the specified range.

### Summary of Functionality:
The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `x` and `y` and a list of integers `a`. It checks whether the sequence of cells represented by the integers in `a` can form a valid path on a grid of size `x` by `y` where each step moves to an adjacent cell (up, down, left, right). If at any point the movement is not valid (i.e., not a direct move to an adjacent cell), the function returns `False`. If all steps are valid, the function returns `True`.

### Final Answer:
Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `x` and `y`, and a list of integers `a`. It returns `True` if the sequence of cells represented by the integers in `a` forms a valid path on a grid of size `x` by `y` where each step moves to an adjacent cell. If any step is invalid, it returns `False`.**
