Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has a logical flaw in how it determines whether a path is valid using the `func_1` function. Specifically, the condition `abs(nx - px) + abs(ny - py) != 1` is incorrect for determining if a move is valid. According to the problem description, a valid move should either increase or decrease the row index by 1 (while staying within bounds) or increase or decrease the column index by 1 (while staying within bounds). The current condition checks if the Manhattan distance between the current and previous positions is not equal to 1, which does not correctly capture the constraints of moving to an adjacent cell.

To fix this, the condition should check if the row or column changes by exactly 1 and ensures the move is within bounds. Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(x, y):
    (px, py) = (0, 0)
    for v in a:
        (nx, ny) = ((v - 1) // y, (v - 1) % y)
        if not (1 <= nx <= x and 1 <= ny <= y and (abs(nx - px) == 1 or abs(ny - py) == 1)):
            return False
        (px, py) = (nx, ny)
    return True
```

With this correction, the program should correctly determine whether a given sequence of moves is valid on a grid of size \(x \times y\).
