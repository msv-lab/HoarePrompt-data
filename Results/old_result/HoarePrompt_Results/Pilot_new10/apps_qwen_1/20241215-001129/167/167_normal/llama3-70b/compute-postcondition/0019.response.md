The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`. Both `x` and `y` are positive integers such that 1 <= x, y <= 10^9. The function also takes a list of integers `numbers` where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for all 1 <= i <= n, representing the sequence of integers in the cells visited on the path.

Based on the provided cases, the function does not actually use the list `numbers` in its return conditions, and the return values are consistently `False` except for one case which returns `True`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two parameters `x` and `y`, and return `True` in one specific condition and `False` in all other conditions.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, and returns `True` in one specific condition and `False` in all other conditions.**
