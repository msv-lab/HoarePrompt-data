Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the mex value of the array. Specifically, the program sorts the array and then iterates through it, incrementing `mex` whenever `num` is greater than or equal to `mex`. However, this approach does not account for the fact that Alyona can decrease any element to any positive integer less than or equal to its original value. 

For example, consider the input:
```
3
2 1 1
```

According to the problem description, Alyona can decrease the first element from 2 to 1, making the array `[1, 1, 1]`. The mex of this array is 2. However, the program would sort the array to `[1, 1, 2]` and then determine the mex as 3, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and is hence incorrect.
