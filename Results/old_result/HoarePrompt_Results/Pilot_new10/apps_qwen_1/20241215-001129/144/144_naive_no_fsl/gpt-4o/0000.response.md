Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the maximum value in the array is less than the current `mex` value. Specifically, if the array contains values that are all greater than 1, the program will always output 1 as the maximum possible value of `mex`, which is incorrect.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
2 2 2
```

The correct output should be 3, because Alyona can decrease each element to 1, resulting in the array [1, 1, 1], and the mex of this array is 3. However, the provided program will output 2 because it increments `mex` only when the current element is greater than or equal to `mex`, and it stops at 2 since the next element is also 2.

To fix this, the program should continue incrementing `mex` until it finds an index where `num < mex`. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    mex = 1
    for num in a:
        if num >= mex:
            mex += 1
    print(mex)

func()
```

This version ensures that `mex` is incremented correctly even if the array values are all greater than 1.
