Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem described. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer \( n \) and an array of \( n \) integers from standard input, which matches the problem description.

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The program sorts the array `arr`. While sorting is not explicitly required by the problem statement, it simplifies finding the mex value. Sorting helps in efficiently checking the presence of each positive integer in the array.

3. **Finding the Mex Value:**
   - The program initializes `mex` to 1, which is the smallest possible positive integer.
   - It iterates over the sorted array and checks if the current number is equal to `mex` or greater than `mex`. If it is equal, it increments `mex` by 1. If it is greater, the loop breaks because all numbers up to `mex` must already be present in the array.
   - This approach ensures that the smallest missing positive integer is found, which aligns with the definition of mex.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the value of `mex`, which is the result as per the problem description.

Given these points, the program correctly determines the maximum possible value of mex for the given array, meeting the requirements of the problem description in all cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
