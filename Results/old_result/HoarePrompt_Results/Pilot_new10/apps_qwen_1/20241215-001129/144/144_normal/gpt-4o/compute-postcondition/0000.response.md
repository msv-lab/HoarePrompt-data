`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which means it will take an integer input from the user within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000. The value of `a` remains unchanged as no operation is performed on it in this snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9.**
