The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it reads input from standard input, where the first line contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) representing the number of elements in the array, and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of the array. Based on this input, the function processes the array and returns a result.

Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` and an array of `n` integers from standard input, processes the array, and returns a result based on the input array.**
