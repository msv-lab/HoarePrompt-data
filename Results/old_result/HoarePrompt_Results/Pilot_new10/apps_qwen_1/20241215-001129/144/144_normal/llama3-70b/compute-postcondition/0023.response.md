The code prints the value of `mex`, which is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `arr`. However, the code itself does not change the value of `mex` or any other variable. It simply outputs the value of `mex`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with `arr` being a non-empty sorted list of integers, `n` being an integer input from standard input, and `mex` being the smallest non-negative integer not present in `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `n` is an integer input from standard input, and `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `arr`.**
