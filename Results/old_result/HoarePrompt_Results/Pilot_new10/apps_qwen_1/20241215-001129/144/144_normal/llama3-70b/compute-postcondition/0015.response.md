Postcondition: ***`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `n` is an integer input from standard input, `mex` is 2, and `num` is the next element in the list `arr`. If `num` is greater than 2, the condition holds true as it remains unchanged. Otherwise, `num` is not affected since there is no else part provided.***
