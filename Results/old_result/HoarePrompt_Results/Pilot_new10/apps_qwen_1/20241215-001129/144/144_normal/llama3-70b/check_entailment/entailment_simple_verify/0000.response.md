Final: **False**

Reason: Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment was accurate. The program does not correctly compute the maximum possible value of mex for the given array, especially in cases where the array has duplicate values. The annotated version clearly shows that the program increments `mex` only when `num` equals `mex`, but it should also consider cases where `num` is greater than `mex`. The provided explanation and examples in the original assessment correctly highlight this issue. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
