According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num` and its position within the list `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `n` is an integer input from standard input, and `mex` is 2. If `num` (the next element in `arr`) equals 3, then `mex` is set to 3. Otherwise, `mex` remains 2.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `mex` is 2.
- `num` is the next element in `arr`.

For the loop to continue executing, `num` must be the next element in `arr`. If `num` is 3, `mex` would change to 3, but since we need to determine the state for the loop to continue, we assume `num` is not 3 (otherwise, `mex` would already be 3).

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `mex` remains 2.
- `num` becomes the next element in `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `n` is an integer input from standard input, `mex` is 2, and `num` is the next element in `arr`.**
