#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no input parameters. However, the input is provided through standard input, where the first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) representing the number of elements in the array, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of the array.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    arr.sort()
    mex = 1
    for num in arr:
        if num == mex:
            mex += 1
        elif num > mex:
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `n` is an integer input from standard input, and `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `arr`.
    print(mex)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` and an array of `n` integers from standard input. It then sorts the array and finds the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array, which is printed as the output. Potential edge cases include an empty array or an array containing only the smallest non-negative integer.
