The code updates `dp[i]` to be the minimum of its original value and `c[i]` for `i` being `i_prev + 1`. This means that `dp[i]` will now hold the smaller value between its current value and `c[i_prev + 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp[i]` is updated to be the minimum of its original value and `c[i_prev + 1]`, `c[i]` remains unchanged**
