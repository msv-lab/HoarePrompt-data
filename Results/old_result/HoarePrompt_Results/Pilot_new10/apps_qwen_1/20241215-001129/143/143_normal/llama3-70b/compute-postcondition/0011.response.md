The code assigns `2 ** j - 1` to the variable `vol`. Given that `j` is 1 (from the initial state), `vol` is calculated as `2 ** 1 - 1`, which equals 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `L` is a positive integer, `n` is at least 1, `vol` is 1, and `dp[1]` remains unchanged, `j` is 1, and `j` must be less than `n`.**
