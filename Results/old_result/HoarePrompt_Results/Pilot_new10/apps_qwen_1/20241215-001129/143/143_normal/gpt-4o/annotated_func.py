#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, L is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9, and costs is a list of n positive integers where each element represents the cost of a bottle of lemonade of a specific type, with 1 ≤ costs[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n.
def func_1(n, L, costs):
    max_cost = 10 ** 18
    dp = [max_cost] * 31
    c = costs + [max_cost] * (31 - len(costs))
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], c[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `dp[i]` is the minimum value between the original value of `dp[i]` and `c[i]` for all `0 ≤ i < n`, `c[i]` remains unchanged for all `0 ≤ i < n`.
    for i in range(1, 31):
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] * 2)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is 30, `c[i]` remains unchanged for all \(0 \leq i < n\), and for each \(1 \leq i \leq 30\), `dp[i]` is the minimum value between the original value of `dp[i]` and `dp[i - 1] * 2`.
    answer = max_cost
    current_cost = 0
    for i in range(30, -1, -1):
        if L >= 1 << i:
            current_cost += dp[i]
            L -= 1 << i
        
        answer = min(answer, current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is 0, `current_cost` is the sum of `dp[j]` for all `j` such that `1 << j` is a power of 2 within the range of `L`, `answer` is the minimum value between `current_cost` and `dp[0]` if `L > 0`, otherwise `answer` remains `max_cost`, `L` is 0.
    return answer
    #The program returns `answer` which is the minimum value between `current_cost` and `dp[0]` since `L` is 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts parameters `n`, `L`, and `costs`, where `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 30), `L` is a positive integer (1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9), and `costs` is a list of `n` positive integers representing the cost of each type of lemonade (1 ≤ costs[i] ≤ 10^9). The function calculates a dynamic programming table `dp` to find the minimum cost to buy enough lemonades to satisfy the requirement of `L` units of lemonade, considering that each unit can be bought from the most expensive type of lemonade down to the least expensive. The final result is the minimum value between the current total cost `current_cost` and the cost of buying one more unit of the most expensive type of lemonade (`dp[0]`), given that `L` is now 0.
