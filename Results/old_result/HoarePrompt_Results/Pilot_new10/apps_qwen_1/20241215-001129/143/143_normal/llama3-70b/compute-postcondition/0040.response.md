Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is 2
- `vol` is 2
- If `vol` is less than or equal to `i`, `dp[2]` is updated to the minimum of `dp[2]` and `dp[0] + costs[j]`.
- Since there is no else part, the values of `i` and `vol` remain unchanged.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop variable `j` ranges from `0` to `n-1`.
- The loop body does not change the values of `i` or `vol`.
- The condition for updating `dp[2]` (i.e., `vol <= i`) remains the same as long as `i` and `vol` do not change.

Since the loop body does not modify `i` or `vol`, these values will remain the same for each iteration of the loop.

### Next Iteration:
- The loop will execute again if `j` is within the range `0` to `n-1`.
- Therefore, we need to ensure that `j` is incremented to the next value.

### Updated State:
- `i` remains `2`.
- `vol` remains `2`.
- `j` is incremented to `3`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 2, `vol` is 2, `j` is 3**
