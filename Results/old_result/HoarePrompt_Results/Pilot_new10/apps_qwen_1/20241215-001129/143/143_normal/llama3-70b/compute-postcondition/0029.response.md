Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- \( i \) is \( L + 1 \)
- \( L \) is a positive integer
- \( n \) must be greater than 0
- \( dp[i] \) is updated to the minimum of its current value and \( dp[i - 2] + costs[j] \), where \( j \) is \( j_end + 1 \)
- \( vol \) is \( 2 \)

### For Loop Analysis:
The for loop iterates over \( j \) from 0 to \( n-1 \). The key points to consider are:
- The loop will continue as long as \( j < n \).
- Since \( vol \) is always 2 (and it is independent of the loop variable \( j \)), the condition `vol <= i` is always true given the precondition \( i = L + 1 \).

### State Adjustments:
- The value of \( i \) remains \( L + 1 \) because the loop does not change the value of \( i \).
- The value of \( n \) remains the same because the loop does not change the value of \( n \).
- The value of \( dp[i] \) might change due to the update rule in the loop body, but we don't know the exact new value without the loop body.
- The value of \( j \) will be incremented by 1 with each iteration, starting from 0.

### Starting State for the Next Iteration:
- After the first iteration of the loop, \( j \) will be 0.
- Therefore, for the next iteration, \( j \) will be 1.

### Updated States:
- \( i \) remains \( L + 1 \).
- \( n \) remains the same.
- \( dp[i] \) will be updated to the minimum of its current value and \( dp[i - 2] + costs[j] \), where \( j \) is now \( j_end + 1 \).
- \( j \) will be 1.
- \( vol \) remains 2.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is `L + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `dp[i]` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `dp[i - 2] + costs[j]` where `j` is `j_end + 1`, `vol` is `2`, `j` is `1`**
