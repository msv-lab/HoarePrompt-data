`current_cost` is incremented by `dp[i]`. The value of `i` remains 29, and the conditions regarding `L` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 29; `current_cost` is `current_cost + dp[29]`; `answer` is the same as before; `L` must be such that it could potentially be reduced by \(2^{29}\) if the condition \(L \geq 2^{29}\) holds true.
