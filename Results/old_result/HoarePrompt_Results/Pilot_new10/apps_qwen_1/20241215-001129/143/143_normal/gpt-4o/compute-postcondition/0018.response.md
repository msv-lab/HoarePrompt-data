The code initializes `current_cost` to 0. This assignment does not affect the values of `i`, `c`, `dp`, or `answer`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 30, `c[i]` remains unchanged for all \(0 \leq i < n\), `dp[i]` for each \(1 \leq i \leq 30\) is the minimum value between the original value of `dp[i]` and `dp[i - 1] * 2\), `answer` is equal to `max_cost`, `current_cost` is 0.**
