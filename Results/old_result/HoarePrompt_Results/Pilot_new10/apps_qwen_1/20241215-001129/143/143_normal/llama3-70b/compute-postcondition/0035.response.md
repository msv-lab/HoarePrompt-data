According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `i` is 2 and `vol` must be less than 2. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`i` is 2, `vol` must be less than 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
