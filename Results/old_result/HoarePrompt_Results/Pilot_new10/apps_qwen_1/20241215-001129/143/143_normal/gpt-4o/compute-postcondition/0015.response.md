Output State: **`dp[1]` remains the same, `dp[2]` is min(`original_dp_2_value`, `dp[1]` * 2)**

Explanation:
- The given line of code `dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] * 2)` updates the value of `dp[i]` based on the previous value of `dp[i - 1]`.
- Initially, `dp[1]` remains the same because no update is applied to `dp[1]` directly in this line of code.
- For `dp[2]`, the value is updated to be the minimum of its original value and twice the value of `dp[1]`. This is represented as `min(original_dp_2_value, dp[1] * 2)`.
- The other values of `dp[i]` remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
