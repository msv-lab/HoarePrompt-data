Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 30.
   - `current_cost` is updated by adding `dp[30]` to it.
   - If `L >= 2^{30}`, then `L` is reduced by `2^{30}`.
   - `answer` is updated to `min(answer, current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[30])`.

2. **Loop Range:**
   - The loop iterates from `30` down to `-1` in steps of `-1`.

3. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be decreased by 1 from its current value.
   - Since `i` was 30 in the previous iteration, it will now be 29.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - `i` will be set to 29.
   - The `current_cost` and `answer` states will remain as they were because they are not directly modified by the loop itself but rather by the loop body.
   - `L` may or may not be adjusted based on the condition in the loop body. However, since we don't know the exact state of `L` from the previous iteration, we cannot predict the exact new value of `L`. But we know that if `L >= 2^{29}`, `L` would be reduced by `2^{29}`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - We need to update `i` to 29.
   - We need to ensure that `L` is in a state where it could potentially be reduced by `2^{29}` if the condition holds true.
   - `current_cost` and `answer` will retain their values from the previous iteration.

Given this, the adjusted states for the next iteration are:
- `i` is 29.
- `current_cost` is the same as before.
- `answer` is the same as before.
- `L` must be such that it could potentially be reduced by `2^{29}` if the condition `L >= 2^{29}` holds true.

So, the final state is:

**State: **`i` is 29, `current_cost` is the same as before, `answer` is the same as before, `L` must be such that it could potentially be reduced by `2^{29}` if the condition `L >= 2^{29}` holds true**.
