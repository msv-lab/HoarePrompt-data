The code `max_sum = digit_sum` assigns the value of `digit_sum` to `max_sum`. This means that `max_sum` now holds the same value as `digit_sum`, which is the sum of the digits of `i + 1`. The values of `i` and `max_num` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`; `digit_sum` is the sum of the digits of `i + 1`; `max_sum` is equal to `digit_sum`; `max_num` must be equal to the corresponding number found so far**
