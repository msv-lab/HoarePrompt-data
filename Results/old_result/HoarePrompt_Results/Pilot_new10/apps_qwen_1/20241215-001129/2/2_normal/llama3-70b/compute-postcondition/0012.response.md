The code assigns the value of `i` to `max_num`. Before the assignment, `max_num` was equal to the value of `max_sum`, which itself was equal to the `digit_sum` of `i + 1`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, but now `max_num` is updated to be the current value of `i`.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`; `digit_sum` is the sum of the digits of `i + 1`; `max_sum` is equal to `digit_sum`; `max_num` is `i`.**
