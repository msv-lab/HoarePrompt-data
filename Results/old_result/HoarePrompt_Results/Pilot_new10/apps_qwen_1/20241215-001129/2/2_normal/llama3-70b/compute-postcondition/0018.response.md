Postcondition: ***`i` is `prev_i + 2`, `digit_sum` is the sum of the digits of `prev_i + 2`, `max_sum` and `max_num` remain unchanged. If `digit_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `digit_sum` and `max_num` is updated to `prev_i + 2`. Otherwise, `max_sum` and `max_num` remain unchanged.***
