To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop continues to execute. The loop will continue as long as `i` is within the range from 1 to `x + 1`.

Given the conditions:
- `i` is incremented by 1 (`i = i + 1`) at the end of each iteration.
- `digit_sum` is calculated as the sum of the digits of `i + 1`.
- If `digit_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `digit_sum` and `max_num` is updated to `i`.
- Otherwise, `max_sum` and `max_num` remain unchanged.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Identify the current state at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - `i` is some value (let's call it `prev_i`).
   - `digit_sum` is the sum of the digits of `prev_i + 1`.
   - `max_sum` and `max_num` are either updated or remain unchanged based on the comparison between `digit_sum` and `max_sum`.

2. **Determine the new value of `i` at the start of the next iteration:**
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` will be `prev_i + 1`.

3. **Determine the new value of `digit_sum`:**
   - `digit_sum` is the sum of the digits of `(prev_i + 1) + 1`, which is `prev_i + 2`.

4. **Determine the new values of `max_sum` and `max_num`:**
   - These values depend on the comparison between `digit_sum` of `prev_i + 2` and the current `max_sum`.
   - If `digit_sum` of `prev_i + 2` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `digit_sum` of `prev_i + 2` and `max_num` is updated to `prev_i + 1`.
   - Otherwise, `max_sum` and `max_num` remain unchanged.

Since the exact values of `max_sum` and `max_num` are not specified in the problem, we will leave them as they are unless explicitly updated.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
- `i` is `prev_i + 1`.
- `digit_sum` is the sum of the digits of `prev_i + 2`.
- `max_sum` and `max_num` remain unchanged unless they were updated in the previous iteration.

State: **`i` is `prev_i + 1`, `digit_sum` is the sum of the digits of `prev_i + 2`, `max_sum` and `max_num` remain unchanged.**
