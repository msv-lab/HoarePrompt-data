Output State: **`x` is the final integer value within the range of 1 to \(10^{18}\); `max_sum` is the maximum digit sum encountered during the loop; `max_num` is the number corresponding to the maximum digit sum.** 

Explanation:
- The loop iterates through all integers from 1 to \(x\).
- For each integer `i`, the digit sum is calculated and compared to the current `max_sum`.
- If the digit sum of `i` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to this new digit sum, and `max_num` is updated to `i`.
- After all iterations, the loop terminates, and `max_sum` and `max_num` will hold the highest digit sum and the corresponding number, respectively, among all integers from 1 to \(x\).

In the case where the loop does not execute (i.e., `x` is 1), the values of `max_sum` and `max_num` will both be 1 since the digit sum of 1 is 1.
