`i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `prev_i + 2`. The `digit_sum` is recalculated as the sum of the digits of `i`, which is now `prev_i + 2`. The previous `digit_sum` was the sum of the digits of `prev_i + 1`. Since `max_sum` and `max_num` remain unchanged, their values stay the same.

Output State: **`i` is `prev_i + 2`, `digit_sum` is the sum of the digits of `prev_i + 2`, `max_sum` and `max_num` remain unchanged**
