Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the `func_2` function calculates the `f_max_n` value incorrectly. This function computes the GCD of the sequence from 1 to n, but it does not consider the definition of `f_max_n` which is the maximum number of distinct GCD values among all permutations of length n.

For example, for `n=4`, the correct `f_max_n` should be 3, because the permutation `[1, 2, 3, 4]` results in distinct GCD values `[1, 2, 3, 1]`, and no other permutation will produce more distinct GCD values. However, the current implementation of `func_2` does not guarantee this behavior.

Additionally, the `func_3` function assumes that `dp[j]` represents the number of ways to achieve `j` distinct GCD values, but it does not correctly handle the permutation logic to ensure that the GCD values are distinct for each prefix.

These issues make the program incorrect as it does not meet the requirements for calculating the number of permutations that achieve the maximum possible number of distinct GCD values.
