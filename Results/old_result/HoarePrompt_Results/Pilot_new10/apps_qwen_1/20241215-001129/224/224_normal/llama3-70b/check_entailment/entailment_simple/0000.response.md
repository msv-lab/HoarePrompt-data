Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the given problem. Here's a detailed explanation of why the program is correct:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. It correctly computes the GCD of `a` and `b` and returns it. This part is straightforward and works as expected.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function determines the maximum value of \( f(p) \) for permutations of length \( n \). It iterates through all integers from 1 to \( n \) and updates the result (`res`) by taking the maximum GCD value between the current `res` and each integer `i`. This correctly computes the maximum possible value of \( f(p) \).

3. **Function `func_3`**: This function counts the number of permutations \( p \) of length \( n \) such that \( f(p) \) is equal to \( f_{max}(n) \). It uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of valid permutations. Specifically, it initializes a DP array `dp` where `dp[j]` represents the number of ways to achieve a GCD value of `j` with a prefix of length up to `i`. The logic ensures that for each prefix length, the number of valid permutations is incremented appropriately, and the result is taken modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

### Key Points:
- **Permutations and GCD Calculation**: The program correctly handles the computation of GCD values for prefixes of permutations.
- **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The use of DP ensures that the program efficiently counts the number of permutations meeting the criteria.
- **Modulo Operation**: The program ensures that the result is within the specified bounds by taking the result modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

Since the program accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement and correctly handles all necessary computations, it is correct.
