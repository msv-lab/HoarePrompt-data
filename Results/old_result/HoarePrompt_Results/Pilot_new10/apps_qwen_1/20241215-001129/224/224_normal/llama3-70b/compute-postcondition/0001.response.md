The code initializes a list `dp` with zeros, where the length of the list is `f_max_n + 1`. Since `f_max_n` is an integer representing the maximum value of `f(p)` for permutations of length `n`, and `n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6`, the value of `f_max_n` can vary depending on `n`. However, the exact value of `f_max_n` is not specified, so we cannot determine the exact length of the `dp` list. 

Other variables like `n` and `MOD` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, `f_max_n` is an integer representing the maximum value of `f(p)` for permutations of length `n`, `MOD` is 10, `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1` initialized to 0.**
