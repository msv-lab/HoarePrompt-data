Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem. The function `func_1` computes the factorial of `n-1` modulo \(10^9 + 7\), which is not related to the definition of \(f(p)\) or the calculation of permutations where \(f(p) = f_{max}(n)\).

According to the problem description, \(f_{max}(n)\) is the maximum number of distinct GCDs of prefixes in any permutation of \(1, 2, \ldots, n\). For \(n = 6\), for example, the correct value of \(f_{max}(6)\) is 3, not 2 as computed by the provided code. The correct number of permutations where \(f(p) = f_{max}(6)\) is 120, but the code outputs 120 for \(n = 6\) only because it computes the factorial, which is unrelated to the actual problem.

To correctly solve this problem, one needs to understand the structure of permutations that achieve \(f_{max}(n)\) and compute the count of such permutations modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The provided code does not address this requirement.
