The code snippet `dp[j] += dp[j - 1]` updates the value of `dp[j]` by adding `dp[j - 1]` to it. Given the initial state, `j` is equal to `f_max_n`. The value of `dp[j]` (which is `dp[f_max_n]`) is updated by adding `dp[f_max_n - 1]` to it. All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, `f_max_n` is an integer representing the maximum value of f(p) for permutations of length n, `MOD` is 10, `dp` is a list of length f_max_n + 1 initialized to 0, `dp[0] = 1, `j` is f_max_n, `dp[f_max_n]` is updated to `dp[f_max_n] + dp[f_max_n - 1]`**
