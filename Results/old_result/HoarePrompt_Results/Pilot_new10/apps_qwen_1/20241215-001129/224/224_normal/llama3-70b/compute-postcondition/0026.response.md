Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop:**
   - The loop variable is `j`.
   - The loop runs from `f_max_n` to `1` in reverse order.

2. **Initial Values:**
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\).
   - `f_max_n` is a positive integer.
   - `MOD` is 10.
   - `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[0] = 1` and for every `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j] = (2 * dp[j - 1] + dp[j - 2] + ... + dp[0]) % 10`.
   - `i` is `n + 2`.
   - `j` is initially 1.

3. **Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
   - For the loop to execute, `j` must take values from `f_max_n` down to `1`.
   - Since `j` is initially 1, we need to ensure that `f_max_n` is greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to start executing.

4. **State Adjustments Needed:**
   - Ensure `f_max_n` is at least 1.
   - Ensure `j` is set to its initial value of 1.

Given these points, we need to adjust the following states:

- `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `j` should be set to 1.

So, the modified state before the loop execution is:

State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\), `f_max_n` is a positive integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `MOD` is 10, `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[0] = 1` and for every `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j] = (2 * dp[j - 1] + dp[j - 2] + ... + dp[0]) % 10`, `i` is `n + 2`, `j` is 1**
