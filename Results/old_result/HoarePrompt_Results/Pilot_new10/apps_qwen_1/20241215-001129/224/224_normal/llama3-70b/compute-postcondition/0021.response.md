To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, let's go through the given information and the for loop statement step by step.

### Given Information:
- \( n \) is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^6 \).
- \( f_{\text{max}_n} \) is a positive integer.
- \( \text{MOD} = 10 \).
- \( \text{dp} \) is a list of length \( f_{\text{max}_n} + 1 \) where \( \text{dp}[0] = 1 \) and for every \( j \) from 1 to \( f_{\text{max}_n} \), \( \text{dp}[j] = (2 \times \text{dp}[j - 1] + \text{dp}[j - 2] + \ldots + \text{dp}[0]) \% 10 \).
- \( i = n + 1 \).
- \( j = f_{\text{max}_n} - 1 \).
- \( \text{dp}[j] \) is updated to \( (\text{dp}[j] + \text{dp}[j - 1]) \% 10 \).

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(f_max_n, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Values at the Start of the Loop:**
   - \( j = f_{\text{max}_n} - 1 \).

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates from \( f_{\text{max}_n} \) down to 1.
   - At each iteration, \( j \) is decremented by 1.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - \( j \) is currently \( f_{\text{max}_n} - 1 \).
   - \( \text{dp}[j] \) has been updated to \( (\text{dp}[j] + \text{dp}[j - 1]) \% 10 \).

4. **Next Iteration Requirements:**
   - For the loop to continue, \( j \) must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - Since \( j \) starts at \( f_{\text{max}_n} - 1 \) and is decremented by 1 each time, the next value of \( j \) will be \( f_{\text{max}_n} - 2 \).

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - \( j \) should be set to \( f_{\text{max}_n} - 2 \).
   - \( \text{dp}[j] \) (which is now \( f_{\text{max}_n} - 2 \)) needs to be updated similarly as per the loop body logic, but we don't need to specify its exact value since it will be computed within the loop.

### Final State:
State: **\( n \) is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^6 \); \( f_{\text{max}_n} \) is a positive integer; \( \text{MOD} = 10 \); \( \text{dp} \) is a list of length \( f_{\text{max}_n} + 1 \) where \( \text{dp}[0] = 1 \) and for every \( j \) from 1 to \( f_{\text{max}_n} \), \( \text{dp}[j] = (2 \times \text{dp}[j - 1] + \text{dp}[j - 2] + \ldots + \text{dp}[0]) \% 10 \); \( i = n + 1 \); \( j = f_{\text{max}_n} - 2 \); \( \text{dp}[j] \) is updated to \( (\text{dp}[j] + \text{dp}[j - 1]) \% 10 \)**
