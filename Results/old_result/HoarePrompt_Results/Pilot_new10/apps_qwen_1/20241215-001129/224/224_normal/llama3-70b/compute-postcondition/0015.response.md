Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\).
- `f_max_n` is an integer representing the maximum value of \(f(p)\) for permutations of length `n`.
- `MOD` is 10.
- `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1` where:
  - `dp[0] = 1`
  - For every `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j] = (dp[j - 1] + dp[j - 2] + ... + dp[0]) % 10`.
- `i` is `n + 1`.

### Loop Statement:
```
for j in range(f_max_n, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `j`:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` in reverse order from `f_max_n` to 1.
   - Therefore, the initial value of `j` must be `f_max_n`.

2. **Variable `i`:**
   - According to the given information, `i` is `n + 1`.
   - This does not affect the loop condition since the loop variable `j` is not related to `i`.

3. **Variable `f_max_n`:**
   - The loop depends on `f_max_n` as the upper limit.
   - Thus, `f_max_n` must be defined and valid for the loop to execute.

4. **List `dp`:**
   - The `dp` list must be properly initialized and populated as described.
   - Specifically, `dp[0]` should be 1, and for every `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` should follow the given recurrence relation.

5. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition is `range(f_max_n, 0, -1)`, which means `j` will start from `f_max_n` and go down to 1.
   - Hence, `f_max_n` must be a positive integer.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states to reflect the necessary conditions for the loop to iterate correctly.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\), `f_max_n` is a positive integer, `MOD` is 10, `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[0] = 1` and for every `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j] = (dp[j - 1] + dp[j - 2] + ... + dp[0]) % 10`, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `f_max_n`**
