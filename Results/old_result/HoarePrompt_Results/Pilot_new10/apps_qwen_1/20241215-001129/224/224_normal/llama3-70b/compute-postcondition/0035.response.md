Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\); `f_max_n` is a positive integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `MOD` is 10; `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[0] = 1`, `dp[1] = 4`, and for every `j` from 2 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j] = (2 * dp[j - 1] + dp[j - 2] + ... + dp[0]) % 10`; `i` is `n + 2`; `j` is 0; `dp[j]` is the final value of `dp[1]` after the loop completes.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates backward from `f_max_n` to 1.
- In each iteration, `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] + dp[j - 1] % MOD`.
- After the loop completes, `dp[j]` for `j = 1` will be the sum of the entire `dp` list modulo 10.

Since the loop starts from `f_max_n` and goes down to 1, the final value of `dp[j]` when `j = 1` will be the sum of all elements in the `dp` list modulo 10. This is because each element `dp[j]` is updated to include the previous value of `dp[j-1]` until all elements have been added together.

Thus, after the loop completes, `dp[1]` will hold the final value of the sum of all elements in the `dp` list modulo 10.
