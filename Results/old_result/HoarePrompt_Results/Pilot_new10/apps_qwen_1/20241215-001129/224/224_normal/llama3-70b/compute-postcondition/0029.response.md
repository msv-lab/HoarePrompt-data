Let's analyze the given information step by step to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\).
- `f_max_n` is a positive integer that must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `MOD` is 10.
- `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1` where:
  - `dp[0] = 1`
  - `dp[1] = 4`
  - For every `j` from 2 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j] = (2 * dp[j - 1] + dp[j - 2] + ... + dp[0]) % 10`.
- `i` is `n + 2`.
- `j` is 1.
- `dp[j]` is 4.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(f_max_n, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop starts with `j` set to 1 and goes down to 0.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was 1.
- Since the loop is decrementing `j` by 1 each iteration, the next value of `j` would be `0`.

### Adjusted States:
- `j` will now be 0.
- All other states remain unchanged as the loop body is omitted, and no modifications are made to `n`, `f_max_n`, `MOD`, or `dp`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\); `f_max_n` is a positive integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `MOD` is 10; `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[0] = 1`, `dp[1] = 4`, and for every `j` from 2 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j] = (2 * dp[j - 1] + dp[j - 2] + ... + dp[0]) % 10`; `i` is `n + 2`; `j` is 0; `dp[j]` is 4**
