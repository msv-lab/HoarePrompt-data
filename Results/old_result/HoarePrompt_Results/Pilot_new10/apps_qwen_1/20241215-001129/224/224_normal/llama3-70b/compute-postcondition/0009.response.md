The code snippet `dp[j] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[j]` by taking the modulo with `MOD`. Given that `MOD` is 10, and the initial value of `dp[j]` is `dp[f_max_n - 2] + dp[f_max_n - 1]`, we need to apply the modulo operation to this sum.

Since `dp[f_max_n - 1]` is already `dp[f_max_n - 2] + dp[f_max_n - 1]`, the value of `dp[j]` before the operation is `dp[f_max_n - 2] + dp[f_max_n - 1]`.

After applying the modulo operation, `dp[j]` becomes `(dp[f_max_n - 2] + dp[f_max_n - 1]) % 10`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\), `f_max_n` is an integer representing the maximum value of \(f(p)\) for permutations of length `n`, `MOD` is 10, `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1` initialized to 0 with `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[f_max_n] = dp[f_max_n] % 10`, `j` is `f_max_n - 1`, `dp[j]` is `(dp[f_max_n - 2] + dp[f_max_n - 1]) % 10`**
