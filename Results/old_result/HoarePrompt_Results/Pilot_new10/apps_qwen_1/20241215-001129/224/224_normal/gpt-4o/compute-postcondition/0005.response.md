According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 2 to \(n+1\). At the end of the previous iteration, the following states hold:

- `total` is 1
- `mod` is 1000000007
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\)
- `result` is 6
- `i` is 3

For the loop to execute one more time, the variable `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 4. The variable `n` remains the same because the loop condition does not depend on modifying `n` within the loop itself.

So, at the start of the next iteration, the state will be:

- `total` remains 1
- `mod` remains 1000000007
- `n` remains an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\)
- `result` remains 6
- `i` is now 4

State: **`total` is 1, `mod` is 1000000007, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\), `result` is 6, `i` is 4**
