Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The annotated program does not correctly implement the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1` calculates the factorial of `n` modulo `10^9 + 7`, but the problem requires counting the number of permutations where the function `f(p)` equals `f_max(n)`. Hereâ€™s why the program does not meet the requirements:

1. **Incorrect Functionality**: The function `func_1` computes the factorial of `n` modulo `10^9 + 7`, which is not relevant to the problem at hand. The problem requires counting permutations where `f(p)` equals `f_max(n)`, not computing factorials.

2. **Problem Description Mismatch**: The core requirement is to find permutations `p` of integers `1` to `n` such that `f(p) = f_max(n)`. The annotated program does not address this part of the problem. Instead, it simply handles the base case `n=2` correctly (returning `1`) and then incorrectly calls `func_1` for `n > 2`.

To meet the problem description, the program needs to:
- Calculate `f_max(n)` based on the properties of the GCD function over permutations.
- Count the number of permutations where `f(p)` equals `f_max(n)`.

Since the provided program does not perform these required steps, it is incorrect.
