Let's go through the given code step by step:

- Initial State:
  - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\)
  - `f_max_n` is a positive integer that must be greater than or equal to 1
  - `MOD` is 10
  - `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[0] = 1` and for every `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j] = (2 * dp[j - 1] + dp[j - 2] + ... + dp[0]) % 10`
  - `i` is `n + 2`
  - `j` is 1

- Code:
  ```python
  dp[j] += dp[j - 1]
  ```

This line of code increments `dp[j]` by `dp[j - 1]`. Given the initial state, let's determine the values of `dp[j]` and `dp[j - 1]`.

- From the initial state, `dp[0] = 1` and for `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j] = (2 * dp[j - 1] + dp[j - 2] + ... + dp[0]) % 10`.
- Since `j` is initially set to 1, we have `dp[1] = (2 * dp[0] + dp[0]) % 10 = (2 * 1 + 1) % 10 = 3 % 10 = 3`.

Therefore, before the code execution, `dp[1]` is 3.

Now, executing the code:
```python
dp[j] += dp[j - 1]
```
Substituting the values:
```python
dp[1] += dp[0]
```
Since `dp[0] = 1`, we get:
```python
dp[1] = 3 + 1 = 4
```

The other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the updated state is:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\)
- `f_max_n` is a positive integer that must be greater than or equal to 1
- `MOD` is 10
- `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[0] = 1` and for every `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j] = (2 * dp[j - 1] + dp[j - 2] + ... + dp[0]) % 10`, and now `dp[1] = 4`
- `i` is `n + 2`
- `j` is 1

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\); `f_max_n` is a positive integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `MOD` is 10; `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[0] = 1`, `dp[1] = 4`, and for every `j` from 2 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j] = (2 * dp[j - 1] + dp[j - 2] + ... + dp[0]) % 10`; `i` is `n + 2`; `j` is 1**
