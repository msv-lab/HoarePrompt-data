The code snippet `dp[j] %= MOD` updates `dp[j]` by taking its value modulo `MOD`. Given the initial state:

- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\)
- `f_max_n` is a positive integer that must be greater than or equal to 1
- `MOD` is 10
- `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[0] = 1`, `dp[1] = 4`, and for every `j` from 2 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j] = (2 * dp[j - 1] + dp[j - 2] + ... + dp[0]) % 10`
- `i` is `n + 2`
- `j` is 0
- `dp[j]` is 8

The line `dp[j] %= MOD` means `dp[j]` will be updated to `dp[j] % 10`. Since `dp[j]` is initially 8, `dp[j] % 10` is simply 8.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\); `f_max_n` is a positive integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `MOD` is 10; `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[0] = 1`, `dp[1] = 4`, and for every `j` from 2 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j] = (2 * dp[j - 1] + dp[j - 2] + ... + dp[0]) % 10`; `i` is `n + 2`; `j` is 0; `dp[j]` is 8**
