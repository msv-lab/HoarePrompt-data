### Explanation:
- **Initial State**: 
  - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\).
  - `f_max_n` is a positive integer.
  - `MOD` is 10.
  - `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[0] = 1` and for every `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j] = (dp[j - 1] + dp[j - 2] + ... + dp[0]) % 10`.
  - `i` is `n + 1`.
  - `j` is `n + 1`.

- **Loop Execution**:
  - The loop runs from `j = f_max_n` down to `j = 1`.
  - For each iteration, the value of `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] + dp[j - 1]` and then taken modulo `10`.

- **Final Iteration**:
  - After the loop completes, `j` will be 1 because the loop runs in reverse order from `f_max_n` to 1.
  - All values of `dp[j]` for `j` from 1 to `f_max_n` will have been updated according to the formula `dp[j] = (2 * dp[j - 1] + dp[j - 2] + ... + dp[0]) % 10`.

- **Conclusion**:
  - After the loop completes, `j` will be 1.
  - `dp[j]` will be updated to `(`2 * dp[j - 1] + dp[j - 2] + ... + dp[0]`) % 10`.

Thus, the final state of the variables is as described above.
