Let's analyze the provided code and annotations step-by-step to determine the functionality of the function.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Parameters**:
   - The function `func_3` takes two parameters:
     - `n`: An integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\).
     - `f_max_n`: An integer representing the maximum value of `f(p)` for permutations of length `n`.

2. **Variables**:
   - `MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7`: A constant used for modulo operation.
   - `dp`: A list of length `f_max_n + 1` initialized to 0, except `dp[0] = 1`.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - A nested loop is used to update the `dp` array.
   - The outer loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `n`.
   - The inner loop iterates over `j` from `f_max_n` down to 1.
   - For each `j`, `dp[j]` is updated by adding `dp[j - 1]` and taking modulo `MOD`.

4. **Return Statement**:
   - The function returns `dp[f_max_n]`, which is the last value computed in the `dp` array.

### Potential Edge Cases and Missing Logic

- **Edge Case: `f_max_n` is 0**:
  - If `f_max_n` is 0, the `dp` array is only of length 1, and `dp[0]` is set to 1. No other values are computed. However, the code doesn't explicitly handle this case, so it should be noted.
  
- **Edge Case: `n` is less than 2**:
  - Although the problem statement specifies \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\), the code itself does not enforce this condition. If `n < 2`, the loops will not execute, and `dp[f_max_n]` will still be 1 due to the initialization.

- **Modulo Operation**:
  - The modulo operation ensures that the values in `dp` stay within a manageable range.

### Functionality Summary

The function `func_3` computes a value stored in the `dp` array using a dynamic programming approach. Specifically, it updates the `dp` array such that `dp[j]` contains the cumulative product of `(j + 1)` for all `j` from 0 to `f_max_n`, modulo `10^9 + 7`. Finally, it returns `dp[f_max_n]`.

Given the above analysis, the correct summary is:

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `n` and `f_max_n`. It computes and returns `dp[f_max_n]` using a dynamic programming approach, where `dp[j]` is updated to represent the cumulative product of `(j + 1)` for all `j` from 0 to `f_max_n`, modulo `10^9 + 7`. The function handles the case where `f_max_n` is 0 by initializing `dp[0]` to 1 and leaves `n` as an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\).**
