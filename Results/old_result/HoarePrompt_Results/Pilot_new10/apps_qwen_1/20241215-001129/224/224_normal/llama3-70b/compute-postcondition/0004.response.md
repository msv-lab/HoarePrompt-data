Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop**: The loop is defined as follows:
   ```python
   for j in range(f_max_n, 0, -1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```
   This loop iterates from `f_max_n` down to `1`.

2. **Determine the Necessary Conditions for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop requires that `j` takes values starting from `f_max_n` down to `1`.
   - Since the loop iterates in reverse order (from `f_max_n` to `1`), the initial value of `j` must be `f_max_n`.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - `j` must start at `f_max_n` and decrease by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `1`.
   - The variable `f_max_n` remains unchanged within the loop.
   - The variable `MOD` is a constant (10) and doesn't affect the loop's execution directly.

4. **Initial State Before the Loop**:
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\).
   - `f_max_n` is an integer representing the maximum value of `f(p)` for permutations of length `n`.
   - `MOD` is set to `10`.
   - `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1` initialized to `0`, and `dp[0] = 1`.

5. **Required Adjustments**:
   - To ensure the loop starts correctly, `j` must be `f_max_n` initially.

Given these points, the final state before the loop should be:

**State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, `f_max_n` is an integer representing the maximum value of f(p) for permutations of length n, `MOD` is 10, `dp` is a list of length f_max_n + 1 initialized to 0, and `dp[0] = 1, `j` is f_max_n**.
