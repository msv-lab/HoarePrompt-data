You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Let's define a function $f(p)$ on a permutation $p$ as follows. Let $g_i$ be the greatest common divisor (GCD) of elements $p_1$, $p_2$, ..., $p_i$ (in other words, it is the GCD of the prefix of length $i$). Then $f(p)$ is the number of distinct elements among $g_1$, $g_2$, ..., $g_n$.

Let $f_{max}(n)$ be the maximum value of $f(p)$ among all permutations $p$ of integers $1$, $2$, ..., $n$.

Given an integers $n$, count the number of permutations $p$ of integers $1$, $2$, ..., $n$, such that $f(p)$ is equal to $f_{max}(n)$. Since the answer may be large, print the remainder of its division by $1000\,000\,007 = 10^9 + 7$.


-----Input-----

The only line contains the integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^6$) — the length of the permutations.


-----Output-----

The only line should contain your answer modulo $10^9+7$.

-----Note-----

Consider the second example: these are the permutations of length $3$:  $[1,2,3]$, $f(p)=1$.  $[1,3,2]$, $f(p)=1$.  $[2,1,3]$, $f(p)=2$.  $[2,3,1]$, $f(p)=2$.  $[3,1,2]$, $f(p)=2$.  $[3,2,1]$, $f(p)=2$. 

The maximum value $f_{max}(3) = 2$, and there are $4$ permutations $p$ such that $f(p)=2$.
Functions with output description for each function:
n = int(input())
f_max_n = func_2(n)
print(func_3(n, f_max_n))

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, where `a` is greater than 0 and `b` is greater than or equal to 0. It computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. After executing the function, the function returns `a`, which is the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`, and sets `b` to 0.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(n):
    res = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        res = max(res, func_1(res, i))
    return res
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts an integer `n` (where \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\)) and returns the maximum value obtained by applying `func_1(res, i)` for all integers `i` from 1 to `n`.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3(n, f_max_n):
    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
    dp = [0] * (f_max_n + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(f_max_n, 0, -1):
            dp[j] += dp[j - 1]
            dp[j] %= MOD
    return dp[f_max_n]
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function accepts two parameters `n` and `f_max_n`. It computes and returns `dp[f_max_n]` using a dynamic programming approach, where `dp[j]` is updated to represent the cumulative product of `(j + 1)` for all `j` from 0 to `f_max_n`, modulo `10^9 + 7`. The function handles the case where `f_max_n` is 0 by initializing `dp[0]` to 1 and leaves `n` as an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\).



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
