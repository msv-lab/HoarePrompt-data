Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_2` indeed calculates the GCD of the numbers from 1 to `n`, which is not equivalent to `f_max(n)`. For example, for `n = 6`, the correct `f_max(6)` should be 3, as the permutation `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` results in `f(p) = 3`. However, `func_2` does not correctly compute this value. The output hints confirm that `func_1` and `func_3` are implemented correctly, but the core issue lies with `func_2`. Therefore, the overall program does not correctly solve the problem as described.
