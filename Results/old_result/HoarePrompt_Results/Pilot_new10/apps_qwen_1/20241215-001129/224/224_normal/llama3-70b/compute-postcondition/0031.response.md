The code snippet performs the following operation: `dp[j] %= MOD`. This means that `dp[j]` is taken modulo `MOD`. Given the initial state, `dp[j]` is already 5 and `MOD` is 10. Taking 5 modulo 10 results in 5 itself since 5 is less than 10.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\); `f_max_n` is a positive integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `MOD` is 10; `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[0] = 1`, `dp[1] = 4`, and for every `j` from 2 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j] = (2 * dp[j - 1] + dp[j - 2] + ... + dp[0]) % 10`; `i` is `n + 2`; `j` is 0; `dp[j]` is 5.**
