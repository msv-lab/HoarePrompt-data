The code updates the `result` variable by multiplying it with `i` and then taking the modulo `mod`. Given the initial values:
- `total` is 1
- `mod` is 1000000007
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\)
- `result` is 2
- `i` is 3

The code executes as follows:
- `result = result * i % mod` translates to `result = 2 * 3 % 1000000007`.
- Calculating the multiplication first: \(2 * 3 = 6\).
- Taking the modulo: \(6 \% 1000000007 = 6\).

Therefore, the value of `result` is updated to 6. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 1, `mod` is 1000000007, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\), `result` is 6, `i` is 3**
