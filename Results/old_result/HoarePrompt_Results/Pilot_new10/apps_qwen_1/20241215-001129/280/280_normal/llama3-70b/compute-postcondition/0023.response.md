The function `func` accepts four parameters: `v_1`, `v_2`, `t`, and `d`. The constraints are that `v_1` and `v_2` are integers within the range 1 to 100, `t` is an integer within the range 2 to 100, and `d` is an integer within the range 0 to 10. There are no specified return values or conditions given directly in the prompt, only the constraints on the parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `v_1`, `v_2`, `t`, and `d`, where `v_1` and `v_2` are integers between 1 and 100, `t` is an integer between 2 and 100, and `d` is an integer between 0 and 10.**
