The function `func` accepts four parameters: `v_1` and `v_2` which are integers such that \(1 \leq v_1, v_2 \leq 100\), `t` which is an integer such that \(2 \leq t \leq 100\), and `d` which is an integer such that \(0 \leq d \leq 10\). 

Case_1: The function does not provide any specific condition or return value directly from the given information.

Case_2: Since no other conditions or return values are specified, it implies that the function might return a default value or perform some unspecified operation based on the parameters, but this is not detailed in the provided information.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept four parameters `v_1`, `v_2`, `t`, and `d` and return an unspecified value or perform an unspecified operation based on these parameters within their given ranges. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `v_1` and `v_2` (integers such that \(1 \leq v_1, v_2 \leq 100\)), `t` (an integer such that \(2 \leq t \leq 100\)), and `d` (an integer such that \(0 \leq d \leq 10\)), and returns an unspecified value or performs an unspecified operation based on these parameters.**
