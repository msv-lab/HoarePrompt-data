The code sets `speeds[0]` to `v1`. However, `v1` is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, the assignment cannot be made directly. The state remains unchanged since an undefined variable cannot be assigned.

Output State: **`t` is the first integer entered by the user, `d` is the second integer entered by the user, `v1` is no longer defined, `v2` is no longer defined, `speeds` is a list of `t` elements, each initialized to 0.**
