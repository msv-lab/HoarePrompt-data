You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The on-board computer on Polycarp's car measured that the car speed at the beginning of some section of the path equals v_1 meters per second, and in the end it is v_2 meters per second. We know that this section of the route took exactly t seconds to pass.

Assuming that at each of the seconds the speed is constant, and between seconds the speed can change at most by d meters per second in absolute value (i.e., the difference in the speed of any two adjacent seconds does not exceed d in absolute value), find the maximum possible length of the path section in meters.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers v_1 and v_2 (1 ≤ v_1, v_2 ≤ 100) — the speeds in meters per second at the beginning of the segment and at the end of the segment, respectively.

The second line contains two integers t (2 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the time when the car moves along the segment in seconds, d (0 ≤ d ≤ 10) — the maximum value of the speed change between adjacent seconds.

It is guaranteed that there is a way to complete the segment so that:  the speed in the first second equals v_1,  the speed in the last second equals v_2,  the absolute value of difference of speeds between any two adjacent seconds doesn't exceed d. 


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible length of the path segment in meters. 


-----Examples-----
Input
5 6
4 2

Output
26
Input
10 10
10 0

Output
100


-----Note-----

In the first sample the sequence of speeds of Polycarpus' car can look as follows: 5, 7, 8, 6. Thus, the total path is 5 + 7 + 8 + 6 = 26 meters.

In the second sample, as d = 0, the car covers the whole segment at constant speed v = 10. In t = 10 seconds it covers the distance of 100 meters.
Program:
```
def func():
    (v1, v2) = map(int, input().split())
    (t, d) = map(int, input().split())
    max_speed = max(v1, v2)
    min_speed = min(v1, v2)
    max_length = max_speed * t
    min_length = min_speed * t
    for i in range(t - 1, 0, -1):
        max_speed = max(max_speed - d, min_speed)
        min_speed = min(min_speed + d, max_speed)
        max_length += max_speed
        min_length += min_speed
    print(max_length)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum possible length of the path segment. The issue lies in the way the maximum and minimum speeds are updated within the loop. Specifically, the program updates the `max_speed` and `min_speed` based on the previous values, but it does not ensure that these values are consistent with the constraints given in the problem description.

For instance, consider the following input:
```
5 6
4 2
```

According to the problem description, the speed changes between adjacent seconds should not exceed 2 meters per second in absolute value. However, the current implementation may not enforce this constraint properly. Let's break down the issue:

1. Initially, the speeds are 5 and 6.
2. The program tries to update the speeds from the last second to the first second.
3. In the first iteration, it updates the `max_speed` and `min_speed` based on the previous values, but it does not ensure that the difference between `max_speed` and `min_speed` does not exceed 2.

To illustrate, let's manually check the sequence of speeds:
- Start with speeds 5 and 6.
- Update the speeds backwards:
  - Second 3: `max_speed = max(5 - 2, 6) = 5`, `min_speed = min(5, 6 - 2) = 4`.
  - Second 2: `max_speed = max(5 - 2, 4) = 5`, `min_speed = min(4, 5) = 4`.
  - Second 1: `max_speed = max(5 - 2, 4) = 5`, `min_speed = min(4, 5) = 4`.

The sequence of speeds could be 5, 5, 5, 6, which results in a path length of 20 meters instead of the correct maximum length of 26 meters.

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle the constraints and does not provide the maximum possible length of the path segment.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts four parameters: `v1` and `v2` (integers between 1 and 100), `t` (an integer between 2 and 100), and `d` (an integer between 0 and 10). It calculates the maximum and minimum speeds based on `v1` and `v2`, and then iteratively updates the maximum and minimum speeds over `t-1` iterations. During each iteration, the maximum length covered is updated based on the current maximum speed, and the minimum length covered is updated based on the current minimum speed. After the loop, the function prints the maximum length covered. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
