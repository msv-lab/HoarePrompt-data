The code `t, d = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input, splits them by whitespace, and assigns them to `t` and `d` respectively. Since the initial state specifies that `v1` and `v2` are integers entered by the user, and `t` and `d` are also integers entered by the user with specific ranges, these inputs will replace the initial values of `v1` and `v2` in the variables `t` and `d`. The initial values of `v1` and `v2` are no longer relevant after this operation, and the conditions for `t` and `d` are now directly determined by the user's input.

Output State: **`t` is the first integer entered by the user, `d` is the second integer entered by the user, `v1` is no longer defined, `v2` is no longer defined**
