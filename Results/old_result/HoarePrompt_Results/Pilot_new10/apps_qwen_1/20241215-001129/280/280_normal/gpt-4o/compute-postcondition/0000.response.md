The code `v1, v2 = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers from input and assigns them to `v1` and `v2`. This means the values of `v1` and `v2` will be updated to the integers entered by the user, while `t` and `d` remain unchanged.

Given the initial conditions:
- `v_1` and `v_2` are integers such that \(1 \leq v_1, v_2 \leq 100\)
- `t` is an integer such that \(2 \leq t \leq 100\)
- `d` is an integer such that \(0 \leq d \leq 10\)

After the code execution, `v1` and `v2` will be the integers entered by the user, and `t` and `d` will retain their original values.

Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are the integers entered by the user, `t` is an integer such that \(2 \leq t \leq 100\), `d` is an integer such that \(0 \leq d \leq 10\)**
