You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The on-board computer on Polycarp's car measured that the car speed at the beginning of some section of the path equals v_1 meters per second, and in the end it is v_2 meters per second. We know that this section of the route took exactly t seconds to pass.

Assuming that at each of the seconds the speed is constant, and between seconds the speed can change at most by d meters per second in absolute value (i.e., the difference in the speed of any two adjacent seconds does not exceed d in absolute value), find the maximum possible length of the path section in meters.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers v_1 and v_2 (1 ≤ v_1, v_2 ≤ 100) — the speeds in meters per second at the beginning of the segment and at the end of the segment, respectively.

The second line contains two integers t (2 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the time when the car moves along the segment in seconds, d (0 ≤ d ≤ 10) — the maximum value of the speed change between adjacent seconds.

It is guaranteed that there is a way to complete the segment so that:  the speed in the first second equals v_1,  the speed in the last second equals v_2,  the absolute value of difference of speeds between any two adjacent seconds doesn't exceed d. 


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible length of the path segment in meters. 


-----Examples-----
Input
5 6
4 2

Output
26
Input
10 10
10 0

Output
100


-----Note-----

In the first sample the sequence of speeds of Polycarpus' car can look as follows: 5, 7, 8, 6. Thus, the total path is 5 + 7 + 8 + 6 = 26 meters.

In the second sample, as d = 0, the car covers the whole segment at constant speed v = 10. In t = 10 seconds it covers the distance of 100 meters.
Program:
```
def func():
    (v1, v2) = map(int, input().split())
    (t, d) = map(int, input().split())
    max_speed = max(v1, v2)
    min_speed = min(v1, v2)
    max_length = max_speed * t
    min_length = min_speed * t
    for i in range(t - 1, 0, -1):
        max_speed = max(max_speed - d, min_speed)
        min_speed = min(min_speed + d, max_speed)
        max_length += max_speed
        min_length += min_speed
    print(max_length)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum possible length of the path segment. Specifically, the logic to update `max_speed` and `min_speed` is flawed. The program updates `max_speed` and `min_speed` in such a way that they can become negative or exceed the initial values, which may not satisfy the constraints of the problem.

For example, consider the following input:
```
10 10
4 2
```
According to the problem description, the sequence of speeds should start at 10 m/s, end at 10 m/s, and the difference between any two adjacent speeds should not exceed 2 m/s. A valid sequence could be 10, 12, 14, 12, 10, resulting in a total length of \(10 + 12 + 14 + 12 + 10 = 58\) meters.

However, the program would calculate the length as:
- Initial `max_speed` = 10, `min_speed` = 10
- After first iteration: `max_speed` = 8, `min_speed` = 12
- After second iteration: `max_speed` = 6, `min_speed` = 14
- After third iteration: `max_speed` = 4, `min_speed` = 16 (which is invalid as it exceeds the initial value)

This leads to an incorrect calculation of the maximum possible length. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: v_1 and v_2 are integers such that 1 ≤ v_1, v_2 ≤ 100, t is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100, and d is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10.
def func():
    v1, v2 = map(int, input().split())
    t, d = map(int, input().split())
    max_speed = max(v1, v2)
    min_speed = min(v1, v2)
    max_length = max_speed * t
    min_length = min_speed * t
    for i in range(t - 1, 0, -1):
        max_speed = max(max_speed - d, min_speed)
        
        min_speed = min(min_speed + d, max_speed)
        
        max_length += max_speed
        
        min_length += min_speed
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `max_length` is the sum of `min_length` and `t * max_speed`, `max_speed` is the maximum of `a` and `b` decreased by `d * (t - 1)`, `min_speed` is the minimum of `a` and `b` increased by `d * (t - 1)`, `min_length` is the sum of `min_speed` multiplied by `t`, `i` is 0 if the loop does not execute, otherwise `i` is 0.
    print(max_length)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four parameters: `v1` and `v2` (integers between 1 and 100), `t` (an integer between 2 and 100), and `d` (an integer between 0 and 10). It calculates the maximum and minimum speeds based on `v1` and `v2`, and then iteratively updates the maximum and minimum speeds over `t-1` iterations. During each iteration, the maximum length covered is updated based on the current maximum speed, and the minimum length covered is updated based on the current minimum speed. After the loop, the function prints the maximum length covered.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
