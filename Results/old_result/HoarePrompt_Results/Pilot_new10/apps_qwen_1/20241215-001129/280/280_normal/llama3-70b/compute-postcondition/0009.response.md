`max_length` is incremented by `max_speed`. The previous state was defined such that `max_speed` is the maximum of `max_speed - d` and `min_speed`, and `min_speed` is the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`. After executing the line of code, the values of `max_speed` and `min_speed` remain unchanged, but `max_length` is updated.

Output State: **`max_length` is `max_length + max_speed`, `max_speed` is the maximum of `max_speed - d` and `min_speed`, `min_speed` is the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`**
