The code snippet `print(max_length)` prints the value of `max_length`. Since no assignment or change to any variable is made in this line, the value of `max_length` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`max_length` is the sum of `min_length` and `t * max_speed`, `max_speed` is the maximum of `a` and `b` decreased by `d * (t - 1)`, `min_speed` is the minimum of `a` and `b` increased by `d * (t - 1)`, `min_length` is the sum of `min_speed` multiplied by `t`, `i` is 0**
