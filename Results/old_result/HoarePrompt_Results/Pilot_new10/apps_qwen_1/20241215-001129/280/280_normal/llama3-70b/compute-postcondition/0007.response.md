The code updates the value of `max_speed` to be the maximum of `max_speed - d` and `min_speed`. However, the initial value of `max_speed` is not specified in the initial state, and neither is the value of `d` or `min_speed`. Therefore, we can only express the updated value of `max_speed` in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`max_speed` is the maximum of `max_speed - d` and `min_speed`**
