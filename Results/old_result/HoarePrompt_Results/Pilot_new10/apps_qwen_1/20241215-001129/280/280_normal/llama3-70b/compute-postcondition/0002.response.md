`max_speed` is assigned the maximum value between `v1` (which is `a`) and `v2` (which is `b`). The values of `t` and `d` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. Therefore, the Output State is: `v1` is `a`, `v2` is `b`, `t` is an integer input, `d` is an integer input, and `max_speed` is the maximum of `a` and `b`.

Output State: **`v1` is `a`, `v2` is `b`, `t` is an integer input, `d` is an integer input, `max_speed` is the maximum of `a` and `b`**
