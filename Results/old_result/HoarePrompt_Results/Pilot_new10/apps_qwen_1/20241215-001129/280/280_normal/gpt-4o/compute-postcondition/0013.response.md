The code `print(total_distance)` simply prints the value of `total_distance`. Since `total_distance` is already calculated before this line of code, the print statement does not change its value. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`total_distance` is the sum of the elements in `speeds`, where for each index `i` from 0 to `t-1`, `speeds[i]` is the minimum value between `speeds[i-1] + d` and `v2 + (t - i - 1) * d`, `t` is a positive integer at least 2, `d` is the second integer entered by the user, and `speeds` is a list of `t` elements. The value of `total_distance` is printed.**
