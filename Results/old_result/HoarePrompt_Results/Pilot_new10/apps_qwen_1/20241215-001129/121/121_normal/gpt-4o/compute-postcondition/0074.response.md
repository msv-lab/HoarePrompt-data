Postcondition: ***`counts` is a dictionary where the sum of all values is exactly `target_count`, `result` is a list containing each character of `s` where the corresponding `counts[char]` is less than `target_count`, and `i` is `i + 1` if `i + 1` is within bounds, otherwise `0`. If `result[i]` equals `'?'`, the function does not change `counts`, `result`, or `i`. Otherwise, no specific changes are made to `counts`, `result`, or `i` as there is no else part provided.***
