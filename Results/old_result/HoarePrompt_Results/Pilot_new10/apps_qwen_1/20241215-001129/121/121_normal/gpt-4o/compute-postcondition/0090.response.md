The code `break` does not change any variable values. It only breaks out of the most internal loop or conditional statement. Since there is no loop or conditional statement that is being executed, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`counts` is a non-empty dictionary where the value associated with `char` is `target_count + 2`, the sum of all values in `counts` is `target_count + 2`, and `result[i]` is equal to `char`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
