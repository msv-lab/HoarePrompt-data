Postcondition: `c` is the next character in the string `s`, `res` is a concatenation string that includes `'ACGT'` followed by all characters from `s` that have a count greater than zero in `count`, and `count['A']`, `count['C']`, `count['G']`, `count['T']` reflect the final counts of each nucleotide after processing all characters in `s` up to the next character. `c` is not `?`.
