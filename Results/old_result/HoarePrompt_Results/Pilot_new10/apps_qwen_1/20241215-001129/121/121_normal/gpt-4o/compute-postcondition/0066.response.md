The `break` statement does not modify any variables but instead breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or conditional block. Since no loop or conditional block is specified in the code snippet, we assume this `break` statement is outside of any such block, meaning it does not affect any variables. Therefore, the states of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`counts` is a dictionary where the sum of all values is exactly `target_count - 1`, `result` is a list containing each character of `s` where the corresponding `counts[char]` is less than `target_count`, and `i` is 1.**
