Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 255, `count` is a dictionary where `count['A']`, `count['C']`, `count['G']`, and `count['T']` are non-negative integers, and if `c` is not '?', then `count[c]` is incremented by 1 (the value is the original value + 1), and `c` is the next character in the string `s`. Since there is no else part, the postcondition only includes the if part.***
