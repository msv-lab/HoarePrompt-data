Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has a logical flaw that causes it to fail in certain cases. Specifically, the code does not ensure that after replacing the question marks (`?`) with nucleotides, the final count of each nucleotide is exactly `n // 4`. Instead, it only checks the intermediate counts and stops as soon as it finds a nucleotide count exceeding `n // 4`, which is not sufficient to guarantee a valid solution.

For example, consider the input:
```
8
A??C??TT
```

The code will replace the first `?` with `A`, the second `?` with `C`, and the third `?` with `T`, resulting in the string `AACCCTTT`. However, the counts of nucleotides are:
- `A`: 2
- `C`: 2
- `G`: 0
- `T`: 3

This results in an invalid genome because the counts are not equal.

To fix this, the code needs to ensure that after replacing the question marks, the final counts of `A`, `C`, `G`, and `T` are all equal to `n // 4`. The current implementation does not enforce this final check.
