`nc` is subtracted by 1 from `count[nc]`. The value of `count[nc]` was originally greater than 0, so after subtracting 1, it remains greater than 0 (it could be 1 or any positive number). The values of `count['A']`, `count['C']`, `count['G']`, `count['T']`, and `res` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`count['A']` is greater than 0, `count['C']` is greater than 0, `count['G']` is greater than 0, `count['T']` is greater than 0, `res` is the original value of `res` plus `nc`, `count[nc]` is greater than 0 and equals to its original value minus 1**
