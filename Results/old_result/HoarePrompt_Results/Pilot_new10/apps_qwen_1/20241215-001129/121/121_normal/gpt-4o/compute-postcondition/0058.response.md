Postcondition: **`counts` is a dictionary where the sum of all values is exactly `target_count` and must have at least one key, `result` is a list containing each character of `s` where the corresponding `counts[char]` is less than `target_count`, and `i` is 0, and the current value of `char` is such that `counts[char]` is less than `target_count`**
