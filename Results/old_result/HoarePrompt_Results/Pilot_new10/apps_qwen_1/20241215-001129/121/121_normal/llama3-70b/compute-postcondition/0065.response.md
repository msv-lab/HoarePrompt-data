Postcondition: **`c` is the next character in the string `s`, `res` is a concatenation string that includes `'ACGT'` followed by all characters from `s` that have a count greater than zero in `count`, and `count['A']`, `count['C']`, `count['G']`, `count['T']` reflect the final counts of each nucleotide after processing all characters in `s`. If `c` is `?`, `res` is the concatenation of `'ACGT'` and all characters from `s` that have a count greater than zero in `count`. Otherwise, `res` is updated to `res + c` and `count['A']`, `count['C']`, `count['G']`, `count['T']` are updated based on the value of `c`.**
