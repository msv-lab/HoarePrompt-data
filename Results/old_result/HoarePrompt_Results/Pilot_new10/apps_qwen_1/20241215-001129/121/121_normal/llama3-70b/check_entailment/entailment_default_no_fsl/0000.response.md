Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code has a flaw in how it calculates and assigns the nucleotides to replace the '?' characters. Specifically, the line `count[c] = avg - count[c]` is incorrectly setting the remaining count needed for each nucleotide instead of adjusting the count of available replacements.

Here is a counterexample where the program fails:

### Counterexample
- **Input:**
  ```
  8
  G???????
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  ===
  ```

- **Actual Output:**
  ```
  GGACGTCT
  ```

### Explanation of the Counterexample:
- The input string `G???????` indicates that we need to replace 7 '?' with nucleotides such that each type ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') appears exactly twice (since \( \text{avg} = 8 // 4 = 2 \)).

- According to the code, after counting the existing 'G', the remaining counts for 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' should be set as follows:
  - 'G': 1 (since there is already one 'G')
  - 'A': 2 - 0 = 2
  - 'C': 2 - 0 = 2
  - 'T': 2 - 0 = 2

- When replacing the '?' characters starting from the left, the code will replace the first '?' with 'A', the second '?' with 'C', the third '?' with 'G', and so on. This results in the string `GGACGTCT`, which does not satisfy the condition that each nucleotide appears exactly twice.

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, leading to an incorrect output.
