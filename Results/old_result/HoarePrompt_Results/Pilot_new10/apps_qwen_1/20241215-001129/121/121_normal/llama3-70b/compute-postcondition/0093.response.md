The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `s`. 

- `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 255.
- `s` is a string consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'.

The function returns a value based on the following conditions:
- Case_1: If the length of `s` is less than `n`, the function returns an error message indicating that the string is too short.
- Case_2: If the length of `s` is equal to or greater than `n`, the function returns the string `s`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept an integer `n` and a string `s` and return the string `s` if its length is at least `n`, otherwise return an error message.
