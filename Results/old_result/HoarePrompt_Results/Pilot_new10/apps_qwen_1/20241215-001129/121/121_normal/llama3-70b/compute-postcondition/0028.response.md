`count[nc]` is decremented by 1. The value of `nc` is greater than 0, so `count[nc]` was initially greater than 0. The other variables (`c`, `ACGT`, `res`, and `nc_val`) are not affected.

Output State: **`c` is an integer or character with the current value being '?', `'ACGT'` must exist and be non-empty, `nc` is greater than 0, `res` is its current value plus `nc_val`, `count[nc]` is decreased by 1.**
