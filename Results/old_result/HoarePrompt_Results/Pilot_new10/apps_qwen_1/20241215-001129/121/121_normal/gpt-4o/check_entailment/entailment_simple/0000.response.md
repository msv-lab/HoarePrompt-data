Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here’s a breakdown of why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input and splits it into `n` and the genome string `s`. It checks if `n` is divisible by 4. If not, it prints "===" and exits, which aligns with the requirement to print "===" if it's not possible to decode the genome.

2. **Count Calculation**: It calculates the target count (`target_count`) as `n // 4`. It also initializes a dictionary to keep track of the count of each nucleotide ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') in the genome string.

3. **Validation of Counts**: The program checks if the count of any nucleotide exceeds the target count. If it finds such a nucleotide, it prints "===" and exits, which correctly handles the case where the genome cannot be decoded.

4. **Decoding the Genome**: If the genome can be decoded, it iterates through the string `s` and replaces each '?' with the appropriate nucleotide. The selection of the nucleotide is done based on the current minimum count in the `counts` dictionary. This ensures that the number of each nucleotide becomes equal after the replacements.

5. **Output**: Finally, it prints the decoded genome as a string.

The program handles all the cases described in the problem statement:
- It correctly prints "===" when it’s not possible to decode the genome.
- It decodes the genome correctly when it’s possible by ensuring that each nucleotide type appears exactly `target_count` times.

Since the program adheres to the problem description in all scenarios, the correctness is **True**.
