`target_count` is assigned the value of `n` divided by 4 using integer division (`//`). Since `n` is divisible by 4, `target_count` will be an integer. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 255, `s` is the second element of the `data` list, `data` is a list of strings from the input split by whitespace, `input` is the concatenated string of the input values, `target_count` is n // 4, and `n` is divisible by 4.**
