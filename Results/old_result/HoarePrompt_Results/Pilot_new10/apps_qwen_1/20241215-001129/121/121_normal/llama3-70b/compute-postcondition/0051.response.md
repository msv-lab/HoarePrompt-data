Postcondition: ***`ACGT` must not be empty, `c` is the next character in the string `s`, `res` is the current value, which is the previous value of `res` concatenated with `nc` if `nc` (the character being checked) is present more than once in the sequence. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged, and `count['A']`, `count['C']`, `count['G']`, `count['T']` reflect the current counts based on the character `nc`.***
