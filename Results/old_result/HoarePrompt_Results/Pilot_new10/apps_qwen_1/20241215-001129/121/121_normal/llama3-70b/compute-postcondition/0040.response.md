Postcondition: ***`c` is an integer or character with the current value being '?', `'ACGT'` must exist and be non-empty, `nc` is 'T', `res` is 'CT'. If `count['T'] > 0`, `count['T']` is decreased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, no other changes occur in these cases.***
