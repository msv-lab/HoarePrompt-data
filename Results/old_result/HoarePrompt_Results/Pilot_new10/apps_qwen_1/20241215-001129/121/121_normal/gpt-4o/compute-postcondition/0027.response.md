The code `print('===')` prints the string '===' to the console. This does not affect any of the variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(4 \leq n \leq 255\) and `n` is still divisible by 4, `s` is a non-empty string that is completely exhausted, `data` is the same list, `input` is the same concatenated string, `target_count` is \(n // 4\), `counts` is a dictionary with the count of each nucleotide ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') found in the string `s`, and for all characters `char` in `counts`, the count of `char` is less than or equal to `target_count`, and the loop is now processing the next character in the `counts` dictionary.**
