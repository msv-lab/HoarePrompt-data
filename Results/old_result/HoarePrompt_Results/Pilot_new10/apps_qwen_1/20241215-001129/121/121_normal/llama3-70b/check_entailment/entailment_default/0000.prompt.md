You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```

Output hints: The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation:The code originally looks correct. The function hints agree with the code and with their help we determine that the code indeed follows the problem description. the function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints: The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The code seems to be incorrect and not follow the problem description. We also see that the output hints agree with the code and they also help prove that the code is incorrect.  The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Output hints: The function returns the index of the target number in the input list `arr` if it is present; otherwise, it returns -1. If the taget is at the last index it wont be found as the loop will break before reaching the last index.

Example answer 3:
Explanation: Originnaly the code looks correct but after confirming that the output hints agree with the code,we can see the function returns the index of the target number in the input list `arr` if it is present; otherwise, it returns -1. The function uses a binary search algorithm to find the target number in the list. However, the termination condition of the while loop is `left < right`, which may cause the loop to terminate prematurely when `left` is equal to `right`. This condition can lead to missing the target element if it is at the last index of the list. Also when left and right are adjacent then mid will always be left leading to infinate loop.
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The process of mammoth's genome decoding in Berland comes to its end!

One of the few remaining tasks is to restore unrecognized nucleotides in a found chain s. Each nucleotide is coded with a capital letter of English alphabet: 'A', 'C', 'G' or 'T'. Unrecognized nucleotides are coded by a question mark '?'. Thus, s is a string consisting of letters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and characters '?'.

It is known that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types in the decoded genome of mammoth in Berland should be equal.

Your task is to decode the genome and replace each unrecognized nucleotide with one of the four types so that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types becomes equal.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the integer n (4 ≤ n ≤ 255) — the length of the genome.

The second line contains the string s of length n — the coded genome. It consists of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and '?'.


-----Output-----

If it is possible to decode the genome, print it. If there are multiple answer, print any of them. If it is not possible, print three equals signs in a row: "===" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
8
AG?C??CT

Output
AGACGTCT

Input
4
AGCT

Output
AGCT

Input
6
????G?

Output
===

Input
4
AA??

Output
===



-----Note-----

In the first example you can replace the first question mark with the letter 'A', the second question mark with the letter 'G', the third question mark with the letter 'T', then each nucleotide in the genome would be presented twice.

In the second example the genome is already decoded correctly and each nucleotide is exactly once in it.

In the third and the fourth examples it is impossible to decode the genom.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    count = {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}
    for c in s:
        if c != '?':
            count[c] += 1
    avg = n // 4
    for c in 'ACGT':
        count[c] = avg - count[c]
    res = ''
    for c in s:
        if c == '?':
            for nc in 'ACGT':
                if count[nc] > 0:
                    res += nc
                    count[nc] -= 1
                    break
        else:
            res += c
    if any(count.values()):
        print('===')
    else:
        print(res)


```
Output hints: The function accepts an integer `n` and a string `s` and replaces all '?' in `s` with 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T' such that each nucleotide appears exactly `n // 4` times. If this is not possible, it prints '==='; otherwise, it prints the modified string `s`.

Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
