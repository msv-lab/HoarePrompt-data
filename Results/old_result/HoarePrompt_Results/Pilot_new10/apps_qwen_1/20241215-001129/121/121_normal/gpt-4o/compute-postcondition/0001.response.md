The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into a list of strings, and assigns this list to the variable `data`. The initial values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged, and `input` remains the concatenated string of the input values. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer (4 ≤ n ≤ 255), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', `data` is a list of strings from the input split by whitespace, `input` is the concatenated string of the input values.**
