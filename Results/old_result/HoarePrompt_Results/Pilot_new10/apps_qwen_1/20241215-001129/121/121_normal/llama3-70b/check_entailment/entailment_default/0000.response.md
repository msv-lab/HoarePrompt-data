Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the case where the total number of nucleotides is not divisible by 4. In such cases, it is impossible to decode the genome such that each nucleotide type appears exactly `n // 4` times. However, the code does not check for this condition and simply tries to replace '?' with 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T' without ensuring the feasibility of the solution. For example, if the input is:

```
Input
5
AG?C?
```

The code will attempt to replace the '?' but will fail to ensure that each nucleotide appears exactly 1 time, which is impossible for this input. Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
