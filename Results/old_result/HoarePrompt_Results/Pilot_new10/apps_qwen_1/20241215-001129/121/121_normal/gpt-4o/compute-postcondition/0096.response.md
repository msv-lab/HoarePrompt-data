The function `func_1` accepts no input parameters. The input consists of two lines: the first line is an integer `n` (4 ≤ n ≤ 255) representing the length of the genome, and the second line is a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?' representing the coded genome.

The function returns based on the following cases:
- Case_1: The function returns `None`.
- Case_2: The function returns a character `char` that satisfies `counts[char] > target_count`, where `target_count` is `n // 4` and `char` is a nucleotide ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') that appears more than `target_count` times in string `s`.
- Case_3: The function does not return any value.
- Case_4: The function returns `target_count`, where `target_count` is `n // 4` and `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 255 and `n` is divisible by 4.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to process the input parameters `n` and `s` and return based on specific conditions involving the counts of nucleotides in the string `s`.
