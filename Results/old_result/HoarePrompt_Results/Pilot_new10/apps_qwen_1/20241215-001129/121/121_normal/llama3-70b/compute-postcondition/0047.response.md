Postcondition: **`'ACGT'` must not be empty, `c` is the next character in the string `s`, `res` is the current value, either the concatenation of `'ACGT'` and `c` if `c` is `'?'; otherwise, `res + c`, `nc` is the character being checked, `count['A']`, `count['C']`, `count['G']`, `count['T']` are the current counts based on the character `c`, and the count of `nc` is greater than 0**
