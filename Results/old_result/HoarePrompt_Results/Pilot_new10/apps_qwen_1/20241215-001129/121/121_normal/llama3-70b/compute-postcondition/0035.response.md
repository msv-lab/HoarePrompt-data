Postcondition: ***`c` is an integer or character with the current value being '?', `'ACGT'` must exist and be non-empty, `nc` is 'C', `res` is 'C'. If `count['C'] > 0`, then `count['C']` is decremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count['C'] <= 0`, no changes occur to `count['C']` and the program continues as is.***
