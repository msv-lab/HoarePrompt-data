Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(4 \leq n \leq 255\) and `n` is still divisible by 4, `s` is a non-empty string starting with the third character of the original `s`, `data` is the same list, `input` is the same concatenated string, `target_count` is \(n // 4\). If `char` is found in `counts`, then `counts[char]` is incremented by 1.***
