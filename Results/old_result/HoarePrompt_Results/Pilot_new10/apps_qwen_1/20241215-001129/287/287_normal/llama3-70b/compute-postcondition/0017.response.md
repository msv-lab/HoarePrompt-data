The variable `res` is decremented by 1. The value of `i` is updated to `i_current + 1`, and `i_next` is still less than `n`. The initial conditions of `n` being an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and `res` being either `res` (if \(n \% i \neq 0\)) or `res + 2` (if \(n \% i == 0\)) remain unchanged. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `res`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\), `res` is either `res` (if \(n \% i \neq 0\)) or `res + 1` (if \(n \% i == 0\)), `i` is `i_current + 1`, and `i_next` must be less than `n`.**
