`count` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `count` was 0, so now `count` is 1. The conditions on `num` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 10^9\) and `num` must be at least 9, `i` must be such that \((i + 1) * (i + 1) \leq num\); `count` is 1.
