The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Based on the initial state, `i` must satisfy \((i + 1) * (i + 1) \leq num\). Since the exact value of `i` was not specified, we only know it satisfies the given condition. After incrementing `i` by 1, the new condition becomes \((i + 1) * (i + 1) \leq num\), which now includes the increment.

Other variables remain unchanged:
- `num` is still an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 10^9\) and `num` must be at least 9.
- `count` remains unchanged unless `num` is divisible by the new value of `i`.

Since the exact value of `i` before the increment was not specified, the new value of `i` is `i + 1`. The condition \((i + 1) * (i + 1) \leq num\) still holds true because `i` originally satisfied this condition, and incrementing `i` by 1 should still keep it within the bounds unless `i` was already at the maximum value where \((i + 1) * (i + 1) > num\).

Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is increased by 1; `num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 10^9\) and `num` must be at least 9; `count` remains unchanged unless `num` is divisible by the new value of `i`.

Output State: **`i` is increased by 1; `num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 10^9\) and `num` must be at least 9; `count` remains unchanged unless `num` is divisible by the new value of `i`.**
