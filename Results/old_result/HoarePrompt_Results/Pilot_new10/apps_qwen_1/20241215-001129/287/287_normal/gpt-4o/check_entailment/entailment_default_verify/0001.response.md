Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The program indeed attempts to count the number of divisors of `n` instead of finding the number of different weights of its splits. Based on the output hints, the function `func_1` returns the number of divisors of `num`, which does not match the problem requirements. The problem asks for the number of different weights of splits of `n`, not the number of divisors. Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description.
