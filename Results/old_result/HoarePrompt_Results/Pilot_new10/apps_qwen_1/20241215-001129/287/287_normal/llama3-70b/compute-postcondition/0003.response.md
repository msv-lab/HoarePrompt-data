Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer within the range 1 <= n <= 10^9, `res` is 0, and `int(n` is divisible by `i`.***

Note: The postcondition assumes that `i` is an integer that divides `n` without a remainder, as per the if condition. However, since `i` is not defined in the precondition, it's important to clarify that `i` is an integer divisor of `n`.
