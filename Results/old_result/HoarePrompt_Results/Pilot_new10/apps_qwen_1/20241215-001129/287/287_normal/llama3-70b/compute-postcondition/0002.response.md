To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the for loop statement step by step.

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\).
- `res` is 0.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Range of the Loop**: The loop iterates over values of `i` starting from 1 up to (and including) `int(n ** 0.5)`.
   - This means that the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(n ** 0.5)`.

2. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\).
   - `res` is 0.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will execute if `int(n ** 0.5) >= 1`.
     - If `n == 1`, then `int(n ** 0.5) == 1`, and the loop will execute once.
     - If `n > 1`, then `int(n ** 0.5) > 1`, and the loop will execute more than once.

4. **States to Adjust**:
   - To ensure the loop can execute, we need to ensure that `int(n ** 0.5) >= 1`.
   - Since `n` is within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\), `int(n ** 0.5)` will always be at least 1 for any valid `n`.

Given this analysis, the key state to adjust is ensuring that the loop condition `int(n ** 0.5) >= 1` holds true.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 <= n <= 10^9, `res` is 0, and `int(n ** 0.5) >= 1`**

This ensures that the loop can execute.
