The code `count += 1` increments the value of `count` by 1. Given that the initial state is `count` is 1, the new value of `count` will be 2. The value of `i` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it. The value of `num` also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`count` is 2, `i` is 1, `num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 10^9\) and the current value of `i` is a divisor of `num`, and the current value of `i` is not equal to `num` divided by `i`**
