Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - `num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 10^9\) and `num` must be at least 9.
   - `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.
   - If `num` is divisible by `i` and `i` is not equal to `num // i`, then `count` is increased by 1.
   - If `i` is equal to `num // i`, then `count` is set to 2.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i * i <= num`.

3. **Next Iteration Check:**
   - For the loop to continue, the condition `i * i <= num` must be true after the increment.
   - Therefore, we need to check if the new value of `i` (after increment) satisfies this condition.

4. **Incrementing `i`:**
   - After the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1. Let’s denote the new value of `i` as `i_new`.
   - We need `i_new * i_new <= num` to be true for the loop to continue.

5. **Determining `i_new`:**
   - If `i` was the previous value of `i`, then `i_new = i + 1`.
   - We need to check if `(i + 1) * (i + 1) <= num`.

6. **Current Values:**
   - Since the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration is not given, let’s denote the previous value of `i` as `i_prev`.
   - The new value of `i` will be `i_prev + 1`.

7. **Condition for Next Iteration:**
   - We need `(i_prev + 1) * (i_prev + 1) <= num` to be true.
   - This simplifies to `i_prev * i_prev + 2 * i_prev + 1 <= num`.

8. **Final State Adjustment:**
   - The only state that needs adjustment is to ensure that the new value of `i` (which is `i_prev + 1`) satisfies the loop condition.

Therefore, the state adjustment required for the loop to execute one more time is:

**State: **`num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 10^9\) and `num` must be at least 9, `i` must be such that `(i + 1) * (i + 1) <= num`**.
