Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code attempts to count the number of divisors of \( n \), which is not the correct approach to solve the problem. The problem requires finding the number of different weights of splits of \( n \).

To understand why the code is incorrect, consider the following points:

1. **Divisor Counting**: The code counts the number of divisors of \( n \) and corrects for perfect squares. However, this is not related to the number of different weights of splits of \( n \).
   
2. **Example Analysis**:
   - For \( n = 7 \), the correct answer is 4 (weights 1, 2, 3, 7).
   - For \( n = 8 \), the correct answer is 5 (weights 1, 2, 3, 4, 8).
   - For \( n = 9 \), the correct answer is 5 (weights 1, 2, 3, 4, 9).

3. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code only checks for divisors and does not account for different weights of splits. For instance, for \( n = 8 \), the splits and their weights are:
     - [8] (weight 1)
     - [4, 4] (weight 2)
     - [3, 3, 2] (weight 2)
     - [2, 2, 2, 2] (weight 4)
     - [2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1] (weight 2)
     - [5, 3] (weight 2)
     - [5, 2, 1] (weight 3)
     - [4, 3, 1] (weight 3)
     - [3, 3, 2] (already counted)
     - [3, 2, 2, 1] (weight 3)
     - [2, 2, 2, 1, 1] (weight 4)
     - [2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1] (weight 4)
     - [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (weight 2)
     - [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (weight 8)

   - The code fails to generate these splits and compute the weights correctly.

Therefore, the provided code does not meet the requirements of the problem and hence the correctness is **False**.
