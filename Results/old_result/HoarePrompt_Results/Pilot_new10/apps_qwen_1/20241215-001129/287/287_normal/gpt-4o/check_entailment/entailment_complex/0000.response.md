Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The problem requires finding the number of different weights of splits of \( n \), but the given implementation calculates the number of divisors of \( n \) instead. This is fundamentally different from what the problem description asks for.

To illustrate why the program is incorrect, let's consider the following examples:

1. **Example with \( n = 7 \)**:
   - The possible splits of 7 are: \([7]\), \([3, 3, 1]\), \([2, 2, 1, 1, 1]\), \([2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\), \([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\).
   - The corresponding weights are: 1, 2, 3, 7, 7.
   - The distinct weights are: 1, 2, 3, 7.
   - The expected output is 4, but the program would incorrectly output the number of divisors of 7, which is 2 (since 7 is a prime number).

2. **Example with \( n = 8 \)**:
   - The possible splits of 8 are: \([8]\), \([4, 4]\), \([3, 3, 2]\), \([2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1]\), \([5, 2, 1]\), \([4, 3, 1]\), etc.
   - The corresponding weights are: 1, 2, 3, 6, 2, 3, etc.
   - The distinct weights are: 1, 2, 3, 6.
   - The expected output is 4, but the program would incorrectly output the number of divisors of 8, which is 4 (since the divisors are 1, 2, 4, 8).

The program correctly calculates the number of divisors, but this does not align with the problem's requirement to find the number of different weights of splits. Therefore, the program is incorrect and should return "False".
