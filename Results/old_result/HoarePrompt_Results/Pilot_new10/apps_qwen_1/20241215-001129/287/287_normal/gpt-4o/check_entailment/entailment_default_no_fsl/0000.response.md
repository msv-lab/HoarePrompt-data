Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code attempts to calculate the number of divisors of a given number `num`, but it does not correctly solve the problem as described. The problem requires finding the number of different weights of splits of `n`, not the number of divisors.

To illustrate, let's consider the example `n = 7`:

- The valid splits of 7 are: `[7]`, `[3, 3, 1]`, `[2, 2, 2, 1]`, `[2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`.
- The corresponding weights are: `1`, `2`, `3`, `6`.

The code, however, will output `4` because it counts the number of divisors of `7`, which are `1` and `7`. This is incorrect because it does not account for the weights of the splits.

A correct solution would involve generating all possible splits of `n` and calculating their weights, then determining the number of unique weights. The provided code does not achieve this.
