`count` is incremented by 1. The initial state mentions that `count` is increased by 1, which implies `count` was 0 before this operation. After executing `count += 1`, `count` becomes 2. The precondition that `num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 10^9\) and `num` must be at least 9 remains unchanged.

Output State: **`num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 10^9\) and `num` must be at least 9; `count` is 2**
