The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The initial condition specifies that `i` is not equal to `num // i` when `count` is set to 2, and if `num` is divisible by `i` and `i` is not equal to `num // i`, then `count` is increased by 1. However, the code only increments `i` without affecting `num` or `count`. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged in terms of the values of `num` and `count`, but `i` has been incremented.

Output State: **`num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 10^9\) and `num` must be at least 9; `i` is incremented by 1; if `num` is divisible by `i` and `i` is not equal to `num // i`, then `count` is increased by 1; if `i` is equal to `num // i`, then `count` is set to 2.**
