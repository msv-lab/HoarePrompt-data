Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program counts the number of divisors of `num` instead of determining the number of different weights of splits for a given `n`. The output hints also confirm that the function `func_1` returns the total number of divisors of `num`, which does not align with the problem description. The number of different weights of splits for a given `n` is actually `floor(sqrt(n))`, as each integer from `1` to `floor(sqrt(n))` can represent the weight of a split. Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem and should return `False` for the original assessment.
