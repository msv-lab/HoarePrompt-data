Final: **False**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly counts the number of divisors of `num`. However, the problem requires finding the number of different weights of splits for a given `n`, not the number of divisors. The number of different weights of splits for a given `n` is actually the number of integers from `1` to `floor(sqrt(n))`, inclusive. Therefore, the program is not solving the correct problem as per the given problem description. The original assessment was accurate in stating that the program is incorrect.
