The code `res += 2` increments the value of `res` by 2. The initial state of `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\), `res` remains unchanged (but its new value after the increment is `res + 2`), `i` is `i_current + 1`, and `i_next` must be less than `int(n)`. Since `n` is an integer within the specified range, `int(n)` is `n` itself. Therefore, `i_next` must be less than `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\), `res` is `res + 2`, `i` is `i_current + 1`, and `i_next` must be less than `n`.**
