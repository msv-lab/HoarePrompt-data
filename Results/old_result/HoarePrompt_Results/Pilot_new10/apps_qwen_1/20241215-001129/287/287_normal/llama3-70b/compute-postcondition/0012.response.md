The initial state is defined as `n` being an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\), and `res` is set to 1 if `n` is divisible by `i`, and remains -1 otherwise.

The code snippet is `res -= 1`. This operation decrements `res` by 1.

- If `res` was initially 1 (meaning `n` was divisible by `i`), then `res` becomes 0.
- If `res` was initially -1 (meaning `n` was not divisible by `i`), then `res` remains -1.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\); if `n` is divisible by `i`, then `res` is 0, else `res` is -1**.
