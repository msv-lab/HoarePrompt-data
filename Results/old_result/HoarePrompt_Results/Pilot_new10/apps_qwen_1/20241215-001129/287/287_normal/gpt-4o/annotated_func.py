    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables `num`, `count`, and `i` after the loop has executed.
    #
    #### Initial State:
    #- `num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 10^9\).
    #- `count` is 0.
    #- `i` is 1.
    #
    #### Loop Analysis:
    #The loop runs as long as `i * i <= num`. Inside the loop, it checks if `num` is divisible by `i` and increments `count` accordingly. Specifically:
    #- If `num % i == 0`, then `count` is incremented by 1.
    #- If `i` is not equal to `num // i`, then `count` is incremented by 1 again (since both `i` and `num // i` are divisors).
    #
    #### Key Observations:
    #1. **Divisor Counting**: The loop counts the number of divisors of `num`. Each time `i` divides `num` without a remainder, `count` is incremented.
    #2. **Perfect Squares**: If `i` equals `num // i`, it means `num` is a perfect square, and this divisor is counted only once.
    #
    #### Final Iteration:
    #- The loop terminates when `i * i > num`. At this point, `i` is the smallest integer such that `i * i > num`.
    #- This implies that the last value of `i` is the smallest integer greater than \(\sqrt{\text{num}}\).
    #
    #### Final State:
    #- Since the loop terminates when `i * i > num`, `i` will be \(\lceil \sqrt{\text{num}} \rceil\).
    #- `count` will be the total number of divisors of `num`.
    #
    #### Output State:
    #- `num` remains the same as its original value.
    #- `i` is \(\lceil \sqrt{\text{num}} \rceil\).
    #- `count` is the total number of divisors of `num`.
    #
    #Thus, the final output state is:
    #
    #**Output State: `num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 10^9\), `i` is \(\lceil \sqrt{\text{num}} \rceil\), and `count` is the total number of divisors of the original value of `num`.**
    return count
    #`count` is the total number of divisors of the original value of `num`, `i` is \(\lceil \sqrt{\text{num}} \rceil\), and `num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 10^9\)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `num` such that \(1 \leq num \leq 10^9\) and returns the total number of divisors of `num`. Additionally, it sets `i` to \(\lceil \sqrt{\text{num}} \rceil\).
