Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program attempts to count the number of divisors of `num`, but this approach does not correctly solve the problem of finding the number of different weights of splits for a given `n`. 

To correctly solve the problem, we need to determine the number of different weights possible for splits of `n`. The weight of a split is defined as the number of elements that are equal to the first element in the split. For a given `n`, the smallest possible weight is 1 (a split like `[n]`), and the largest possible weight is `sqrt(n)` (considering the maximum number of equal elements starting from the largest possible value).

The program provided does not consider these constraints. For example, for `n = 7`, the expected output is `4` because the possible weights are `1`, `2`, `3`, and `7`. However, the program incorrectly counts the number of divisors of `n`, which does not align with the required solution.

A correct solution would involve understanding that the number of different weights is essentially the number of integers from `1` to `floor(sqrt(n))`, inclusive. This is because each integer in this range can represent the weight of a split, and there are no other possible weights.
