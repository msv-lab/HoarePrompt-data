The code `break` does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `a`, `d`, `c`, `a1`, or `a2`. It simply breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement we were inside, but since no loop or if statement was mentioned, the values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an even number between 2 and 100, `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each element is an integer, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and the corresponding value is the frequency of that element in `a`, `c` is either 0 or 1, `a1` is either -1 or the key `i` from `d` such that `d[i]` is equal to `n // 2`, `a2` is equal to `i`, `d` must have at least one key.**
