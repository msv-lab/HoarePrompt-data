Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to determine if Petya and Vasya can choose two distinct integers to fairly distribute all \( n \) cards. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads the number of cards \( n \) and the integers written on each card. This part correctly handles the input as specified in the problem description.

2. **Frequency Counting**:
   - A dictionary `d` is used to count the frequency of each integer in the list `a`. This ensures that we can efficiently check how many times each number appears.

3. **Fair Distribution Check**:
   - The program iterates through the dictionary `d` to find if there are two distinct integers that each appear exactly \( \frac{n}{2} \) times. If such integers exist, they would allow Petya and Vasya to each take exactly half of the cards.
   - Specifically, the program:
     - Checks if any integer appears exactly \( \frac{n}{2} \) times using the condition `if d[i] == n // 2`.
     - Ensures that these two integers are distinct by setting `a1` and `a2` appropriately and breaking the loop once both integers are found.

4. **Output Determination**:
   - If two such integers are found, the program prints "YES" followed by the two integers.
   - If no such pair exists, the program prints "NO".

### Why the Program Meets the Problem Description:

- **Correct Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of cards and the integers on those cards.
- **Correct Frequency Counting**: The dictionary `d` ensures that the frequency of each integer is accurately tracked.
- **Correct Fairness Check**: The program correctly checks for the existence of two distinct integers each appearing exactly \( \frac{n}{2} \) times, which guarantees a fair distribution of all cards.
- **Correct Output**: The program provides the correct output ("YES" with the chosen integers or "NO") based on the criteria described in the problem.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.
