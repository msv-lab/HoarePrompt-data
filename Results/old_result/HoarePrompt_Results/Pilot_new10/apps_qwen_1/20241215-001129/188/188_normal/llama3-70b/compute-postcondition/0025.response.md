`c` is assigned the value `0`. The value of `n` remains an even number between 2 and 100, the list `a` still contains `n` elements, and the dictionary `d` still maps each element of `a` to its frequency in `a`. Therefore, the only change is that `c` has been initialized to `0`.

Output State: **`n` is an even number between 2 and 100, `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each element is an integer, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and the corresponding value is the frequency of that element in `a`, `c` is 0**
