Functionality: **The function processes a set of integers written on `n` cards, where `n` is an even number and each integer is in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100. It creates a dictionary to count the frequency of each integer in the list. Then, it checks if there are two distinct integers in the list that each appear exactly `n // 2` times. If such integers exist, it prints "YES" followed by the two integers; otherwise, it prints "NO".**
