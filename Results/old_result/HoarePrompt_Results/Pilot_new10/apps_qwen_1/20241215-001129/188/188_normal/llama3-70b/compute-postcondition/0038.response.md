The code `a1 = i` assigns the value of the variable `i` to the variable `a1`. However, the value of `i` is not explicitly defined in the given code snippet. The only constraint provided is that `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and the corresponding value is the frequency of that element in `a`. Given that `n` is an even number between 2 and 100, `n // 2` would be an integer representing half of `n`.

Since the code does not specify what `i` is, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we know that `a1` is now equal to `i`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an even number between 2 and 100, `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each element is an integer, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and the corresponding value is the frequency of that element in `a`, `c` is either 0 or 1, `a1` is equal to `i`, `a2` is either -1 or equal to `i`, `d` must have at least one key.**
