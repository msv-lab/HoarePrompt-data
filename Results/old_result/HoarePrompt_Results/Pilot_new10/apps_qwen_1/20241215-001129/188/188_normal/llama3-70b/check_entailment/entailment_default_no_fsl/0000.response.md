Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the code only checks if there are two distinct integers that each appear exactly `n // 2` times. However, the problem description requires that both players must be able to take all `n` cards, and each player must end up with exactly `n // 2` cards. 

Consider the following example:
- Input:
  ```
  4
  1
  1
  2
  2
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  NO
  ```

- Actual Output:
  ```
  YES
  1 2
  ```

In this case, while the integers 1 and 2 each appear twice, Petya and Vasya cannot take all 4 cards because no single player can take all cards. Petya can take the cards with 1, and Vasya can take the cards with 2, but this does not satisfy the requirement that both players must take exactly `n // 2` cards each. Therefore, the output should be "NO".
