The code `a1 = i` assigns the value of the current key `i` from the dictionary `d` to the variable `a1`. Since `i` is a key from the dictionary `d`, and `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from the list `a` and the corresponding value is the frequency of that element in `a`, the value of `a1` becomes the current key `i`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an even number between 2 and 100, `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each element is an integer, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and the corresponding value is the frequency of that element in `a`, `c` is either 0 or 1, `a1` is equal to the current key `i` from `d`, `a2` is either -1 or equal to `i`, and `d` must have at least one key.**
