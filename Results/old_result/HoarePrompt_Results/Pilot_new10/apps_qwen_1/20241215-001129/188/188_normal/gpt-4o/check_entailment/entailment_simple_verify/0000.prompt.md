You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Petya and Vasya decided to play a game. They have n cards (n is an even number). A single integer is written on each card.

Before the game Petya will choose an integer and after that Vasya will choose another integer (different from the number that Petya chose). During the game each player takes all the cards with number he chose. For example, if Petya chose number 5 before the game he will take all cards on which 5 is written and if Vasya chose number 10 before the game he will take all cards on which 10 is written.

The game is considered fair if Petya and Vasya can take all n cards, and the number of cards each player gets is the same.

Determine whether Petya and Vasya can choose integer numbers before the game so that the game is fair. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) — number of cards. It is guaranteed that n is an even number.

The following n lines contain a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (one integer per line, 1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100) — numbers written on the n cards.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible for Petya and Vasya to choose numbers in such a way that the game will be fair, print "NO" (without quotes) in the first line. In this case you should not print anything more.

In the other case print "YES" (without quotes) in the first line. In the second line print two distinct integers — number that Petya should choose and the number that Vasya should choose to make the game fair. If there are several solutions, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
4
11
27
27
11

Output
YES
11 27

Input
2
6
6

Output
NO

Input
6
10
20
30
20
10
20

Output
NO

Input
6
1
1
2
2
3
3

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example the game will be fair if, for example, Petya chooses number 11, and Vasya chooses number 27. Then the will take all cards — Petya will take cards 1 and 4, and Vasya will take cards 2 and 3. Thus, each of them will take exactly two cards.

In the second example fair game is impossible because the numbers written on the cards are equal, but the numbers that Petya and Vasya should choose should be distinct.

In the third example it is impossible to take all cards. Petya and Vasya can take at most five cards — for example, Petya can choose number 10 and Vasya can choose number 20. But for the game to be fair it is necessary to take 6 cards.
Program:
```
from collections import Counter

def func():
    n = int(input())
    cards = [int(input()) for _ in range(n)]
    count = Counter(cards)
    unique_numbers = sorted(count.keys(), key=lambda x: count[x])
    if len(unique_numbers) < 2:
        print('NO')
    elif count[unique_numbers[-1]] == n // 2 and count[unique_numbers[-2]] == n // 2:
        print('YES')
        print(unique_numbers[-1], unique_numbers[-2])
    else:
        print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly determine whether Petya and Vasya can choose numbers to make the game fair. Specifically, the program checks if the last two unique numbers in the sorted count dictionary appear exactly `n // 2` times each, which is a sufficient condition but not a necessary one for the game to be fair.

Consider the following input:

```
Input:
6
1
1
2
2
3
3

Output:
NO
```

In this case, both 1 and 2 appear three times each, which means it is possible for Petya to choose 1 and Vasya to choose 2, making the game fair. However, the program outputs "NO", indicating it incorrectly determines that the game cannot be fair.

To fix this, the program should check all unique numbers to ensure that no more than one number appears less than `n // 2` times. Here’s a revised version of the program:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    n = int(input())
    cards = [int(input()) for _ in range(n)]
    count = Counter(cards)
    
    # Check if there's any number that appears less than n // 2 times
    if any(count[num] < n // 2 for num in count):
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        # Find any two distinct numbers that appear at least n // 2 times
        for num1 in count:
            for num2 in count:
                if num1 != num2 and count[num1] >= n // 2 and count[num2] >= n // 2:
                    print(num1, num2)
                    return

func()
```

This revised version ensures that the program correctly identifies whether the game can be made fair by checking all possible pairs of numbers that appear at least `n // 2` times.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
from collections import Counter

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an even number of integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), and each of the n lines contains a single integer (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100) representing the number written on each card.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    cards = [int(input()) for _ in range(n)]
    count = Counter(cards)
    unique_numbers = sorted(count.keys(), key=lambda x: count[x])
    if (len(unique_numbers) < 2) :
        print('NO')
    else :
        if (count[unique_numbers[-1]] == n // 2 and count[unique_numbers[-2]] == n // 2) :
            print('YES')
            print(unique_numbers[-1], unique_numbers[-2])
        else :
            print('NO')
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer input, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, `count` is a Counter object with elements from `cards` and their counts, `unique_numbers` is a list of unique numbers from `cards` sorted by their counts in ascending order. The length of `unique_numbers` is at least 2. If the last two elements of `unique_numbers` each occur exactly `n // 2` times, the last two elements of `unique_numbers` are printed. Otherwise, nothing specific is done (the program continues execution in a default state).

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
