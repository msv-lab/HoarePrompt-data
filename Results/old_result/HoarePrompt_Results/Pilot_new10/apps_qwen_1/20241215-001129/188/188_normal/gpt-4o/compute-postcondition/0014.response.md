The function `func` accepts no parameters directly. Instead, it implies that the input is provided through some external means (e.g., a list passed to it or through some other method). The function processes an even number of integers where each integer is within the range of 1 to 100. It does not provide specific details about the output based on the input, so we focus on the input constraints.

Given the constraints, the functionality of the function can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function processes an even number of integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), where each integer (a_{i}) is between 1 and 100, and returns undefined based on the provided input.**
