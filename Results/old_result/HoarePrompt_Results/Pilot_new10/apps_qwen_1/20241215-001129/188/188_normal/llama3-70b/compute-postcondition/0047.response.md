The code `a2 = i` assigns the value of the current key `i` from the dictionary `d` to the variable `a2`. The variable `i` is the current key being iterated over in the loop, and since no specific key is mentioned, `i` retains its current value during this assignment. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an even number between 2 and 100, `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each element is an integer, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and the corresponding value is the frequency of that element in `a`, `c` is either 0 or 1, `a1` is either -1 or the key `i` from `d` such that `d[i]` is equal to `n // 2`, `a2` is equal to the current key `i` from `d`, and `d` must have at least one key.**
