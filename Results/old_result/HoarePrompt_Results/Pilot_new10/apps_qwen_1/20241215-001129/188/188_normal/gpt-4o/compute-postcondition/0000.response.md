The code reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. However, the actual value of `n` is not provided in the initial state, only that it is an even number between 2 and 100. The code does not read the values of the cards or perform any operations on `n` itself. Thus, the only change is that `n` is now an integer input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input**
