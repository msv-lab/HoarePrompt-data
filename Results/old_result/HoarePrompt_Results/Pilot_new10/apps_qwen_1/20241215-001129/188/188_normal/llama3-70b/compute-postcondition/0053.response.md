The code `print('YES')` does not affect any variables or their values. It simply prints the string 'YES' to the console. Therefore, the only change is the printed output, but the variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is an even number between 2 and 100, `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each element is an integer, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and the corresponding value is the frequency of that element in `a`, `c` is either 0, 1, or 2, `a1` is either -1 or the key `i` from `d` such that `d[i]` is equal to `n // 2`, `a2` is either -1 or equal to `i`, and the output is 'YES'.**
