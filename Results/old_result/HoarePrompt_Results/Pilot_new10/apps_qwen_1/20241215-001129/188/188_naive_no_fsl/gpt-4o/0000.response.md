Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program fails to handle a scenario where there are multiple unique numbers but they do not split the cards equally between Petya and Vasya. Specifically, the program checks if the last two unique numbers have exactly half the cards each. However, this is not sufficient to ensure that Petya and Vasya can take all cards equally. 

Consider the following case:

Input:
```
6
1
1
2
2
3
3
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
1 2
```

However, the given program will output:
```
NO
```

This is incorrect because Petya and Vasya can indeed choose the numbers 1 and 2, each taking three cards. Therefore, the program needs to check all possible pairs of unique numbers to ensure they can split the cards equally.
