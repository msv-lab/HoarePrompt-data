Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `func_1(right) == m`.
2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `func_1(right + 1)` must be equal to `m`.
   - `right` is increased by 1.

Given that `right` is increased by 1 in the previous iteration, the new value of `right` is `right + 1`.

For the loop to continue executing, the condition `func_1(right) == m` must hold true. Since `func_1(right + 1)` must be equal to `m` (as stated in the current state), we need to ensure that `func_1(right)` equals `m` in the next iteration.

3. **Adjusting the State**:
   - The function call `func_1(right)` must now be equal to `m`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `func_1(right)` must be equal to `m`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`func_1(right)` must be equal to `m`**
