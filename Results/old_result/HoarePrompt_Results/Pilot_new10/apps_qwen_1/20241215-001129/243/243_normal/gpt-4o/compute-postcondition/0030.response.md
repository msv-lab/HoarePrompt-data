The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the current loop or conditional block. Since there is no loop or conditional block in the given code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `low` is 0; `high` is \(5 \times (m + 1)\); `result` is the list of integers from \(((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2 - k) + 1\) to \(((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2 + (loop_executions - 1)) - 1\); `mid` is \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2\); `zeroes` is `func_1(mid)'`; `left` is \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2 - k\); `right` is \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2 + (loop_executions - 1)\)**
