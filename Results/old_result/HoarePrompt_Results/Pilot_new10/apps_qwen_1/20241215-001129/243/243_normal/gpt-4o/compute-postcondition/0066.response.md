Let's analyze the given state and the condition of the `while` loop step by step.

### Given State:
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\)
- `low` is updated to either `mid + 1` or `mid - 1`
- `high` is updated to `mid - 1` if `zeroes > m`, otherwise it retains its value from the last iteration
- `mid` is now \((low + high) // 2\)
- `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`
- `result` is an empty list
- `left` is equal to `mid`
- `high` retains its value from the last iteration

### Condition of the While Loop:
The loop condition is `func_1(left) == m`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Current State**: 
   - `left` is equal to `mid`.
   - The loop condition is `func_1(left) == m`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `func_1(left)` must be equal to `m`.

3. **State Adjustments**:
   - Since `left` is equal to `mid`, and `mid` is calculated as \((low + high) // 2\), the current state of `low`, `high`, and `mid` should be such that `func_1(left)` equals `m`.
   - The values of `low` and `high` will be updated based on the condition `zeroes > m` in each iteration.
   - The loop will continue until `func_1(left)` no longer equals `m`.

4. **Ensuring the Loop Executes**:
   - We need to ensure that the initial state allows `func_1(left)` to be equal to `m` when the loop starts.
   - Given that `m` is an integer between \(1\) and \(100,000\), we need to set up the initial conditions such that `func_1(mid)` returns `m` when `left` is `mid`.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes at least once, the state must be such that `func_1(mid)` returns `m` when `left` is equal to `mid`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `low` and `high` are initialized in a way that `func_1(mid)` returns `m` when `left` is equal to `mid`, `mid` is \((low + high) // 2\), `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`, `result` is an empty list, `left` is equal to `mid`, `high` retains its value from the last iteration**.
