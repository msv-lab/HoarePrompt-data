Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `m` (where \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\)) from input. It then calculates the largest integer `count` such that \(5^{\text{count}} \leq \frac{n}{m}\). Afterward, it generates a list `ans` containing all integers from 1 up to and including the last valid `n` where \(5^{\text{count}} > \frac{n}{m}\). Finally, it prints the length of `ans` followed by the elements of `ans` separated by spaces. **

This summary covers all the steps and potential cases as described by the code, ensuring that all functionalities are accurately reflected.
