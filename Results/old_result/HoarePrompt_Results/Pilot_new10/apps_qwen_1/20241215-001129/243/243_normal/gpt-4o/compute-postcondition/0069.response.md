The code `left -= 1` decrements the value of `left` by 1. Given the initial conditions, `left` was defined as \((low + high) // 2 - 1\). Since this value is derived from `low` and `high`, and those values remain unchanged, `left` is now one less than its previous value.

The function `func_1(left) == m` still holds true, meaning that when `left` is one less than its previous value, it still returns `m`. Therefore, `m` remains unchanged.

The output state after executing the code is:

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `low` and `high` retain their values from the last iteration; `left` is \((low + high) // 2 - 2\); `func_1(left) == m`**
