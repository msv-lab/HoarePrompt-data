To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition under which the loop continues:

The loop condition is:
```
while func_1(right) == m:
```

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\)
- `low` is 0
- `high` is \(5 \times (m + 1)\)
- `result` is an empty list
- `mid` is \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2\)
- `zeroes` is `func_1(mid)`
- `left` is \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2 - k\)
- `right` is \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2 + 2\)

For the loop to continue executing, the condition `func_1(right) == m` must be true. Therefore, we need to ensure that `func_1(right)` evaluates to `m`.

Given the current state:
- `right` is \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2 + 2\)

We need to adjust the state such that `func_1(right)` still equals `m` when the loop executes again. This means we need to ensure that `func_1(right)` remains `m`.

Since `right` is already defined in terms of `m` and no other state variables directly affect the evaluation of `func_1(right)`, the only state that needs adjustment is ensuring that `func_1(right)` remains `m`.

Therefore, the state adjustment needed is:
- Ensure `func_1(right)` still equals `m` after the loop executes again.

The final answer is:
State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `right` is \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2 + 2\) and `func_1(right)` must still equal `m`**
