Let's analyze the given conditions and the `while` loop statement step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\).
   - `low` must be less than `high`.
   - `left` is \((low + high) // 2\).
   - `mid` is updated to \((low + high) // 2\).
   - `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`.
   - `result` is an empty list.
   - `high` and `right` remain as they are after the last iteration.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   ```python
   while func_1(left) == m:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

To proceed with the first iteration of the loop, we need to ensure that the condition `func_1(left) == m` evaluates to `True`.

Given the information:
- `left` is \((low + high) // 2\).
- `mid` is also \((low + high) // 2\) (which means `left` and `mid` are the same at this point).
- `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`, so `zeroes = func_1(left)`.

For the loop to execute the first time, `func_1(left)` must equal `m`. This means we need to adjust the state so that `func_1(left)` returns `m`.

Therefore, the state right before the loop needs to be adjusted such that:
- `func_1(left)` returns `m`.

The final answer is:
State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `low` must be less than `high`; `left` is \((low + high) // 2\); `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(left)` and must be equal to `m`; `result` is an empty list; `high` and `right` remain as they are after the last iteration.**
