According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `func_1(right) == m`. At the end of the last iteration, `func_1(right)` is not equal to `m`. For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `func_1(right) == m` must be true.

To achieve this, we need to adjust the state such that `func_1(right)` equals `m`.

State: **`right` is incremented by 1 and `func_1(right)` must be equal to `m`**
