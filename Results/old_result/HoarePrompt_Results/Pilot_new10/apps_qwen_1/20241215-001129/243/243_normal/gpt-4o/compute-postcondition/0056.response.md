The code `break` is executed within a loop, which causes the loop to exit. However, the values of the variables `right`, `func_1(right)`, `m`, `low`, `high`, `left`, `zeroes`, and `result` remain unchanged after the `break` statement. The `result` list still contains integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`.

Output State: **`right` is incremented to a value where `func_1(right)` is no longer equal to `m`, `func_1(right)` is not equal to `m`, `low` remains as it was before the loop started, `high` remains as it was before the loop started, `left` remains as it was before the loop started, `zeroes` remains as it was before the loop started, `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
