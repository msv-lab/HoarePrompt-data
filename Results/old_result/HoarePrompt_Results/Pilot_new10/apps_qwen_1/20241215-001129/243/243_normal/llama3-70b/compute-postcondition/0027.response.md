Postcondition: ***`m` is an integer between 1 and 100,000 inclusive, `count` is the largest integer such that \(5^{\text{count}} \leq \frac{1}{m}\) and \(5^{\text{count}+1} > \frac{1}{m}\), `n` is 2, `ans` is `[1]`. If \( \frac{n}{5^{\text{count}}} < m \), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, the state remains unchanged if the condition is not met.***
