`mid` is assigned the value `(low + high) // 2`. This calculation updates the value of `mid` based on the current values of `low` and `high`. The values of `zeroes`, `result`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged from their previous states.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `low` must be less than `high`, `mid` is updated to \((low + high) // 2\), and all other variables (`zeroes`, `result`, `left`, `right`) remain as they are after the last iteration.**
