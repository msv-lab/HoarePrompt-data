Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `func_1(right) == m`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), and `right` is calculated as \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2 + 3\).

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `func_1(right) == m` must be true again.

Given that the loop condition is based on `func_1(right)` and `m`, we need to ensure that `func_1(right)` still returns `m` in the next iteration. Since no information about `func_1` is provided other than its input parameter, we assume that `right` should remain the same for the loop to continue because changing `right` would generally change its value according to the formula provided.

Therefore, we do not need to adjust `m` or `right` based on the given information. The state remains as provided.

**State**: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `right` is \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2 + 3\)**
