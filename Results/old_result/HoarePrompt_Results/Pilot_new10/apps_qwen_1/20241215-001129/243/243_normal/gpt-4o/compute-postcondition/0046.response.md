Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `low` must be less than `high`; `left` is \((low + high) // 2 - k\) where `k` is the number of times the loop has executed; `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(left)` and must be equal to `m`; `result` is an empty list; `high` and `right` remain as they are after the last iteration.**
