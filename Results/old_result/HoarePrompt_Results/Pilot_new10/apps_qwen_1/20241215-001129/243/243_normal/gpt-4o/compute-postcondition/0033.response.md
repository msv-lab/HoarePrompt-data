To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition under which the `while` loop continues:

```python
while low <= high:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

The loop will continue as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`. Let's break down the given information:

- `low` and `high` are updated within the loop based on the condition involving `zeroes` and `m`.
- `zeroes < m` leads to specific updates for `low`, `high`, and `result`.
- `zeroes >= m` leads to a different set of updates.

For the loop to continue to the next iteration, `low` must still be less than or equal to `high` after the current iteration. Therefore, we need to ensure that `low` does not exceed `high` after the adjustments made in the loop.

Let's summarize the relevant parts of the loop body that affect `low` and `high`:

1. **If `zeroes < m`:**
   - `low` is updated to \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2 + 1\)
   - `high` is updated to \(5 \times (m + 1)\)
   - `result` is either an empty list or a list of integers as described.

2. **If `zeroes >= m`:**
   - `result` is either an empty list or a list of integers as described.
   - `left` is updated to \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2 - k\)
   - `right` is updated to \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2 + (loop_executions - 1)\)

In both cases, the key is ensuring that `low` remains less than or equal to `high` for the loop to continue.

Since the problem does not provide the exact values of `low` and `high` after the previous iteration, we need to consider the worst-case scenario where `low` just becomes equal to `high` in the next iteration. This would mean `low` is exactly one less than `high` to ensure the loop can continue.

Therefore, the adjustment needed is to ensure `low` is less than `high`.

**Final State Adjustment:**

State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `low` must be less than `high`, `high` is updated as per the conditions, and all other variables (`zeroes`, `result`, `mid`, `left`, `right`) remain as they are after the last iteration.**

This ensures that the loop can execute one more time by maintaining the condition `low <= high`.
