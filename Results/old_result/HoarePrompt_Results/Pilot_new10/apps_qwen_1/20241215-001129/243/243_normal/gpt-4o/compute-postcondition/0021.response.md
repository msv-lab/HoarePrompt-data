The code snippet assigns `right` the value of `mid + 1`. Given the initial conditions:

- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\)
- `low` is 0
- `high` is \(5 \times (m + 1)\)
- `result` is an empty list
- `mid` is \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2\)
- `zeroes` is `func_1(mid)`
- `left` is \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2 - k\), where `k` is the number of iterations the loop has executed
- `func_1(left)` must not be equal to `m`

The only change made by the code is to assign `right` the value of `mid + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated value of `right` is `mid + 1`.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `low` is 0; `high` is \(5 \times (m + 1)\); `result` is an empty list; `mid` is \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2\); `zeroes` is `func_1(mid)`; `left` is \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2 - k\); `right` is `mid + 1`**
