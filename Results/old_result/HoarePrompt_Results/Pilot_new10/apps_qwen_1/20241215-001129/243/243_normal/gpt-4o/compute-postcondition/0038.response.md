The code initializes an empty list named `result`. This does not affect the values of `m`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `zeroes`, `left`, `right`, or `func_1(mid)`. Therefore, the only change is that `result` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `low` must be less than `high`; `mid` is updated to \((low + high) // 2\); `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`; `result` is an empty list; all other variables (`left`, `right`) remain as they are after the last iteration.**
