Postcondition: ***`m` is an integer between 1 and 100,000 inclusive, `count` remains 0, and `n` is 1. If `n // 5 ** count` is greater than or equal to `m`, then the condition is already met and no changes are made. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains as the same as the if part.***
