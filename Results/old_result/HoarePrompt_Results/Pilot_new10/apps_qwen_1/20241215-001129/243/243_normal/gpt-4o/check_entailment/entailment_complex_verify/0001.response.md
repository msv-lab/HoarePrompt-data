Final: **False**

Reason: Based on the annotated version of the code, the program appears to correctly implement a binary search to find the range of integers \( n \) such that \( n! \) ends with exactly \( m \) trailing zeroes. The function `func_1` accurately calculates the number of trailing zeroes in \( n! \) by summing up the integer divisions of \( n \) by increasing powers of 5. The binary search in `func_2` efficiently narrows down the range of \( n \) values that meet the condition. 

However, the original assessment correctly pointed out that for very large values of \( m \) (close to the upper limit of 100,000), the difference between consecutive \( n \) values that have exactly \( m \) trailing zeroes can be quite large. While the binary search should theoretically work for finding the range, there could be edge cases where the binary search might not accurately pinpoint the exact range due to the large gap between valid \( n \) values. The annotated version does not explicitly address this potential issue, and thus, the original assessment about the potential failure in handling such large \( m \) values remains valid. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is not fully correct as stated.
