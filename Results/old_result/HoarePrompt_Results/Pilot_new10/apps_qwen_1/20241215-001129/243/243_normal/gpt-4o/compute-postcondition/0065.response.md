The code updates the variable `left` to be equal to `mid`. Other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. Therefore, the value of `left` is now `mid`, and the other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `low` is updated to either `mid + 1` or `mid - 1`, `high` is updated to `mid - 1` if `zeroes > m`, `mid` is now \((low + high) // 2\), `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`, `result` is an empty list, `left` is equal to `mid`, `high` retains its value from the last iteration.**
