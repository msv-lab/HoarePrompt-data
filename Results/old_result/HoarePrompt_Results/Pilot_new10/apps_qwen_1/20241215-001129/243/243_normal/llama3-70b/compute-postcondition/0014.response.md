Postcondition: ***`m` is an integer between 1 and 100,000 inclusive, `count` remains 0, and `n` is 1. If `n // 5 ** count` is greater than or equal to `m`, we break out of the most internal loop or match statement. Since there is no else part, the condition `n // 5 ** count >= m` must hold true for the postcondition.***
