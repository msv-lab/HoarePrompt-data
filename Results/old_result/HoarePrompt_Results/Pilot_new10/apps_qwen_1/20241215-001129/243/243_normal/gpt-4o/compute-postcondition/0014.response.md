Let's analyze the given loop and the initial state step by step.

The loop condition is:
```python
while func_1(left) == m:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

The current state before the loop is:
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\)
- `low` is 0
- `high` is \(5 \times (m + 1)\)
- `result` is an empty list
- `mid` is \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2\)
- `zeroes` is `func_1(mid)`
- `left` is \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2`

For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `func_1(left) == m` must hold true. Let's examine the values of the relevant variables:

1. `left` is defined as \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2\).
2. The function `func_1(left)` returns some value, and this value should be equal to `m`.

Since `left` is defined as \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2\), we can calculate `left` explicitly:
\[ \text{left} = \frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2} \]

Given that `func_1(left)` should be equal to `m`, we need to ensure that:
\[ \text{func_1}\left(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2}\right) = m \]

This means that the initial value of `left` must satisfy the condition `func_1(left) == m`. Since `left` is already calculated based on `m`, the only thing we need to ensure is that `func_1(left)` returns `m` when evaluated.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed in the given state because the condition `func_1(left) == m` is already satisfied by the initial values provided.

State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `low` is 0, `high` is \(5 \times (m + 1)\), `result` is an empty list, `mid` is \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2\), `zeroes` is `func_1(mid)`, `left` is \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2\)**
