To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute at least once, let's analyze the given conditions:

- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\).
- `low` is 0.
- `high` is \(5 \times (m + 1)\).
- The loop condition is `while low <= high`.

For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `low <= high` must be true at the start of the loop.

Given:
- `low` is explicitly stated as 0.
- `high` is \(5 \times (m + 1)\).

We need to ensure that \(0 \leq 5 \times (m + 1)\). Since \(m\) is an integer between 1 and 100,000, the smallest possible value of \(m\) is 1. Let's check the smallest and largest values of `high`:

- When \(m = 1\), \(high = 5 \times (1 + 1) = 10\).
- When \(m = 100,000\), \(high = 5 \times (100,000 + 1) = 500,005\).

In both cases, \(low = 0\) is always less than or equal to \(high\), ensuring that the loop condition `low <= high` is satisfied.

Since `low` is fixed at 0 and `high` is calculated based on `m`, and the loop condition `low <= high` is inherently satisfied for all valid values of `m` within the given range, no adjustments are necessary to ensure the loop executes at least once.

Therefore, the states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 100,000; `low` is 0; `high` is 5 * (m + 1); `result` is an empty list**
