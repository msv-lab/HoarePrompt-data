The code snippet updates the variable `right` to be `mid + 1`. From the initial state, we know that `left` is \((low + high) // 2 - k\), where `k` is the number of iterations the loop executed. However, the exact values of `low`, `high`, and `k` are not specified, so they remain unchanged. The value of `mid` would be \((low + high) // 2\), and now `right` is set to `mid + 1`.

The Output State is: `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `low` and `high` retain their values from the last iteration; `left` is \((low + high) // 2 - k\); `func_1(left) == m`; `right` is \((low + high) // 2 + 1\).

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `low` and `high` retain their values from the last iteration; `left` is \((low + high) // 2 - k\); `func_1(left) == m`; `right` is \((low + high) // 2 + 1\)**
