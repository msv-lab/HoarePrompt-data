The code snippet `right += 1` increments the value of `right` by 1. According to the initial state, `right` is equal to `mid + 1`. Since `mid` is defined as `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`, `right` initially is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2 + 1`.

After executing `right += 1`, the new value of `right` will be `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2 + 2`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `low` is 0; `high` is \(5 \times (m + 1)\); `result` is an empty list; `mid` is \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2\); `zeroes` is `func_1(mid)'; `left` is \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2 - k\); `right` is \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2 + 2\)**
