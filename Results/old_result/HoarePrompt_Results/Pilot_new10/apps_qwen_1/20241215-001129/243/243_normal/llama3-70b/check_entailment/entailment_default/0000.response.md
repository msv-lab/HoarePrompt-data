Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the solution for finding the number of positive integers \( n \) such that the factorial of \( n \) ends with exactly \( m \) zeroes. The logic for determining the number of trailing zeroes in \( n! \) is flawed. Specifically:

1. The first while loop calculates `count` as the largest integer such that \( 5^{\text{count}} \leq \frac{n}{m} \). This is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the number of factors of 5 in \( n! \), which determines the number of trailing zeroes.

2. The second while loop generates a list of integers `ans` where each integer \( n \) satisfies \( 5^{\text{count}} > \frac{n}{m} \). This logic also does not accurately reflect the requirement for trailing zeroes in factorials.

To correctly solve this problem, you would need to use the formula for counting the number of factors of 5 in \( n! \):

\[ z(n) = \left\lfloor \frac{n}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{25} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{125} \right\rfloor + \cdots \]

You need to find the range of \( n \) such that \( z(n) = m \). This involves calculating the smallest and largest \( n \) for which the number of trailing zeroes equals \( m \).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def count_trailing_zeroes(n):
    count = 0
    power_of_5 = 5
    while n >= power_of_5:
        count += n // power_of_5
        power_of_5 *= 5
    return count

def func():
    m = int(input())
    lower_bound = m * 5
    upper_bound = (m + 1) * 5 - 1

    # Find the smallest n such that the number of trailing zeroes is at least m
    n = lower_bound
    while count_trailing_zeroes(n) < m:
        n += 1
    
    # Find the largest n such that the number of trailing zeroes is exactly m
    n_max = n
    while count_trailing_zeroes(n_max) <= m:
        n_max += 1
    n_max -= 1

    # Count the number of valid n
    count = n_max - n + 1

    print(count)
    print(*range(n, n_max + 1))

func()
```

This corrected version correctly calculates the number of trailing zeroes in \( n! \) and finds the range of \( n \) such that the factorial ends with exactly \( m \) zeroes.
