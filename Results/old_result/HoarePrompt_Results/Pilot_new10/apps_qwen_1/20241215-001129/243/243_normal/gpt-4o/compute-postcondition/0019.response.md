The code `left -= 1` decrements the value of `left` by 1. According to the initial state, `left` is \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2 - 2\). After decrementing, the new value of `left` will be \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2 - 3\).

All other variables remain unchanged as per the precondition.

Output State: **`m` remains the same, `low` remains 0, `high` remains \(5 \times (m + 1)\), `result` remains an empty list, `mid` remains \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2\), `zeroes` remains `func_1(mid)`, `left` is now \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2 - 3\), and `func_1(left)` is different from `m`.**
