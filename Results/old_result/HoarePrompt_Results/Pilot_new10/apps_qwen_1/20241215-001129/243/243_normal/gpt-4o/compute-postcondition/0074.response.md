Let's analyze the given `while` loop and the conditions under which it will execute.

The `while` loop condition is:
```python
while func_1(right) == m:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Given the state right before the loop:
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\).
- `low` and `high` retain their values from the last iteration.
- `left` is \((low + high) // 2 - k\).
- `func_1(left) == m`.
- `right` is \((low + high) // 2 + 1\).

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `func_1(right) == m` must be true. Let's examine the current values:

1. **Initial Condition Analysis:**
   - `left = (low + high) // 2 - k`.
   - `right = (low + high) // 2 + 1`.
   - Given that `func_1(left) == m`, we know the function returns `m` at `left`.

2. **Loop Condition Check:**
   - The loop continues as long as `func_1(right) == m`.
   - For `func_1(right)` to be equal to `m`, `right` must map to `m` in the function `func_1`.

Since `func_1(left) == m` and `right` is defined as `low + high // 2 + 1`, the only way for `func_1(right) == m` to hold true is if `right` is a valid input that maps to `m` in the function `func_1`.

Therefore, no adjustments are necessary to the given states because the loop condition `func_1(right) == m` can be satisfied with the provided values of `left` and `right`.

**State:**
State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `low` and `high` retain their values from the last iteration; `left` is \((low + high) // 2 - k\); `func_1(left) == m`; `right` is \((low + high) // 2 + 1\)**
