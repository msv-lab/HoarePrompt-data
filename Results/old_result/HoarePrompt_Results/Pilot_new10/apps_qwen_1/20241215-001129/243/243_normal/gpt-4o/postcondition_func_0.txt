The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the count of trailing zeroes in \( n! \) by calculating the sum of \( n // 5 \), \( n // 25 \), \( n // 125 \), ..., where each term is \( n \) divided by increasing powers of 5 until \( n \) is less than the next power of 5. This calculation accurately determines the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `n`.
