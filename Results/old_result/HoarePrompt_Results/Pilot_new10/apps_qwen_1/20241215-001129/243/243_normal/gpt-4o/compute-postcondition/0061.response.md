The code snippet `zeroes = func_1(mid)` assigns the value returned by `func_1(mid)` to the variable `zeroes`. The previous values of the other variables (`m`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `result`, `left`, and `high`) remain unchanged.

The output state will include the updated value of `zeroes` and the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `low` is updated to either `mid + 1` or `mid - 1`, `high` is updated to `mid - 1` if `zeroes > m`, `mid` is now \((low + high) // 2\), `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`, `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1` in the else part, and `left` and `high` retain their values from the last iteration.**
