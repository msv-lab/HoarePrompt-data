`low` is assigned the value of `mid + 1`. The previous values of `high`, `mid`, `zeroes`, `result`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is:

- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\)
- `low` is updated to `mid + 1`
- `high` remains the same
- `mid` remains the same (it was previously \((low + high) // 2\))
- `zeroes` remains the same (it was the value returned by `func_1(mid)`)

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `low` is `mid + 1`; `high` remains the same; `mid` remains the same; `zeroes` remains the same; `result`, `left`, and `right` remain as they are after the last iteration.**
