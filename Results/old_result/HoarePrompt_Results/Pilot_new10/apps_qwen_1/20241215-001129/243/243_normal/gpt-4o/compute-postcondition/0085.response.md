Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\). `low` and `high` are updated until `low` exceeds `high`. `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1` where `left` and `right` are determined based on the conditions within the loop. If `zeroes < m`, then `low` is updated to `mid + 1` or `mid - 1` and `high` remains `5 \times (m + 1)`. If `zeroes > m`, then `low` remains unchanged and `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. If `zeroes == m`, then `left` is found by decrementing from `mid` until `func_1(left) != m` and `right` is found by incrementing from `mid + 1` until `func_1(right) != m`. Finally, `result` is set to the range of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`.**

This final state indicates that the loop continues to narrow down the range between `low` and `high` based on the comparison with `zeroes` and `m`. Once the correct range is found where `zeroes == m`, the loop terminates and `result` is populated with the integers that satisfy this condition.
