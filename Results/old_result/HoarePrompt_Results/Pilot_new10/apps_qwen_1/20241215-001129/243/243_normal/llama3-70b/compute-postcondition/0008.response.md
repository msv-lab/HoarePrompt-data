State: **`m` is an integer between 1 and 100,000 inclusive, `count` is 0, `n` is 1**

Explanation:
- The loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will continue to execute indefinitely as long as no break statement is encountered.
- Since the loop condition is always true, no adjustments are needed to any of the variables (`m`, `count`, or `n`) to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

Therefore, the state remains the same as given in the previous iteration.
