Let's analyze the given state and the while loop condition step by step.

### Given Information
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\).
- `low` must be less than `high`.
- `left` is calculated as \((low + high) // 2 - 1\).
- `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(left)` and must be equal to `m`.
- `result` is an empty list.
- `high` and `right` remain as they are after the last iteration.

### While Loop Condition
The loop continues as long as `func_1(left) == m`.

### Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `m` is an integer within the specified range.
- `low` is less than `high`.
- `left` is \((low + high) // 2 - 1\).
- `zeroes` equals `m`.
- `result` is still an empty list.
- `high` and `right` are unchanged from the previous iteration.

### Step-by-Step Analysis
To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that the condition `func_1(left) == m` remains true or becomes true after the adjustment.

1. **Condition Analysis**: The loop condition is `func_1(left) == m`. Since `zeroes` is already equal to `m`, `func_1(left)` must return `m` for the loop to continue.

2. **Variable `left`**: The value of `left` is \((low + high) // 2 - 1\). For the loop to continue, `left` should be such that `func_1(left)` returns `m`.

3. **Adjustments Needed**: 
   - `low` and `high` must be adjusted to ensure that `left` is correctly recalculated in the next iteration and that `func_1(left)` still returns `m`.

Given that `low` must be less than `high` and the loop condition is based on the function `func_1`, we need to ensure that the new `left` value still satisfies `func_1(left) == m`.

### Conclusion
Since `zeroes` is already equal to `m`, no further adjustments to `m` or `zeroes` are needed. The key is to ensure that `low` and `high` are set such that `left` remains valid and `func_1(left)` continues to return `m`.

Thus, the state at the end of the current iteration needs to be adjusted to maintain the loop condition.

### Final Answer
State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `low` must be less than `high`, `left` is \((low + high) // 2 - 1\), `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(left)` and must be equal to `m`, `result` is an empty list, and `high` and `right` remain as they are after the last iteration.**
