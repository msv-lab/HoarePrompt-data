Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `b` is either `b + a[2]` or `b + 0`, `c` is either `c + a[2]` or `2 * a[1] + a[2]`, `i` is 3.***

Explanation:
- If `i % 2 == 0`, then `b` is updated to `b + a[2]` and `i` is set to 3. Also, `c` remains as either `a[1]` or `2 * a[1]`.
- If `i % 2 != 0`, then `b` remains as either `b + a[1]` or 0, `c` is updated to `c + a[2]`, and `i` is set to 2.
- Combining both cases, we can conclude that `b` is updated to either `b + a[2]` or `b + 0` depending on whether `i` is even or odd, and `c` is updated to either `c + a[2]` or `2 * a[1] + a[2]`. `i` is set to 3 when `i` is even and remains 2 when `i` is odd.
