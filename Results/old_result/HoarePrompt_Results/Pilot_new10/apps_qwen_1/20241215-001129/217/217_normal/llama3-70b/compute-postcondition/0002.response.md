The code sorts the list `a` in descending order. This means that the list `a` will be rearranged such that its elements are sorted from the largest to the smallest. The length of the list `a` remains unchanged, and the initial values of the elements in the list are preserved but reordered.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 100\)
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is an integer satisfying -100 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100

After executing `a.sort(reverse=True)`, the list `a` will be sorted in descending order, but the specific values of the elements in `a` depend on the input provided by the user. Since the exact values are not given, we can only say that the list is sorted in descending order.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 100\); `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order.**
