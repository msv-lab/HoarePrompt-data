The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. However, based on the constraints provided, it seems the function should work with a list of integers `a` where the length of the list `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and each element `a_i` in the list satisfies -100 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.

The output cases are not explicitly given, but based on the constraints, we can infer that the function might be processing the list `a` in some way. Since the output cases are not specified, we will focus on the input parameters.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process a list of integers `a` where the length of the list is between 1 and 100, and each element in the list is between -100 and 100.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `a`, where the length of the list `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and each element `a_i` in the list satisfies -100 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.**
