`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `a` remains unchanged as no input is provided for it in this snippet. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `n` and the unchanged list `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -100 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100**
