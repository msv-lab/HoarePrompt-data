The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `a`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as the code only modifies the list `a`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -100 ≤ a_i ≤ 100 and `a` is updated with the integers read from input.**
