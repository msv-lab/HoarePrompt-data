The code prints the value of `b - c`. Since `b` is the sum of elements at even indices and `c` is the sum of elements at odd indices of the list `a`, the printed value is `b - c`. However, the actual values of `b` and `c` depend on the specific values in the list `a`, which are not provided. The only information given is that `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, where `1 <= n <= 100`.

Since no specific values are provided for the elements of `a`, the exact value of `b - c` cannot be determined. The output of the print statement will vary depending on the content of `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `b` is the sum of elements at even indices of `a`, `c` is the sum of elements at odd indices of `a`, and the value of `b - c` is printed.**
