Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem. It calculates the sum of positive integers (`B`) and the sum of negative integers (`C`) in the given list, and then computes the difference `B - C`. This approach ensures that the maximum possible value of `B - C` is obtained by partitioning the sequence into two subsets such that the sum of the first subset minus the sum of the second subset is maximized.

The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. It works for any list size `n` within the specified range and for any integer values within the range `[-100, 100]`. The logic is sound and does not miss any edge cases, making the program correct according to the problem description.
