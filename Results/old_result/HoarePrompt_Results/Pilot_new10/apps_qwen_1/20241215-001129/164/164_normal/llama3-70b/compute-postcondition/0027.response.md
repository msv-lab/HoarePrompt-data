Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1` inclusive, `s` is a string input from the user, `g` is the index of the first occurrence of 'G' in `s` if such an occurrence exists; otherwise, `g` is -1, `t` is the index of the first occurrence of 'T' in `s` if such an occurrence exists; otherwise, `t` remains -1, `g` is not -1, and `t` is not -1, `abs(t - g) % k != 0` or there exists an integer `i` in the range `0` to `abs(t - g) // k` such that `s[(g + i * k) % n] == '#'`**
