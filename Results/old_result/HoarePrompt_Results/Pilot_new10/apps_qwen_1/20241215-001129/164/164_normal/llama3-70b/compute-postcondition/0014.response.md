Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1` inclusive, `s` is a string input from the user, `g` is the index `i` of the first occurrence of 'G' in `s` if such an occurrence exists; otherwise, `g` is -1, `t` remains the value it had at the previous iteration (which is either the index of the first occurrence of 'T' or -1), `i` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1 and must be less than `n`. If `s[i] == 'T'`, then `t` is updated to `i`. Otherwise, `t` remains unchanged.***
