Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1`, `string` is a sequence of length `n` containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', `line` is the input string, `reachable` is `False`, `G_pos` and `T_pos` are valid indices within the string, and the range `G_pos` to `T_pos + 1` with step `k` contains at least one element. If `line[pos]` is '#', then the condition remains as is; otherwise, no change to the variables, and the current value of `pos` is equal to `T_pos`***
