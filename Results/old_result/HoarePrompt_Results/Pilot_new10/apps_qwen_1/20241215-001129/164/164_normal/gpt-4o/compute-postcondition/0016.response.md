Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `n` is an integer between 2 and 100.
   - `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1`.
   - `string` is a sequence of length `n` containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T'.
   - `line` is the input string.
   - `reachable` is `True` if `pos` equals `T_pos`.
   - `G_pos` and `T_pos` are valid indices within the string.
   - The range from `G_pos` to `T_pos + 1` with step `k` contains at least one element.
   - If `line[pos]` is '#', the condition remains as is; otherwise, no change to the variables.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs over the range `range(G_pos, T_pos + 1, k)`.
   - For each iteration, `pos` takes values starting from `G_pos` up to `T_pos + 1` with a step size of `k`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - Let's assume `pos` was at some value `p` in the previous iteration (where `p` is within the range `[G_pos, T_pos]` and incremented by `k`).

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - In the next iteration, `pos` will be incremented by `k` from its current value.
   - Therefore, `pos` will be set to `p + k` (assuming `p + k` is still within the range `[G_pos, T_pos + 1]`).

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - `n` remains the same since it does not change within the loop.
   - `k` remains the same since it does not change within the loop.
   - `string` remains the same since it does not change within the loop.
   - `line` remains the same since it does not change within the loop.
   - `reachable` remains `True` if `pos` equals `T_pos` after incrementing `pos` by `k`.
   - `G_pos` and `T_pos` remain the same since they do not change within the loop.

6. **Final State After Next Iteration**:
   - `pos` will be `p + k`, where `p` is the value of `pos` at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `reachable` will be `True` if `pos + k` equals `T_pos`.

Given these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `pos` will be updated to `pos + k`.
- `reachable` will be checked if `(pos + k) == T_pos`.

Thus, the final state should be:

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100; `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1`; `string` is a sequence of length `n` containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T'; `line` is the input string; `reachable` is `True` if `(pos + k)` equals `T_pos`; `G_pos` and `T_pos` are valid indices within the string; the range from `G_pos` to `T_pos + 1` with step `k` contains at least one element; if `line[pos]` is '#', the condition remains as is; otherwise, no change to the variables.**

In a concise form:
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1`, `string` is a sequence of length `n` containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', `line` is the input string, `reachable` is `True` if `(pos + k)` equals `T_pos`, `G_pos` and `T_pos` are valid indices within the string, the range from `G_pos` to `T_pos + 1` with step `k` contains at least one element, if `line[pos]` is '#', the condition remains as is, otherwise no change to the variables.**
