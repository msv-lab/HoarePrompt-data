The first line of the input contains two integers n and k, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1. The second line contains a string of length n consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where '.' represents an empty cell, '#' represents a cell with an obstacle, 'G' represents the grasshopper's starting position, and 'T' represents the insect's position. It is guaranteed that the characters 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once in the string.
