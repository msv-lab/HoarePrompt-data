`t` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `i` changes to `i+1` at the end of the previous iteration, but since the code only assigns the current value of `i` to `t`, `t` will retain the value of `i` from the previous iteration. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1` inclusive, `s` is a string input from the user, `g` is the index `i` of the first occurrence of 'G' in `s` if such an occurrence exists; otherwise, `g` is -1, `t` is the value of `i` from the previous iteration, `i` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1 and must be less than `n`**
