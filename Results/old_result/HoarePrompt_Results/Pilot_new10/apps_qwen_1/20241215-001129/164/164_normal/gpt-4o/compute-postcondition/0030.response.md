The code `print('YES')` prints the string 'YES' to the console. However, this operation does not change the values of the existing variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1`, `string` is a sequence of length `n` containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', `line` is the input string, `reachable` is `True` if `pos` reaches `T_pos` without encountering `'#'`; otherwise, `reachable` is `False`, `G_pos` and `T_pos` are valid indices within the string, the range from `G_pos` to `T_pos + 1` with step `k` is checked during the loop, and if `line[pos]` is `'#'` at any point, the loop breaks, and the value of `reachable` is `True`, print statement outputs 'YES'**
