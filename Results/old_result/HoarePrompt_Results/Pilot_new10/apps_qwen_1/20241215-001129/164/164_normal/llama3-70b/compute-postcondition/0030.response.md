Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1` inclusive, `s` is a string input from the user, `g` is the index of the first occurrence of 'G' in `s` if such an occurrence exists; otherwise, `g` is -1, `t` is the index of the first occurrence of 'T' in `s` if such an occurrence exists; otherwise, `t` remains -1, and 'NO' is printed to the console if either `g` or `t` is -1. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed to the console if the absolute difference between `t` and `g` modulo `k` is 0 and for all indices `i` from 0 to the absolute difference between `t` and `g` divided by `k`, the character at index `(g + i * k) % n` in `s` is not '#'. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed to the console.***
