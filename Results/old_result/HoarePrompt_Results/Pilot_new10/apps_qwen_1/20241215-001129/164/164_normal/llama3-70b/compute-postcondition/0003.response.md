According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1. Given that `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, the loop will definitely execute as long as `n` is within this range. However, we need to ensure all initial states are correctly reflected.

Here are the key points to consider:
- `n` must be within the range [2, 100] to ensure the loop can execute.
- `k` must be within the range [1, n-1] as per its definition.
- `s` is a string input from the user, so no adjustment is needed regarding its value for the loop to execute.
- `g` is initially set to -1, so no adjustment is needed.
- `t` is initially set to -1, so no adjustment is needed.

Given these considerations, the only necessary adjustments are to ensure `n` is within the specified range and `k` is within the range [1, n-1].

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1` inclusive, `s` is a string input from the user, `g` is -1, `t` is -1**
