The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the loop or block it is inside. Since there is no loop or block specified in the given code, the values of the variables remain unchanged after the `break` statement is executed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1`, `string` is a sequence of length `n` containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', `line` is the input string, `reachable` is `True` if `(pos + k)` equals `T_pos`, `G_pos` is a valid index within the string, `T_pos` is a valid index within the string, the range from `G_pos` to `T_pos + 1` with step `k` contains at least one element, if `line[pos]` is '#', the condition remains as is, otherwise no change to the variables. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
