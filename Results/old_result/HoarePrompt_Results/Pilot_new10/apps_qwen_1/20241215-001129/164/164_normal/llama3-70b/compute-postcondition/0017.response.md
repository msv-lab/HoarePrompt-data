The code assigns the value of `i` to `g`. Before the assignment, `g` is the index of the first occurrence of 'G' in `s`, or -1 if 'G' does not exist in `s`. After the assignment, `g` will now hold the value of `i`, which was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1. 

Therefore, the updated state is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1` inclusive, `s` is a string input from the user, `g` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, `t` is the index `i` of the first occurrence of 'T' in `s` if such an occurrence exists; otherwise, `t` remains -1, `i` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1` inclusive, `s` is a string input from the user, `g` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, `t` is the index `i` of the first occurrence of 'T' in `s` if such an occurrence exists; otherwise, `t` remains -1, `i` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 2**.
