The code snippet updates the `max_beauty` variable by taking the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`. This means that `max_beauty` is updated to be the larger of its current value and `curr_beauty`.

- `n` is an integer input by the user within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `s` is a string consisting of `n` characters, each being either 'G' or 'S'.
- `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' in `s`.
- `max_beauty` is the maximum beauty found during the traversal of `s`.
- `curr_beauty` is the beauty at the last position `right` where `s[right]` is 'G' or 0.
- `left` is the index of the last 'G' character in `s` or `n` if no 'G' characters are present.

After executing the line `max_beauty = max(max_beauty, curr_beauty)`, the value of `max_beauty` is updated to ensure it is the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `s` is a string consisting of `n` characters, each being either 'G' or 'S'; `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' in `s`; `max_beauty` is the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`; `curr_beauty` is the beauty at the last position `right` where `s[right]` is 'G' or 0; `left` is the index of the last 'G' character in `s` or `n` if no 'G' characters are present.**
