Postcondition: **`segments` is either `[('2', 'i - 1'), ('2', 'i - 1'), (start, i - 1)]` or `[('None', 'i - 1'), (start, i - 1)]`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `i` is the index of the first 'S' in `trophies` or `n` if there are no 'G's left, and `start` is the final value of `i` before the increment, unless `trophies[i]` is not 'G', in which case `i` is incremented by 1.**
