Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` must be at least 2, `j` is `n` if the condition `s[i] == 'G' and s[i + 1] == 'S'` does not hold, otherwise `j` is the first index `k` such that `s[k] != 'G'` or `n` if no such index exists. `beauty` is the number of consecutive 'G's from `s[0]` to `s[n-1]` if the condition does not hold, otherwise the count of 'G's from `s[0]` to the last 'G' before `s[j]`. `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum value between `max_beauty_one_swap` and `beauty`.***
