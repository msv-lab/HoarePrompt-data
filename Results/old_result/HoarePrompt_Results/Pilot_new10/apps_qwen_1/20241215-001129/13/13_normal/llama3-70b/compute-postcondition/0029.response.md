Let's break down the problem step-by-step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Initial States:
- `n` is an integer input by the user within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- `s` is a string consisting of `n` characters, each being either 'G' or 'S'
- `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' in `s`
- `max_beauty` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`
- `left` is the previous value of `left` + 1
- `right` is `n - 1`
- `curr_beauty` is 0
- `s[left]` must not be 'G'

### Loop Condition:
The loop condition is `while left < right and s[left] != 'G':`

### Analysis:
- The loop continues as long as `left < right` and `s[left] != 'G'`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `s[left]` must not be 'G'.
- For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions need to hold true:
  1. `left < right`
  2. `s[left] != 'G'`

### Required Adjustments:
- To ensure `left < right` holds true for the next iteration, `left` should be less than `right`.
- To ensure `s[left] != 'G'` holds true for the next iteration, `s[left]` should not be 'G'.

Since we don't know the exact values of `left` and `s[left]` from the given information, but we know they need to satisfy the conditions for the next iteration, we need to adjust these states accordingly.

### State Adjustment:
- We need to ensure that `left < right` and `s[left] != 'G'` for the next iteration.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` is an integer input by the user within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a string consisting of `n` characters, each being either 'G' or 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`, `left` is such that `left < right` and `s[left] != 'G'`, `right` is `n - 1`, `curr_beauty` is 0, and `s[left]` must not be 'G'**

This ensures that the loop condition `left < right and s[left] != 'G'` is satisfied for the next iteration.
