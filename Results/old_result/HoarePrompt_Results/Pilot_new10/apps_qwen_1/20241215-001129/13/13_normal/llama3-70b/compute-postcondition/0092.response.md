`beauty` is assigned the value `1`. The value of `i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `j` is determined based on the condition `s[1] == 'G' and s[2] == 'S'`, and `beauty` is recalculated based on the new value of `i`, and `max_beauty_one_swap` is updated if necessary. Since `beauty` is explicitly set to `1`, the only change is in the value of `beauty`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `j` is determined based on the condition `s[1] == 'G' and s[2] == 'S'`, `beauty` is 1, and `max_beauty_one_swap` is updated if necessary.**
