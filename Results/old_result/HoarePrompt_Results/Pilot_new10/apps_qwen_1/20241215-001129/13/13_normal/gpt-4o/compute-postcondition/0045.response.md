Postcondition: **`segments` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a segment of consecutive 'G's in `trophies`, starting from the first 'G' found and ending just before the next 'S' or the end of the string, `i` is `n`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), and `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'. The list `segments` is not empty**
