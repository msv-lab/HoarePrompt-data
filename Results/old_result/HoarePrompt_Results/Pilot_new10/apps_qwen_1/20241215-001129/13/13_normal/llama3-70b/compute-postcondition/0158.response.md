Postcondition: ***`i`, `n`, `j`, `beauty`, and `max_beauty_one_swap` are as follows: `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `j` is `n`, `beauty` is the number of 'G' characters in the substring `s[j:j+1]` where `j` is the largest index such that `s[j] == 'G'` and `j >= i + 2`, or `beauty` is 0 if no such `j` exists; `max_beauty_one_swap` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `beauty`.***
