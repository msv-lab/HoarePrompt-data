The code initializes the variable `max_beauty_one_swap` to 0. This assignment does not affect any other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is the initialization of `max_beauty_one_swap`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `s` is a string consisting of `n` characters, each being either 'G' or 'S'; `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' in `s`; `max_beauty` is the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`; `curr_beauty` is the beauty at the last position `right` where `s[right]` is 'G' or 0; `left` is the index of the last 'G' character in `s` or `n` if no 'G' characters are present; `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0.**
