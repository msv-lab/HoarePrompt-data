The code assigns the start and end values of the third segment (which are stored in `segments[i - 1]`) to `prev_start` and `prev_end`, respectively. Since `i` is 3, `segments[i - 1]` corresponds to `segments[2]`. Therefore, `prev_start` and `prev_end` take on the values of `segments[2][0]` and `segments[2][1]`, respectively. The values of the other variables (`curr_start` and `curr_end`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `prev_start` is the start value of the third segment, `prev_end` is the end value of the third segment, `curr_start` is the start value of the fourth segment, `curr_end` is the end value of the fourth segment, `prev_start` is equal to `segments[2][0]`, `prev_end` is equal to `segments[2][1]`**
