The code snippet updates the variable `max_beauty` to be the maximum value between its current value (`max_beauty`) and the current beauty (`curr_beauty`). This does not change the values of other variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except that `max_beauty` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a string consisting of `n` characters, each being either 'G' or 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is unchanged, `left` is unchanged, `right` is a value such that `right < n` and `s[right]` is not 'G', `right` has incremented by 1 on each iteration since the start of the loop**.
