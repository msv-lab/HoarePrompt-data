The code `break` does not assign any new values to variables or change their states; it only breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no loop or if statement in the current context, the only effect is that the execution would exit the current block. However, since no new values are assigned, the variables retain their previous states.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is at least 4, `j` is 6 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
