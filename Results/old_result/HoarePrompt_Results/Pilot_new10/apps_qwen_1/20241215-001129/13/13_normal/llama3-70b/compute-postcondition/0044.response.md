Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `left < right and s[left] != 'G'`.

2. **Current State After Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` is an integer input by the user within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `s` is a string consisting of `n` characters, each being either 'G' or 'S'.
   - `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' in `s`.
   - `max_beauty` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and 1.
   - `left` is `left + 1`.
   - `right` is `n - 2`.
   - `curr_beauty` is 0.

3. **Determine Necessary Adjustments**:
   - For the loop to continue executing, both conditions in the loop must be true: `left < right` and `s[left] != 'G'`.
   - We need to ensure that `left < right` remains true.
   - Since `left` is incremented by 1 (`left = left + 1`), we need to adjust `left` such that it is still less than `right`.
   - `right` is set to `n - 2`, which means `right` is fixed for the next iteration.
   - To ensure `s[left] != 'G'`, we need to ensure that the character at `left` is not 'G'.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - `left` should be adjusted to be an index where `s[left]` is not 'G' and `left < right`.
   - Since `right` is `n - 2`, `left` must be less than `n - 2`.
   - We can set `left` to `left + 1` (as it was incremented in the previous iteration) and check if it still meets the conditions.

Given these points, the necessary adjustments would be to ensure that `left` is incremented to a position where it is still valid and the character at `left` is not 'G'.

Therefore, the state to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:
State: **`left` is `left + 1` and `s[left]` is not 'G'**.

Since `right` is fixed as `n - 2`, we don't need to adjust it. `max_beauty`, `golden`, and `curr_beauty` remain unchanged from the previous iteration.

So, the final answer is:
State: **`left` is `left + 1` and `s[left]` is not 'G'**
