Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `prev_start` is the start value of the first segment in `segments`, `prev_end` is the end value of the first segment in `segments`, `curr_start` is the start value of the second segment in `segments`, `curr_end` is the end value of the second segment in `segments`, and `max_length` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and either `curr_end - prev_start + 1` (if `curr_start - prev_end == 2`) or `curr_end - prev_start + 1` (since there is no else part that changes `max_length`).**
