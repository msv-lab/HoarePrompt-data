`left` is incremented by 1. The value of `left` was less than `right` and `s[left]` was not 'G', so after incrementing `left`, the new value of `left` will be one more than its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a string consisting of `n` characters, each being either 'G' or 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`, `left` is such that `left < right` and `s[left] != 'G'`, `right` is `n - 1`, `curr_beauty` is 0, and the new value of `left` is `left + 1`.**
