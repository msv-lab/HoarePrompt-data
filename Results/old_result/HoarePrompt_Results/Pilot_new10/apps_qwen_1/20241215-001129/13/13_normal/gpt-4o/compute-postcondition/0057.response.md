The code assigns the start and end values of the second segment (segments[i - 1]) to `prev_start` and `prev_end`, respectively. Given that `i` is 2, `segments[i - 1]` refers to the second segment in the list. The previous values of `prev_start` and `prev_end` are updated to these new values, but the values of `curr_start`, `curr_end`, and `max_length` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `prev_start` is the start value of the second segment, `prev_end` is the end value of the second segment, `curr_start` is the start value of the third segment, `curr_end` is the end value of the third segment, and `max_length` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and either `curr_end - prev_start + 1` if `curr_start - prev_end == 2`, or `curr_end - prev_start + 1`.**
