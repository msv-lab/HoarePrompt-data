`left` is incremented by 1. The condition `left + 4 < right` must still hold true, and the condition `s[left + 2]` is not 'G' must also still be true. Therefore, the updated state is: `left` is incremented by 1, `left + 4 < right` is still true, and `s[left + 2]` is not 'G'.

Output State: **`left` is incremented by 1, `left + 4 < right` is still true, and `s[left + 2]` is not 'G'.**
