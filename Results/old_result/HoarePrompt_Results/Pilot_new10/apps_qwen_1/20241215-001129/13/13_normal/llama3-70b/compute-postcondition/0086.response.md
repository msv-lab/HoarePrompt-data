The code `break` does not change any variable values but breaks out of the most internal loop or conditional statement. Since there are no loops or conditions in the initial state that would be affected by this `break` statement, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `n + 2`, `beauty` may be increased by 1 if `s[n + 2] == 'G'` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
