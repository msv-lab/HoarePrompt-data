The code `beauty += 1` increments the value of `beauty` by 1. Since `beauty` was initially the number of 'G' characters in the substring `s[i+2:i+3]`, after this line of code, `beauty` will be incremented by 1. The other variables (`s`, `j`, and `n`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `beauty` is the number of 'G' characters in the substring `s[i+2:i+3]` plus 1, `j` is `i + 3`, and `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.**
