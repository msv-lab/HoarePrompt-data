The code updates `max_length` to the maximum of its current value and `curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end - prev_start + 1) + 1`. Given the initial conditions, the values of the variables remain as follows:
- `i` is 2
- `prev_start` is the start value of the second segment
- `prev_end` is the end value of the second segment
- `curr_start` is the start value of the third segment
- `curr_end` is the end value of the third segment
- `max_length` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end - prev_start + 1) + 1`

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`i` is 2, `prev_start` is the start value of the second segment, `prev_end` is the end value of the second segment, `curr_start` is the start value of the third segment, `curr_end` is the end value of the third segment, and `max_length` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end - prev_start + 1) + 1**.
