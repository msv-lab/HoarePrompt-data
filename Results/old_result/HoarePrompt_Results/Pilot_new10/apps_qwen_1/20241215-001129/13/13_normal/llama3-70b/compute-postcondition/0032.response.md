The code `left += 1` increments the value of `left` by 1. Given the precondition, `left < right` and `s[left] != 'G'` from the end of the previous iteration, and `right` is `n - 1`. After this increment, `left` will be one more than its previous value. Additionally, since `s[left] != 'G'` before the increment, `s[left]` will still not be 'G' immediately after the increment (because if it was 'G', the condition would not allow the increment). Also, `left + 1 < right` and `s[left + 1] != 'G'` for the next iteration will still hold true because `left` is incremented by 1, making `left + 1` less than `right` and ensuring the character at the new position `left + 1` is not 'G'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a string consisting of `n` characters, each being either 'G' or 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`, `left` is incremented by 1, `right` is `n - 1`, `curr_beauty` is 0, and `left + 1 < right` and `s[left + 1] != 'G'` for the next iteration.**
