Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `j` is `n`, `beauty` is at most 3, and `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum value between its current value and `beauty` after the last iteration. If `s[j-2]` is 'G' during any iteration, `beauty` is updated accordingly; otherwise, the loop breaks, and `beauty` remains unchanged.**

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Initial Values**: 
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be at least 2
   - `j` is -1
   - `beauty` is at most 3
   - `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum value between its current value and `beauty` after the last iteration.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs for each `j` in the range `(i + 2, n)`. This means `j` starts from `i + 2` (which is 4) and goes up to `n - 1`.

3. **Condition Inside the Loop**:
   - If `s[j]` is 'G', `beauty` is incremented by 1.
   - If `s[j]` is not 'G', the loop breaks.

4. **Final Values After Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will continue to increment `beauty` as long as `s[j]` is 'G'.
   - The loop will break when `s[j]` is not 'G', and `j` will be set to `n`.
   - `i` and `n` remain unchanged unless explicitly modified outside the loop.
   - `j` will be set to `n` once the loop breaks.
   - `beauty` will be the maximum value it reached during the loop iterations, but it cannot exceed 3.
   - `max_beauty_one_swap` will hold the maximum value between its current value and the final value of `beauty`.

### Conclusion:
After all iterations of the loop, the values of the variables will be as described above. If the loop does not execute at all, `j` will still be -1, but this scenario is not considered based on the given conditions.
