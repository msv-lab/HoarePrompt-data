Let's analyze the given `while` loop and the current state to determine which adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute at least one more time.

The `while` loop condition is:
```python
while left < right and s[left] != 'G':
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Given the current state:
- `n` is an integer input by the user within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `s` is a string consisting of `n` characters, each being either 'G' or 'S'.
- `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' in `s`.
- `max_beauty` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`.
- `curr_beauty` is 0.
- `left` is unchanged (its exact value is not specified but is part of the loop condition).
- `right` is a value such that `right < n` and `s[right]` is not 'G'.
- `right` has incremented by 1 on each iteration since the start of the loop.

To ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to satisfy both conditions in the `while` loop:
1. `left < right`
2. `s[left] != 'G'`

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition 1: `left < right`**
   - The problem states that `right < n` and `s[right]` is not 'G'.
   - We need `left` to be less than `right` initially.

2. **Condition 2: `s[left] != 'G'`**
   - We need `s[left]` to be 'S' initially (since it is not 'G').

### Required Adjustments:

- For the first iteration, `left` should be set to an index where `s[left]` is 'S' and `left < right`.

Since `right` is already defined as being less than `n` and not 'G', and `left` is not specified but needs to be initialized to an appropriate value, let's assume `left` is set to the smallest index where `s[left]` is 'S'. 

Therefore, the required adjustments are:
- Ensure `left` is set to an index where `s[left]` is 'S' and `left < right`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer input by the user within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a string consisting of `n` characters, each being either 'G' or 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is set to an index where `s[left]` is 'S' and `left < right`, `right` is a value such that `right < n` and `s[right]` is not 'G', `right` has incremented by 1 on each iteration since the start of the loop.**
