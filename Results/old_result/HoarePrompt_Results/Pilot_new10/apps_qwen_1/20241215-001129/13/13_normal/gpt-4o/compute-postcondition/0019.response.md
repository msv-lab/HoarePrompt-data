The value of `i` is incremented by 1. According to the initial state, `i` is the smallest index starting from 2 where `trophies[i]` is not 'G', and `i` must satisfy `i < n and trophies[i] == 'G'`. After incrementing `i` by 1, the new value of `i` will be the next index where `trophies[i]` is not 'G'. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`segments` is either `[('2', 'i - 1')]` where `i` is the smallest index starting from 3 where `trophies[i]` is not 'G', or an empty list `[]`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `i` is the smallest index starting from 3 where `trophies[i]` is not 'G', `start` is equal to `i - 1`, and `i` must satisfy `i < n and trophies[i] == 'G'`**
