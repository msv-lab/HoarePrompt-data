#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: an integer `n` such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\) and a string `trophies` of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' (golden) and 'S' (silver). The function processes the string to find segments of consecutive 'G's and calculates the maximum length of these segments. If no segments are found, it returns 0. If there is only one segment, it returns its length. If there are multiple segments, it checks for specific conditions where the segments can be combined to form longer segments and updates the maximum length accordingly. Finally, it returns the minimum value between the updated maximum length plus one and the length of the string `trophies`.
