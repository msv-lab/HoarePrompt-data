The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or a nested structure. In this case, since there is no loop or nested structure specified in the initial state, the `break` statement does not change any variables. The conditions and values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` satisfies the condition \( i + 2 \leq j < n \) and `s[j] != 'G'**
