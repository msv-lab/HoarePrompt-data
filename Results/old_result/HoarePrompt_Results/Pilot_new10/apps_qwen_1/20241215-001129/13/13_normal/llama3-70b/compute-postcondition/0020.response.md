The code `curr_beauty += 1` increments the value of `curr_beauty` by 1. Given that the initial value of `curr_beauty` is 0, after this operation, `curr_beauty` becomes 1. The other variables (`n`, `s`, `golden`, `max_beauty`, `left`, and `right`) remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a string consisting of `n` characters, each being either 'G' or 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is 1, `left` is incremented to `n`, `right` is `n`. The condition `left < right` is true**.
