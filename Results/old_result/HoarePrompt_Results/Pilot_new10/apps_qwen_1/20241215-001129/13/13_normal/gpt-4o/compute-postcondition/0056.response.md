To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the information provided and the loop logic.

### Given Information:
- `i` is currently 1.
- `prev_start` is the start value of the first segment in `segments`.
- `prev_end` is the end value of the first segment in `segments`.
- `curr_start` is the start value of the second segment in `segments`.
- `curr_end` is the end value of the second segment in `segments`.
- `max_length` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and either `curr_end - prev_start + 1` if `curr_start - prev_end == 2`, or `curr_end - prev_start + 1`.

### Loop Condition:
The loop starts with `i = 1` and runs until `i < len(segments)`.

### Current State:
- The loop has just completed the first iteration with `i = 1`.
- `prev_start` and `prev_end` correspond to the first segment.
- `curr_start` and `curr_end` correspond to the second segment.
- `max_length` has been updated based on the values of the first and second segments.

### Next Iteration:
For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented from 1 to 2. This means we are moving to the third segment in the list.

### Adjusted States:
- `i` will now be 2.
- `prev_start` and `prev_end` will now refer to the second segment.
- `curr_start` and `curr_end` will now refer to the third segment.
- `max_length` will be updated based on the new values of `prev_start`, `prev_end`, `curr_start`, and `curr_end`.

### Updated State:
- `i` is 2.
- `prev_start` is the start value of the second segment.
- `prev_end` is the end value of the second segment.
- `curr_start` is the start value of the third segment.
- `curr_end` is the end value of the third segment.
- `max_length` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and either `curr_end - prev_start + 1` if `curr_start - prev_end == 2`, or `curr_end - prev_start + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `prev_start` is the start value of the second segment, `prev_end` is the end value of the second segment, `curr_start` is the start value of the third segment, `curr_end` is the end value of the third segment, and `max_length` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and either `curr_end - prev_start + 1` if `curr_start - prev_end == 2`, or `curr_end - prev_start + 1`.**
