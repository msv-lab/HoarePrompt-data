Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `prev_start` is the start value of the third segment, `prev_end` is the end value of the third segment, `curr_start` is `segments[3][0]`, `curr_end` is `segments[3][1]`, `max_length` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the value of `curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end - prev_start + 1) + 1` if `curr_start - prev_end == 2`. Otherwise, the values of `max_length`, `prev_start`, `prev_end`, `curr_start`, and `curr_end` remain unchanged.***
