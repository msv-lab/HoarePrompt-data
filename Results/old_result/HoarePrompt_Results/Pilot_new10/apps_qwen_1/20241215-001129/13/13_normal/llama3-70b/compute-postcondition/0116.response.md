The `break` statement does not modify any variable values but instead breaks out of the loop or the innermost enclosing block. Since there is no loop or innermost block context given in the initial state that would be exited by this `break`, the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions without modification.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is at least 4, `j` is 5, `beauty` is at most 3, and `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum value between its current value and `beauty` after the last iteration. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
