To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions under which the `while` loop continues:

The loop condition is:
```
while left < right and s[left] != 'G':
```

Given the current state:
- `n` is an integer input by the user within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `s` is a string consisting of `n` characters, each being either 'G' or 'S'.
- `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' in `s`.
- `max_beauty` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`.
- `left < right` and `s[left] != 'G'` (from the end of the previous iteration).
- `right` is `n - 1`.
- `curr_beauty` is 0.
- The new value of `left` is `left + 1`.

For the loop to continue executing one more time, the following conditions must be met at the start of the next iteration:
1. `left < right` must still be true.
2. `s[left] != 'G'` must still be true.

Let's break this down:

1. **Condition `left < right`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `left < right` was true.
   - Since `left` is incremented by 1 (`left = left + 1`), for `left < right` to remain true, `left + 1` must still be less than `right`.
   - Therefore, `left + 1 < right` must be true.

2. **Condition `s[left] != 'G'`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `s[left] != 'G'` was true.
   - After incrementing `left` by 1, `s[left + 1]` must not be 'G'.

Given these requirements, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- Ensure that `left + 1 < right`.
- Ensure that `s[left + 1] != 'G'`.

So, the final state for the loop to execute one more time is:
State: **`n` is an integer input by the user within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a string consisting of `n` characters, each being either 'G' or 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`, `left < right` and `s[left] != 'G'` from the end of the previous iteration, `right` is `n - 1`, `curr_beauty` is 0, and `left + 1 < right` and `s[left + 1] != 'G'` for the next iteration.**
