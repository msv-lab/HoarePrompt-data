`beauty` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `beauty` is 4 (since it was initially at most 3, and now it is incremented by 1). The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 4, `j` is 4, `beauty` is 4, and `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum value between its current value and `beauty` after the last iteration.**
