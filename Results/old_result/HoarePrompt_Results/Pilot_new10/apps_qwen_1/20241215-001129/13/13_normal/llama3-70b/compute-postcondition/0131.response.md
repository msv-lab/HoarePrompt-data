The code `break` does not assign any new values to the variables. It only breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or match case. Since there is no loop or match case in the given initial state, the execution of `break` does not change the values of `s` or `j`. The precondition that the character at index `j` is not 'G' remains unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `j` is an index within the string `s`, and the character at index `j` is not 'G'**
