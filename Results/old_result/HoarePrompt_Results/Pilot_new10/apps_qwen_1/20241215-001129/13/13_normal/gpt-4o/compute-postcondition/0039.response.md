Postcondition: `segments` is either `[('2', 'i - 1'), ('2', 'i - 1')]` or `[('None', 'i - 1')]`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', and `i` is incremented by the number of times the loop executed to ensure `i < n`. Moreover, `trophies[i]` is not equal to 'G'.
