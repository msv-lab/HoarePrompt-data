The `beauty` variable is incremented by 1. The value of `i`, `n`, `j`, `beauty`, and `max_beauty_one_swap` are the same as the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `j` is determined based on the condition `s[1] == 'G' and s[2] == 'S'`, `beauty` is 2, and `max_beauty_one_swap` is updated if necessary. The current value of `s[j]` is 'G'.
