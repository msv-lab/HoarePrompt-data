Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `right = 0` to `right = n-1`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` is an integer input by the user within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `s` is a string consisting of `n` characters, each being either 'G' or 'S'.
   - `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' in `s`.
   - `max_beauty` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty` if `s[right]` is not 'G'. If `s[right]` is 'G', then `curr_beauty` is set to 1, `left` is set to 0, and `right` is set to 1.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration**:
   - If `s[right]` is 'G', then `curr_beauty` is set to 1, `left` is set to 0, and `right` is set to 1. This means the loop will terminate immediately after this condition because `right` becomes 1, and the next increment would make it 2.
   - If `s[right]` is not 'G', then `curr_beauty` is compared with `max_beauty`, and `max_beauty` might get updated. The loop continues as long as `right` is less than `n-1`.

4. **State Adjustment**:
   - If `s[right]` is not 'G' and the loop continues:
     - `right` will be incremented by 1.
     - `left` remains the same (assuming no changes were made in the loop body for non-'G' cases).
     - `max_beauty` remains unchanged unless `s[right]` is not 'G'.
   - If `s[right]` is 'G':
     - The loop will terminate as `right` will become 1 and the next increment will make it 2.

Given the above conditions, let's assume the loop did not terminate due to a 'G' character at the end of the previous iteration (otherwise, we would be starting a new loop).

Therefore, for the next iteration:
- `right` will be `n - 1` if it was `n - 2` at the end of the previous iteration.
- `left` remains unchanged.
- `max_beauty` remains unchanged.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`n` is an integer input by the user within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a string consisting of `n` characters, each being either 'G' or 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty` is the same as the previous iteration, `left` is the same as the previous iteration, `right` is `n - 1`**.
