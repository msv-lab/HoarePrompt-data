`curr_beauty` is assigned the value `0`. This initializes `curr_beauty` but does not affect the values of `n`, `s`, `golden`, or `max_beauty`. Therefore, the only change is the initialization of `curr_beauty`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `s` is a string consisting of `n` characters, each being either 'G' or 'S'; `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' in `s`; `max_beauty` is 0; `curr_beauty` is 0.**
