Let's analyze the given program state and the `while` loop condition step by step:

- The state right before the loop is as follows:
  - `n` is an integer input by the user within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
  - `s` is a string consisting of `n` characters, each being either 'G' or 'S'.
  - `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' in `s`.
  - `max_beauty` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and 1.
  - `left` is the index where `s[left] == 'G'` (or `left == right` if no more 'G' is found).
  - `right` is `n - 2`.
  - `curr_beauty` is 0.

- The `while` loop condition is: `while left < right and s[left] != 'G':`

For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must be met:
1. `left < right`: This condition ensures that there are still indices to check between `left` and `right`.
2. `s[left] != 'G'`: This condition ensures that the character at index `left` is not 'G'.

Given these conditions, we need to adjust the states such that:
- `left < right` holds true.
- `s[left] != 'G'` holds true.

Since `left` and `right` are already defined and their relationship (`left < right`) needs to hold, we only need to ensure that the character at `left` is not 'G'. 

Therefore, we need to make sure that `s[left]` is not 'G'. To do this, we can set `left` to an index where `s[left]` is 'S' or simply adjust the state to reflect that `s[left]` is not 'G'.

State: **`n` is an integer input by the user within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a string consisting of `n` characters, each being either 'G' or 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and 1, `left` is an index where `s[left]` is not 'G', `right` is `n - 2`, and `curr_beauty` is 0.**
