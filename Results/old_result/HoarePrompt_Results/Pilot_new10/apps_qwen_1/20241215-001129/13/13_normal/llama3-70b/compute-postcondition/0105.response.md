The code `break` does not change the values of any variables but instead breaks out of the nearest loop or switch-case structure. Since there is no such structure in the given code snippet, the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `j` is 1, `beauty` is either 2 or 3, and `max_beauty_one_swap` is updated if necessary.**
