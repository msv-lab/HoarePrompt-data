Postcondition: ***`segments` is either `[('2', 'i - 1')]` where `i` is the smallest index starting from 2 where `trophies[i]` is not 'G', or an empty list `[]`. `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\). `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'. `i` is set to the next non-'G' character starting from 2, or 3 if all characters from index 2 to `n-1` are 'G'.***
