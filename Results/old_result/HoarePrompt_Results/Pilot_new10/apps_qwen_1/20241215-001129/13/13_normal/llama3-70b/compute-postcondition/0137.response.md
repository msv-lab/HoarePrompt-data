Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `s` is a string.
   - `j` is an index within the string `s` that is one less than its previous value.
   - `beauty` is increased by 1 if `s[j]` is 'G'. Otherwise, `beauty` remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Range**:
   - The loop iterates from `i-1` to `-1` with a step of `-1`. This means it starts at `i-1` and decrements `j` until it reaches `-1`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `j` is one less than its previous value, meaning the loop just finished decrementing `j`.
   - `beauty` was updated based on the current value of `j`.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be decremented again.
   - Since `j` is already one less than its previous value, the new value of `j` will be one less than its current value.
   - The condition for updating `beauty` will be checked again with the new value of `j`.

Given these points, let's adjust the states:

- `j` will be decreased by 1 from its current value.
- The loop will check if `s[j]` is 'G' and update `beauty` accordingly.

So, the updated states are:

**State: **`s` is a string, `j` is an index within the string `s` that is one less than its previous value, and `beauty` is increased by 1 if `s[j]` is 'G'. Otherwise, `beauty` remains unchanged.**
