Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- State at the end of the previous iteration: `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is initially `n`.
- The loop checks if `s[j]` is 'G'. If it is, `beauty` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `j` satisfies the condition `i + 2 ≤ j < n` and `s[j] != 'G'`, no changes are made to `beauty`.

### Loop Details:
```
for j in range(i + 2, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initial Values:**
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `j` is `n`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` starting from `i + 2` (which is `n - 1 + 2 = n + 1`) up to `n - 1` (since `n` is not included).

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - Since `i` is `n - 1`, the smallest value `j` can take in the next iteration would be `n + 1` (because `i + 2 = n + 1`).
   - The loop will check if `j` is within the range `i + 2` to `n - 1`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - If the loop continues, `j` will start from `n + 1` and go up to `n - 1`.
   - The new value of `j` will be `n + 1` because `j` starts from `n` and is incremented by the loop.

### Adjusted States:
- `i` remains `n - 1` because `i` does not change inside the loop.
- `j` will start from `n + 1` in the next iteration.
- The condition `i + 2 ≤ j < n` will not be satisfied since `i + 2 = n + 1` and `n + 1` is not less than `n`.

### Conclusion:
The state at the start of the next iteration should reflect `j` starting from `n + 1`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `n + 1`**
