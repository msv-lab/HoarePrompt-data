Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `i` is 3
   - `n` must be greater than 3
   - `j` is `n`
   - `beauty` is 1
   - `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum value between its current value and 1.

2. **Loop Definition:**
   ```python
   for j in range(i - 1, -1, -1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `i-1` down to `-1` with a step of `-1`.
   - For the loop to execute, `i - 1` should be greater than or equal to `-1`.

4. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - `i` is currently 3.
   - Therefore, `i - 1` is 2, which is indeed greater than `-1`.

5. **Determine the Range of `j`:**
   - Initially, `j` is set to `n`.
   - Since `n` must be greater than 3, let's denote `n` as some value greater than 3 (e.g., 4, 5, etc.).

6. **Adjusting the State:**
   - `j` starts as `n`, which is greater than `i-1` (which is 2).
   - The loop will run until `j` becomes less than or equal to `-1`, but this condition will not be met because `j` starts as `n` and `n` is greater than 3.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The initial values and conditions given already ensure that the loop will execute. No further adjustments are necessary for the loop to start and run correctly based on the provided information.

**Final State:**
State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `j` is `n`, `beauty` is 1, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum value between its current value and 1**
