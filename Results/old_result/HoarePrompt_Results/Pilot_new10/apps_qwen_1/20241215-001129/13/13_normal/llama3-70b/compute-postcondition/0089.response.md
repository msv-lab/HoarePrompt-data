The code snippet `max_beauty_one_swap = max(max_beauty_one_swap, beauty)` assigns the maximum value between `max_beauty_one_swap` and `beauty` to `max_beauty_one_swap`. The value of `beauty` is the number of consecutive 'G's from `s[0]` to `s[n-1]` if the loop does not break early, otherwise the count of 'G's from `s[0]` to the last 'G' before `s[j]`. Since the value of `max_beauty_one_swap` is not specified in the initial state, it is considered as a variable that can take any value.

The variables `i` and `j` are not affected by this line of code, and their values remain as they were initially. The value of `beauty` remains unchanged as well. 

Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `n` if the loop does not execute, otherwise `j` is the first index `k` such that `s[k] != 'G'` or `n` if no such index exists, `beauty` is the number of consecutive 'G's from `s[0]` to `s[n-1]` if the loop does not break early, otherwise the count of 'G's from `s[0]` to the last 'G' before `s[j]`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum value between `max_beauty_one_swap` and `beauty`**.
