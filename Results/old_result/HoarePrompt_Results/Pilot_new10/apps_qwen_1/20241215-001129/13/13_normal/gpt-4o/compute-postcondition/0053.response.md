Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `prev_start` is the start value of the first segment in `segments`, `prev_end` is the end value of the first segment in `segments`, `curr_start` is the start value of the second segment in `segments`, `curr_end` is the end value of the second segment in `segments`, and `curr_start` is exactly 2 more than `prev_end`**
