The code assigns the values from the `segments` list to the variables `curr_start` and `curr_end`. Specifically, `curr_start` gets the value of the start of the current segment (i.e., `segments[i][0]`) and `curr_end` gets the value of the end of the current segment (i.e., `segments[i][1]`). 

The initial state shows that `i` is 1, which means `segments[i]` refers to the second segment in the list since indexing starts at 0. The preconditions state that `len(segments)` is greater than 1, so there is indeed a second segment.

Therefore, the values of `curr_start` and `curr_end` are the start and end values of the second segment in the `segments` list.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `prev_start` is the start value of the first segment in `segments`, `prev_end` is the end value of the first segment in `segments`, `curr_start` is the start value of the second segment in `segments`, `curr_end` is the end value of the second segment in `segments`**
