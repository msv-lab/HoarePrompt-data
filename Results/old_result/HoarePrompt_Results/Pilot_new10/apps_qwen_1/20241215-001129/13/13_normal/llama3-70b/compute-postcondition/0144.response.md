The code increments the `beauty` variable by 1 because the current value of `s[j]` is 'G', and `beauty` counts the number of 'G' characters in the substring `s[j:j+1]`. The value of `j` remains 0, and the condition that `n` must be greater than `j + 1` still holds true since `j + 1` is 1, which is less than `n`.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `beauty` is the number of 'G' characters in the substring `s[j:j+1]` plus 1, `j` is 0, and `n` must be greater than `j + 1`.**
