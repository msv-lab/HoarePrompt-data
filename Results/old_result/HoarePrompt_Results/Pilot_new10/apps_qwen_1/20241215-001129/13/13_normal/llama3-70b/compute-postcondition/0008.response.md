The code `curr_beauty += 1` increments the value of `curr_beauty` by 1. Since the current value of `s[right]` is 'G', this indicates that we are currently within a segment of 'G's, and the count of 'G's in the current segment is being tracked.

Given the initial conditions:
- `n` is an integer input by the user within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- `s` is a string consisting of `n` characters, each being either 'G' or 'S'
- `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' in `s`
- `max_beauty` is 0
- `curr_beauty` is 0 initially and will increase by 1 for each 'G' encountered
- `left` is 0 and does not change in this particular line of code
- `right` is 0 and will increment by 1 on each iteration of the loop
- The loop continues as long as `right < n`

Since the current value of `s[right]` is 'G', `curr_beauty` will be incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a string consisting of `n` characters, each being either 'G' or 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty` is 0, `curr_beauty` is 1, `left` is 0, `right` is 1**
