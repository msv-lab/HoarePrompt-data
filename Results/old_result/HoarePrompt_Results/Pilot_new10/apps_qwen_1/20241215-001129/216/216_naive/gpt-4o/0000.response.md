Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of elements in a pretty set of positions for the given string. It iterates through each character of the string, adds lowercase unique characters to a set, and clears the set upon encountering an uppercase letter. This ensures that the set only contains distinct lowercase letters up to the last uppercase letter encountered. The maximum count of such sets is then printed. Given the examples and the nature of the problem, the program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
