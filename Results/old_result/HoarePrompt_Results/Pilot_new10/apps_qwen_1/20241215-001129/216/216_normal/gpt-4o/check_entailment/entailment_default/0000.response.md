Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem asks for the maximum number of elements in a pretty set of positions, which means the set of positions should contain distinct lowercase letters without any uppercase letters in between. However, the code only counts the maximum number of consecutive lowercase characters and resets the count upon encountering an uppercase character. It does not ensure that the selected characters are distinct and that there are no uppercase letters between them.

For example, consider the input:
```
11
aaaaBaabAbA
```

The code will output `2`, but the correct output should be `2` for the positions 6 and 8 or 7 and 8, as mentioned in the example. The code does not handle the requirement that the characters must be distinct and there should be no uppercase letters between them.

To fix this, the code needs to maintain a set of characters that have already been included in the pretty set and check if the current character is already in the set or if there is an uppercase letter between the current and previously added characters.
