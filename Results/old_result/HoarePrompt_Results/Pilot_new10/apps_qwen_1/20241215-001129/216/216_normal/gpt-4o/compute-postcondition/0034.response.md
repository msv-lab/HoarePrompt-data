The code `print(max_count)` simply prints the value of `max_count` and does not change any variable values. The variables `n`, `s`, `current_set`, and `current_count` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200, `s` is a non-empty string, `max_count` is the maximum number of consecutive lowercase characters seen in `s`, `current_set` is an empty set, `current_count` is 0, the value of `max_count` is printed.**
