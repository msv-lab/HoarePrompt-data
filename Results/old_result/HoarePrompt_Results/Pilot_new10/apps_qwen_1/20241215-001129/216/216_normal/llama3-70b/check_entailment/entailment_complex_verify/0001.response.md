Final: **False**

Reason: The annotated version clearly shows that the program does not check for the absence of uppercase letters between any two selected lowercase letters. The program simply collects all the indices of lowercase letters and prints their count, which violates the problem's requirement. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program needs to be modified to meet the problem's constraints.
