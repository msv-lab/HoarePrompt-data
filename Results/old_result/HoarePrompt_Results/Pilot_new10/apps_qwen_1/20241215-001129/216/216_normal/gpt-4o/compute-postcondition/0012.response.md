The code snippet `max_count = max(max_count, current_count)` updates `max_count` to be the maximum of its current value and `current_count`. Since `current_count` was not explicitly set before this line of code, its value remains 0. `max_count` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value (which is 0) and `current_count` (also 0), so `max_count` remains 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200, `s` is a non-empty string, `max_count` is 0, `current_set` is an empty set, `current_count` is 0**
