The line `current_count = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `current_count`. This does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `current_count`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200, `s` is a non-empty string, `max_count` is 0, `current_set` is an empty set, `current_count` is 0**
