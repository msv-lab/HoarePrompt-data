The code `current_set.clear()` clears the `current_set`, which means it removes all elements from `current_set`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated states are:

- `n` is an integer between 1 and 200
- `s` is a non-empty string
- `max_count` remains unchanged
- `current_set` is now an empty set

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200; `s` is a non-empty string; `max_count` remains unchanged; `current_set` is an empty set**
