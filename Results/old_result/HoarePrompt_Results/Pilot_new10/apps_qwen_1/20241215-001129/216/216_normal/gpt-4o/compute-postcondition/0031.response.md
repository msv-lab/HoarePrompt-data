Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 200, `s` is a non-empty string, `max_count` remains unchanged, `current_set` either contains the next character in `s` (if it is lowercase and not already in `current_set`) or remains unchanged, and `current_count` is incremented by 1. If the next character in `s` is not lowercase or is already in `current_set`, `current_set` becomes an empty set and `current_count` is reset to 0.***
