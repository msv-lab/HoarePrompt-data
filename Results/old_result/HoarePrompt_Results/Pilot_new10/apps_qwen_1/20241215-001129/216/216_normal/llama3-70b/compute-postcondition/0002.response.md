The code creates a list `lowercase` containing the indices of all lowercase characters in the string `s`. This operation does not change the values of `n` or `s`, but it introduces a new list `lowercase`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, `s` is the string entered by the user, `lowercase` is a list of indices of all lowercase characters in `s`**
