The code `current_set.clear()` clears the set `current_set`. This means that `current_set` will no longer contain any elements. The values of `n`, `s`, `max_count`, and `current_count` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200, `s` is a non-empty string, `max_count` is the maximum count of any character seen so far, `current_set` is an empty set, and `current_count` is unchanged.**
