The code increments the value of `current_count` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200, `s` is a non-empty string, `max_count` is the maximum count of any character seen so far, `current_set` either contains the next character in `s` (if it is lowercase and not already in `current_set`) or remains unchanged, `current_count` is incremented by 1.**
