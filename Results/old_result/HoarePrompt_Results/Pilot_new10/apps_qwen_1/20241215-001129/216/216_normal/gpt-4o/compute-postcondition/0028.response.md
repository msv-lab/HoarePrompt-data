The code snippet updates `max_count` to be the maximum of its current value and `current_count`. This means `max_count` will be updated to the higher of its current value and the current count of the character being processed.

Since the initial state does not specify a specific value for `current_count`, we can denote the new value of `max_count` as `max(max_count, current_count)`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200, `s` is a non-empty string, `max_count` is max(max_count, current_count), `current_set` is a set that either contains the next character in `s` (if it is lowercase and not already in `current_set`) with `current_count` incremented to 1, or remains unchanged, the next character in `s` is being processed, and `current_count` is incremented by 1 if the next character is added to `current_set`.**
