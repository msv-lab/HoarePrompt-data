Final: **False**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the problem description show that the program only collects the indices of lowercase letters without checking for the presence of uppercase letters between them. The original assessment correctly identified that this approach is incorrect because it does not satisfy the condition that there should be no uppercase letters between the selected positions. Therefore, the original assessment remains accurate.
