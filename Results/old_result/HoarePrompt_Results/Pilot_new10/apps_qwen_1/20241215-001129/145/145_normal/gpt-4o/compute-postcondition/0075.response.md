Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: an integer `n` (such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\)) and a string `ticket` consisting of `n` digits where each digit is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive. It checks if the string `ticket` can be partitioned into segments where each segment has the same sum. If such a partition exists, the function returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.**

This summary covers the following points:
- The function iterates over possible segment lengths from 1 to `n-1`.
- For each segment length, it calculates the target sum of the first `segment_length - 1` digits.
- It then iterates through the digits of the `ticket` to check if the segments can be formed such that each segment sums to the target sum.
- If a valid partition is found (where `current_sum` becomes 0 and `segment_count` is greater than 1), the function returns 'YES'.
- If no valid partition is found by the end of the iterations, the function returns 'NO'.
