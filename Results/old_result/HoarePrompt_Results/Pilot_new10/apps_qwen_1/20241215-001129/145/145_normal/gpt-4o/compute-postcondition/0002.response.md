Functionality: **The function `segment_sum` accepts two parameters, `start` and `end`, which are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq \text{start} \leq \text{end} < \text{len(ticket)}\). It returns the sum of the digits in the string `ticket` from index `start` to index `end` inclusive. This includes handling the case where the indices are valid within the length of the string `ticket`.**
