The code `target_sum = total_sum // 2` assigns the integer division of `total_sum` by 2 to `target_sum`. Since the `total_sum` is given to be even, dividing it by 2 will result in an integer value.

The impact of the code is that `target_sum` is set to half of `total_sum`. The values of `ticket` and `total_sum` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ticket` is a string consisting of $n$ digits where $2 \le n \le 100$ and each digit is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive; `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket` and is even; `target_sum` is total_sum // 2**
