Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a string `ticket` consisting of \( n \) digits where \( 2 \le n \le 100 \) and each digit is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive. It calculates the total sum of the digits in `ticket` and checks if this sum is even. If the sum is not even, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it calculates half of the total sum (`target_sum`) and iterates through the digits in `ticket`, counting the number of segments where the sum of digits equals `target_sum`. If there are at least two such segments, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.**
