The initial state is defined as follows:
- `current_sum` is `int(ticket[4])`
- `i` is 4
- `ticket` is a string consisting of `n` digits where each digit is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive
- `target_sum` is the sum of the first `segment_length` digits of `ticket`
- `segment_count` is 2
- `segment_length` is `n`

The given code snippet sets `current_sum` to 0:
```python
current_sum = 0
```

This changes the value of `current_sum` from its initial value to 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`current_sum` is 0, `i` is 4, `ticket` is a string consisting of `n` digits where each digit is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, `target_sum` is the sum of the first `segment_length` digits of `ticket`, `segment_count` is 2, and `segment_length` is `n`.**
