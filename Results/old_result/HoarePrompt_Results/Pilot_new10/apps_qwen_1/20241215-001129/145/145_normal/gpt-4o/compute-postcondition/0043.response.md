Postcondition: ***`current_sum` is an integer. If `current_sum` equals `target_sum`, then `current_sum` remains unchanged, `i` is 4, `ticket` is a string consisting of `n` digits where each digit is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, `target_sum` is the sum of the first `segment_length` digits of `ticket`, `segment_count` is 2, and `segment_length` is `n`. If `current_sum` does not equal `target_sum`, then `current_sum` remains unchanged under the same conditions.***
