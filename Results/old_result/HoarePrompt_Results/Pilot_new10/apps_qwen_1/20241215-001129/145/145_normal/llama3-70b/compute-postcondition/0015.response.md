`segments` is incremented by 1, which means the value of `segments` is now one more than its previous value. The initial state of `curr_sum` being the original value of `curr_sum` plus `digit` and `digit` remaining unchanged are still valid. 

Output State: **`curr_sum` is the original value of `curr_sum` plus `digit`, `digit` is unchanged, `segments` is incremented by 1.**
