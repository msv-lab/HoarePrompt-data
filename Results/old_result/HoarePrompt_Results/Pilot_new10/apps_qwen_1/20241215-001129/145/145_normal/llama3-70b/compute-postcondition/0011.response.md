The code sets `curr_sum` to 0, which overwrites its previous value of `target_sum`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated values are as follows:

- `ticket` is a string consisting of \( n \) digits where \( 2 \le n \le 100 \)
- `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket` and is even
- `target_sum` is `total_sum // 2`
- `curr_sum` equals 0 (overwritten from `target_sum`)
- `segments` is 1

Output State: **`ticket` is a string consisting of \( n \) digits where \( 2 \le n \le 100 \), `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket` and is even, `target_sum` is `total_sum // 2`, `curr_sum` equals 0, `segments` is 1**
