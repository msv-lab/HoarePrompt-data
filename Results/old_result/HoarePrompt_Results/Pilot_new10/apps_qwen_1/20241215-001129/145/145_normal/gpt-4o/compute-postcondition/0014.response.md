Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `i` is 3, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `ticket` is a string consisting of `n` digits where each digit is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, `target_sum` is the result of the function `segment_sum(0, segment_length - 1)`, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 1. If `current_sum` equals `target_sum`, then `total` remains 0 and `segment_count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the values of `total`, `i`, `n`, `ticket`, `target_sum`, and `current_sum` remain unchanged.***
