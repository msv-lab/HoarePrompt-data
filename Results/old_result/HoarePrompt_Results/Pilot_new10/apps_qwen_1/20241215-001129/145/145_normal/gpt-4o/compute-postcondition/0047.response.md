Postcondition: **`current_sum` is the sum of the first `segment_length` digits of `ticket` if the loop executes `segment_count` times, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `ticket` is a string consisting of `n` digits where each digit is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, `target_sum` is the sum of the first `segment_length` digits of `ticket`, `segment_count` is the number of times the condition `current_sum == target_sum` is met, and `segment_length` is `n`. `current_sum` is not equal to 0 or `segment_count` is not greater than 1, `i` is `n`, `segment_count` is 0, and the other variables retain their initial values.**
