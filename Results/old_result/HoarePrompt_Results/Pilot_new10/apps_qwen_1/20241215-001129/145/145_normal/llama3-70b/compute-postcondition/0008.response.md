`curr_sum` is incremented by the current `digit`. The value of `digit` is a single digit from the string `ticket`. The `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket` and is even, `target_sum` is `total_sum // 2`, `curr_sum` starts at 0, and `segments` starts at 0. After the line of code is executed, the `curr_sum` will be updated by adding the value of the current digit from `ticket`.

Output State: **`ticket` is a string consisting of $n$ digits where $2 \le n \le 100$, `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket` and is even, `target_sum` is `total_sum // 2`, `curr_sum` is the original `curr_sum` plus the value of the current digit from `ticket`, `segments` is 0**
