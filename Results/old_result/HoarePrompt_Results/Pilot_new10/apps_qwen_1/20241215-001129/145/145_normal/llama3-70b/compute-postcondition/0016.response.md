The code sets `curr_sum` to 0, which overrides its previous value of `curr_sum` plus `digit`. The values of `digit` and `segments` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `curr_sum` is 0, `digit` is unchanged, `segments` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`curr_sum` is 0, `digit` is unchanged, `segments` is incremented by 1**
