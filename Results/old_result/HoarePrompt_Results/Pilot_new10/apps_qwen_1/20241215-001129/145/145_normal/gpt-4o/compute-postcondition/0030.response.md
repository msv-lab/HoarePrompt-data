Postcondition: **`current_sum` is the integer value of `ticket[0]`, `i` is 2 (since it was incremented by 1 in the code), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `ticket` is a string consisting of `n` digits where each digit is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, `target_sum` is the sum of the first `segment_length` digits of `ticket`, `segment_count` is 0, and `current_sum` equals `target_sum`**
