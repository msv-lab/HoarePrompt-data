Postcondition: ***`current_sum` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `ticket` is a string consisting of `n` digits where each digit is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, `target_sum` is `int(ticket[0])`, and `segment_count` is 1. This holds true regardless of the condition since there is no else part and the if condition always sets these variables to the specified values.***
