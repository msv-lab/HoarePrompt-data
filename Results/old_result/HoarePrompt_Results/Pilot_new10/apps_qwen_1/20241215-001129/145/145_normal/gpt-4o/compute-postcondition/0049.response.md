The code `target_sum = segment_sum(0, segment_length - 1)` calls the function `segment_sum` with the parameters `0` and `segment_length - 1`. Since the `segment_length` is equal to `n`, the function call becomes `segment_sum(0, n - 1)`. The function `segment_sum` presumably returns the sum of the digits in the `ticket` string from index `0` to `n - 1`.

Given that `segment_length` is `n` and `current_sum` is the sum of the first `segment_length` digits of `ticket`, the `target_sum` should be equal to `current_sum` because both are defined to be the sum of the first `segment_length` digits of `ticket`.

Therefore, after executing the line of code, `target_sum` is assigned the value of `current_sum`.

Output State: **`current_sum` is the sum of the first `segment_length` digits of `ticket`, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `ticket` is a string consisting of `n` digits where each digit is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, `target_sum` is `current_sum`, `segment_count` is 0, and the other variables retain their initial values.**
