`segment_count` is assigned the value 0. The initial values of `current_sum`, `i`, `n`, `ticket`, and `target_sum` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`current_sum` is 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `ticket` is a string consisting of `n` digits where each digit is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, `target_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 0**
