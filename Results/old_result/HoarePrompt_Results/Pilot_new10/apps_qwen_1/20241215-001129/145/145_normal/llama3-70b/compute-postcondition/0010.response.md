`segments` is incremented by 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ticket` is a string consisting of $n$ digits where $2 \le n \le 100$, `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket` and is even, `target_sum` is `total_sum // 2`, `curr_sum` equals `target_sum`, `segments` is 1.
