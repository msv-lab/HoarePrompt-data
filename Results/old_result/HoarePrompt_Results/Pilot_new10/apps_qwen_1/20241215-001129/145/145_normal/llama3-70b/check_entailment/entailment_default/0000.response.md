Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the function `func_1` only checks if the total sum of the digits is even and whether there are at least two segments with the same sum. However, it does not ensure that these segments are non-intersecting.

Consider the following case:

**Input:**
```
6
123456
```

**Expected Output:**
```
NO
```

This input has an even total sum (1+2+3+4+5+6 = 21), and the sum is divisible by 2. The function would incorrectly return "YES" because it only checks for the possibility of having segments with equal sums without ensuring that the segments are non-intersecting.

To correctly solve the problem, the function needs to ensure that the segments are non-intersecting. A correct approach would involve trying different ways to partition the sequence into segments and checking if any partition results in segments with equal sums. The current implementation only checks for the possibility of such segments but does not enforce non-intersection.
