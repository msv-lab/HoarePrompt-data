Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic for calculating the sum of \( f(i) \) for \( i \) from 0 to \( m \). Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) Calculation**: The function `func_1` calculates the GCD of \( a \) and \( b \), which is necessary to handle the periodic nature of the jumps.

2. **Recursive Case Handling**: If the GCD is not 1, the function calls itself recursively with \( m \) divided by the GCD and \( a \) and \( b \) also divided by the GCD. This ensures that the problem is reduced to a smaller instance of the same problem but with a simplified step size.

3. **Base Case Handling**: When the GCD is 1, the function computes the number of reachable positions within the interval \([0, m]\). The formula used (`k * (k + 1) // 2` and `sum_m`) correctly counts the number of unique positions the frog can reach.

4. **Summation Calculation**: The final summation part correctly combines the results from different intervals to get the total sum.

Since the provided program handles all edge cases (e.g., when \( m \) is small, when the GCD is greater than 1, and the general case), and the logic seems sound, the program should work correctly for all valid inputs as described in the problem statement.
