`dp[i + a]` is assigned the value of `dp[i]`. The variable `i` is initially 1, and `a` is not specified, so we cannot determine the exact value of `dp[i + a]`. However, we know that `dp[i + a]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i]`, which is the current value of `dp[1]`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` is an integer where \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\), `dp[i + a]` is `dp[i]` (which is `dp[1]`) incremented by the original value of `dp[i]`**
