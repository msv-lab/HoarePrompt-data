`dp[0]` is assigned the value `1`. This initializes the first element of the `dp` list to `1`. The values of `m`, `a`, `b`, and the rest of the elements in the `dp` list remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is an integer where \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\); `a` is an integer where \(1 \leq a \leq 10^5\); `b` is an integer where \(1 \leq b \leq 10^5\); `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where `dp[0] = 1` and all other elements are `0`.**
