Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. Let's break down why the program is incorrect:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the sum of \( \sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i) \), where \( f(i) \) is the number of distinct integers the frog can reach starting from 0 without jumping outside the interval \([0, i]\).

2. **Key Points:**
   - The frog can jump to \( k + a \) or \( k - b \) from any position \( k \).
   - \( f(i) \) represents the number of distinct integers reachable within the interval \([0, i]\).
   - The GCD of \( a \) and \( b \) determines the fundamental step size the frog can take within the interval.

3. **Analyze the Provided Code:**
   - **Function `func_1`:** Computes the GCD of \( a \) and \( b \). This part is correct.
   - **Function `func_2`:**
     - It uses the GCD to simplify the problem when \( a \) and \( b \) are not coprime.
     - When \( g = \text{GCD}(a, b) \neq 1 \), it recursively calls itself with \( m \), \( a \), and \( b \) divided by \( g \) and multiplies the result by \( g \).
     - However, this recursive approach is incorrect because it does not handle the general case correctly.

4. **Specific Issues:**
   - The logic in `func_2` when \( g = 1 \) is almost correct but misses an important detail:
     - It calculates \( k = a + b - 1 \), which is the maximum distance the frog can jump within the interval.
     - The sum calculation for \( f(i) \) is also almost correct but needs adjustment:
       - The formula \( (m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2 \) for \( m < k \) is correct.
       - The formula for \( m \geq k \) should be adjusted to correctly account for the reachable numbers within the interval.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - The correct approach involves calculating the sum of the number of distinct integers reachable for each \( i \) from 0 to \( m \).
   - For each \( i \), the number of reachable integers can be derived from the properties of the GCD and the intervals formed by \( a \) and \( b \).

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not fully implement the required logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
