`k` is assigned the value `a + b - 1`. Given that `a` is a positive integer and `b` is a positive integer, the value of `k` will be a positive integer that is exactly one less than the sum of `a` and `b`. The states of the other variables (`m`, `a`, `b`, and `g`) are not affected.

Output State: **`m` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\), `a` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^5\), `b` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 10^5\), `g` is the return value of `func_1(a, b)` and \(g = 1\), `k` is a positive integer equal to `a + b - 1`.**
