The code `print('2')` simply prints the string '2' to the console. This does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the only change is the printed output, but since the question asks for the output state in terms of variables, no variables are updated.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value entered by the user, `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is the sum of all elements in `A` and must be 0, `i` is 4**
