Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify Initial Conditions:**
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers.
   - `prefix_sum` is a list where each element `prefix_sum[i]` (for `0 <= i <= n`) is the sum of the first `i` elements of the list `a`.
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `prefix_sum[n]` is not equal to `0`.
   - `k` is `2`.
   - `l` is `r`.
   - `r` is in the range `[1, n]`.

2. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - If `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to `0` and `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, then these conditions hold.
   - If `prefix_sum[r]` equals `0` or `prefix_sum[r]` equals `prefix_sum[n]`, then no changes are made to `k` and `l`.

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - The loop starts from `r = 1` and goes up to `r = n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n + 1`, and `r` is `n`.

4. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `r` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `r` will now be `n + 1`.

5. **Verify Conditions for Next Iteration:**
   - Since `r` is now `n + 1`, which is out of the range `[1, n]`, the loop condition `r in range(1, n + 1)` will fail.
   - Hence, the loop will terminate.

6. **State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop will terminate, no further changes are needed for `k` and `l`.
   - The value of `i` remains `n + 1`.
   - `r` becomes `n + 1`.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration (which is actually the end of the loop) will be:

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum` is a list where each element `prefix_sum[i]` (for `0 <= i <= n`) is the sum of the first `i` elements of the list `a`, `i` is `n + 1`, `prefix_sum[n]` is not equal to `0`, `k` is `2`, `l` is `n + 1`, and `r` is `n + 1`.**
