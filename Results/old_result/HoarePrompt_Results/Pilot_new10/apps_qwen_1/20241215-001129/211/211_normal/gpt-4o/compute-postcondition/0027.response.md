The code prints the value of `i + 2` and `n`. Since `i` is initially 5, `i + 2` evaluates to 7. The value of `n` remains unchanged. The states of the other variables (`A`, `total_sum`) are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value entered by the user, `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is the sum of all elements in `A` and must be 0, `i` is 7, `total_sum` is the sum of all elements in `A` and must be 0**
