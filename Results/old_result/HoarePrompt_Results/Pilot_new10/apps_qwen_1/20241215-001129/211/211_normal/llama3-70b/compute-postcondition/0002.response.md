The code initializes a new list `prefix_sum` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. This does not affect the values of `n` or `a`. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer representing the number of elements in the array A; `a` is a list of `n` integers; `prefix_sum` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.**
