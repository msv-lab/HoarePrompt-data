`i` is currently 0, so the code updates `prefix_sum[i + 1]` which is `prefix_sum[1]`. Given that `prefix_sum` initially is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `prefix_sum[0]` is 0. The code adds `a[0]` to `prefix_sum[0]`, so `prefix_sum[1]` will be `a[0]`. All other parts of the lists remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer representing the number of elements in the array A, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[0]` is 0 and `prefix_sum[1]` is `a[0]`, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 0**
