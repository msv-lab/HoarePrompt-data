According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is 3
- `prefix_sum[4]` is `prefix_sum[3] + a[3]`
- `n` remains the same and is greater than 0

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 4. Additionally, `n` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

State: **`i` is 4, `prefix_sum[4]` is `prefix_sum[3] + a[3]`, `n` remains the same and is greater than 0**
