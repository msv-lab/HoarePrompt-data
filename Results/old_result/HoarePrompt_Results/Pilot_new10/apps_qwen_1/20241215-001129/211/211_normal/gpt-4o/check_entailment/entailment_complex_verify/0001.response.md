Final: **False**

Reason: Based on the annotated version of the code, the original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not handle the case where all elements in the array are zero correctly. According to the annotations, if `total_sum` is zero, the program should print "NO". However, the current implementation only checks if there is at least one non-zero element and splits the array at that point. This means the program will incorrectly output "YES" for an array of all zeros, which does not satisfy the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of the program being incorrect is accurate.
