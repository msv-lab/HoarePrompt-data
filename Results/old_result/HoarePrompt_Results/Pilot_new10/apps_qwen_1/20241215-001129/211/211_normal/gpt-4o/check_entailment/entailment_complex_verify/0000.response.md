Final: **False**

Reason: The annotated version of the code clarifies that the program does not correctly handle the splitting of the array into subarrays where each subarray's sum is not zero. Specifically, the program only checks if the total sum of the array is zero and prints "NO" if it is. It does not check for and split the array into subarrays where each subarray's sum is non-zero. For example, the input `1 -1 2` should result in a valid split `1 -1` and `2`, but the current implementation incorrectly prints "NO". Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
