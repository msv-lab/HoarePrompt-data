The code simply prints 'YES', which does not affect any of the variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value entered by the user, `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is the sum of all elements in `A` and must be 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `A[i]` is not 0**
