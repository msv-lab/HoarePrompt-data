Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum` is a list where each element `prefix_sum[i]` (for `0 <= i <= n`) is the sum of the first `i` elements of the list `a`, `i` is `n + 1`, `prefix_sum[n]` is not equal to `0`, `k` is `2`, `l` is `r`, and `r` is in the range `[1, n]`. If `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to `0` and `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, then these conditions hold. If `prefix_sum[r]` equals `0` or `prefix_sum[r]` equals `prefix_sum[n]`, then no changes are made to `k` and `l`.***
