Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer representing the number of elements in the array `A`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum` is a list where each element `prefix_sum[i]` (for `0 <= i <= n`) is the sum of the first `i` elements of the list `a`, `i` is `n + 1`. If `prefix_sum[n]` equals 0, the value printed is 'NO'. Otherwise, `k` is the number of iterations the loop executed plus 1, `l` is the last value of `r` for which the condition `prefix_sum[r] != 0 and prefix_sum[r] != prefix_sum[n]` was satisfied, and the values of `k`, `l`, and `n` are printed.***
