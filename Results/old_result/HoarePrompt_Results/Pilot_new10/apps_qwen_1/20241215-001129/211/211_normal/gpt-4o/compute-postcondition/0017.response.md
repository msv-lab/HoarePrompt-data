The code `print('YES')` simply prints the string 'YES' to the console and does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the only change is the printed statement, but since the task is to provide the output state with updated variable values, we will include the printed statement as additional information.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value entered by the user, `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is the sum of all elements in `A` and must be 0, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 0; printed 'YES'**
