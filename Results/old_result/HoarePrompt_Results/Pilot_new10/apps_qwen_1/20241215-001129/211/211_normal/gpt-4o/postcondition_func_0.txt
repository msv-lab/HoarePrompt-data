The function reads an integer `n` followed by `n` integers to form an array `A`. It then calculates the sum of all elements in `A`. If the sum is not zero, it prints "YES", "1", "1", and "n". If the sum is zero, it checks each element in `A`. If any element is not zero, it prints "YES", "2", "1", the index (index + 1), followed by the index + 2 and `n`, and breaks the loop. If all elements are zero, it prints "NO".
