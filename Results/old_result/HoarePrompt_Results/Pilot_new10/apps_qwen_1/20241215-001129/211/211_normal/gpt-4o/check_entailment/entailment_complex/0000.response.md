Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of how the program adheres to the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of elements `n` and the array `A` as specified in the problem description.
2. **Sum Calculation**: It calculates the sum of the array elements. If the sum is not zero, it directly outputs "YES" and provides a valid split by outputting "1" for the number of subarrays and the entire array as a single subarray from index 1 to `n`.
3. **Zero Sum Handling**: If the sum is zero, the program iterates through the array to find the first non-zero element. Once found, it outputs "YES" and splits the array into two subarrays: from index 1 to the index of the first non-zero element and from the next index to the end of the array. This ensures that each subarray has a non-zero sum.
4. **Edge Case**: If all elements in the array are zero, the program correctly outputs "NO".

Given these points, the program correctly handles all scenarios described in the problem statement, thus meeting the requirements.
