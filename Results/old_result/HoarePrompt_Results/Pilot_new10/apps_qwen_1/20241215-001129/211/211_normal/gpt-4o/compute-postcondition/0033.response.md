The annotated code provides information about the state of the program at different points, but it may not always align with the actual code behavior. Let's analyze the code line by line to determine the actual functionality of the function.

1. The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the input, which represents the number of elements in an array `A`.
2. It then reads `n` integers from the input and stores them in the list `A`.
3. It calculates the sum of all elements in the array `A` and stores it in the variable `total_sum`.
4. If `total_sum` is not equal to 0, the function prints "YES", "1", "1" and "n".
5. If `total_sum` is 0, the function iterates through the array `A` and checks if any element is not 0. If such an element is found, it prints "YES", "2", "1", the index (index + 1), followed by the index + 2 and `n`, and breaks out of the loop.
6. If no element in `A` is not 0, the function prints "NO".

Let's summarize the functionality based on the actual code:

Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` followed by `n` integers to form an array `A`. It then calculates the sum of all elements in `A`. If the sum is not zero, it prints "YES", "1", "1", and "n". If the sum is zero, it checks each element in `A`. If any element is not zero, it prints "YES", "2", "1", the index (index + 1), followed by the index + 2 and `n`, and breaks the loop. If all elements are zero, it prints "NO".**
