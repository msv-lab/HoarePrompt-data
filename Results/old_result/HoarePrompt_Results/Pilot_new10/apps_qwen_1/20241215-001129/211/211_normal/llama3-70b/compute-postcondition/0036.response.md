The function `func` reads an array `A` of size `n` from the input, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, and each element of `A` is an integer between -10^3 and 10^3. The function then computes the prefix sums of the array and checks if the sum of the entire array is zero. If the sum is zero, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it finds the smallest subarray whose sum is not zero and prints its indices along with the index of the last element of the array.

To summarize the potential edge cases and missing logic from the code:
1. The function correctly handles the case where the sum of the array is zero, printing 'NO'.
2. The function correctly finds and prints the smallest subarray whose sum is not zero and prints its indices along with the index of the last element of the array.

Functionality: **The function reads an array A of size n from the input, computes the prefix sums of the array, and prints 'NO' if the sum of the entire array is zero. Otherwise, it finds and prints the smallest subarray whose sum is not zero, along with its start and end indices.**
