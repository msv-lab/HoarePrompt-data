Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly split the array into subarrays where the sum of elements in each subarray is not zero. Specifically, the code only checks if the sum of the entire array is zero and prints "NO" in that case. It then finds and prints the smallest subarray whose sum is not zero, along with its start and end indices. However, the problem description requires splitting the array into multiple subarrays, not just finding a single subarray.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
1 2 3 -5
```
The code will output:
```
YES
4
1 1
2 2
3 3
4 4
```
This is incorrect because the entire array can be split into subarrays `[1]`, `[2]`, `[3]`, and `[-5]`, which individually have non-zero sums. The code, however, incorrectly treats the entire array as a single subarray.

Additionally, the code does not handle the case where the entire array has a non-zero sum but cannot be split further (e.g., `[1, -1, 1, -1]`). The code would output "NO" in such cases, which is also incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the required functionality for every potential case, and hence the correctness is **False**.
