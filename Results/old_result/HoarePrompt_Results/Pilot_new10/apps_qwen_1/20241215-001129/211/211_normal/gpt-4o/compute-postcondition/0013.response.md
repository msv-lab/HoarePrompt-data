The print statement `print(i + 2, n)` will execute, but since there are no defined values for `i` and `n` in the initial state, they remain unchanged. The only information given is that the printed output is '2'. This implies that the first argument to the print function, `i + 2`, when combined with the second argument `n`, results in the string '2'. However, without specific values for `i` and `n`, we cannot determine their exact values, but we know that `i + 2` must be '2' and `n` can be any value (since it's not used in the condition).

Output State: **printed output is '2', `i` is an integer such that `i + 2` equals '2', `n` is any value**
