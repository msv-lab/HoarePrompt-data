`i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The value of `prefix_sum[i + 1]` is updated based on the given formula, which means `prefix_sum[4]` (since `i + 1` equals 4) is assigned the value of `prefix_sum[3] + a[3]`. However, since `a[3]` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot provide its specific value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `prefix_sum[4]` is `prefix_sum[3] + a[3]`, `n` remains the same (greater than 0)**
