The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it reads input from the user, where the first line contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of elements in the array `A`, and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` ( - 10^3 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^3) representing the elements of the array `A`. Based on the input, the function does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the given information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to read an array `A` of size `n` from the input and process it according to its requirements (though the specific processing is not detailed in the given information).

Functionality: **The function reads an array `A` of size `n` from the input, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, and each element of `A` is an integer between -10^3 and 10^3.**
