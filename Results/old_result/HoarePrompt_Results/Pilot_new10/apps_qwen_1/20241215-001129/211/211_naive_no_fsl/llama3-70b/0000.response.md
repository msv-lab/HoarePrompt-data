Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program fails when the entire array sums to zero. According to the problem description, if the sum of the entire array is zero, it should output "NO". However, the current implementation will incorrectly output "YES" and attempt to split the array, which violates the problem constraints.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
0 0 0
```

The program will output:
```
YES
1
1 3
```

This is incorrect because the entire array sums to zero, and the correct output should be "NO". Therefore, the program is incorrect.
