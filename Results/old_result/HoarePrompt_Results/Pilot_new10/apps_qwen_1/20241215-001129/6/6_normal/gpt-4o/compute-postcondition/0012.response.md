The code calculates the minimum number of moves required to move from position `pos` to either position `l` or `r`. The expression `min(move_to_l + (r - l + 2), move_to_r + (r - l + 2))` is used to determine this minimum.

- `move_to_l` is the absolute difference between `pos` and `l`.
- `move_to_r` is the absolute difference between `pos` and `r`.

The formula `move_to_l + (r - l + 2)` represents the total number of moves if moving to `l` first and then to `r`, including the steps from `l` to `r` which are `r - l + 1`, plus one additional move to account for the possibility of an extra step.

Similarly, `move_to_r + (r - l + 2)` represents the total number of moves if moving to `r` first and then to `l`, again including the steps from `l` to `r` which are `r - l + 1`, plus one additional move.

Since `close_both_sides` is assigned the minimum of these two values, its value depends on the specific values of `move_to_l`, `move_to_r`, `r - l + 2`, and thus `r` and `l`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `l` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `r` is an integer between `l` and `n`, `r != n`, `close_both_sides` is `min(abs(pos - l) + (r - l + 2), abs(pos - r) + (r - l + 2))`, `move_to_r` is `abs(pos - r)`, `move_to_l` is `abs(pos - l)`**
