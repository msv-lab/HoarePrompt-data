The code calculates the absolute difference between `pos` and `r` and adds 1 to it. Since `l` is initially set to 1 and the condition `(l != 1 or r != n)` is true (as `l` cannot be 1 and `r` cannot be `n`), `r` must be assigned a value between `l` and `n` excluding the boundary conditions. The output of the `print` function will be the result of `abs(pos - r) + 1`. However, without knowing the exact value of `r`, we cannot determine the exact output.

Given that `l` is 1 and remains unchanged, the output state will include `l` being 1, and the other variables will be updated according to the calculation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `l` is 1, `r` is an integer between 1 and `n` (excluding 1 and `n`), and the output is `abs(pos - r) + 1`.**
