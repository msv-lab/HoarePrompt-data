The code assigns the value of `abs(pos - l)` to the variable `move_to_l`. This means `move_to_l` will be the absolute difference between `pos` and `l`. The other variables (`n`, `pos`, `l`, `r`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `l` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `r` is an integer between `l` and `n`, and `r != n`; `move_to_l` is the absolute difference between `pos` and `l`**
