Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `l` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `r` is an integer between `l` and `n` with `r != n`. If `r == n`, the output is `abs(pos - l) + 1`. Otherwise, `close_both_sides` is defined as `min(abs(pos - l) + (r - l + 2), abs(pos - r) + (r - l + 2))`, `move_to_r` is `abs(pos - r)`, `move_to_l` is `abs(pos - l)`, and `close_both_sides` is printed.***
