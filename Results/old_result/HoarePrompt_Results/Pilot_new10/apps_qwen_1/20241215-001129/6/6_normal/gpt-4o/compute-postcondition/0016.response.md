Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `l` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `r` is an integer between `l` and `n`. After the execution of the if-else block, if `l == 1` and `r == n`, the console displays `0`. Otherwise, if `l == 1`, the console displays `abs(pos - r) + 1`. If `r == n`, the console displays `abs(pos - l) + 1`. Otherwise, `close_both_sides` is defined as the minimum of `abs(pos - l) + (r - l + 2)` and `abs(pos - r) + (r - l + 2)`, `move_to_r` is `abs(pos - r)`, `move_to_l` is `abs(pos - l)`, and `close_both_sides` is printed.***
