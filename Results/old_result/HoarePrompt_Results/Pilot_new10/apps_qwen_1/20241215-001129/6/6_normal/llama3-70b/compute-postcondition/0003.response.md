`ans` is incremented by the value of `l - pos`. Given the initial conditions, `ans` was 0, `l` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n` with `pos` less than `l`, and `r` is an integer between `l` and `n`. Since `l - pos` is a specific value based on the given ranges, `ans` will be updated accordingly.

Let's denote the specific values for clarity:
- `l` is some integer between 1 and `n`.
- `pos` is some integer between 1 and `l-1` (since `pos` is less than `l`).
- `l - pos` will be a positive integer between 1 and `l-1`.

Therefore, `ans` will be updated to `ans + (l - pos)`, which simplifies to `l - pos` since `ans` was initially 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n` with `pos` less than `l`, `l` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `r` is an integer between `l` and `n`, `ans` is `l - pos`**
