The code updates the value of `ans` by adding the difference between `pos` and `r` to the current value of `ans`. Based on the initial state, `ans` is `l - pos` if `pos` is less than `l`, otherwise `ans` is 0. Since `pos` is greater than `r`, `ans` remains 0. Therefore, the new value of `ans` is `pos - r`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `ans` is initially 0 because `pos` is greater than `r`.
2. The code `ans += pos - r` adds `pos - r` to the current value of `ans`, which is 0.

Therefore, the updated value of `ans` is `pos - r`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `l` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `r` is an integer between `l` and `n`, `ans` is `pos - r`, and `pos` is greater than `r`.**
