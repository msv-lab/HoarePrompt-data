Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. The initial conditions are:
   - `n` is an integer between 1 and 100.
   - `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`.
   - `l` is an integer between 1 and `n`.
   - `r` is an integer between `l` and `n`.
   - If `pos` is greater than `r`, `ans` is `pos - r`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `l - pos` if `pos` is less than `l`, otherwise `ans` remains 0.

2. The code updates `ans` as follows:
   - `ans += min(pos - 1, n - r) + max(0, l - 1)`

We need to consider different cases for `pos` relative to `l` and `r`.

### Case 1: `pos` is greater than `r`
- In this case, `ans` is already set to `pos - r`.
- We need to add `min(pos - 1, n - r) + max(0, l - 1)` to `ans`.
  - Since `pos > r`, `min(pos - 1, n - r)` will be `min(pos - 1, n - r)`.
  - `max(0, l - 1)` will be `max(0, l - 1)`.

Thus, `ans` becomes:
\[ ans = (pos - r) + \min(pos - 1, n - r) + \max(0, l - 1) \]

### Case 2: `pos` is less than `l`
- In this case, `ans` is already set to `l - pos`.
- We need to add `min(pos - 1, n - r) + max(0, l - 1)` to `ans`.
  - Since `pos < l`, `min(pos - 1, n - r)` will be `min(pos - 1, n - r)`.
  - `max(0, l - 1)` will be `max(0, l - 1)`.

Thus, `ans` becomes:
\[ ans = (l - pos) + \min(pos - 1, n - r) + \max(0, l - 1) \]

### Case 3: `l <= pos <= r`
- In this case, `ans` is already set to 0.
- We need to add `min(pos - 1, n - r) + max(0, l - 1)` to `ans`.
  - Since `l <= pos <= r`, `min(pos - 1, n - r)` will be `min(pos - 1, n - r)`.
  - `max(0, l - 1)` will be `max(0, l - 1)`.

Thus, `ans` becomes:
\[ ans = \min(pos - 1, n - r) + \max(0, l - 1) \]

### Updated Variables
- `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged.
- `ans` is updated according to the above rules.

### Final Output State
- The updated value of `ans` is dependent on the values of `pos`, `l`, `r`, `n`, and the case in which they fall.
- The final state is:
  - `n` is an integer between 1 and 100.
  - `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`.
  - `l` is an integer between 1 and `n`.
  - `r` is an integer between `l` and `n`.
  - `ans` is updated based on the rules described above.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`; `l` is an integer between 1 and `n`; `r` is an integer between `l` and `n`; `ans` is updated based on the rules: if `pos > r`, `ans = (pos - r) + \min(pos - 1, n - r) + \max(0, l - 1)`. If `pos < l`, `ans = (l - pos) + \min(pos - 1, n - r) + \max(0, l - 1)`. If `l <= pos <= r`, `ans = \min(pos - 1, n - r) + \max(0, l - 1)`.**
