Functionality: **The function accepts four integers `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` and calculates a value `ans` based on the positions relative to `l` and `r`. Specifically, it adds the minimum distance from `pos` to `l` and from `pos` to `r`, ensuring these distances do not go beyond the boundaries of 1 and `n`. Finally, it prints the computed value `ans`.**
