The code `ans = 0` initializes the variable `ans` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `pos`, `l`, or `r`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `l` is an integer between 1 and `r`, `r` is an integer between `l` and `n`, `ans` is 0**
