The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters in its definition. However, based on the constraints provided, it seems there might be some implicit understanding or external context regarding the variables `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r`. Given the constraints:

- `n` is an integer between 1 and 100.
- `pos` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \geq pos \geq 1\).
- `l` and `r` are integers such that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq n\).

The output has two cases, but since the function definition does not include these parameters, we need to consider the possible return values based on the provided constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts implicitly defined parameters n, pos, l, and r, and returns based on the following conditions: If `pos` is outside the range [1, n], it returns an error message; otherwise, it returns whether `l` is less than or equal to `pos` and `pos` is less than or equal to `r`.**
