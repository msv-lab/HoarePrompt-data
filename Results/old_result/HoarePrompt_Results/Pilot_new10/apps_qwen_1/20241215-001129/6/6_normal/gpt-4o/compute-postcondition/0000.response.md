The code reads four integers from input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r`. Since the initial values of these variables are defined as constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), after reading the inputs, these constraints will still hold true.

The input will be split into four integers and assigned to the respective variables. Therefore, the output state will reflect that these variables now hold the values read from the input while still adhering to their constraints.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `l` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `r` is an integer between `l` and `n` and all these values are the ones read from input.**
