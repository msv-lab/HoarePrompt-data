Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment states that the program is correct, but upon reviewing the code and the problem description, there is an issue with the handling of the case where \(x\) is greater than or equal to \(y\) but not necessarily greater than the sum of \(y\) and \(z\). Specifically, the code does not correctly handle this scenario. According to the problem description, if \(x \geq y + z\), the result should be `+`, and if \(x \leq y\), the result should be `-`. However, the code incorrectly prints `?` in these cases.

The correct logic should be:
- If \(x > y + z\), print `+`.
- If \(x < y\), print `-`.
- If \(x == y\):
  - If \(z == 0\), print `0`.
  - If \(z > 0\), print `?`.
- In all other cases (i.e., \(x > y\) and \(x \leq y + z\) or \(x < y + z\) and \(x \geq y\)), print `?`.

The provided code incorrectly prints `?` in cases where it should print `+` or `-`. Therefore, the original assessment is not accurate, and the program needs to be corrected.
