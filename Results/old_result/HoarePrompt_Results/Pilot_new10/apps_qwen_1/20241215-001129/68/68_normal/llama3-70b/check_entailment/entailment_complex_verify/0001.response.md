Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The program handles all the specified conditions accurately:
- If \(x > y + z\), it prints `+`.
- If \(x < y\), it prints `-`.
- If \(x == y\) and \(z == 0\), it prints `0`.
- If \(x == y\) and \(z > 0\), it prints `?`.
- In all other cases, it prints `?`.

The annotations align with the original assessment, which concluded that the program is correct. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
