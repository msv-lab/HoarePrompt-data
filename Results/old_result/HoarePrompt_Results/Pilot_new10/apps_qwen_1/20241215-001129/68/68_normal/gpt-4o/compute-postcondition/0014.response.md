The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The parameters `x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq x, y, z \leq 100\). However, since these are not passed as arguments to the function, they must be defined within the function itself or provided elsewhere.

Given the output cases, the function does not seem to use the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` directly. Instead, it has predefined outputs. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to return a specific value without accepting any parameters.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and returns a specific value.**
