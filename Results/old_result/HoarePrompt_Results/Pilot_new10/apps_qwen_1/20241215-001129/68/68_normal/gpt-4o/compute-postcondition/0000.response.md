The code `x, y, z = map(int, input().split())` reads three space-separated integers from input and assigns them to `x`, `y`, and `z`. Since the initial state specifies that `x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers between 0 and 100, the new values assigned to these variables will also be non-negative integers between 0 and 100. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are now determined by the input, and the original conditions apply to these new values.

Output State: **`x` is an integer between 0 and 100, `y` is an integer between 0 and 100, `z` is an integer between 0 and 100**
