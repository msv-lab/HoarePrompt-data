The code `x, y, z = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `x`, `y`, and `z`. Since the initial values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers (0 <= x, y, z <= 100), after the input, these variables will now hold the values entered by the user, which must also fall within the specified range.

The output state after executing this code will be:

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers entered by the user and each lies in the range 0 <= x, y, z <= 100**
