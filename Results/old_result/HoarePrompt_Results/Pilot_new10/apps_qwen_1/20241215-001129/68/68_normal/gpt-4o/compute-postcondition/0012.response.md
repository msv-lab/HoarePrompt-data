Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer between 0 and 100, `y` is an integer between 0 and 100, `z` is an integer between 0 and 100, `max_upvotes` is `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is `y`, `max_downvotes` is `y + z`, and `(max_upvotes >= min_downvotes)`. If `max_downvotes < min_upvotes`, then the condition remains unchanged. If `max_downvotes >= min_upvotes`, then the condition also remains unchanged.***
