Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly handles all the given conditions and examples. Let's break down the logic:

1. If \(x > y + z\), the program prints `+` because there will always be more upvotes than downvotes.
2. If \(x < y\), the program prints `-` because there will always be more downvotes than upvotes.
3. If \(x == y\):
   - If \(z == 0\), the program prints `0` because the number of upvotes and downvotes is equal.
   - If \(z > 0\), the program prints `?` because the result is uncertain due to the unknown votes.
4. In all other cases, the program prints `?` indicating the result is uncertain.

This covers all the scenarios mentioned in the problem description and the provided examples. Therefore, the program is correct.
