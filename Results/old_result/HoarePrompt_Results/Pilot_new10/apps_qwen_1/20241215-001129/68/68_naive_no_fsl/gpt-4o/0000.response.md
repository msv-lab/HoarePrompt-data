Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided program correctly handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes `min_upvotes` and `max_upvotes` to account for the minimum and maximum possible number of upvotes considering the unknown votes (`z`). Similarly, it initializes `min_downvotes` and `max_downvotes` for downvotes.

2. **Comparison**:
   - If `max_upvotes` is less than `min_downvotes`, it means there are more downvotes than upvotes in all scenarios, so the result is `-`.
   - If `max_downvotes` is less than `min_upvotes`, it means there are more upvotes than downvotes in all scenarios, so the result is `+`.
   - Otherwise, since there is at least one scenario where the outcome could be either `+`, `-`, or `0`, the result is `?`.

Given this logic, the program correctly handles all potential cases, including edge cases such as:
- When `z` is zero (all votes are known).
- When the votes are exactly balanced or slightly unbalanced due to the unknown votes.

Since the program follows the problem description for every potential case, the correctness is **True**.
