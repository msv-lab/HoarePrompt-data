The code `final_y += 1` increments the value of `final_y` by 1. Since `final_y` was initially 0, it is now 1. The other variables (`n`, `operations`, `x`, `y`, and the current operation) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' characters, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `final_x` is 0, `final_y` is 1, the current operation is 'U'**
