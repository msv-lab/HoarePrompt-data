`dx` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `dx` is adjusted based on the operation and its conditions, but the exact value is not specified. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`ops` is a non-empty string with at least two more characters, `ux` is 0, `uy` is 0, `dx` is the original value plus 1, `dy` is `y - uy`, and `res` is 1 if the operation is 'L' and `dx` is less than 0, otherwise `res` is 2.**
