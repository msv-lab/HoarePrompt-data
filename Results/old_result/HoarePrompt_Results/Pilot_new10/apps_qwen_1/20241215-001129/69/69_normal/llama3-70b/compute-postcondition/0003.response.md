The code initializes four variables `ux`, `uy`, `lx`, and `ly` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `ops`, `x`, or `y`. Therefore, the only changes are to the new variables initialized to 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `ops` is a string of operations, `x` is an integer such that -10^9 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `y` is an integer such that -10^9 ≤ y ≤ 10^9; `ux` is 0, `uy` is 0, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0.**
