`final_x` is decremented by 1. The value of `n` is at least 1, `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' characters, `x` is either 0 or 1, `y` is either 0 or 1, and `i` must be less than `n`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`final_x` is decreased by 1, `n` is at least 1, `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' characters, `x` is either 0 or 1, `y` is either 0 or 1, and `i` must be less than `n`.**
