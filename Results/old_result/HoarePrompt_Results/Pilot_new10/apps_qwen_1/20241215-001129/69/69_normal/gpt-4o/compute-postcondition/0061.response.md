Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' characters, `x` is the net change in the horizontal position starting from 0, `y` is the net change in the vertical position starting from 0, `final_x` is `x`, `final_y` is `y`, `dx` is 0, `dy` is either -1 or 0 depending on the current operation, `min_length` is `inf`, `current_x` is either -1 or 0, `current_y` is 1 or -1, `position_map` is `{(0, 0): -1}`. If the current operation is 'U', `current_y` is set to 1. If the current operation is 'D', `dy` remains -1, otherwise `current_x` changes to -1 and `dy` becomes 0.***
