Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' characters, `x` is either 0 or 1, `y` is either 0 or 1, and if `op == 'D'`, `final_y` is -1 if it was 0 and 0 if it was 1. Otherwise, `final_x` is decreased by 1 if `op == 'L'`, increased by 1 if `op == 'R'`, and remains unchanged if `op` is neither 'L' nor 'R'.***
