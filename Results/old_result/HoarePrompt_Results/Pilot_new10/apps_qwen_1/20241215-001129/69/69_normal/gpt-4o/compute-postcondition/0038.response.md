`dy` is assigned the value of `y - final_y`. Given that `y` is the net change in the vertical position starting from 0 and `final_y` is also `y`, the value of `dy` will be 0 because `y - y` equals 0. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' characters, `x` is the net change in the horizontal position starting from 0, `y` is the net change in the vertical position starting from 0, `final_x` is `x`, `final_y` is `y`, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 0**
