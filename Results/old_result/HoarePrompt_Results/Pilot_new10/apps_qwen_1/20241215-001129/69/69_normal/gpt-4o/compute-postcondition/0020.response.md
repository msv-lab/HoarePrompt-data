`final_y` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `final_y` is not specified directly, but since no initial value is given for `final_y` in the preconditions, we assume it is an existing variable. The operations string `operations`, the starting coordinates `x` and `y`, and the next operation `op` remain unchanged. The value of `final_y` is updated by subtracting 1 from its current value.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 1; `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' characters; `x` is 0; `y` is 0; the next operation `op` must be one of 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R'; `final_y` is decreased by 1.**
