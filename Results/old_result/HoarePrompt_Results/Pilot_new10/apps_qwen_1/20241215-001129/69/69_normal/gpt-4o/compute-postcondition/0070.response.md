`current_x` is decremented by 1. Given that `current_x` was either -1 or 0, it is now -1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' characters; `x` is the net change in the horizontal position starting from 0; `y` is the net change in the vertical position starting from 0; `final_x` is `x`; `final_y` is `y`; `dx` is 0; `dy` is either -1 or 0; `min_length` is `inf`; `current_x` is -1; `current_y` is 1 or -1; `position_map` is `{(0, 0): -1, (-1, 1): i + 1}` if `current_y` was 1, otherwise `{(0, 0): -1, (-1, -1): i + 1}`; `target_pos` is one of `(0, 0)`, `(-1, 0)`, or `(-1, -1)`. If `target_pos` is in `position_map`, `min_length` is updated to `i + 2`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.**
