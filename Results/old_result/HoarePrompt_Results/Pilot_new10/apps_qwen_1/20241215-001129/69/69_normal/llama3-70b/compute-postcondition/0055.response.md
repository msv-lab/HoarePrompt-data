The initial state includes that `ops` is a non-empty string, `ux` is 0, `uy` is 0, `dx` is `x - ux`, `dy` is `y - uy`, `res` is 0, `dx` is less than 0, and the operation `op` is 'L'. 

The code snippet is:
```python
dx += 1
```

This means `dx` is incremented by 1. Since `dx` was initially less than 0, after adding 1, `dx` will now be -1 + 1 = 0.

Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`ops` is a non-empty string, `ux` is 0, `uy` is 0, `dx` is 0, `dy` is `y - uy`, `res` is 0, and the operation `op` is 'L'.**
