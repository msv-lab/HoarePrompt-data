`final_x` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `final_x` is 0, so after executing the code, `final_x` becomes 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' characters, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `final_x` is 1, `final_y` is 0, and the operation `op` is 'R'.**
