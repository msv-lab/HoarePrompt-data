The code `current_x = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `current_x`. This initializes the current horizontal position to 0, which was previously set to 0 but is now explicitly stated. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' characters, `x` is the net change in the horizontal position starting from 0, `y` is the net change in the vertical position starting from 0, `final_x` is `x`, `final_y` is `y`, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 0, `min_length` is `inf`, `current_x` is 0, `dx` is not 0 or `dy` is not 0**
