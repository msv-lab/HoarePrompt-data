The code `res = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `res`. This is the only change made to the variables. The initial values of `ops`, `ux`, `uy`, `dx`, and `dy` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ops` is a non-empty string, `ux` is 0, `uy` is 0, `dx` is `x - ux`, `dy` is `y - uy`, `res` is 0 and both `dx` is greater than or equal to 0 and `dy` is greater than or equal to 0.**
