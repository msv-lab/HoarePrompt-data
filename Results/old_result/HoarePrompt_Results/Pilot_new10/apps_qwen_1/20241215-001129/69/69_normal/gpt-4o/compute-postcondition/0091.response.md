Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0; `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' characters; `x` is the net change in the horizontal position starting from 0; `y` is the net change in the vertical position starting from 0; `final_x` is `x`; `final_y` is `y`; `dx` is 0; `dy` is either -1 or 0; `target_pos` is the tuple `(current_x, current_y + dy)`; `position_map` is updated such that the key `(current_x, current_y)` maps to the value `i + 1`; if `target_pos` is in `position_map`, `min_length` is updated to be the minimum of its original value and `i - position_map[target_pos]`.***
