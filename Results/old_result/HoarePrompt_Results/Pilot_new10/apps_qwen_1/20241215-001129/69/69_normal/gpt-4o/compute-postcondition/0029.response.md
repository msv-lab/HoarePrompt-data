`final_y` is decremented by 1. The value of `final_y` was previously either 0 or 1, so after decrementing by 1, it will now be -1 if it was 0, or 0 if it was 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be at least 1; `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' characters; `x` is either 0 or 1; `y` is either 0 or 1; `i` must be less than `n`; `final_y` is -1 if it was 0 and 0 if it was 1.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 1; `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' characters; `x` is either 0 or 1; `y` is either 0 or 1; `i` must be less than `n`; `final_y` is -1 if it was 0 and 0 if it was 1.**
