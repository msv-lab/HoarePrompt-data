The code `position_map[current_x, current_y] = i` updates the `position_map` dictionary with the key `(current_x, current_y)` and assigns the value `i`. This means that the current position `(current_x, current_y)` is now associated with the index `i` in the operations string.

The variables `n`, `operations`, `x`, `y`, `final_x`, `final_y`, `dx`, `dy`, `current_x`, `current_y`, `target_pos`, and `position_map` remain unaffected except for the `position_map` itself, which is updated.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' characters, `x` is the net change in the horizontal position starting from 0, `y` is the net change in the vertical position starting from 0, `final_x` is `x`, `final_y` is `y`, `dx` is 0, `dy` is either -1 or 0, `current_x` and `current_y` are either -1, 0, or 1 depending on the operations, `target_pos` is the tuple `(current_x + dx, current_y + dy)`, and `position_map` is updated such that the key `(current_x, current_y)` maps to the value `i`.**
