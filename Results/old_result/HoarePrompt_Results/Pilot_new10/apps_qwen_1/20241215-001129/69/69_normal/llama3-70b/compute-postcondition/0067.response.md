`res` is incremented by 1. The value of `ops`, `ux`, `uy`, `dx`, and `dy` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the Output State is: `ops` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `ux` is 0, `uy` is 0, `dx` is adjusted based on the operation and its conditions, `dy` is `y - uy`, and `res` is 2 if the operation is 'L' and `dx` is less than 0, otherwise `res` is 1.
