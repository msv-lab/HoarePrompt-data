The code `final_x -= 1` subtracts 1 from the value of `final_x`. The initial state of `x` is 0, and `final_x` is not explicitly mentioned to have a specific value in the initial state, but it must be at least 1. After the operation, `final_x` will be reduced by 1.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' characters, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, and `final_x` is at least 0.**
