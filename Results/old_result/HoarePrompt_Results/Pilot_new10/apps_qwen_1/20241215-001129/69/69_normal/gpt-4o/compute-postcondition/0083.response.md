The code `current_x -= 1` subtracts 1 from the value of `current_x`. Since `current_x` can be -1, 0, or 1 depending on the operations at index `i+1` in `operations`, the new value of `current_x` will be `-2` if it was `1`, `-1` if it was `0`, or `0` if it was `-1`.

Other variables remain unchanged:
- `n` is still greater than 0.
- `operations` remains a string of length `n` consisting of 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R'.
- `x` is the net change in the horizontal position starting from 0.
- `y` is the net change in the vertical position starting from 0.
- `final_x` is `x`.
- `final_y` is `y`.
- `dx` is 0.
- `dy` is either -1 or 0.
- `target_pos` is the tuple `(current_x + dx, current_y + dy)`.
- `position_map` is updated such that the key `(current_x, current_y)` maps to the value `i + 1`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` is the net change in the horizontal position starting from 0, `y` is the net change in the vertical position starting from 0, `final_x` is `x`, `final_y` is `y`, `dx` is 0, `dy` is either -1 or 0, `target_pos` is the tuple `(current_x + dx, current_y + dy)`, `position_map` is updated such that the key `(current_x, current_y)` maps to the value `i + 1`, and `current_x` is decreased by 1.**
