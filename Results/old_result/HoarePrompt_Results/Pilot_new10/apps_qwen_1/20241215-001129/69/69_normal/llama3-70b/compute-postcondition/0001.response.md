The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, and the variable `ops` is assigned the value of `input()`. The value of `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and `ops` is a string consisting of 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R' characters representing operations. The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `ops` is a string of operations, `x` is an integer such that -10^9 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `y` is an integer such that -10^9 ≤ y ≤ 10^9; `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, and `ops` is assigned the value of `input()`**
