The code sets `final_y` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `operations`, `x`, `y`, or `final_x`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `operations` is a string consisting of n characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` is an integer such that -10^9 <= x <= 10^9, `y` is an integer such that -10^9 <= y <= 10^9, `final_x` is 0, `final_y` is 0.**
