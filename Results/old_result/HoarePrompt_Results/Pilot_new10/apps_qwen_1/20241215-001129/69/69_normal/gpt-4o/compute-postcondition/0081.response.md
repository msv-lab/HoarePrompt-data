The code `current_y += 1` increments the value of `current_y` by 1. Given that `current_y` could be -1, 0, or 1 based on the operations at index `i+1` in `operations`, after this operation, `current_y` will be one of these values plus 1. Specifically, if `current_y` was -1, it becomes 0; if `current_y` was 0, it becomes 1; and if `current_y` was 1, it becomes 2. However, since `current_y` can only be -1, 0, or 1, it cannot become 2. Thus, the valid new values for `current_y` are 0 or 1.

Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' characters; `x` is the net change in the horizontal position starting from 0; `y` is the net change in the vertical position starting from 0; `final_x` is `x`; `final_y` is `y`; `dx` is 0; `dy` is either -1 or 0; `current_x` and `current_y` are either -1, 0, or 1 depending on the operations at index `i+1` in `operations`; `target_pos` is the tuple `(current_x + dx, current_y + dy)`; `position_map` is updated such that the key `(current_x, current_y)` maps to the value `i + 1`; `current_y` is incremented by 1.**
