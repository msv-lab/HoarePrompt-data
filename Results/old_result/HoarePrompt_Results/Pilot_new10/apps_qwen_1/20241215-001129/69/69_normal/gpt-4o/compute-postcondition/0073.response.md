Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0; `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' characters; `x` is the net change in the horizontal position starting from 0; `y` is the net change in the vertical position starting from 0; `final_x` is `x`; `final_y` is `y`; `dx` is 0; `dy` is either -1 or 0; `min_length` is updated based on whether `target_pos` is in `position_map`; if `target_pos` is in `position_map`, `min_length` is updated to `i + 2`; `current_x` and `current_y` are either -1, 0, or 1 depending on the operations; `position_map` is updated accordingly based on the operations performed.***
