Postcondition: ***`ops` is a non-empty string, and `uy` and `ux` are integers. If `op` is 'U', `uy` is increased by 1. If `op` is 'D', `uy` is decreased by 1. If `op` is 'R', `ux` is incremented by 1. If `op` is 'L', `ux` is decremented by 1. If `op` is neither 'R' nor 'L', `ux` remains unchanged.***
