Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Let's verify this by considering various cases:

1. When `t` is less than or equal to `n`:
   - For `t <= n`, the function returns `min(t, k)`. This correctly counts the number of spectators who are still standing because they haven't reached their sitting time yet.
   
2. When `t` is greater than `n`:
   - For `t > n`, the function returns `k - (t - n) % k`. This correctly calculates the number of spectators standing after the initial phase of `n` seconds, taking into account the periodic nature of the wave.

Given these considerations, the function handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
