Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case when `t` is greater than `n`. According to the problem description, at time `n + 1`, the `(n + 1 - k)`-th spectator sits, and this pattern continues. However, the program does not account for this behavior after `t = n`.

For example, consider the following input:
```
10 5 16
```
According to the problem description, at `t = 16`, the `6-th` spectator should sit, and the number of standing spectators should be `4`. However, the program will output `5`, which is incorrect.

To fix this, the program needs to handle the case when `t > n` by determining how many spectators have sat down since `t = n`. This can be done by calculating the remainder of `(t - n)` when divided by `k` and adjusting the count of standing spectators accordingly.
