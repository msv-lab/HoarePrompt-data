Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Initial Conditions**: The program starts by reading three integers \( n \), \( k \), and \( t \) from the input, which aligns with the input format specified.

2. **Case Analysis**:
   - For \( t \leq k \):
     - All spectators from 1 to \( t \) are standing, so the number of standing spectators is exactly \( t \). This matches the behavior described in the problem statement.
   - For \( k < t \leq n \):
     - Spectators from 1 to \( k \) will sit down one by one, and new spectators starting from \( k+1 \) will stand up until \( t \). Since all \( k \) initial spectators have sat down by this point, the number of standing spectators is \( k \).
   - For \( t > n \):
     - After all spectators have stood and sat according to the pattern, the process repeats. By time \( n \), all \( k \) initial spectators have sat down, and no more spectators will stand because we have already considered all \( n \) spectators. Therefore, the number of standing spectators is \( n + k - t \).

Given these conditions, the program correctly handles all cases as per the problem description, ensuring the number of standing spectators is calculated accurately at any given time \( t \). Hence, the program is correct.
