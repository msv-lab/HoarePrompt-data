`n`, `k`, and `t` are assigned the values from the input split into integers. The previous values of these variables are replaced by the new input values. The constraints remain the same: 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer; 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k.**
