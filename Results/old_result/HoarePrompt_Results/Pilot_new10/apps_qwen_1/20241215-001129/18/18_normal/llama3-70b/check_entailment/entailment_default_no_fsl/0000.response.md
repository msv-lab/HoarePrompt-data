Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for calculating the number of standing spectators at time `t` when `t > n` needs to account for the fact that the wave pattern repeats after `n` seconds.

Let's analyze the issue:
- For `t <= n`, the number of standing spectators is simply `min(t, k)`, which is correct.
- For `t > n`, the number of standing spectators is supposed to be `k - (t - n) % k`. However, this formula only works correctly when `(t - n) % k` gives the position within the repeating cycle of `k` spectators. 

Consider the following example:
- Input: `10 5 12`
- According to the problem description, at `t = 12`, the 3rd spectator should be sitting, and the 9th to 12th spectators should be standing. Thus, the number of standing spectators should be 3.

However, the current implementation will calculate:
- `(t - n) % k = (12 - 10) % 5 = 2`
- `k - (t - n) % k = 5 - 2 = 3`

This appears to work in this specific case. But let's consider another case to confirm:

- Input: `10 5 17`
- According to the problem description, at `t = 17`, the 2nd spectator should be sitting, and the 12th to 17th spectators should be standing. Thus, the number of standing spectators should be 5.

However, the current implementation will calculate:
- `(t - n) % k = (17 - 10) % 5 = 2`
- `k - (t - n) % k = 5 - 2 = 3`

This is incorrect. The correct number of standing spectators should be 5, not 3. 

Therefore, the program does not handle all cases correctly, leading to **False**.
