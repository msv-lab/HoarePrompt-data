Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment is accurate. The annotated code clearly shows that the function correctly handles both cases where `t <= n` and `t > n`. The logic `min(t, k)` ensures that the number of standing spectators does not exceed `k` when `t <= n`, and the logic `k - (t - n) % k` correctly accounts for the periodic nature of the wave when `t > n`. The annotations align with the problem description and the expected behavior of the program. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is accurate.
