Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is `n - 1`
   - `days` is a list of `n - 1` tuples
   - `regular_sales` is `[min(days[0][0], days[0][1]), min(k, l)]`
   - `potential_sales_increase` is `[days[0][1] - days[0][0], min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l)]`
   - `k` is `days[1][0]`
   - `l` is `days[1][1]`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over each tuple `(k, l)` in the list `days`.

3. **What Changes During One Iteration?**
   - `k` and `l` are updated to the values from the current tuple in the `days` list.
   - The loop continues until there are no more tuples left in the `days` list.

4. **State After One Iteration:**
   - Since the loop iterates over `days`, and `days` contains `n-1` tuples, after the first iteration, `days` will contain `n-2` tuples.
   - `k` and `l` will be updated to the values from the second tuple in the original `days` list.

5. **Updated States:**
   - `n` remains `n - 1` because the length of `days` does not affect `n`.
   - `days` now has `n - 2` tuples.
   - `k` and `l` are updated to the values from the second tuple in the original `days` list.

6. **Condition for Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `days` must have at least one tuple left. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`n` is `n - 1`, `days` is a list of `n - 2` tuples, `k` is `days[1][0]`, `l` is `days[1][1]**'**.
