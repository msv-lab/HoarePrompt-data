`potential_sales_increase` is appended with the value of `min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l)`. Given that `k` is `days[1][0]` and `l` is `days[1][1]`, the expression `min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l)` will be calculated and appended to `potential_sales_increase`.

Since `k` is `days[1][0]` and `l` is `days[1][1]`, let's denote `days[1][0]` as `a` and `days[1][1]` as `b`. Therefore, the expression simplifies to `min(2 * a, b) - min(a, b)`.

- If `2 * a <= b`, then `min(2 * a, b) = 2 * a` and `min(a, b) = a`, so the expression evaluates to `2 * a - a = a`.
- If `2 * a > b`, then `min(2 * a, b) = b` and `min(a, b) = a`, so the expression evaluates to `b - a`.

Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not specified, we can represent the result as `min(2 * a, b) - min(a, b)`.

Output State: **`n` is `n - 1`; `days` is a list of `n - 2` tuples; `k` is `days[1][0]`; `l` is `days[1][1]`; `regular_sales` is a list containing the minimum value of `k` and `l`; `potential_sales_increase` is updated with `min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l)`.**
