The function reads the number of days `n` and the value of `f` from input, followed by `n` pairs of integers `(k_i, l_i)` representing the number of products to be put up for sale and the number of clients coming to the shop on the `i`-th day. It sorts these pairs based on the difference `l_i - k_i` in descending order. It then calculates the total number of products sold, where for the first `f` days, each product can be sold twice if there are more products than clients, and for the remaining days, each product can only be sold once. The function outputs the total number of products sold.
