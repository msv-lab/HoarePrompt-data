`days` is appended with a tuple `(k, l)`. The values of `i`, `n`, `f`, `k`, and `l` remain unchanged. The initial state of `days` as an empty list is updated to include the new tuple.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `f` is an integer such that 0 ≤ f ≤ n, `days` is now `[ (k, l) ]`, `k` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer**
