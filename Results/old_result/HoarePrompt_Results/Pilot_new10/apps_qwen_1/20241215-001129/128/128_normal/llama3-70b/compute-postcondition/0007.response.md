`days` is a list that appends a tuple `(k, l)` to itself. The values of `k` and `l` are input integers. The initial state of `days` is `[ (k, l) ]`, which means it already contains one tuple. After appending `(k, l)` to `days`, `days` will now contain two tuples.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `f` is an integer such that \(0 \leq f \leq n\), `days` is now `[ (k, l), (k, l) ]`**
