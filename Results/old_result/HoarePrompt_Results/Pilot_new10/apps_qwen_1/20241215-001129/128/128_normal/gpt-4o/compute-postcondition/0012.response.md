The code `total_sales = sum(regular_sales)` calculates the sum of all elements in the `regular_sales` list and assigns this sum to the variable `total_sales`. The `regular_sales` list contains the minimum of `days[i][0]` and `days[i][1]` for each `i` from `0` to `n-1`.

Since the initial state defines `total_sales` as the sum of `regular_sales`, and no other operations modify `total_sales` or `regular_sales`, the value of `total_sales` is directly the sum of all `regular_sales[i]` for `0 <= i < n`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `f` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq f \leq n\), `days` is an empty list, `regular_sales` is a list of length `n`, where each element is `min(days[i][0], days[i][1])` for \(0 \leq i < n\), `potential_sales_increase` is a list of length `n`, where each element is `min(2 * days[i][0], days[i][1]) - min(days[i][0], days[i][1])` for \(0 \leq i < n\), and `total_sales` is the sum of `regular_sales`.**
