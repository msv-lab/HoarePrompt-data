The function `func` accepts no parameters directly listed in the provided code snippet. However, based on the constraints, it seems the function might internally use or manipulate variables `$n` and `$s`, but these are not passed as function arguments.

Given the constraints, `$n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), and `$s` is a string of length `$n$` consisting of "-" and "+" symbols.

Output:
- Case_1: The function processes the string `$s` of length `$n` and returns the count of "+" symbols in the string.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process a string `$s` of length `$n`, counting the number of "+" symbols in the string and returning this count.

Functionality: **The function processes a string `s` of length `n`, counts the number of "+" symbols in the string, and returns this count.**
