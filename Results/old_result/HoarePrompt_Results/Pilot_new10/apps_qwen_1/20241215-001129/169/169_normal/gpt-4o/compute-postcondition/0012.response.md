The value of `stones` is incremented by 1. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `stones`, it could either be 0 or 1 depending on whether `operation` was '-' or '+'. After the code executes, `stones` will be 1 more than its initial value.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the length of the string `s`, `s` is a string of length `n-1` consisting of '-' and '+' characters, and `stones` is either 2 if `operation` was '-', or 0 if `operation` was '+'**
