The code `stones = max(0, stones - 1)` impacts the variable `stones`. The value of `stones` can be either 2 (if `operation` is '-') or 0 (if `operation` is '+'). The operation `stones - 1` will reduce the value of `stones` by 1, but it will be capped at 0 due to the `max(0, ...)` function. 

- If `stones` was 2 (when `operation` is '-'), it will become 1.
- If `stones` was 0 (when `operation` is '+'), it will remain 0.

Therefore, the updated values are:

- `n` is an integer representing the length of the string `s`.
- `s` is a string of length `n-1` consisting of '-' and '+' characters.
- `operation` is the next character in `s`.
- `stones` is now either 1 (if `operation` was '-') or 0 (if `operation` was '+').

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the length of the string `s`, `s` is a string of length `n-1` consisting of '-' and '+' characters, `operation` is the next character in `s`, `stones` is either 1 or 0.**
