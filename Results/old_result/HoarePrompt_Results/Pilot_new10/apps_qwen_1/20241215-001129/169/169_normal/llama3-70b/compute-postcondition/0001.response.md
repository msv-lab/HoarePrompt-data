The code reads a string from the user input and assigns it to the variable `s`. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of "-" and "+" symbols, after the code execution, `n` remains unchanged, and `s` is updated to the new string input by the user.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive); `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of "-" and "+" symbols, and it is equal to the input string**
