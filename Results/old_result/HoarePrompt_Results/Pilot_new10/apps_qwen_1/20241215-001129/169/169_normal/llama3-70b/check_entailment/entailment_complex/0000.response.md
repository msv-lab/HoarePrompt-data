Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem described. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of operations `n` and the sequence of operations `s` as described in the problem.
2. **Counting Operations**: It counts the number of "-" and "+" symbols in the string `s` using the `count` method. These counts represent the number of times a stone was taken and added, respectively.
3. **Logic for Output**: 
   - If the number of "-" symbols (`minus_count`) is greater than the number of "+" symbols (`plus_count`), the pile would have ended up with 0 stones or fewer, which is impossible since we start with at least 1 stone and cannot have a negative number of stones. Therefore, the program prints `0`.
   - Otherwise, the minimal possible number of stones in the pile is calculated as `plus_count - minus_count`. This accounts for the net effect of all the operations on the initial number of stones.

The program correctly handles all edge cases and ensures that the output adheres to the problem constraints. For any valid input, the program will produce the correct minimal possible number of stones in the pile, as described in the problem statement.
