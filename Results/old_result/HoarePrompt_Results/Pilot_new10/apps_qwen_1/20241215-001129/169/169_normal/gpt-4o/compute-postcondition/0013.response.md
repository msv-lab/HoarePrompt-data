`stones` is initially either 1 (if `operation` is '+') or 0 (if `operation` is '-'). The code `stones = max(0, stones - 1)` decreases the value of `stones` by 1 but ensures that `stones` does not go below 0. Therefore, if `stones` was 1, it will become 0; if `stones` was 0, it will remain 0. The states of the other variables (`n` and `s`) are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the length of the string `s`, `s` is a string of length `n-1` consisting of '-' and '+' characters, and `stones` is 0**
