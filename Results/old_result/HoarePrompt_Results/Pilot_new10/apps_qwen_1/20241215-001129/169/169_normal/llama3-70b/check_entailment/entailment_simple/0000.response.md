Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of operations and a string `s` of length `n` containing the operations as "-" or "+". This matches the problem's input requirements.

2. **Counting Operations**: The program counts the number of "-" and "+" in the string `s` using `s.count('-')` and `s.count('+')`. These counts represent the number of times a stone was taken and added, respectively.

3. **Calculation of Minimal Stones**: The program calculates the minimal possible number of stones left after performing the operations. This is done by computing `plus_count - minus_count`. Since each "-" reduces the pile by one and each "+" increases it by one, the difference between the number of additions and subtractions gives the net change in the pile size.

4. **Edge Case Handling**: The program handles the edge case where the initial number of stones in the pile is less than the number required to perform all operations. Specifically:
   - If `minus_count` (number of "-" operations) is greater than `plus_count` (number of "+" operations), the pile would become empty before all operations could be performed, so the result should be `0`.
   - Otherwise, the result is `plus_count - minus_count`, which represents the minimal number of stones remaining after all operations.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the logic required to find the minimal possible number of stones in the pile after performing the specified operations, adhering to the problem description in all cases.
