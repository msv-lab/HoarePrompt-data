The function `func` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string. The string `s` consists of '-' and '+' characters, has a length between 1 and 100, and represents operations where '-' means taking one stone from a pile and '+' means adding one stone to the pile. The pile is assumed to be non-empty before each operation of taking one stone from the pile. 

Case_1: The string `s` is a string. If the final count of stones in the pile after all operations is zero, the function returns `True`.
Case_2: The string `s` is a string. If the final count of stones in the pile after all operations is not zero, the function returns `False`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a string `s` and return `True` if the final count of stones in the pile is zero after performing all operations, and `False` otherwise.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `s`, returns `True` if the final count of stones in the pile is zero after performing all operations, and `False` otherwise.**
