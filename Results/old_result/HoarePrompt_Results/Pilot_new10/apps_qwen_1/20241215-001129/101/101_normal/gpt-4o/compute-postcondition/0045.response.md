Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w", `j` is in the range `[1, m-1]`, and `right` is set to `j` if `j > right`. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
