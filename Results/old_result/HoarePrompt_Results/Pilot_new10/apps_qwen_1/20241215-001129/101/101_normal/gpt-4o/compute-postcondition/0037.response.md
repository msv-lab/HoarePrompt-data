The code assigns the value of `j` to both `left` and `right`. This means that `left` and `right` are both set to `j`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `screen`, `j`, `top`, `bottom`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w", `j` is in the range `[1, m-1]`, `top` is `i`, `bottom` is `i`, `left` is `j`, `right` is `j`**
