The code snippet `result[i][j] = '+'` assigns the value `'+'` to the element in the `i`-th row and `j`-th column of the `result` matrix. Given the initial conditions:

- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\)
- `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\)
- `screen` remains unchanged except for the boundary elements which are now `'+'`
- `top` is the smallest row index where `'w'` is found
- `bottom` is the largest row index where `'w'` is found
- `left` is the smallest column index where `'w'` is found
- `right` is the largest column index where `'w'` is found
- `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2
- `frame_width` is `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2
- `right` is at least one more than `left` (`right >= left + 1`)
- `j` is less than `right + 1` (`j < right + 1`)

The value of `i` is not specified in the given snippet, but since the code does not affect `n`, `m`, `screen`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `frame_height`, `frame_width`, or `j`, their values remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\); `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\); `screen` remains unchanged except for the boundary elements which are now `'+'`; `top` is the smallest row index where `'w'` is found; `bottom` is the largest row index where `'w'` is found; `left` is the smallest column index where `'w'` is found; `right` is the largest column index where `'w'`; `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2; `frame_width` is `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2; `right` is at least one more than `left` (`right >= left + 1`); `j` is less than `right + 1` (`j < right + 1`); and `result[i][j]` is `'+'`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\); `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\); `screen` remains unchanged except for the boundary elements which are now `'+'`; `top` is the smallest row index where `'w'` is found; `bottom` is the largest row index where `'w'` is found; `left` is the smallest column index where `'w'` is found; `right` is the largest column index where `'w'`; `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2; `frame_width` is `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2; `right` is at least one more than `left` (`right >= left + 1`); `j` is less than `right + 1` (`j < right + 1`); and `result[i][j]` is `'+'`.**
