The code `right = j` assigns the value of `j` to the variable `right`. Given that `j` is the column index where 'w' is found and `j` is greater than `right`, the value of `right` will now be equal to `j`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`total` is not mentioned and remains unchanged, `i` is 1, `j` is the column index where 'w' is found, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w", `top` is 1, `bottom` is the minimum of the previous `bottom` and `i` (since `i` is greater than `bottom` in the if case), `left` is now `j`, `right` is equal to `j`, and `j` is greater than `right` (now equal to `j`).**
