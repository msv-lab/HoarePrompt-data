Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the dimensions of the monitor (n, m) and the current state of the monitor (represented by a list of strings) as specified in the problem description.

2. **Finding Boundaries**: The program uses nested loops to find the smallest and largest row and column indices where 'w' (white pixels) are present. This is done through the variables `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`.

3. **Checking Frame Validity**: After finding these boundaries, the program checks whether the frame formed by these boundaries is valid (i.e., has a height and width of at least 2). If not, it returns -1, as per the problem description.

4. **Modifying the Screen**: If a valid frame is found, the program modifies the screen by replacing the boundary pixels with '+' (plus sign) where they were originally '.' (black pixels).

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases appropriately:
   - If no white pixels are found, it returns -1.
   - If the resulting frame dimensions are less than 2x2, it also returns -1.

6. **Output**: The program prints the modified screen or -1 based on the conditions, ensuring it meets the output requirements.

Since the program correctly implements all the steps described in the problem statement, it meets the requirements for every potential case. Therefore, the program is correct.
