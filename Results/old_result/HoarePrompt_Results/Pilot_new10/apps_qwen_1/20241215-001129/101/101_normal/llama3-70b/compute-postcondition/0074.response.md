The code `pixels[i][j] = '.'` changes the value of the pixel at position (`i`, `j`) in the `pixels` 2D list to `'.'`. The initial conditions specify that `i` is 2, `n` and `m` are greater than 0, all boundary pixels are set to `'+'`, and all other pixels are set to `'.'` unless they are `'w'`. Since the condition for `j` being 0 or the pixel at position (`i`, `j`) being `'w'` is not met, the pixel at position (`i`, `j`) is set to `'.'`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `pixels` is a 2D list where all boundary pixels are set to `'+'` and all other pixels are set to `'.'`, the pixel at position (`i`, `j`) is set to `'.'`**
