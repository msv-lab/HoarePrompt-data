Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- \( n \) is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 2000 \).
- \( m \) is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq m \leq 2000 \).
- `screen` remains unchanged except for the boundary elements which are now `'+'`.
- `top` is the smallest row index where `'w'` is found.
- `bottom` is the largest row index where `'w'` is found.
- `left` is the smallest column index where `'w'` is found.
- `right` is the largest column index where `'w'`.
- `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2.
- `frame_width` is `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2.
- `i` is `top` or `bottom` or `j` is `left` or `j` is `right + 1`.
- If `result[i][j] == '.'`, it is changed to `'+'`; otherwise, the value of `result[i][j]` remains `'+'`.

### For Loop Statement:
```
for j in range(left, right + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over columns from `left` to `right` inclusive.
2. **Previous Iteration**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` would have been one of the values in the range `[left, right]`.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the next iteration, `j` will increment by 1 and continue within the range `[left, right]`.

### Updated States:
- The column index `j` will increment by 1.
- Since the loop body is not provided, no other state changes are mentioned other than the column index.

### Final State:
- `j` will be incremented by 1, so if the previous `j` was `right`, the new `j` will be `right + 1`.
- All other states remain unchanged because the loop body does not modify them.

### Updated State:
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 2000 \); `m` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq m \leq 2000 \); `screen` remains unchanged except for the boundary elements which are now `'+'`; `top` is the smallest row index where `'w'` is found; `bottom` is the largest row index where `'w'` is found; `left` is the smallest column index where `'w'` is found; `right` is the largest column index where `'w'`; `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2; `frame_width` is `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2; `i` is `top` or `bottom` or `j` is `right + 1`; if `result[i][j] == '.'`, it is changed to `'+'`; otherwise, the value of `result[i][j]` remains `'+'`.**
