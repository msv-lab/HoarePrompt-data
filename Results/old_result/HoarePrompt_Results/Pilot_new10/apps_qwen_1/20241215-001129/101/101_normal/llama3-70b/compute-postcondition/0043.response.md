State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 0, and `pixels` is a 2D list, `j` is 0**.

Explanation:
- The loop variable `j` starts from 0 and goes up to `m-1`.
- For the loop to execute, `j` must start at 0.
- Therefore, we need to adjust the initial state to ensure `j` is 0 when the loop begins.

So, the required adjustments include setting `j` to 0, while keeping the other given states unchanged.
