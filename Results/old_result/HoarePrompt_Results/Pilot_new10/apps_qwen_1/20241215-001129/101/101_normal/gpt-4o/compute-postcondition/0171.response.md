Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\).
- `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\).
- `screen` remains unchanged except for the boundary elements which are now `'+'`.
- `top` is the smallest row index where `'w'` is found.
- `bottom` is the largest row index where `'w'` is found.
- `left` is the smallest column index where `'w'` is found.
- `right` is the largest column index where `'w'`.
- `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2.
- `frame_width` is `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2.
- `top` must be less than or equal to `bottom`.
- `left` must be less than or equal to `right`.

### For Loop:
```python
for i in range(top, bottom + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over rows from `top` to `bottom` inclusive.
2. **Current Iteration**: At the end of the previous iteration, the loop has just finished iterating over a row `i` where `top <= i <= bottom`.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the next row `i` should be such that `i + 1` is within the range `[top, bottom]`.

Given that the loop is iterating over rows from `top` to `bottom`, the next row `i + 1` should still be within this range. Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is `i` itself.

### Adjusted State:
- Since `i` was the current row at the end of the previous iteration, the next row `i + 1` should be processed.
- The loop will continue if `i + 1 <= bottom`.

### Final State:
- `top` remains the same.
- `bottom` remains the same.
- `left` remains the same.
- `right` remains the same.
- `frame_height` remains the same (since it is derived from `bottom - top + 1`).
- `frame_width` remains the same (since it is derived from `right - left + 1`).
- `i` is adjusted to `i + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` remains unchanged except for the boundary elements which are now `'+'`, `top` is the smallest row index where `'w'` is found, `bottom` is the largest row index where `'w'` is found, `left` is the smallest column index where `'w'` is found, `right` is the largest column index where `'w'`, `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` is `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `i + 1`**.
