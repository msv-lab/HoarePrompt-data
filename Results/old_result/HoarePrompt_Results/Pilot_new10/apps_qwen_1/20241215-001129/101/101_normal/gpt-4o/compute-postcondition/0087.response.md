Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w", `top` is updated to `i` if `i` is less than `top` or `top` is `None`, otherwise `top` remains unchanged, `bottom` is updated to `i`, `i` remains unchanged, `left` is updated to `j - 1` if `(j - 1) + 1 > right` or `(j - 1) > right`, otherwise `left` remains unchanged, `j` is incremented by 1, `right` is updated to `j - 1` if `(j - 1) > right`**
