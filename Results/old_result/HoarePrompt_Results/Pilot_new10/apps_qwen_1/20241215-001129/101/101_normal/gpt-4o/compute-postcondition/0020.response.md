Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w". `top` is either `0` or `i`, `bottom` is `0`, `left` is `j`, `right` is `j`, `i` is `0`, and `j` is `0`. The current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w'.***

This postcondition summarizes both the if and else parts, considering the initial precondition and the states after the execution of the if-else block.
