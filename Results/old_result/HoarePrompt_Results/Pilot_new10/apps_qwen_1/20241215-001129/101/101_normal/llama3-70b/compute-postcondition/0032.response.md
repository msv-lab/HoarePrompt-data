The code `pixels[i][j] = '.'` assigns the value `'.'` to the element in the `pixels` list at index `i` and sub-index `j`. Since `i` is 0 and `j` must be less than `m`, the precondition is that `j` is a valid index for the sublist `pixels[0]`. However, the value of `pixels` itself is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact structure. The values of `n`, `m`, and `j` are not directly affected by this assignment. The value of `i` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `j` is less than `m`, and pixels[0][j] is '.'**
