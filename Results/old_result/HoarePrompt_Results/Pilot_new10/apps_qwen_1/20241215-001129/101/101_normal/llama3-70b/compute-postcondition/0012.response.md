The code snippet updates the variables `max_x` and `max_y` to be the maximum values between their current values and `x` and `y`, respectively. However, since the initial values of `x` and `y` are not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact updated values of `max_x` and `max_y`. We only know that `max_x` is now the maximum of its current value and `x`, and `max_y` is now the maximum of its current value and `y`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of rows, `m` is an integer representing the number of columns, `pixels` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains a string of characters, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (i, j) where `pixels[i][j]` is 'w' and must have at least one tuple left, `min_x` is `min(min_x, x)`, `min_y` is `min(min_y, y)`, `max_x` is `max(max_x, x)`, `max_y` is `max(max_y, y)`**
