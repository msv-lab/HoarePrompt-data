Postcondition: ***`total` is not mentioned and remains unchanged, `i` is 1, `j` is the column index where 'w' is found, `j` satisfies the condition of being less than `m`, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w", `top` is 1, `bottom` is 1, `left` is the smallest column index where 'w' is found, `right` is the largest column index where 'w' is found, and the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w'. If `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `bottom` is set to `i`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
