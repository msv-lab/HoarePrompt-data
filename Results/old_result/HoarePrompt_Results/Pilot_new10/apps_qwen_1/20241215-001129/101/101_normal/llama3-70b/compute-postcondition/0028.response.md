Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0. If the pixel at position `(i, j)` in the `pixels` list is `'+',` and either `i` being equal to `min_x`, `i` being equal to `max_x`, `j` being equal to `min_y`, or `j` being equal to `max_y`, the pixel at position `(i, j)` remains `'+'`. Otherwise, the pixel at position `(i, j)` is set to `'.'`.**
