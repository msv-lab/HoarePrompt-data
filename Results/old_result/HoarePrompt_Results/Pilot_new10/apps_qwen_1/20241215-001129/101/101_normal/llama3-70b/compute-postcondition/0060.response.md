The code assigns the value `+` to the element in the 2D list `pixels` at index `[i][j]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1 and `j` is 2, so the element `pixels[1][2]` is updated to `+`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `pixels` is a 2D list with `pixels[1][2]` equal to `+`, `j` is 2**
