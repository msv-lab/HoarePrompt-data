The code reads two space-separated integers `n` and `m` from the input and assigns them to variables `n` and `m` respectively. This means the values of `n` and `m` are now the dimensions of the monitor as specified by the input, and the list of characters representing the monitor's pixels has not yet been read.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of rows, `m` is an integer representing the number of columns, and the list of characters representing the monitor's pixels has not been read yet.**
