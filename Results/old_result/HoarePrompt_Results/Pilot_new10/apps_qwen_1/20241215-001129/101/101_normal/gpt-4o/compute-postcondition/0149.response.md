The code `frame_height = bottom - top + 1` calculates the height of the frame by subtracting the `top` index from the `bottom` index and adding 1. This value is stored in the variable `frame_height`. The values of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged, as well as the values of `n`, `m`, and `screen`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w", `top` is the smallest row index where 'w' is found, `bottom` is the largest row index where 'w' is found, `left` is the smallest column index where 'w' is found, `right` is the largest column index where 'w', `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1`**
