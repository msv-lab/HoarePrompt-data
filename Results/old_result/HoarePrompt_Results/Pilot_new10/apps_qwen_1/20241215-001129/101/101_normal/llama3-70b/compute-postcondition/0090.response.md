Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `pixels` is an `n x m` 2D list, `min_x` is the smallest `x` coordinate of all white pixels, `min_y` is the smallest `y` coordinate of all white pixels, `max_x` is the largest `x` coordinate of all white pixels, `max_y` is the largest `y` coordinate of all white pixels, `frame_size` is \(\max(\max(\text{max\_x}) - \min(\text{min\_x}), \max(\text{max\_y}) - \min(\text{min\_y})) + 1\), and `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`.

For every `i` in the range `[0, n-1]` and every `j` in the range `[0, m-1]`:
- If `j` is such that `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y)` and `pixels[i][j] == '.'`, then `pixels[i][j]` is changed to `'+'.`
- If `pixels[i][j]` is `'w'`, it remains `'w'`.
- Otherwise, `pixels[i][j]` is changed to `'.'`.

After the loop executes, all boundary pixels (where `i` is `min_x` or `max_x` or `j` is `min_y` or `max_y`) are set to `'+'`, and all other pixels are either `'.'` or `'w'`.**
