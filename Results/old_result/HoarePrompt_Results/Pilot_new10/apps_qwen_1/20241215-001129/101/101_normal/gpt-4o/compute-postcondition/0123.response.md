The variable `bottom` is assigned the value of `i`. The previous value of `bottom` was `1`, and now it is updated to `i`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value and still satisfies the condition of being less than `m`, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w", `top` is 1, `left` is `j`, `right` is `j`, `bottom` is `i`.**
