The code assigns the value of `j` to both `left` and `right`. The initial values of `left` and `right` are `None`, so they are updated to `j`. The current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w', and this does not change. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w", `top` is `0`, `bottom` is `0`, `left` is `j`, `right` is `j`, `i` is `0`, `j` is `0`, and the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w'**
