Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\)
   - `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\)
   - `screen` remains unchanged except for the boundary elements which are now `'+'`
   - `top` is the smallest row index where `'w'` is found
   - `bottom` is the largest row index where `'w'` is found
   - `left` is the smallest column index where `'w'` is found
   - `right` is the largest column index where `'w'`
   - `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2
   - `frame_width` is `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2
   - `i` is `top` or `bottom` or `j` is `left` or `j` is `right`
   - If `result[i][j] == '.'`, the value of `result[i][j]` is changed to `'+'`; otherwise, the value of `result[i][j]` remains `'+'`

2. **For Loop Statement**:
   ```python
   for j in range(left, right + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over columns from `left` to `right` inclusive.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was either `left` or `right`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented from `left` to `right + 1`.

5. **New State After the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from `left` and goes up to `right` (inclusive), after the next iteration, `j` will be `left + 1`.
   - All other variables (`n`, `m`, `screen`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `frame_height`, `frame_width`, `i`) remain unchanged because the loop only modifies the `result` matrix along the boundary.

**Final State:**
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\)
- `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\)
- `screen` remains unchanged except for the boundary elements which are now `'+'`
- `top` is the smallest row index where `'w'` is found
- `bottom` is the largest row index where `'w'` is found
- `left` is the smallest column index where `'w'` is found
- `right` is the largest column index where `'w'`
- `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2
- `frame_width` is `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2
- `i` is `top` or `bottom` or `j` is `left` or `j` is `right + 1`
- If `result[i][j] == '.'`, the value of `result[i][j]` is changed to `'+'`; otherwise, the value of `result[i][j]` remains `'+'`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` remains unchanged except for the boundary elements which are now `'+'`, `top` is the smallest row index where `'w'` is found, `bottom` is the largest row index where `'w'` is found, `left` is the smallest column index where `'w'` is found, `right` is the largest column index where `'w'`, `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` is `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `top` or `bottom` or `j` is `left` or `j` is `right + 1`, and if `result[i][j] == '.'`, the value of `result[i][j]` is changed to `'+'`; otherwise, the value of `result[i][j]` remains `'+'`.**
