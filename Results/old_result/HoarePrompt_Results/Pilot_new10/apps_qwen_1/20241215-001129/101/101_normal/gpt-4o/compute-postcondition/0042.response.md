The code `left = j` assigns the value of `j` to the variable `left`. No other changes occur to the variables or conditions. Therefore, the only change is that `left` now holds the value of `j`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w", and `j` is in the range `[1, m-1]`, `left` is equal to `j`.**
