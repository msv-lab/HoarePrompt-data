The code `bottom = i` updates the variable `bottom` to the current value of `i`. Based on the initial state, `i` was being updated, but the exact value of `i` before this line is not specified. However, since `bottom` is now updated to the current value of `i`, we can represent the updated state accordingly.

The other variables remain unchanged: `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w", `top` remains unchanged, `i` is updated to its new value (which is now assigned to `bottom`), `j` is incremented by 1, `left` remains unchanged, and `right` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w", `top` remains unchanged, `bottom` is equal to the current value of `i`, `i` is equal to the current value of `bottom`, `j` is incremented by 1, `left` remains unchanged, `right` remains unchanged.**
