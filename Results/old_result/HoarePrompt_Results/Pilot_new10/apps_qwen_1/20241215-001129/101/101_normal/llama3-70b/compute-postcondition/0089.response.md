Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `pixels` is a 2D list where all boundary pixels are set to `'+'` and all other pixels are either `'.'` or `'w'`. If the current value of `pixels[i][j]` is `'.'` and the condition `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y)` is true, then the pixel at position (`i`, `j`) is set to `'+'`. If `pixels[i][j]` is `'w'`, it remains `'w'`. Otherwise, the pixel at position (`i`, `j`) is set to `'.'`.**
