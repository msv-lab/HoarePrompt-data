Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the code fails to consider scenarios where the white region is not rectangular but L-shaped or other non-rectangular shapes. Hereâ€™s an example that demonstrates this issue:

### Example:
**Input:**
```
3 5
..w..
.w...
..w..
```

**Expected Output:**
```
..w+.
+w+..
..w+.
```

However, the current implementation only checks for the smallest rectangle that encloses all white pixels, which might not be the correct solution for non-rectangular shapes.

### Issue:
The code assumes that the smallest enclosing rectangle will always be the correct solution. This assumption is valid for rectangular regions but not for non-rectangular ones. For instance, in the example above, the code would return `-1` because it cannot form a rectangle with a width or height of at least 2.

To fix this, the code needs to handle non-rectangular regions by finding the minimum bounding box that fits the white region. This involves more complex logic to ensure that the frame is the smallest possible while still fitting the white pixels.

Since the provided code does not handle non-rectangular regions correctly, the program is not fully correct.
