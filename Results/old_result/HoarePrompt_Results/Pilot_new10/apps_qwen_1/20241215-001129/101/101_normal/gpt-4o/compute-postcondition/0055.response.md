Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w", `top` is the smallest row index where 'w' is found, `bottom` is the largest row index where 'w' is found, `left` is the smallest column index where 'w' is found, `right` is the largest column index where 'w' is found, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `0`, and `top` is not `None`**
