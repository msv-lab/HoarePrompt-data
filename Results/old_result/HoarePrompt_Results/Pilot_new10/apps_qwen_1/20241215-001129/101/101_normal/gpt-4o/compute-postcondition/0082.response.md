Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w". `top` is updated to `i` if `top` is `None` or `i` is less than `top`; otherwise, `top` remains unchanged. `bottom` is updated to `i`. `i` remains unchanged. `left` is updated to `j` if `j + 1 > right` or `j > right`, otherwise `left` remains unchanged. `j` is incremented by 1. `right` is updated to `j` if `j > right`. If `screen[i][j] == 'w'`, the conditions for `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are additionally satisfied as per the if part conditions.***
