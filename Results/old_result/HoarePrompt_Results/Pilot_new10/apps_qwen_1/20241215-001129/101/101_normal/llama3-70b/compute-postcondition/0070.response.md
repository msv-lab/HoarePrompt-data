Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `pixels` is a 2D list where all boundary pixels (where `i` is `min_x` or `max_x` or `j` is `min_y` or `max_y`) are set to `'+'` and all other pixels are set to `'.'` unless they are `'w'`, in which case they remain unchanged, `j` is not 0 or the pixel at position (`i`, `j`) is not `'.'`**
