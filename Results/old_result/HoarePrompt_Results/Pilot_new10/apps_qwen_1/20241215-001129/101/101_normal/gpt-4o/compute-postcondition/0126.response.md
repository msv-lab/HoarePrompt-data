Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value and still satisfies the condition of being less than `m`. `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w". `top` is 1, `bottom` is `i`, `left` is `j`, `right` is `j`. If `j < left`, then `left` is updated to `j`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `left`, `bottom` remains as `i`.***
