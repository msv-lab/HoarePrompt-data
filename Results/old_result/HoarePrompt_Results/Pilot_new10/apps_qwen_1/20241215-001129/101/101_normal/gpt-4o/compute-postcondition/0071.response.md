The code `top = bottom = i` assigns the value of `i` to both `top` and `bottom`. This means that `top` and `bottom` now both hold the value of `i`, while `i` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w", `top` and `bottom` are both equal to `i`, `i` remains unchanged, `left` is set to `j + 1` if `j + 1 > right` and `left` remains unchanged otherwise, and `j` is incremented by 1.**
