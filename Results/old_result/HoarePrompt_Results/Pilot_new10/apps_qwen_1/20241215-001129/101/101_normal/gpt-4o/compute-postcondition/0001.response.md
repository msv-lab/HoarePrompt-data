State before the loop starts: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 2000, `screen` is a list of n strings where each string contains exactly m characters, and the characters in the strings are either "." (black pixels) or "w" (white pixels), `top` is `None`, `bottom` is `None`, `left` is `None`, `right` is `None`.

For the loop to execute, the following conditions need to be met:

1. The variable `n` must be greater than 0 because the loop iterates over the range from 0 to `n-1`.
2. The variable `i` must start at 0 and will increment by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n`.

Since `n` is already specified as a positive integer (1 <= n <= 2000), we only need to ensure that `i` starts at 0.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 2000, `screen` is a list of n strings where each string contains exactly m characters, and the characters in the strings are either "." (black pixels) or "w" (white pixels), `top` is `None`, `bottom` is `None`, `left` is `None`, `right` is `None`, `i` is 0**
