The code assigns the same value to `top` and `bottom` and also assigns the same value to `i`. However, the value of `i` is not specified in the initial state. Since the initial state does not provide a specific value for `i`, we can only say that `top` and `bottom` are assigned the value of `i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w", and `j` is in the range `[1, m-1]`, `top` is `i`, `bottom` is `i`**
