The code `top = bottom = i` assigns the value of `i` to both `top` and `bottom`. Since the initial value of `i` is `0`, both `top` and `bottom` are now set to `0`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w", `top` is `0`, `bottom` is `0`, `left` is `None`, `right` is `None`, `i` is `0`, `j` is `0`, and the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w'**
