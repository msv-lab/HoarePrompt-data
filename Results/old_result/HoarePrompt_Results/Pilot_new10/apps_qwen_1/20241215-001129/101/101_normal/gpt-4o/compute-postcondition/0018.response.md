The code sets the value of `right` to `j`. Given that `j` is initially `0`, `right` will also be `0`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w", `top` is either `i` or `None`, `bottom` is `0`, `left` is `0`, `i` is `0`, `j` is `0`, `right` is `0`. The current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w', and the condition `(i > bottom)` is true.**
