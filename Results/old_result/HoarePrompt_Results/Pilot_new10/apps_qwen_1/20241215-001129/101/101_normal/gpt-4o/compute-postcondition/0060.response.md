The code sets `bottom` to the value of `i`. Since `i` is now less than `top` (as mentioned in the precondition) and the condition `(i > bottom)` was true, `i` must have been less than `bottom` before this assignment. However, the exact value of `i` is not specified, only that it is less than `top`.

Therefore, after executing the line `bottom = i`, the value of `bottom` is updated to the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w", `top` is `n - 1`, `bottom` is `i`, `left` is the smallest column index where 'w' is found, `right` is the largest column index where 'w' is found, `i` is now less than `top`, and `j` is `0`.**
