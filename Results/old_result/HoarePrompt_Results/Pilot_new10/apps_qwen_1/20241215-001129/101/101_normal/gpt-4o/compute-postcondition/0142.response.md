Postcondition: ***`total` remains unchanged, `i` is 1, `j` is incremented by 1, `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w". `top` is 1, `bottom` is 1, `left` is `j + 1`, and `right` is `j + 1`. If `j > right`, then `right` is set to `j` otherwise `right` remains unchanged.***
