The value of `right` is assigned the value of `j`. The value of `j` is greater than `right`, so after the assignment, `right` will also be greater than `right`, which is redundant but true. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w". `top`, `bottom`, `right`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. `left` is set to `j`, and `right` is now equal to `j`. The current value of `j` is greater than `right`.**
