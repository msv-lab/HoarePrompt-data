The `continue` statement in this context does not change the values of any variables; it merely skips to the next iteration of a loop. Given the precondition, the values of `n`, `i`, `m`, `min_x`, `max_x`, `min_y`, `max_y`, `pixels[i][j]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, and either `i` is not equal to `min_x` or `i` is not equal to `max_x` or `j` is not equal to `min_y` or `j` is not equal to `max_y` or `pixels[i][j]` is not equal to '.', additionally `pixels[i][j]` is equal to 'w'**
