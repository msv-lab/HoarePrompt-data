Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w", and `j` is in the range `[1, m-1]`. If `i > bottom`, the condition remains unchanged. Since there is no action specified in the if part other than the condition check, the overall state of the program variables remains as in the precondition.***
