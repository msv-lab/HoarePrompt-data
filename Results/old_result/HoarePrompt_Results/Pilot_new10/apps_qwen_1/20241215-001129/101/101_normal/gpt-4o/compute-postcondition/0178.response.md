According to the provided for loop and the given conditions, we need to adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\).
   - `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\).
   - `screen` remains unchanged except for the boundary elements which are now `'+'`.
   - `top` is the smallest row index where `'w'` is found.
   - `bottom` is the largest row index where `'w'` is found.
   - `left` is the smallest column index where `'w'` is found.
   - `right` is the largest column index where `'w'`.
   - `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2.
   - `frame_width` is `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2.
   - `right` is at least one more than `left` (`right >= left + 1`).

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over columns from `left` to `right + 1`.
   - For each column `j` in this range, the condition inside the loop body is omitted.

3. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `j` is the current column index, and it is within the range `[left, right]`.

4. **Next Iteration Requirements:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `j` should still be within the range `[left, right + 1]`.
   - This means `j` should be incremented by 1 from its current value and still be less than or equal to `right + 1`.

5. **Adjusted States:**
   - Since the loop increments `j` by 1, `j` will become `j + 1`.
   - The loop will continue if `j + 1 <= right + 1`, which simplifies to `j < right + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` remains unchanged except for the boundary elements which are now `'+'`, `top` is the smallest row index where `'w'` is found, `bottom` is the largest row index where `'w'` is found, `left` is the smallest column index where `'w'` is found, `right` is the largest column index where `'w'`, `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` is `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `right` is at least one more than `left` (`right >= left + 1`), and `j` is less than `right + 1` (`j < right + 1`).**

This ensures that the loop continues to execute as long as `j` is within the specified range.
