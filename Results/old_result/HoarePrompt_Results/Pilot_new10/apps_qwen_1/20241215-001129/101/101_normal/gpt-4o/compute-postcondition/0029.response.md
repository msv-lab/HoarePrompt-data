The code `left = j` assigns the value of `j` to the variable `left`. Since `j` is not defined in the initial state or within the provided code snippet, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we know that `left` is assigned this value, and all other variables remain unchanged based on the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w", `i` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq i \leq 2000\), `top` remains `0`, `left` is `j`, and `right` remains `1`. If `i > bottom`, then `bottom` is set to `i`; otherwise, `bottom` remains unchanged.**
