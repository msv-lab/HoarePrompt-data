Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `j` must be less than `m`. If `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or (j == max_y)) and pixels[i][j] == '.'`, then `pixels[2][j]` is set to '+'. Otherwise, if `pixels[2][j]` is 'w', no change occurs. Otherwise, `pixels[2][j]` is set to '.'.***
