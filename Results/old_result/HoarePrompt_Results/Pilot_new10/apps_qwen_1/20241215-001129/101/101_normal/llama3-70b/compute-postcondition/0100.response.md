Functionality: **The function reads the dimensions of a monitor and its pixel representation from standard input, identifies the bounding box of white pixels, and then modifies the pixel representation to set the boundary pixels to '+' and internal pixels to '.', unless the required frame size exceeds the dimensions of the monitor in which case it prints -1.**
