The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration without terminating the loop itself. It does not change the values of any variables; it only affects the flow of the loop. Since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `j` must be less than `m`**
