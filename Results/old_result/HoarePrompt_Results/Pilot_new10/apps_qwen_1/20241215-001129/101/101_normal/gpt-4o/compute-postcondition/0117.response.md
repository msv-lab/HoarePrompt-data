Postcondition: ***`total` is not mentioned and remains unchanged, `i` is 1, `j` is the column index where 'w' is found (if any), `j` satisfies the condition of being less than `m`, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w", `top` is 1, `bottom` is 1, `left` is `j`, `right` is `j`. If no 'w' is found at position `[i][j]`, the values of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged.***
