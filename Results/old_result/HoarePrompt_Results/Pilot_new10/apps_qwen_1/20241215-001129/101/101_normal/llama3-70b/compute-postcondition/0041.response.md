Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, and `pixels` is a 2D list. After the loop completes, for every `j` in the range `[0, m-1]`:
- If `j` is such that `(i == \text{min\_x} \text{ or } i == \text{max\_x} \text{ or } j == \text{min\_y} \text{ or } (j == \text{max\_y}))` and `pixels[i][j] == '.'`, then `pixels[i][j]` is changed to `'+'.`
- If `pixels[i][j]` is `'w'`, it remains unchanged.
- Otherwise, `pixels[i][j]` is changed to `'.'`.**

This output state describes the final state of the `pixels` list after the loop has completed its iterations. It captures the conditions under which the pixel values are modified and the constraints on the indices `i` and `j` during the loop.
