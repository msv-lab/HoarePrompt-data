You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Innocentius has a problem — his computer monitor has broken. Now some of the pixels are "dead", that is, they are always black. As consequence, Innocentius can't play the usual computer games. He is recently playing the following game with his younger brother Polycarpus.

Innocentius is touch-typing a program that paints a white square one-pixel wide frame on the black screen. As the monitor is broken, some pixels that should be white remain black. Polycarpus should look at what the program displayed on the screen and guess the position and size of the frame Innocentius has painted. Polycarpus doesn't like the game but Innocentius persuaded brother to play as "the game is good for the imagination and attention".

Help Polycarpus, automatize his part in the gaming process. Write the code that finds such possible square frame that:  the frame's width is 1 pixel,  the frame doesn't go beyond the borders of the screen,  all white pixels of the monitor are located on the frame,  of all frames that satisfy the previous three conditions, the required frame must have the smallest size. 

Formally, a square frame is represented by such pixels of the solid square, that are on the square's border, that is, are not fully surrounded by the other pixels of the square. For example, if the frame's size is d = 3, then it consists of 8 pixels, if its size is d = 2, then it contains 4 pixels and if d = 1, then the frame is reduced to a single pixel.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the resolution of the monitor as a pair of integers n, m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000). The next n lines contain exactly m characters each — the state of the monitor pixels at the moment of the game. Character "." (period, ASCII code 46) corresponds to the black pixel, and character "w" (lowercase English letter w) corresponds to the white pixel. It is guaranteed that at least one pixel of the monitor is white.


-----Output-----

Print the monitor screen. Represent the sought frame by characters "+" (the "plus" character). The pixels that has become white during the game mustn't be changed. Print them as "w". If there are multiple possible ways to position the frame of the minimum size, print any of them.

If the required frame doesn't exist, then print a single line containing number -1.

-----Note-----

Program:
```
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    pixels = [list(input()) for _ in range(n)]
    white_pixels = [(i, j) for i in range(n) for j in range(m) if pixels[i][j] == 'w']
    (min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y) = (float('inf'), float('inf'), float('-inf'), float('-inf'))
    for (x, y) in white_pixels:
        (min_x, min_y) = (min(min_x, x), min(min_y, y))
        (max_x, max_y) = (max(max_x, x), max(max_y, y))
    frame_size = max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1
    if frame_size > max(n, m):
        print(-1)
    else:
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                if (i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or (j == max_y)) and pixels[i][j] == '.':
                    pixels[i][j] = '+'
                elif pixels[i][j] == 'w':
                    continue
                else:
                    pixels[i][j] = '.'
        for row in pixels:
            print(''.join(row))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to ensure that the frame is the smallest possible size for all valid configurations of white pixels. Let's consider an example:

### Example Input:
```
3 3
w..
...
..w
```

### Expected Output:
```
w++w
++++
++w+
```

However, the program will output:
```
w++w
++++
++w+
```

This seems correct at first glance, but let's consider another configuration:

### Example Input:
```
4 4
w..
w..
..w
..w
```

### Expected Output:
```
w++w
w++w
++++
++w+
```

But the program will output:
```
w++w
w++w
++++
++w+
```

While this particular example seems to work, the program does not always produce the smallest possible frame. Consider the following configuration:

### Example Input:
```
3 3
w..
w..
..w
```

### Expected Output:
```
w++w
+++w
++w+
```

But the program will output:
```
w++w
+++w
++w+
```

In this case, the program incorrectly handles the boundary conditions and does not always find the smallest possible frame. Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not guarantee the smallest possible frame in all cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two space-separated integers n and m representing the dimensions of the monitor, followed by n lines each containing m characters. The characters are either '.' (black pixel) or 'w' (white pixel), with at least one 'w' present in the input.
def func():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    pixels = [list(input()) for _ in range(n)]

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
