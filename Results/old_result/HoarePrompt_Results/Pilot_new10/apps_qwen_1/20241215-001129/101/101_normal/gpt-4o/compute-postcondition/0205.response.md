The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `screen`. `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2000\), and `screen` is a list of `n` strings, where each string contains exactly `m` characters. The characters in the strings are either "." (representing black pixels) or "w" (representing white pixels), and at least one pixel in the monitor is white.

The function has three possible return cases:
- Case_1: The function returns -1.
- Case_2: The function returns -1.
- Case_3: The function returns a list of lists `result` where each inner list is a copy of the corresponding row in the `screen` list with the boundary elements set to "+" if they were originally ".".

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept parameters `n`, `m`, and `screen`, and based on certain conditions, return -1 in two cases or a modified version of `screen` in the third case.
