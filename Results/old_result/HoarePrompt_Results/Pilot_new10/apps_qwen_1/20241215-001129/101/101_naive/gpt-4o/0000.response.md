Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly identifies the smallest possible frame that encompasses all white pixels while ensuring that the frame does not go beyond the borders of the screen. The logic to find the top, bottom, left, and right boundaries of the white pixels is accurate. If these boundaries form a valid frame (i.e., the height and width are both at least 2), the program constructs the frame using '+' characters. If no such frame exists, the program returns -1.

Let's verify the solution with the provided examples:

1. **First Example:**
   ```
   4 8
   ..w..w..
   .......
   .......
   ..w..w..
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   ..w++w..
   ..+..+..
   ..+..+..
   ..w++w..
   ```
   This is correct because the smallest frame that satisfies the conditions is 4x4, and it is correctly drawn.

2. **Second Example:**
   ```
   5 6
   ......
   .w.....
   .......
   ..w....
   .......
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   ......
   +w+....
   +.+....
   ++w....
   .......
   ```
   This is correct because the smallest frame that satisfies the conditions is 3x3, and it is correctly drawn.

3. **Third Example:**
   ```
   2 4
   ...
   .w..
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   ...
   .w..
   ```
   This is correct because the smallest frame that satisfies the conditions is 1x1, and it is correctly drawn.

4. **Fourth Example:**
   ```
   2 6
   w..w.w
   ...w..
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   -1
   ```
   This is correct because no valid frame exists that satisfies the conditions.

Given the verification of the examples and the logic within the program, it correctly handles all potential cases described in the problem statement.
