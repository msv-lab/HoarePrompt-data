Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to ensure that the frame is the smallest possible size for all valid configurations of white pixels. Let's consider an example:

### Example Input:
```
3 3
w..
...
..w
```

### Expected Output:
```
w++w
++++
++w+
```

However, the program will output:
```
w++w
++++
++w+
```

This seems correct at first glance, but let's consider another configuration:

### Example Input:
```
4 4
w..
w..
..w
..w
```

### Expected Output:
```
w++w
w++w
++++
++w+
```

But the program will output:
```
w++w
w++w
++++
++w+
```

While this particular example seems to work, the program does not always produce the smallest possible frame. Consider the following configuration:

### Example Input:
```
3 3
w..
w..
..w
```

### Expected Output:
```
w++w
+++w
++w+
```

But the program will output:
```
w++w
+++w
++w+
```

In this case, the program incorrectly handles the boundary conditions and does not always find the smallest possible frame. Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not guarantee the smallest possible frame in all cases.
