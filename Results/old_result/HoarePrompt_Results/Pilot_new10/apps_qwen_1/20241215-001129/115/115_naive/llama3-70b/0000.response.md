Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly transform matrix \( B \) into matrix \( A \) in all cases. Specifically, the program checks if all four elements in a \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrix are already 1 before performing an operation. However, this approach misses the case where only three out of the four elements in a \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrix are 1, and the fourth element needs to be set to 1 to match the target matrix \( A \).

For example, consider the following input:
```
2 2
1 1
1 0
```
The program would output:
```
-1
```
But it is possible to make matrix \( B \) equal to matrix \( A \) with just one operation:
```
1 1
```
This operation sets \( B_{1,1} \), \( B_{1,2} \), \( B_{2,1} \), and \( B_{2,2} \) to 1, making \( B \) equal to \( A \).

Therefore, the program fails to handle cases where only three elements in a \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrix are 1, leading to incorrect results.
