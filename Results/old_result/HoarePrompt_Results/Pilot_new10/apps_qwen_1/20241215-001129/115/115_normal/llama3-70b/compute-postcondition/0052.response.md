The code `ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))` appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `ops`. Since the initial state does not specify the values of `i` and `j`, they remain as they were before the operation. The list `ops` is initialized or updated with this new tuple.

Output State: **`ops` contains the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`, `i` is unchanged, `j` is unchanged**
