The code `operations.append((i + 1, j + 1))` appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `operations`. Given the initial values of `i` and `j` as `n-2` and `n-1` respectively, we can calculate `i + 1` and `j + 1`:

- `i + 1 = (n-2) + 1 = n-1`
- `j + 1 = (n-1) + 1 = n`

Therefore, the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` becomes `(n-1, n)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `j` is `n-1`, `m` is greater than 0, `n` is the same; `B[n-2][n-1]` is 1, `B[n-2][n]` is 1, `B[n-1][n-1]` is 1, `B[n-1][n]` is 1; `operations` contains the tuple `(n-1, n)`**
