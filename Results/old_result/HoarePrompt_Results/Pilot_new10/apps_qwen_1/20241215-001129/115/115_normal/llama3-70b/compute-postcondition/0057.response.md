The code `ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))` appends a new tuple to the list `ops`. This tuple consists of the values `i + 1` and `j + 1`. According to the initial state, `i` is `k` and `j` is `m - 1`. Therefore, the appended tuple will be `(k + 1, m)`. The loop continues to the next iteration because the condition `A[i][j] == 1 or A[i + 1][j] == 1 or A[i][j + 1] == 1 or A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1` is not specified to be checked here, and it does not change the values of `i` and `j`.

Output State: **`i` is `k`, `j` is `m-1`, and `ops` contains the tuple `(k + 1, m)`**
