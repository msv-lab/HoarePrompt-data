The `continue` statement in the given code does not change the values of any variables; instead, it skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Given the initial state, the values of `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` remain unchanged. Additionally, `ops` and the condition involving `j` also remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A[i][j]` is 1, `A[i + 1][j]` is 1, `A[i][j + 1]` is 1, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1, and `ops` contains the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` since the if condition is satisfied, and `j` is now `j_end_prev + 1`**
