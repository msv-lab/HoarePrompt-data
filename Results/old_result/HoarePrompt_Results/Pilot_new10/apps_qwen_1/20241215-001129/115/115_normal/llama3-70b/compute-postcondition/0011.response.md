Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is 0
- `n` is at least 2
- `m` is an integer between 2 and 50
- `A` is an `n x m` matrix where each element is either 0 or 1
- `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 1)`
- The condition `(A[0][j] == 1 or A[1][j] == 1 or A[0][j + 1] == 1 or (A[1][j + 1] == 1))` holds as is

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(m - 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `m - 2`. This means that if `j` is less than `m - 1`, the loop can continue executing.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is some value less than `m - 1`. Let's denote this value as `j_end`.
3. **Next State**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 and checked against `m - 1`.

Since `j_end < m - 1`, the next value of `j` will be `j_end + 1`.

### Adjusted States:
- `i` remains unchanged, so it is still 0.
- `n` remains unchanged, so it is still at least 2.
- `m` remains unchanged, so it is still an integer between 2 and 50.
- `A` remains unchanged, so it is still an `n x m` matrix where each element is either 0 or 1.
- `ops` remains unchanged, so it is still a list containing the tuple `(1, 1)`.
- The condition `(A[0][j] == 1 or A[1][j] == 1 or A[0][j + 1] == 1 or (A[1][j + 1] == 1))` must hold for the new value of `j`, which is `j_end + 1`.

### Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- `i` is 0
- `n` is at least 2
- `m` is an integer between 2 and 50
- `A` is an `n x m` matrix where each element is either 0 or 1
- `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 1)`
- The condition `(A[0][j] == 1 or A[1][j] == 1 or A[0][j + 1] == 1 or (A[1][j + 1] == 1))` holds for `j = j_end + 1`

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is an `n x m` matrix where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 1)`, and the condition `(A[0][j] == 1 or A[1][j] == 1 or A[0][j + 1] == 1 or (A[1][j + 1] == 1))` holds for `j = j_end + 1`**
