The function `func` accepts no parameters directly listed in the function signature. However, based on the constraints provided, it seems the function should operate on a matrix $A$ which is an $n \times m$ matrix where each element is either $0$ or $1$. The constraints specify that $n$ and $m$ are positive integers such that $2 \le n, m \le 50$. 

Given the provided information about the output cases, it implies that the function returns a specific value based on certain conditions related to the matrix $A$. However, since the function signature does not include $A$ as a parameter, we will focus on what the function should logically do based on typical problem descriptions.

Case_1: The function returns the sum of all elements in the matrix $A$.
Case_2: The function returns the number of rows in the matrix $A$.
Case_3: The function returns the number of columns in the matrix $A$.

Since the function signature does not include $A$ as a parameter, we will describe the functionality based on the logical operations that could be performed with such a matrix.

Functionality: **The function accepts an $n \times m$ matrix $A$ where each element is either $0$ or $1$, and $n$ and $m$ are positive integers such that $2 \le n, m \le 50$. It returns the sum of all elements in the matrix $A$ in Case_1, the number of rows in the matrix $A$ in Case_2, or the number of columns in the matrix $A$ in Case_3.**
