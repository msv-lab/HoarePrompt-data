Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- The current for loop is defined as `for i in range(n - 1):`
- We need to determine the states that should be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 2`.
2. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - Suppose at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value `k` (where `0 <= k < n - 2`).
   - Therefore, the next value of `i` would be `k + 1`.

3. **Condition for Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.
   - If `i` is currently `k`, then `k + 1` must be less than `n - 1`.

4. **State Adjustments**:
   - After the loop completes, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - Hence, `i` becomes `k + 1`.
   - To ensure the loop continues, `n` must remain the same because `range(n - 1)` does not depend on `i` but rather on the initial value of `n`.

### Conclusion:
At the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be `k + 1`.
- `n` must still be greater than `k + 1` to ensure the loop condition `i < n - 1` holds true.

Given the general form, we can represent the final state as:
- `i` will be `k + 1`.
- `n` must be greater than `k + 1`.

Since `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, let's denote it as `i_end` (which is `k`).

### Final State:
State: **`i` is `i_end + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i_end + 1`**

This ensures that the loop condition `i < n - 1` is satisfied for the next iteration.
