Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers, `B` is a 2D list of dimensions `n` by `m` where each element is 0 or 1, `operations` is a list of tuples containing all the coordinates (i+1, j+1) of the 2x2 blocks in `A` that were updated to 1s in `B`, `n` is the same as the initial value, `m` is the same as the initial value.**
