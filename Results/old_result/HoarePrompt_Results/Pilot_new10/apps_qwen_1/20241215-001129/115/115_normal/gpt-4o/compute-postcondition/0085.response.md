The code `print(len(operations))` prints the length of the `operations` list, which contains the coordinates of the 2x2 blocks in `A` that were updated to 1s in `B`. The length of the `operations` list is the number of such blocks. The variables `A`, `B`, `n`, `m`, and `i` and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers, `B` is a 2D list of dimensions `n` by `m` where each element is 0 or 1, `operations` is a list of tuples representing the coordinates (i+1, j+1) of the 2x2 blocks in `A` that were updated to 1s in `B`, `n` is the same as the initial value, `m` is the same as the initial value, the output of the print function is the length of `operations`**
