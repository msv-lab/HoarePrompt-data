Postcondition: ***`A` is a matrix, and `i` and `j` are indices within the matrix `A`. If all the following conditions are met: `A[i][j] == 1`, `A[i + 1][j] == 1`, `A[i][j + 1] == 1`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1`, then these conditions remain true. There is no else part, so no additional changes occur if the conditions are not met.***
