You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given two matrices $A$ and $B$. Each matrix contains exactly $n$ rows and $m$ columns. Each element of $A$ is either $0$ or $1$; each element of $B$ is initially $0$.

You may perform some operations with matrix $B$. During each operation, you choose any submatrix of $B$ having size $2 \times 2$, and replace every element in the chosen submatrix with $1$. In other words, you choose two integers $x$ and $y$ such that $1 \le x < n$ and $1 \le y < m$, and then set $B_{x, y}$, $B_{x, y + 1}$, $B_{x + 1, y}$ and $B_{x + 1, y + 1}$ to $1$.

Your goal is to make matrix $B$ equal to matrix $A$. Two matrices $A$ and $B$ are equal if and only if every element of matrix $A$ is equal to the corresponding element of matrix $B$.

Is it possible to make these matrices equal? If it is, you have to come up with a sequence of operations that makes $B$ equal to $A$. Note that you don't have to minimize the number of operations.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($2 \le n, m \le 50$).

Then $n$ lines follow, each containing $m$ integers. The $j$-th integer in the $i$-th line is $A_{i, j}$. Each integer is either $0$ or $1$.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible to make $B$ equal to $A$, print one integer $-1$.

Otherwise, print any sequence of operations that transforms $B$ into $A$ in the following format: the first line should contain one integer $k$ — the number of operations, and then $k$ lines should follow, each line containing two integers $x$ and $y$ for the corresponding operation (set $B_{x, y}$, $B_{x, y + 1}$, $B_{x + 1, y}$ and $B_{x + 1, y + 1}$ to $1$). The condition $0 \le k \le 2500$ should hold.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3
1 1 1
1 1 1
0 1 1

Output
3
1 1
1 2
2 2

Input
3 3
1 0 1
1 0 1
0 0 0

Output
-1

Input
3 2
0 0
0 0
0 0

Output
0



-----Note-----

The sequence of operations in the first example: $\begin{matrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & & 1 & 1 & 0 & & 1 & 1 & 1 & & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \rightarrow & 1 & 1 & 0 & \rightarrow & 1 & 1 & 1 & \rightarrow & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & & 0 & 0 & 0 & & 0 & 0 & 0 & & 0 & 1 & 1 \end{matrix}$

                B[i][j] = B[i][j + 1] = B[i + 1][j] = B[i + 1][j + 1] = 1
                operations.append((i + 1, j + 1))

        for j in range(m):
            if A[i][j] != B[i][j]:
                return -1

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a logical flaw in its approach to transforming matrix \( B \) into matrix \( A \). Specifically, the program checks if all four elements in a \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrix of \( A \) are \( 1 \) before setting the corresponding elements in \( B \) to \( 1 \). However, this approach fails to account for scenarios where individual elements in \( A \) need to be set to \( 1 \) without the surrounding elements also being \( 1 \).

For example, consider the following input:

```
Input:
3 3
1 0 1
1 0 1
0 0 0
```

The program will not be able to transform \( B \) into \( A \) because it requires all four elements in a \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrix to be \( 1 \) to perform an operation, but in this case, there are no such \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrices where all elements are \( 1 \). Therefore, the program will return \(-1\), which is the correct output for this case. However, the program does not handle the scenario where individual elements need to be set to \( 1 \) without the surrounding elements also being \( 1 \).

Since the program does not handle all possible cases correctly, it is considered incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:

    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])

    index = 2
    for i in range(n):
        row = []
        for j in range(m):
            row.append(int(data[index]))
            index += 1
        A.append(row)
    func_1(n, m, A)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 50, and A is a 2D list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1.
def func_1(n, m, A):
    operations = []
    B = [([0] * m) for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n - 1):
        for j in range(m - 1):
            if A[i][j] == 1 and A[i][j + 1] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][
                j + 1] == 1:
                B[i][j] = B[i][j + 1] = B[i + 1][j] = B[i + 1][j + 1] = 1
                operations.append((i + 1, j + 1))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is `n-2`, `n` is the same as the initial value, `m` is the same as the initial value, `A` is a 2D list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, `B` is a 2D list of dimensions `n` by `m` where each element is 0 or 1 based on the conditions met during the loop execution, `operations` is a list of tuples representing the coordinates (i+1, j+1) of the 2x2 blocks in `A` that were updated to 1s in `B` according to the conditions specified in the loop, and no further updates can be made since the loop has finished executing.
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if A[i][j] != B[i][j]:
                return -1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `A` is a 2D list of integers where each element `A[i][j]` is equal to the corresponding element `B[i][j]` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1` and all `j` from `0` to `m-1`, `i` is `n`, `j` is `m`, `n` is the same as the initial value, `m` is the same as the initial value, `B` is a 2D list of dimensions `n` by `m` where each element is 0 or 1 based on the conditions met during the loop execution, `operations` is a list of tuples representing the coordinates (i+1, j+1) of the 2x2 blocks in `A` that were updated to 1s in `B` according to the conditions specified in the loop, and no further updates can be made since the loop has finished executing.
    print(len(operations))
    for op in operations:
        print(op[0], op[1])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `A` is a 2D list of integers, `B` is a 2D list of dimensions `n` by `m` where each element is 0 or 1, `operations` is a list of tuples containing all the coordinates (i+1, j+1) of the 2x2 blocks in `A` that were updated to 1s in `B`, `n` is the same as the initial value, `m` is the same as the initial value.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `A`, where `n` and `m` are positive integers (2 ≤ n, m ≤ 50) and `A` is a 2D list of integers (0 or 1). The function iterates through `A` to identify 2x2 blocks of 1s and updates corresponding positions in `B` to 1. After updating, it checks if `A` and `B` match. If they do not match, it returns -1. If they match, it prints the length of the operations list and each operation (coordinates of the 2x2 blocks). In all cases, the function returns -1 if there is any mismatch.
