Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State:
- `i` is `i_end + 1`
- `n` must be greater than `i_end + 1`
- `m` must be greater than 1
- `A` and `B` are matrices initialized to some values (not specified)
- `operations` is an empty list

### Loop Code:
```python
for j in range(m - 1):
    if A[i][j] == 1 and A[i][j + 1] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1:
        B[i][j] = B[i][j + 1] = B[i + 1][j] = B[i + 1][j + 1] = 1
        operations.append((i + 1, j + 1))
```

### Analysis:

1. **First Iteration (`j = 0`):**
   - If the condition `A[i][0] == 1 and A[i][1] == 1 and A[i + 1][0] == 1 and A[i + 1][1] == 1` is true, then:
     - `B[i][0]`, `B[i][1]`, `B[i + 1][0]`, and `B[i + 1][1]` are set to 1.
     - `operations` contains the tuple `(i + 1, 1)`.

2. **Second Iteration (`j = 1`):**
   - If the condition `A[i][1] == 1 and A[i][2] == 1 and A[i + 1][1] == 1 and A[i + 1][2] == 1` is true, then:
     - `B[i][1]`, `B[i][2]`, `B[i + 1][1]`, and `B[i + 1][2]` are set to 1.
     - `operations` contains the tuple `(i + 1, 2)`.

3. **General Iteration (`j = k`):**
   - For each `j` from `0` to `m - 2`, if the condition `A[i][j] == 1 and A[i][j + 1] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1` is true, then:
     - `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` are set to 1.
     - `operations` contains the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`.

4. **Final State After All Iterations:**
   - If the loop executes `m - 1` times, the value of `j` will be `m - 2`.
   - `i` will increment by 1 after the loop completes, so `i` will be `i_end + 2`.
   - `B` will be updated according to the conditions met during the loop.
   - `operations` will contain all tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` where the conditions were satisfied.

### Final Output State:
- `i` is `i_end + 2`
- `n` must be greater than `i_end + 1`
- `m` must be greater than 1
- `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` are set to 1 for all valid `j` where the conditions are met.
- `operations` contains all tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` where the conditions were satisfied.
- `A` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified outside the loop.

### Output State:
**Output State: **`i` is `i_end + 2`, `n` must be greater than `i_end + 1`, `m` must be greater than 1, `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` are set to 1 for all valid `j` where the conditions `A[i][j] == 1 and A[i][j + 1] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1` are met, `operations` contains all tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` where the conditions were satisfied, `A` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified outside the loop.**
