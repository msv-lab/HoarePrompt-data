Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `A[i][j]` is 1
   - `A[i + 1][j]` is 1
   - `A[i][j + 1]` is 1
   - `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1
   - The tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` is included in `ops`
   - `j` is now `j_end_prev + 1`

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `m - 2`.

3. **What Changes in Each Iteration**:
   - The value of `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.

4. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was `j_end_prev + 1`.

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be within the range `0` to `m - 2`.
   - Therefore, `j` should be `j_end_prev + 2` at the start of the next iteration.

6. **Other Variables**:
   - The values of `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` remain unchanged as they are not modified inside the loop.
   - The tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` being included in `ops` does not change with the loop.
   - `j` itself changes as explained above.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
- `A[i][j]` is 1
- `A[i + 1][j]` is 1
- `A[i][j + 1]` is 1
- `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1
- The tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` is included in `ops`
- `j` is now `j_end_prev + 2`

State: **`A[i][j]` is 1, `A[i + 1][j]` is 1, `A[i][j + 1]` is 1, `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1, the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` is included in `ops`, `j` is now `j_end_prev + 2`**
