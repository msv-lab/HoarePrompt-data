Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `m - 1`, `ops` contains all tuples \((i + 1, j + 1)\) for each position \((i, j)\) in the matrix \(A\) that satisfy the condition \(A[i][j] == 1\) or \(A[i + 1][j] == 1\) or \(A[i][j + 1] == 1\) or \(A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1\), `n` is a non-negative integer at least 2, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, and `A` is an \(n \times m\) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1.**

### Explanation:
1. **Loop Execution Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `m - 2` (inclusive).
   - For each value of `j`, the loop checks if the conditions \(A[i][j] == 1\) or \(A[i + 1][j] == 1\) or \(A[i][j + 1] == 1\) or \(A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1\) are met.
   - If the conditions are met, the tuple \((i + 1, j + 1)\) is appended to `ops`.
   - If the conditions are not met, the loop continues to the next iteration.

2. **Final Values After Loop Completion**:
   - Since the loop iterates from `j = 0` to `j = m - 2`, it will check all elements in the last column except the last element itself.
   - The variable `i` remains constant at `n - 1` throughout the loop.
   - The variable `j` will be `m - 1` when the loop exits because it increments from `0` to `m - 2`.

3. **Value of `ops`**:
   - `ops` will contain all tuples \((i + 1, j + 1)\) where the conditions \(A[i][j] == 1\) or \(A[i + 1][j] == 1\) or \(A[i][j + 1] == 1\) or \(A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1\) are satisfied for positions \((i, j)\) in the matrix \(A\).
   - Since the loop processes each row from `0` to `n - 2` and each column from `0` to `m - 2`, `ops` will capture all such valid tuples.

4. **Special Case: No Elements Satisfy Conditions**:
   - If no elements in the matrix \(A\) satisfy the conditions, then `ops` will remain empty, and the values of `i`, `j`, `n`, `m`, and `A` will remain as per the initial state.

Thus, the final output state after the loop completes all its iterations is as described above.
