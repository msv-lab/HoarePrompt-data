Postcondition: ***`A[i][j]` is 1, `A[i + 1][j]` is 1, `A[i][j + 1]` is 1, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1, and `ops` contains the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` since the if condition is satisfied, and `j` is now `j_end_prev + 1`. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains as described in the if part.***
