The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, since the `continue` statement does not modify any variables and simply skips to the next iteration, the values of all variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is an `n x m` matrix where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` is an empty list, and the elements `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all equal to 1**
