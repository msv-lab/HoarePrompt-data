Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `i` is `i_end + 1`.
   - `n` must be greater than `i_end + 1`.
   - `m` must be greater than 1.
   - The condition `A[i][j] == 1 and A[i][j + 1] == 1 and (A[i + 1][j] == 1) and (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1)` determines if an operation is added to the `operations` list.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `m - 2`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration:**
   - We need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.
   - At the end of the last iteration, `j` would be one less than the maximum value it can take (i.e., `m - 2`).

4. **State Adjustment:**
   - `j` is increased by 1 at the start of each iteration, so if the loop is to execute one more time, `j` should be `m - 2`.
   - `i` remains the same, so it is still `i_end + 1`.
   - `n` and `m` remain unchanged as there are no modifications to these variables within the loop itself.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is `i_end + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i_end + 1`, and `m` must be greater than 1. `j` is `m - 2`**.
