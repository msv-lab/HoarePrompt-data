The code assigns the value 1 to `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]`. The initial values of these elements in `A` are already given as 1, so their values remain unchanged. The values of `i`, `n`, `m`, and the values of `A[i][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` also remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `i_end + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i_end + 1`, `m` must be greater than 1, the value of `A[i][j]` is 1, the value of `A[i][j + 1]` is 1, the value of `A[i + 1][j]` is 1, the value of `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1, `B[i][j]` is 1, `B[i][j + 1]` is 1, `B[i + 1][j]` is 1, `B[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1**
