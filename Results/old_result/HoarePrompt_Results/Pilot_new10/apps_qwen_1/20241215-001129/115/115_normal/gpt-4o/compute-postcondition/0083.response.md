Output State: **`A` and `B` are lists of lists of integers, `i` is `n`, `j` is `m`, if any element at position `[i][j]` in `A` is not equal to the corresponding element in `B`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, the function completes execution without returning a value.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is 0.
   - `j` is `m-1`.
   - `n` and `m` are the same as their initial values.
   - `A` and `B` are 2D lists of integers where each element `A[n-1][j]` and `B[n-1][j]` is 1 for all `j` from `0` to `m-1` if there were no mismatches.
   - `operations` is a list of tuples representing the coordinates (i+1, j+1) of the 2x2 blocks in `A` that were updated to 1s in `B` according to the conditions specified in the loop.
   - `A[i][j]` is equal to `B[i][j]` for all `j` from `0` to `m-1`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `m-1`.
   - For each iteration, the loop checks if `A[i][j]` is equal to `B[i][j]`.
   - If any `A[i][j]` is not equal to `B[i][j]`, the function immediately returns `-1`.

3. **End Condition**:
   - If the loop completes all iterations without finding any mismatch (`A[i][j]` is always equal to `B[i][j]`), the loop exits and the function continues to its next steps.
   - Since the loop starts with `i = 0` and `j = m-1`, and `j` increments with each iteration until `j = m`, and `i` remains constant throughout, the loop will eventually cover all columns for `i = 0`.

4. **Final State**:
   - After the loop completes, `i` will be `0` (unchanged because the loop only changes `j`).
   - `j` will be `m` (after completing all iterations of `j` from `0` to `m-1`).
   - The condition `if A[i][j] != B[i][j]: return -1` will be checked for every column.
   - If all elements match (`A[i][j] == B[i][j]` for all `j`), the function completes without returning a value.

### Conclusion:
- If the loop completes all iterations without finding any mismatch, `i` remains `0` and `j` becomes `m`, and the function does not return a value.
- If any mismatch is found during the loop execution, the function returns `-1` immediately.

Thus, the final output state is:
**`A` and `B` are lists of lists of integers, `i` is `0`, `j` is `m`, if any element at position `[i][j]` in `A` is not equal to the corresponding element in `B`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, the function completes execution without returning a value.**
