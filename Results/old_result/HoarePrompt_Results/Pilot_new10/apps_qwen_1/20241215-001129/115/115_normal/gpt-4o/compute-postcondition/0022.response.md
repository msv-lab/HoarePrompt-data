Postcondition: ***`i` is `i_end + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i_end + 1`, and `m` must be greater than 1. If the condition `A[i][j] == 1 and A[i][j + 1] == 1 and (A[i + 1][j] == 1) and (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1)` is true, then `operations` now contains `[(i_end + 2, j_end + 2)]`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
