Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State Information:**
   - `ops` is a non-empty list (at least one tuple exists in the list).
   - `n` is a non-negative integer at least 2.
   - `m` is an integer between 2 and 50.
   - `A` is an \(n \times m\) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1.
   - `op[0]` is a tuple and its first and second elements are printed.

2. **Loop Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over each tuple in the list `ops`.
   - The loop condition is based on the availability of tuples in `ops`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration:**
   - The loop has completed one iteration.
   - `ops` still contains at least one tuple (since it is non-empty).
   - `n` remains unchanged from the previous state.
   - `m` remains unchanged from the previous state.
   - `A` remains unchanged from the previous state.
   - `op[0]` is a tuple, but we do not know its specific values since they were printed in the previous iteration.

4. **Adjusting States for Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `ops` must still contain at least one tuple.
   - Since `n`, `m`, and `A` do not change during the loop, they remain the same as the previous state.
   - The next `op` will be the first tuple in the remaining list of `ops`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `ops` is a non-empty list (still contains at least one tuple).
- `n` is a non-negative integer at least 2.
- `m` is an integer between 2 and 50.
- `A` is an \(n \times m\) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1.
- The next `op` will be the first tuple in the updated `ops` list.

State: **`ops` is a non-empty list, `n` is a non-negative integer at least 2, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is an \(n \times m\) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1, and the next `op` will be the first tuple in the updated `ops` list.**
