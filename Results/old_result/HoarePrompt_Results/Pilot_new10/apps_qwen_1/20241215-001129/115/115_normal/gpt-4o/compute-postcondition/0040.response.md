The code appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `operations`. The values of `i` and `j` are both `n-2`, so `i + 1` is `n-1` and `j + 1` is also `n-1`. The values of the other variables (`B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, `B[i + 1][j + 1]`, `m`, and `n`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `j` is `n-2`, `B[i][j]` is 1, `B[i][j + 1]` is 1, `B[i + 1][j]` is 1, `B[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `n` is the same, operations contains the tuple `(n-1, n-1)`**
