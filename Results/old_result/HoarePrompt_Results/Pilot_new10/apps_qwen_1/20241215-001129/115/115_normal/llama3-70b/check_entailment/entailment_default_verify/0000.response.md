Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program fails to account for scenarios where only three out of the four elements in a \(2 \times 2\) submatrix are 1. This oversight leads to incorrect outputs, as demonstrated by the example input:

```
2 2
1 1
1 0
```

In this case, the program incorrectly prints `-1`, indicating it's impossible to make \( B \) equal to \( A \), which is not true since setting the entire \(2 \times 2\) submatrix to 1 would achieve the desired result. The output hints confirm that the program identifies positions where at least one of the adjacent cells is 1, but it does not ensure that all necessary transformations are made, especially when only three elements need to be set to 1. Therefore, the program is not correct for every potential case.
