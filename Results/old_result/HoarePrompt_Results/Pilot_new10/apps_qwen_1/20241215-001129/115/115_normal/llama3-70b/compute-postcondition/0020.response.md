Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is an `n x m` matrix where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `[(1, 1), (i + 1, j + 1)]`, and `j` is `j + 1`. The postcondition remains the same as the precondition regardless of whether the condition `A[i][j] == 1 or A[i + 1][j] == 1 or A[i][j + 1] == 1 or (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1)` is true or false.***
