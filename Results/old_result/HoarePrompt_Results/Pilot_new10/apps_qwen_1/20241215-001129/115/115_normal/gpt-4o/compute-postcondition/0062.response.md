Postcondition: ***`i` is `n-1`, `j` is `0`, `n` is the same as the initial value, `m` is the same as the initial value, `A` is a 2D list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, `B` is a 2D list of dimensions `n` by `m` where each element is 0 or 1 based on the conditions met during the loop execution, `operations` is a list of tuples representing the coordinates (i+1, j+1) of the 2x2 blocks in `A` that were updated to 1s in `B` according to the conditions specified in the loop, and no further updates can be made since the loop has finished executing, and the current value of `A[i][j]` is not equal to the current value of `B[i][j]`***
