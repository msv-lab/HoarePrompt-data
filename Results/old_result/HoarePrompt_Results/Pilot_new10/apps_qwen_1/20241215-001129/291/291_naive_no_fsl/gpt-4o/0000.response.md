Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to minimize the number of segments drawn with a ruler. Specifically, the formula used to calculate the number of segments needed does not match the problem description.

To illustrate, let's consider the example where \( n = 4 \):

- According to the problem description, drawing 4 squares requires 4 segments to be drawn with a ruler initially, and the rest can be drawn using the initial ones as guides. Therefore, the correct output should be 4.

However, the program calculates the number of segments using the formula \( 2 \times (a + b) \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are determined from the equation \( n = ab \). For \( n = 4 \), the possible values for \( a \) and \( b \) are:

- \( a = 1, b = 4 \): \( 2 \times (1 + 4) = 10 \)
- \( a = 2, b = 2 \): \( 2 \times (2 + 2) = 8 \)
- \( a = 4, b = 1 \): \( 2 \times (4 + 1) = 10 \)

The program returns the minimum value among these, which is 8. However, this is incorrect according to the problem description.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
