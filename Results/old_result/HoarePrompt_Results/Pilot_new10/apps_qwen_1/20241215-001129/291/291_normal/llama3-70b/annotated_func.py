#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    print(2 * (n.bit_length() - 1) + 2)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts user input `n` (an integer), and prints the value `2 * (n.bit_length() - 1) + 2`.
