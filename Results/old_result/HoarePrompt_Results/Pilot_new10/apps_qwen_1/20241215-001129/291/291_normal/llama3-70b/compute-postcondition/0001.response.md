The code calculates and prints `2 * (n.bit_length() - 1) + 2`. The `bit_length()` method returns the number of bits necessary to represent an integer in binary, excluding the sign and leading zeros. For an integer \( n \), the number of bits required to represent \( n \) in binary is at least \( \lfloor \log_2(n) \rfloor + 1 \). The formula `2 * (n.bit_length() - 1) + 2` calculates this value and adds 2.

Given that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\):

- The maximum value of `n.bit_length()` when \( n = 10^9 \) is 30 because \( 10^9 \) requires 30 bits in binary representation.
- Therefore, the expression `2 * (n.bit_length() - 1) + 2` will evaluate to `2 * (30 - 1) + 2 = 2 * 29 + 2 = 58 + 2 = 60`.

The print statement will output `60`. However, since the print statement itself does not assign a value to a variable, the only changes are in the console output and the calculation process. The value of `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\)**
