Postcondition: ***`sofas` must contain at least one list of coordinates, `sofa` is an element of `sofas`, `n` and `m` are the dimensions of the storehouse, `d` is the number of sofas in the storehouse, `left` is 1, `right` is 0, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, and the condition `(s != sofa)` is true. Additionally, if the current value of `sofa[0][0]` is less than the current value of `s[0][0]` while `sofa[0][1]` is equal to the current value of `s[0][1]`, then these coordinates have been processed accordingly (specifically, `left` is set to 1). If this condition is not met, then `right` remains 0, `top` remains 0, and `bottom` remains 0.***
