The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop and move to the next iteration of the loop. However, since no loop context is provided in the initial state, we assume this statement is part of a loop, and it will simply continue to the next iteration without changing the current values of the variables.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the variables `d`, `i`, `j`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j`, `top_count[0]`, `left_count[0]`, `right_count[0]`, and `bottom_count[0]` are not directly affected by the `continue` statement. The `continue` statement does not modify any variable's value but instead continues the loop.

Output State: **`d` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `x1_j` remains unchanged, `y1_j` remains unchanged, `x2_j` remains unchanged, `y2_j` remains unchanged, `top_count[0]` is incremented by 1 if `y1 > y2_j` and `y2 > y2_j` otherwise `top_count[0]` remains unchanged, `left_count[0]` remains unchanged, `right_count[0]` remains unchanged, `bottom_count[0]` remains unchanged.**
