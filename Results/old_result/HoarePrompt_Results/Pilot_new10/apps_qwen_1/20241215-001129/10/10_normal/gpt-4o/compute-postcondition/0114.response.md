`right_count[i]` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` is less than `d`, and `d` is greater than 0. The value of `j` is equal to `i`. The values of `x1`, `x2`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are all dependent on `sofas[i]`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is less than `d`; `d` is greater than 0; `j` equals `i`; `x1` is less than `sofas[i][0]`; `x2` is less than `sofas[i][0]`; `x1_j` equals `sofas[i][0]`; `y1_j` equals `sofas[i][1]`; `x2_j` equals `sofas[i][2]`; `y2_j` equals `sofas[i][3]`; `right_count[i]` is increased by 1.**
