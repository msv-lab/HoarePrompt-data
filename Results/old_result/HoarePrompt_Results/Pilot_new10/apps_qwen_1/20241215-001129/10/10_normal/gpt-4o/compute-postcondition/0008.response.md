The code appends a new tuple `(x1, y1, x2, y2)` to the list `sofas`. Since `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth integers input by the user respectively, and these values are already known from the initial state, the list `sofas` will now contain an additional tuple with these values. The other variables (`d`, `n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d` is the integer input by the user and must be greater than 1, `n` is the first integer input by the user, `m` is the second integer input by the user, `sofas` is a list containing the tuple (the third integer input by the user, the fourth integer input by the user, the fifth integer input by the user, the sixth integer input by the user) and an additional tuple `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`, `x1` is the third integer input by the user, `y1` is the fourth integer input by the user, `x2` is the fifth integer input by the user, `y2` is the sixth integer input by the user**
