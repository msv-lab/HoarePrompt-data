Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle boundary conditions properly, specifically when the sofa is placed on the edges of the storehouse. The function `func_1` does not account for cases where the specified sofa is on the boundary or edge of the storehouse. For instance, if a sofa is placed at the topmost row, the function will incorrectly count sofas above it as 0, even though there are no rows above it. Similarly, if a sofa is placed at the leftmost column, the function will incorrectly count sofas to the left as 0, even though there are no columns to the left.

To illustrate, consider a storehouse with dimensions \( n \times m \) and a sofa placed at \((1, 1)\). The function will not correctly count the number of sofas to the left or above this sofa because there are no such positions available. This leads to incorrect counts for boundary cases, making the program incorrect for every potential case.
