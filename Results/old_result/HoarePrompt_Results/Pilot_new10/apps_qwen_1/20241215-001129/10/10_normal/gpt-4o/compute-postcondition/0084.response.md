The code assigns the values from the second tuple in the `sofas` list to the variables `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j`. Since there is no modification inside the if or else blocks, the values of `d`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. The variables `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are updated to the values of the second tuple in the `sofas` list.

Output State: **`d` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `x1_j` is the first element of the second tuple in the `sofas` list, `y1_j` is the second element of the second tuple in the `sofas` list, `x2_j` is the third element of the second tuple in the `sofas` list, and `y2_j` is the fourth element of the second tuple in the `sofas` list.**
