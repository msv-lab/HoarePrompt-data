Postcondition: ***`sofas` must contain at least one list of coordinates, `sofa` is an element of `sofas`, `n` and `m` are the dimensions of the storehouse, `d` is the number of sofas in the storehouse, `left` is 1, `right` is 1, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, and the condition `(s != sofa)` is true. Additionally, since the if condition `(sofa[0][0] > s[0][0] and sofa[0][1] == s[0][1])` is evaluated, these coordinates have been processed accordingly (specifically, `left` remains 1).***

This postcondition summarizes the state of the program variables after the execution of the if-else block, considering the given conditions and outcomes from both the if and else parts.
