`bottom_count[i]` is incremented by 1. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the `bottom_count[i]` increases by 1 from its previous state.

Output State: **`i` is less than `d`, `d` is greater than 0, `j` equals `i + 1`, `x1` is less than `sofas[i][0]`, `x2` is less than `sofas[i][0]`, `x1_j` equals `sofas[j][0]`, `y1_j` equals `sofas[j][1]`, `x2_j` equals `sofas[j][2]`, `y2_j` equals `sofas[j][3]`, `bottom_count[i]` is incremented by 1 from its previous state (either incremented by 2 or 1 based on the conditions), `top_count[i]` is incremented by 1, `right_count[i]` remains unchanged unless the condition `x1 < x1_j and x2 < x1_j` is true, and `left_count[i]` remains unchanged.
