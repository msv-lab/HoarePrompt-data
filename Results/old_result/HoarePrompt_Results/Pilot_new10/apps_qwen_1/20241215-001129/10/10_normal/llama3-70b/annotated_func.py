#State of the program right berfore the function call: sofa is a list containing four integers representing the coordinates of a sofa (x1, y1, x2, y2), and sofas is a list of such lists representing the coordinates of all sofas in the storehouse. Each sofa is defined by two cells that share a side, and no cell is covered by more than one sofa. The lengths of the storehouse are represented by n and m, and d is the number of sofas in the storehouse.
def func_1(sofa, sofas):
    left, right, top, bottom = 0, 0, 0, 0
    for s in sofas:
        if s != sofa:
            if sofa[0][0] < s[0][0] and sofa[0][1] == s[0][1]:
                left += 1
            if sofa[0][0] > s[0][0] and sofa[0][1] == s[0][1]:
                right += 1
            if sofa[0][1] < s[0][1] and sofa[0][0] == s[0][0]:
                top += 1
            if sofa[0][1] > s[0][1] and sofa[0][0] == s[0][0]:
                bottom += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sofas` contains all the coordinates of the sofas in the storehouse, `sofa` is the original sofa coordinates, `n` and `m` are the dimensions of the storehouse, `d` is the number of sofas in the storehouse, `left` is the count of sofas to the left of `sofa`, `right` is the count of sofas to the right of `sofa`, `top` is the count of sofas above `sofa`, and `bottom` is the count of sofas below `sofa`.
    return left, right, top, bottom
    #`left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom` which represent the count of sofas to the left, right, above, and below the original sofa `sofa` respectively
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `sofa`, a list containing the coordinates of a specific sofa (x1, y1, x2, y2), and `sofas`, a list of such lists representing the coordinates of all sofas in the storehouse. The function counts and returns the number of sofas located to the left, right, above, and below the specified sofa. Specifically, it returns `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom`, which represent the counts of sofas in those respective directions. The function does not account for cases where the specified sofa is on the boundary or edge of the storehouse, so these counts might be zero if the sofa is adjacent to the edges.
