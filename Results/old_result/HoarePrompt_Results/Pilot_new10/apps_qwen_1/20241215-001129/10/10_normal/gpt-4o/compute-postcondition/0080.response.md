Postcondition: ***`d` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are assigned the values from the first tuple in the `sofas` list. If the condition `(y1 > y2_j and y2 > y2_j)` is true, then `left_count[0]` and `bottom_count[0]` remain unchanged, and `top_count[0]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `left_count[0]`, `bottom_count[0]`, and `top_count[0]` remain unchanged.***
