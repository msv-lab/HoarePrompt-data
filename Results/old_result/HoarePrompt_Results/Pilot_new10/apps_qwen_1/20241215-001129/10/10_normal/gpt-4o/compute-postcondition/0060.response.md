Postcondition: ***`d` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `sofas` contains exactly `d` tuples, `j` is 2, `x1_2` is `x1_2`, `y1_2` is `y1_2`, `x2_2` is `x2_2`, `y2_2` is `y2_2`, `right_count[0]` is 1, and `top_count[0]` is 1. If `y1 > y2_2` and `y2 > y2_2` are true, then `top_count[0]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
