The code `x1, y1, x2, y2 = map(int, input().strip().split())` reads four integers from the user input, splits them, and converts them into integers. These integers are then assigned to `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` respectively. 

- `d` is the integer input by the user and must be greater than 1.
- `n` is the first integer input by the user.
- `m` is the second integer input by the user.
- `sofas` is a list containing the tuple (`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`).
- `x1` is updated to the third integer input by the user.
- `y1` is updated to the fourth integer input by the user.
- `x2` is updated to the fifth integer input by the user.
- `y2` is updated to the sixth integer input by the user.

The output state is:
Output State: **`d` is the integer input by the user and must be greater than 1, `n` is the first integer input by the user, `m` is the second integer input by the user, `sofas` is a list containing the tuple (the third integer input by the user, the fourth integer input by the user, the fifth integer input by the user, the sixth integer input by the user), `x1` is the third integer input by the user, `y1` is the fourth integer input by the user, `x2` is the fifth integer input by the user, `y2` is the sixth integer input by the user**.
