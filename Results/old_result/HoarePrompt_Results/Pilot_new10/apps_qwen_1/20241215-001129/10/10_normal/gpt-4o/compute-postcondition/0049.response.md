According to the given code, the loop condition for `j` in the range `d` will depend on the value of `j` and `d`. At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:

- `d` is an integer greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `sofas` must contain exactly `d` tuples.
- `j` is 1.
- `x1_1` is the first element of `sofas[1]`.
- `y1_1` is the second element of `sofas[1]`.
- `x2_1` is the third element of `sofas[1]`.
- `y2_1` is the fourth element of `sofas[1]`.
- `y1_j` is `y1_1`.
- `y2_j` is `y2_1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `d`. Currently, `j` is 1, so for the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented to 2 (assuming `d` is at least 2).

We need to adjust the state as follows:

- `j` will be incremented to 2.
- `y1_j` will be updated to `y1_2`, which is the second element of `sofas[2]`.
- `y2_j` will be updated to `y2_2`, which is the fourth element of `sofas[2]`.

However, since no new information about the values of `y1_2` or `y2_2` is provided, we can only increment `j` and update the corresponding indices.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`d` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `sofas` contains exactly `d` tuples, `j` is 2, `x1_2` is the first element of `sofas[2]`, `y1_2` is the second element of `sofas[2]`, `x2_2` is the third element of `sofas[2]`, `y2_2` is the fourth element of `sofas[2]`, `y1_j` is `y1_2`, `y2_j` is `y2_2`.**
