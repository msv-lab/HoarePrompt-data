Precondition: **d is an integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5, there are d lines each containing four integers x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 representing the coordinates of the i-th sofa, where (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) are neighboring cells and no cell is covered by more than one sofa, and the last line contains four integers cnt_{l}, cnt_{r}, cnt_{t}, cnt_{b} such that 0 ≤ cnt_{l}, cnt_{r}, cnt_{t}, cnt_{b} ≤ d - 1.**
