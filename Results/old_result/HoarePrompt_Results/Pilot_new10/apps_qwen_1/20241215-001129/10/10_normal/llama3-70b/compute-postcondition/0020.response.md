Postcondition: ***`sofas` must contain at least one list of coordinates, `sofa` is the next element in `sofas` that is different from the current `sofa`, `n` and `m` are the dimensions of the storehouse, `d` is the number of sofas in the storehouse, `left` is either 2 or unchanged, `right` is 2, and `top` is 1. If `sofa[0][0] > s[0][0]` and `sofa[0][1] == s[0][1]`, then `left` is set to 2. Otherwise, the values of the variables remain unchanged.***
