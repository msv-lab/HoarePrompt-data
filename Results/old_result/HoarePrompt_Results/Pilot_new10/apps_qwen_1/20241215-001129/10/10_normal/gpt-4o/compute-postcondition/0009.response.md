According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `d`. The loop will execute as long as `d` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `d` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is the first integer input by the user, `m` is the second integer input by the user, `sofas` is a list containing the tuple (the third integer input by the user, the fourth integer input by the user, the fifth integer input by the user, the sixth integer input by the user) and an additional tuple `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`, `x1` is the third integer input by the user, `y1` is the fourth integer input by the user, `x2` is the fifth integer input by the user, `y2` is the sixth integer input by the user.

For the loop to execute one more time, `d` must be decremented by 1 and must still be greater than 0. Therefore, `d` should be `d - 1`.

State: **`d` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the first integer input by the user, `m` is the second integer input by the user, `sofas` is a list containing the tuple (the third integer input by the user, the fourth integer input by the user, the fifth integer input by the user, the sixth integer input by the user) and an additional tuple `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`, `x1` is the third integer input by the user, `y1` is the fourth integer input by the user, `x2` is the fifth integer input by the user, `y2` is the sixth integer input by the user**
