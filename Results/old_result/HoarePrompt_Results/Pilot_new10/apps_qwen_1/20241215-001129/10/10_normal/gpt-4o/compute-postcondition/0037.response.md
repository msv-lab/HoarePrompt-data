Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States:
- `d` is an integer greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `sofas` must contain exactly `d` tuples.
- `j` is 0.
- `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[0]`.
- `y1_j` is the second element of `sofas[0]`.
- `x2_j` is the third element of `sofas[0]`.
- `y2_j` is the fourth element of `sofas[0]`.
- `y1` is compared to `y2_j` and `y2` is compared to `y2_j`.
- If `y1 > y2_j` and `y2 > y2_j`, `bottom_count[0]` is 2; otherwise, `left_count[0]` is 1 more than its original value.

### Loop Condition:
The loop `for j in range(d)` iterates from `j = 0` to `j = d - 1`.

### End of Previous Iteration:
At the end of the previous iteration (when `j` was 0), we have:
- `j` is 0.
- `x1_0` is the first element of `sofas[0]`.
- `y1_0` is the second element of `sofas[0]`.
- `x2_0` is the third element of `sofas[0]`.
- `y2_0` is the fourth element of `sofas[0]`.
- The comparison between `y1` and `y2_0`, and `y2` and `y2_0` has occurred, and based on the result, either `bottom_count[0]` is 2 or `left_count[0]` has incremented by 1.

### Next Iteration:
For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will become 1.

### Adjusted States:
- `j` will be 1.
- `x1_1` will be the first element of `sofas[1]`.
- `y1_1` will be the second element of `sofas[1]`.
- `x2_1` will be the third element of `sofas[1]`.
- `y2_1` will be the fourth element of `sofas[1]`.
- The comparison between `y1` and `y2_1`, and `y2` and `y2_1` will occur.

### Final State:
State: **`d` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `sofas` must contain exactly `d` tuples, `j` is 1, `x1_1` is the first element of `sofas[1]`, `y1_1` is the second element of `sofas[1]`, `x2_1` is the third element of `sofas[1]`, `y2_1` is the fourth element of `sofas[1]`, `y1` is compared to `y2_1` and `y2` is compared to `y2_1`. If `y1 > y2_1` and `y2 > y2_1`, `bottom_count[0]` is 2; otherwise, `left_count[0]` is 1 more than its original value.**
