`left_count[i]` is incremented by 1. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, so `left_count[0]` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is:

- `d` is an integer greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `j` is 0
- `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are assigned the values from the first tuple in the `sofas` list
- `x1` is greater than `x2_j`
- `x2` is greater than `x2_j`
- `left_count[0]` is 1 (since it was initially 0 and has been incremented by 1)

Output State: **`d` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are assigned the values from the first tuple in the `sofas` list, `x1` is greater than `x2_j`, `x2` is greater than `x2_j`, `left_count[0]` is 1**
