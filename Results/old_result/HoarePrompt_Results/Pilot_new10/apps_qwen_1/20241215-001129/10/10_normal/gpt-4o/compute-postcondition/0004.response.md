The code snippet reads four integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`. The values of `d`, `n`, `m`, and `sofas` remain unchanged. The initial state of `d` is the integer input by the user, `n` is the first integer input by the user, `m` is the second integer input by the user, `sofas` is an empty list, and `d` must be greater than 0.

After executing the code, the values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` will be the next four integers input by the user.

Output State: **`d` is the integer input by the user, `n` is the first integer input by the user, `m` is the second integer input by the user, `sofas` is an empty list, `x1` is the third integer input by the user, `y1` is the fourth integer input by the user, `x2` is the fifth integer input by the user, `y2` is the sixth integer input by the user, `d` must be greater than 0**
