Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down the solution:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the number of sofas `d`, the dimensions of the storehouse `n` and `m`, the coordinates of each sofa, and the counts of sofas to the left (`cnt_l`), right (`cnt_r`), top (`cnt_t`), and bottom (`cnt_b`) of the target sofa.

2. **Function `func_1`**: This function calculates the number of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of a given sofa. It iterates over all other sofas and checks the conditions specified in the problem description:
   - Left: Checks if the current sofa's top-left cell is to the left of another sofa's top-left cell.
   - Right: Checks if the current sofa's top-left cell is to the right of another sofa's top-left cell.
   - Top: Checks if the current sofa's top-left cell is above another sofa's top-left cell.
   - Bottom: Checks if the current sofa's top-left cell is below another sofa's top-left cell.

3. **Main Loop**: The program iterates over each sofa and uses `func_1` to determine the counts of sofas around it. If the counts match the given values (`cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b`), it prints the index of the sofa (adjusted by adding 1) and breaks out of the loop.

4. **Handling All Cases**: Given the constraints and the logic implemented, the program should correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. For each sofa, it checks the conditions accurately, and if a matching sofa is found, it returns the correct result.

Since the program handles all the specified conditions correctly and there are no apparent edge cases or logical flaws, the program is correct.
