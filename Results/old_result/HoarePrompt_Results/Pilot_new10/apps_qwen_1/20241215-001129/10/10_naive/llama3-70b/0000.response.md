Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic for identifying the correct sofa based on the given conditions. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input data for the number of sofas, dimensions of the storehouse, coordinates of each sofa, and the counts (`cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b`).

2. **Function `func_1` Implementation**: The function `func_1` calculates the counts of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of the given sofa. The logic inside this function correctly checks the conditions for each neighboring sofa:
   - If the x-coordinates match and the first y-coordinate is less than the second y-coordinate, it increments the `top` count.
   - If the x-coordinates match and the first y-coordinate is greater than the second y-coordinate, it increments the `bottom` count.
   - If the y-coordinates match and the first x-coordinate is less than the second x-coordinate, it increments the `left` count.
   - If the y-coordinates match and the first x-coordinate is greater than the second x-coordinate, it increments the `right` count.

3. **Main Logic**: The main loop iterates over each sofa and uses `func_1` to calculate the counts for each sofa. If the calculated counts match the required counts (`cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b`), it prints the index of the sofa (plus one since indices are 0-based) and breaks out of the loop.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the case where no sofa matches the required conditions by printing `-1` after checking all sofas.

Given the logic and the implementation, the program should work correctly for all valid inputs as per the problem description. There are no apparent edge cases or logical flaws that would cause the program to fail under any circumstances. Therefore, the program is correct.
