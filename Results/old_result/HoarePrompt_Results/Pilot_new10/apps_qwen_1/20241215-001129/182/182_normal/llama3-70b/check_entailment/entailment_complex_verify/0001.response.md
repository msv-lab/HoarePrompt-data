Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment stated that the program correctly determines the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed to minimize the deviation from vertical for both positive and negative rotation angles. However, upon reviewing the annotated version of the code and the logic implemented, it appears that the program does not handle negative angles correctly. Specifically, the code only considers angles in the range [0, 359], which means it cannot properly account for negative input values (i.e., clockwise rotations greater than 360 degrees or counter-clockwise rotations).

For example, consider the input `-60`. According to the problem description, a `-60` degree rotation corresponds to a 300-degree clockwise rotation. However, the program would normalize `-60` to `300` degrees, and the logic would incorrectly suggest `3` turns (since `(300 + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4` results in `3`). The correct answer should be `1` turn, as a single 90-degree clockwise turn would align the image properly.

Therefore, the original assessment is not accurate, and the program needs to handle negative angles appropriately.
