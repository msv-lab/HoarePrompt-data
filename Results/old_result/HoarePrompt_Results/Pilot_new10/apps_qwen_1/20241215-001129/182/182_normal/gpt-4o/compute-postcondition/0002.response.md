`turns` is assigned the value of `(360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4`. Since `normalized_angle` is equal to `x % 360`, the expression simplifies to `(360 - (x % 360)) // 90 % 4`. The value of `x % 360` can range from 0 to 359. We need to consider different cases for `x % 360` to determine the value of `turns`.

- If `x % 360` is between 0 and 89 (inclusive), then `360 - (x % 360)` is between 271 and 359 (inclusive). Dividing by 90 gives 3 or 3 with a remainder, and taking modulo 4 results in 3.
- If `x % 360` is between 90 and 179 (inclusive), then `360 - (x % 360)` is between 181 and 270 (inclusive). Dividing by 90 gives 2 or 2 with a remainder, and taking modulo 4 results in 2.
- If `x % 360` is between 180 and 269 (inclusive), then `360 - (x % 360)` is between 91 and 179 (inclusive). Dividing by 90 gives 1 or 1 with a remainder, and taking modulo 4 results in 1.
- If `x % 360` is between 270 and 359 (inclusive), then `360 - (x % 360)` is between 1 and 89 (inclusive). Dividing by 90 gives 0 or 0 with a remainder, and taking modulo 4 results in 0.

Therefore, the value of `turns` depends on the value of `x % 360`:

- If `x % 360` is between 0 and 89 (inclusive), `turns` is 3.
- If `x % 360` is between 90 and 179 (inclusive), `turns` is 2.
- If `x % 360` is between 180 and 269 (inclusive), `turns` is 1.
- If `x % 360` is between 270 and 359 (inclusive), `turns` is 0.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`x` is `x % 360`, `normalized_angle` is `x % 360`, `turns` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3 depending on the value of `x % 360`.**
