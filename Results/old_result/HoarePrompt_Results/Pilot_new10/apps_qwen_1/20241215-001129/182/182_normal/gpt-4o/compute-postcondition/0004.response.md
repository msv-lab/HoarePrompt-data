The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to return a value based on the constraint that the input `x` should be an integer such that \(-10^{18} \leq x \leq 10^{18}\).

However, since no specific behavior or output conditions are provided for the function body, we can only state the parameter constraint.

Functionality: **The function returns a value without accepting any parameters, but the input `x` must be an integer such that \(-10^{18} \leq x \leq 10^{18}\).**
