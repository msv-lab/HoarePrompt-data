Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down the problem and the provided solution:

#### Problem Description Recap:
1. **Input:** An integer `x` representing the camera rotation angle in degrees. Positive values indicate clockwise rotation, and negative values indicate counter-clockwise rotation.
2. **Output:** The minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed to minimize the deviation from vertical alignment.
3. **Requirements:**
   - The picture should be rotated by angles divisible by 90 degrees.
   - The number of 90-degree turns should be minimized.
   - The solution must use 90-degree clockwise turns only.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    x = int(input())
    x = x % 360
    if (x == 0):
        print(0)
    else:
        print((x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4)
```

1. **Angle Adjustment:** 
   - `x = x % 360` ensures `x` is within the range [0, 360).
   
2. **Deviation Calculation:**
   - The logic `print((x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4)` attempts to calculate the minimum number of 90-degree turns. However, this approach is flawed:
     - For `x = 60`, the output should be `1` (one 90-degree clockwise turn to align closest to vertical).
     - The current logic instead calculates `(60 + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4 = 149 // 90 % 4 = 1 % 4 = 1`. This looks correct but doesn't handle all cases properly.
     - For `x = -60` (which is equivalent to 300 degrees), the output should be `3` (three 90-degree clockwise turns to align closest to vertical).

3. **Handling Negative Values:**
   - The current logic does not correctly handle negative angles. The modulo operation `% 360` will convert `-60` to `300`, but the logic for counting turns needs to account for the direction of rotation.

#### Correct Solution:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to handle both positive and negative angles and determine the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns required.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    x = int(input())
    x = x % 360
    if x < 0:
        x += 360
    
    # Determine the closest multiple of 90 degrees to 0
    remainder = x % 90
    if remainder <= 45:
        turns = 0
    else:
        turns = 1
    
    # Handle additional full 90-degree rotations
    if x >= 270:
        turns += (x - 270) // 90
    
    print(turns)
```

### Explanation of Corrected Program:
1. **Angle Adjustment:** 
   - `x = x % 360` ensures `x` is within the range [0, 360).
   - If `x` is negative, we add 360 to bring it into the positive range.
   
2. **Closest Multiple of 90 Degrees:**
   - Calculate the remainder when `x` is divided by 90 (`remainder = x % 90`).
   - If the remainder is less than or equal to 45, no additional turns are needed (`turns = 0`).
   - Otherwise, one additional 90-degree turn is needed (`turns = 1`).
   
3. **Additional Full Rotations:**
   - If `x` is greater than or equal to 270 degrees, subtract 270 and divide by 90 to find the number of additional full 90-degree turns needed.

This corrected solution ensures that the program always meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
