The code `print(turns)` does not change the value of `turns`. It only prints the current value of `turns`. The value of `turns` remains the same as it was in the initial state.

Output State: **`x` is `x % 360`, `normalized_angle` is `x % 360`, `turns` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3 depending on the value of `x % 360`.**
