Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly calculates the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed to minimize the deviation from vertical. The normalization step ensures the angle is within the range of 0 to 359 degrees, and the subsequent calculation accurately determines the required number of turns. The annotations clearly describe each step, confirming the program's logic matches the problem requirements.
