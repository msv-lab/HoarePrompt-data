Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed to minimize the deviation from vertical. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Normalization**: The program first normalizes the angle using `normalized_angle = x % 360`, which ensures that the angle is within the range of 0 to 360 degrees.
2. **Turn Calculation**: It then calculates the number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed by determining how far the angle is from being a multiple of 90 degrees and taking the modulo 4 operation to handle cases where the angle might fall into different ranges.
3. **Edge Cases**: The program handles both positive and negative angles correctly. For example:
   - If the input angle is 60 degrees (clockwise), the normalized angle is 60, and the required turns are `(360 - 60) // 90 % 4 = 3`.
   - If the input angle is -60 degrees (counter-clockwise), the normalized angle is 300, and the required turns are `(360 - 300) // 90 % 4 = 1`.

The program correctly accounts for all possible angles within the specified range and provides the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed. Therefore, the program is correct.
