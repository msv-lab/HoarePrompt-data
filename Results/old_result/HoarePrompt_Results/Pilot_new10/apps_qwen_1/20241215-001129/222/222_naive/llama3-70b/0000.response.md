Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of actions needed to turn over all skewers. Specifically, the logic used to determine the number of actions `l` and the indices of skewers to turn over is flawed.

For example, consider the input `n = 6` and `k = 1`. According to the problem description, the correct solution should involve turning over skewers 2 and 5, which requires only 2 actions. However, the current program calculates `l` as `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)` and suggests turning over skewers starting from 1, which results in more actions than necessary.

Let's analyze the calculation for `l`:
- For `n = 6` and `k = 1`, `(6 + 1 - 1) // (1 * 2 + 1) = 6 // 3 = 2`.
- The program suggests turning over skewers 1 and 6, which indeed works but is not necessarily the minimal solution. A better solution would be to turn over skewers 2 and 5.

Therefore, the program does not always provide the minimum number of actions required to turn over all skewers, making it incorrect.
