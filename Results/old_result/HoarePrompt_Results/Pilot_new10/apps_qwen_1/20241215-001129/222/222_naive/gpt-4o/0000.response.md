Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of actions needed to turn over all \( n \) skewers. Let's consider the following example:

- Input: \( n = 5 \), \( k = 1 \)

According to the problem description, the optimal solution for this case would be to turn over skewers number \( 1 \) and \( 4 \). This is because:
- Turning skewer \( 1 \) affects skewers \( 1 \) and \( 2 \).
- Turning skewer \( 4 \) affects skewers \( 3 \), \( 4 \), and \( 5 \).

However, the provided program generates the output:
```
2
1 6
```

Here, the program suggests turning skewers \( 1 \) and \( 6 \), which is invalid since there is no skewer \( 6 \). Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for at least one potential case, making it incorrect.
