Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, the logic for determining which skewers to turn over is flawed. The code generates a list of skewers by starting from 1 and increasing each subsequent integer by `2 * k + 1`, which does not align with the requirement to turn over `k` closest skewers from each side of the selected skewer.

To illustrate this, consider the following example:

- For \( n = 7 \) and \( k = 2 \):
  - The code will generate the positions: `[1, 5]`.
  - This means it will only turn over skewers 1 and 5.
  - However, according to the problem description, turning skewer 1 should turn over skewers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Similarly, turning skewer 5 should turn over skewers 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
  - Therefore, the correct solution would be to turn over skewers 1, 3, 5, and 7, which can be done in 2 steps (turning 1 and 7, or 3 and 5).

Thus, the code does not meet the requirements for every potential case, leading to an incorrect solution.
