The code initializes an empty list `res`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, or `l`. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the list `res`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 1000, `l` is calculated as (n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1), `res` is an empty list**
