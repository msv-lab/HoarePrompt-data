You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Long story short, shashlik is Miroslav's favorite food. Shashlik is prepared on several skewers simultaneously. There are two states for each skewer: initial and turned over.

This time Miroslav laid out $n$ skewers parallel to each other, and enumerated them with consecutive integers from $1$ to $n$ in order from left to right. For better cooking, he puts them quite close to each other, so when he turns skewer number $i$, it leads to turning $k$ closest skewers from each side of the skewer $i$, that is, skewers number $i - k$, $i - k + 1$, ..., $i - 1$, $i + 1$, ..., $i + k - 1$, $i + k$ (if they exist). 

For example, let $n = 6$ and $k = 1$. When Miroslav turns skewer number $3$, then skewers with numbers $2$, $3$, and $4$ will come up turned over. If after that he turns skewer number $1$, then skewers number $1$, $3$, and $4$ will be turned over, while skewer number $2$ will be in the initial position (because it is turned again).

As we said before, the art of cooking requires perfect timing, so Miroslav wants to turn over all $n$ skewers with the minimal possible number of actions. For example, for the above example $n = 6$ and $k = 1$, two turnings are sufficient: he can turn over skewers number $2$ and $5$.

Help Miroslav turn over all $n$ skewers.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \leq n \leq 1000$, $0 \leq k \leq 1000$) — the number of skewers and the number of skewers from each side that are turned in one step.


-----Output-----

The first line should contain integer $l$ — the minimum number of actions needed by Miroslav to turn over all $n$ skewers. After than print $l$ integers from $1$ to $n$ denoting the number of the skewer that is to be turned over at the corresponding step.


-----Examples-----
Input
7 2

Output
2
1 6 

Input
5 1

Output
2
1 4 



-----Note-----

In the first example the first operation turns over skewers $1$, $2$ and $3$, the second operation turns over skewers $4$, $5$, $6$ and $7$.

In the second example it is also correct to turn over skewers $2$ and $5$, but turning skewers $2$ and $4$, or $1$ and $5$ are incorrect solutions because the skewer $3$ is in the initial state after these operations.
Program:
```
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
func_1(n, k)

def func_1(n, k):
    positions = []
    i = 1
    while i <= n:
        positions.append(i)
        i += 2 * k + 1
    print(len(positions))
    print(' '.join(map(str, positions)))


```
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, and `k` is an integer between 0 and 1000 inclusive. It generates a list of integers starting from 1 and increases each subsequent integer by `2 * k + 1`. After generating the list, it prints the length of the list followed by the list elements separated by spaces.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
