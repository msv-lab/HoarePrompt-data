The code snippet appends a new value to the list `res`. The new value is calculated as `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1`. From the initial state, we know that `res` contains at least one element, which is `(i + 1) * (k * 2 + 1) + 1`. Let's denote this initial element as `initial_element`.

The new element to be added to `res` is calculated as follows:
- `i` is the same as in the initial element.
- `k` is the same as in the initial element.

So the new element is `(i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1)`.

Therefore, the updated list `res` will contain the initial element plus the new element.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `k` is at least 1, `l` is greater than 0, `res` is a list containing `(i + 1) * (k * 2 + 1) + 1` and `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1`**
