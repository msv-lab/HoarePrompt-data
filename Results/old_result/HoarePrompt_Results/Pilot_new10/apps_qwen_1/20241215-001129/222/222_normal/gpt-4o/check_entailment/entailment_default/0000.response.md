Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the problem description. According to the problem, turning skewer \(i\) affects \(k\) skewers on each side of \(i\), including \(i\) itself. However, the code increments the position by \(2 * k + 1\) in each step, which means it skips many skewers and does not cover all necessary turns.

For example, consider \(n = 7\) and \(k = 2\):
- Turning skewer 1 would affect skewers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
- Turning skewer 6 would affect skewers 4, 5, 6, 7.

However, the code suggests turning skewers 1 and 6, which only covers skewers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 partially and incorrectly. It misses the middle skewers without affecting them.

The correct approach would involve identifying the skewers that need to be turned in such a way that all skewers are affected eventually. The current implementation does not achieve this.
