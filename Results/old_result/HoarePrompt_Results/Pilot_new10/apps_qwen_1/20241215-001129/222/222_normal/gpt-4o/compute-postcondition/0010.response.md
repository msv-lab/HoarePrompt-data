`i` is incremented by the value `2 * k + 1`. The initial value of `i` is such that `n > 2 + 4 * k + 2`. The list `positions` remains unchanged, and the value of `n` remains greater than `2 + 4 * k + 2`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2 + 4 * k + 2; `positions` is a list containing `i`; `i` is an integer, and `i` is increased by 2 * k + 1**
