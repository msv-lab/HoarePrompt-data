Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the problem description. Specifically, the calculation of `l` using the formula `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)` does not accurately determine the minimum number of actions needed to turn over all `n` skewers. Additionally, the list `res` constructed by incrementing by `k * 2 + 1` does not ensure that all skewers are turned over correctly. 

For example, consider the case where `n = 7` and `k = 2`. The code calculates `l` as `2` and generates the result as `[1, 5]`. However, the correct sequence of actions would be to turn skewers `[1, 6]`, as mentioned in the problem's example. This shows that the current implementation does not cover all necessary actions to turn over all skewers, thus it is incorrect.
