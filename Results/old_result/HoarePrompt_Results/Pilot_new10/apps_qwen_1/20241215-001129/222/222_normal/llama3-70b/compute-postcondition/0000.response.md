`n, k` are assigned the values from `input().split()`, which means they are converted from strings to integers using `int`. The original values of `n` and `k` are replaced by the inputs. The Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 1000, and both `n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 1000, and both `n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input.**
