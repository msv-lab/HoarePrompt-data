Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\)
   - `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq 1000\)
   - `positions` is `[1]`
   - `i` is \(2 + 2 \times k + 1\)

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition is `i <= n`

3. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - Given `i = 2 + 2 * k + 1`, we need to check if this value satisfies the loop condition `i <= n`.

4. **Determining if the Loop Can Execute Again:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to `n`.
   - The current value of `i` is \(2 + 2 \times k + 1\).
   - To satisfy `i <= n`, we need to ensure that \(2 + 2 \times k + 1 \leq n\).

5. **Adjusting the State:**
   - We need to adjust the state so that the loop condition `i <= n` holds true for the next iteration.
   - Since `i` is already computed as \(2 + 2 \times k + 1\), we need to ensure that `n` is at least \(2 + 2 \times k + 1\) for the loop to continue.

6. **Final State:**
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to \(2 + 2 \times k + 1\).
   - Other states (`k`, `positions`, `i`) remain unchanged because they are not dependent on the loop condition directly.

**Final Answer:**

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2 + 2 * k + 1, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 1000, `positions` is [1], `i` is 2 + 2 * k + 1**
