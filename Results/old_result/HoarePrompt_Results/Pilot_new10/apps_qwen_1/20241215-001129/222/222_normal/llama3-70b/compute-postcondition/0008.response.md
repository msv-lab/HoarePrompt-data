The code appends a new value to the list `res`. The new value added is `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1`. From the initial state, `i_new` is used in the calculation of the initial elements of `res`, but the current code uses `i`, which is not defined in the initial state. However, since `i` is not explicitly defined, we can infer that `i` could be any integer, but for the sake of the initial conditions, let's assume `i` is the same as `i_new` for consistency. 

Given:
- `res` initially contains `(i_new + 1) * (k * 2 + 1) + 1` and `i_new * (k * 2 + 1) + 1`.
- We append `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1` to `res`.

Therefore, the updated list `res` will be:
- First element: `(i_new + 1) * (k * 2 + 1) + 1`
- Second element: `i_new * (k * 2 + 1) + 1`
- Third element: `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1`

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `k` is at least 1, `l` must be greater than 0, `res` is a list containing `(i_new + 1) * (k * 2 + 1) + 1`, `i_new * (k * 2 + 1) + 1`, and `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1`**
