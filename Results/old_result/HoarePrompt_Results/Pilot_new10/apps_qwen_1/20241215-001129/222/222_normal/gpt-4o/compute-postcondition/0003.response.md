The code appends the current value of `i` (which is 1) to the list `positions`. The initial values of `n` and `k` are not affected by this operation. The list `positions` is initially empty, and after appending `i`, it contains the value `1`. Therefore, the updated state is as follows:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 1000, `positions` is `[1]`, `i` is 2**
