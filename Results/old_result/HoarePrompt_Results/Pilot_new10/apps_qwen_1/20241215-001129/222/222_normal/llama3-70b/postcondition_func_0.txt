The function reads two integers `n` and `k` from input, calculates `l` using the formula `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)`, and constructs a list `res` containing integers starting from 1 and increasing by `k * 2 + 1` for `l` times. It then prints the value of `l` followed by the elements of `res` separated by spaces.
