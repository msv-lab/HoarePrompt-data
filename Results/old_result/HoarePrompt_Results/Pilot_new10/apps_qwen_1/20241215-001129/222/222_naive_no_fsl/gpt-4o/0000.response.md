Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the problem description. Specifically, it does not account for the overlapping effect of turning skewers within the range of \( k \). Let's consider the example where \( n = 7 \) and \( k = 2 \):

- According to the problem, turning skewer 1 should affect skewers 1, 2, and 3.
- Similarly, turning skewer 6 should affect skewers 4, 5, 6, and 7.

However, the current implementation simply appends every \( 2k + 1 \)th skewer to the list without considering the overlap. This means that skewers 2 and 3 would be turned twice, and skewers 4, 5, and 6 would be missed entirely.

To correctly solve this problem, the program needs to simulate the turning process and ensure that each skewer is turned exactly once. A more appropriate approach would involve marking which skewers have been turned and ensuring that the correct sequence of operations is applied to cover all skewers minimally.
