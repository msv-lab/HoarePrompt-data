Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario when `k` is 0. According to the problem description, if `k` is 0, only the skewer being turned should change its state, but the program incorrectly turns `k*2+1` skewers around the selected skewer. This leads to an incorrect number of actions required and a wrong sequence of skewers to be turned over.

For example, consider the input `n = 3` and `k = 0`. The correct output should be:
```
1
1
```
But the program outputs:
```
1
1
2
3
```
This is incorrect because turning skewer 1 should only change its state, and no other skewers should be affected. Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirements for this specific case.
