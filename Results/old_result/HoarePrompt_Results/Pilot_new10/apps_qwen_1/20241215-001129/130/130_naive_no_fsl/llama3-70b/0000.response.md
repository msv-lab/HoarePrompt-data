Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program fails to consider the scenario where the total number of unique coins (`N`) is insufficient to satisfy the condition that at least `L` coins must be new in Ivan's collection after receiving gifts from his friends.

For example, consider the following input:
```
10 11 2 4
```

According to the problem description:
- There are 10 different coins (`N = 10`).
- Ivan has 2 coins in his collection (`K = 2`).
- At least 4 coins from the gifts must be new (`L = 4`).
- There are 11 friends (`M = 11`).

In this case, even if each friend gifts 1 coin, Ivan will receive 11 different coins. However, since Ivan already has 2 coins, only 9 of these 11 coins can be new. This means it is impossible to satisfy the condition that at least 4 coins must be new in Ivan's collection after receiving the gifts.

The program, however, incorrectly prints `-1` for this case because it only checks if `M` is greater than or equal to `N - K + 1` and `M` is greater than or equal to `L`. It does not properly account for the fact that the total number of unique coins available must be sufficient to ensure at least `L` new coins.

To fix this, the program needs to check if the total number of unique coins (`N`) is greater than or equal to the sum of the coins Ivan already has (`K`) plus the number of new coins required (`L`). If this condition is not met, the program should return `-1`.

Here is a corrected version of the function:
```python
def func():
    (N, M, K, L) = map(int, input().split())
    if N < K + L:
        print(-1)
    elif M >= N - K + 1 and M >= L:
        print(1)
    else:
        print(-1)
```

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
