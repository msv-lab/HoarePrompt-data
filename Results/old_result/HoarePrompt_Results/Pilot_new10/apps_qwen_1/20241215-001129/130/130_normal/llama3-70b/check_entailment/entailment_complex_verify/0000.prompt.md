You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Ivan is collecting coins. There are only $N$ different collectible coins, Ivan has $K$ of them. He will be celebrating his birthday soon, so all his $M$ freinds decided to gift him coins. They all agreed to three terms:  Everyone must gift as many coins as others. All coins given to Ivan must be different. Not less than $L$ coins from gifts altogether, must be new in Ivan's collection.

But his friends don't know which coins have Ivan already got in his collection. They don't want to spend money so they want to buy minimum quantity of coins, that satisfy all terms, irrespective of the Ivan's collection. Help them to find this minimum number of coins or define it's not possible to meet all the terms.


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains 4 integers $N$, $M$, $K$, $L$ ($1 \le K \le N \le 10^{18}$; $1 \le M, \,\, L \le 10^{18}$) — quantity of different coins, number of Ivan's friends, size of Ivan's collection and quantity of coins, that must be new in Ivan's collection.


-----Output-----

Print one number — minimal number of coins one friend can gift to satisfy all the conditions. If it is impossible to satisfy all three conditions print "-1" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
20 15 2 3

Output
1
Input
10 11 2 4

Output
-1


-----Note-----

In the first test, one coin from each friend is enough, as he will be presented with 15 different coins and 13 of them will definitely be new.

In the second test, Ivan has 11 friends, but there are only 10 different coins. So all friends can't present him different coins.
Program:
```
def func():
    (N, M, K, L) = map(int, input().split())
    if M >= N - K + 1 and M >= L:
        print(1)
    else:
        print(-1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of coins one friend can gift to satisfy all the conditions. Here’s the reasoning:

1. The program first checks if the total number of friends `M` is sufficient to provide `N - K + 1` different coins (since Ivan already has `K` coins out of `N` total types).
2. Additionally, it checks if `M` is sufficient to provide at least `L` new coins.
3. If both conditions are met, it prints `1` because one coin from each friend will ensure the conditions are satisfied.
4. If either condition fails, it prints `-1`.

This logic ensures that the program handles all described scenarios correctly. There are no apparent edge cases or logical flaws in the implementation that would make the program incorrect based on the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N, M, K, L are integers such that 1 <= K <= N <= 10^18, 1 <= M, L <= 10^18, and M * L >= K.
def func():
    N, M, K, L = map(int, input().split())
    if (M >= N - K + 1 and M >= L) :
        print(1)
    else :
        print(-1)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` are integers such that 1 <= `K` <= `N` <= 10^18, 1 <= `M`, `L` <= 10^18, and `M` * `L` >= `K`. If `M` is greater than or equal to `N - K + 1` and `M` is greater than or equal to `L`, the program prints '1'. Otherwise, the program prints '-1'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads four integers `N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` from the input and prints `1` if `M` is greater than or equal to both `N - K + 1` and `L`. Otherwise, it prints `-1`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
