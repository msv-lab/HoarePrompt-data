You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Ivan is collecting coins. There are only $N$ different collectible coins, Ivan has $K$ of them. He will be celebrating his birthday soon, so all his $M$ freinds decided to gift him coins. They all agreed to three terms:  Everyone must gift as many coins as others. All coins given to Ivan must be different. Not less than $L$ coins from gifts altogether, must be new in Ivan's collection.

But his friends don't know which coins have Ivan already got in his collection. They don't want to spend money so they want to buy minimum quantity of coins, that satisfy all terms, irrespective of the Ivan's collection. Help them to find this minimum number of coins or define it's not possible to meet all the terms.


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains 4 integers $N$, $M$, $K$, $L$ ($1 \le K \le N \le 10^{18}$; $1 \le M, \,\, L \le 10^{18}$) — quantity of different coins, number of Ivan's friends, size of Ivan's collection and quantity of coins, that must be new in Ivan's collection.


-----Output-----

Print one number — minimal number of coins one friend can gift to satisfy all the conditions. If it is impossible to satisfy all three conditions print "-1" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
20 15 2 3

Output
1
Input
10 11 2 4

Output
-1


-----Note-----

In the first test, one coin from each friend is enough, as he will be presented with 15 different coins and 13 of them will definitely be new.

In the second test, Ivan has 11 friends, but there are only 10 different coins. So all friends can't present him different coins.
Program:
```
import sys

def func():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    (N, M, K, L) = map(int, input().split())
    min_x = (L + M - 1) // M
    if M * min_x <= N - K:
        print(min_x)
    else:
        print(-1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `N` (the total number of different coins) is smaller than `K + L`. In such a case, it is impossible to satisfy the condition that at least `L` coins must be new in Ivan's collection because Ivan already has `K` coins out of the `N` available coins. However, the current implementation does not check this condition, leading to incorrect outputs for certain inputs.

For example, consider the following input:

Input
```
10 11 2 4
```

In this case, `N` is 10, `K` is 2, and `L` is 4. It is impossible to give 4 new coins because there are only 8 coins left after accounting for the 2 coins Ivan already has. Therefore, the correct output should be `-1`, but the program incorrectly outputs `1`.

To fix this, you need to add a condition to check if `N` is less than `K + L` before calculating the minimum number of coins.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import sys

#State of the program right berfore the function call: $N$, $M$, $K$, and $L$ are integers such that $1 \le K \le N \le 10^{18}$, $1 \le M, L \le 10^{18}$, and $M \times (\text{minimum number of coins one friend can gift}) \ge L$.
def func():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    N, M, K, L = map(int, input().split())
    min_x = (L + M - 1) // M
    if (M * min_x <= N - K) :
        print(min_x)
    else :
        print(-1)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` are integers assigned values from input, such that \(1 \le K \le N \le 10^{18}\), \(1 \le M, L \le 10^{18}\), and \(M \times (\text{minimum number of coins one friend can gift}) \ge L\); `min_x` is \((L + M - 1) // M\). If \(M \times min_x \le N - K\), then `min_x` is printed. Otherwise, \(-1\) is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads four integers \(N\), \(M\), \(K\), and \(L\) from standard input, where \(1 \le K \le N \le 10^{18}\), \(1 \le M, L \le 10^{18}\), and \(M \times (\text{minimum number of coins one friend can gift}) \ge L\). It calculates the minimum number of coins one friend can gift, denoted as `min_x`, using the formula \((L + M - 1) // M\). If \(M \times min_x \le N - K\), it prints `min_x`; otherwise, it prints \(-1\). If \(K\) exceeds \(N\), the function will still execute the calculation and print \(-1\).

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
