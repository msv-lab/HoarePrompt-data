Postcondition: **`N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` are integers assigned values from input, such that \(1 \le K \le N \le 10^{18}\), \(1 \le M, L \le 10^{18}\), and \(M \times (\text{minimum number of coins one friend can gift}) \ge L\); `min_x` is \((L + M - 1) // M\). Additionally, \(M \times min_x > N - K\)**
