The code `print(1)` simply prints the integer `1` to the console. This does not affect the values of the variables `N`, `M`, `K`, and `L`. Therefore, the only change is the printed output.

Output State: **`N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` are integers such that 1 <= `K` <= `N` <= 10^18, 1 <= `M`, `L` <= 10^18, and `M` * `L` >= `K`. `M` is greater than or equal to `N - K + 1` and `M` is greater than or equal to `L`; print statement executed and printed '1'**
