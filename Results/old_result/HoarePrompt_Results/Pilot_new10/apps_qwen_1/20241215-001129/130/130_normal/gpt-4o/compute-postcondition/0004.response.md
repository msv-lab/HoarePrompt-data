The code `print(min_x)` prints the value of `min_x`, which is already defined in the initial state as `(L + M - 1) // M`. This does not change the value of `min_x`, nor does it affect any other variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` are integers assigned values from input, such that $1 \le K \le N \le 10^{18}$, $1 \le M, L \le 10^{18}$, and $M \times (\text{minimum number of coins one friend can gift}) \ge L$; `min_x` is $(L + M - 1) // M$, and `min_x` is printed.**
