Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the case where \(K > N\). According to the problem description, \(1 \le K \le N\), but the code does not check this condition before performing the calculation. If \(K > N\), the calculation will still proceed, leading to an incorrect result. For example, consider the input:

```
2 1 3 1
```

Here, \(K = 3\) and \(N = 2\), which violates the condition \(K \le N\). The code will still attempt to calculate the minimum number of coins, leading to an incorrect output. To fix this, the code should include a check at the beginning to ensure \(K \le N\). If \(K > N\), the code should immediately print \(-1\) without further calculations.
