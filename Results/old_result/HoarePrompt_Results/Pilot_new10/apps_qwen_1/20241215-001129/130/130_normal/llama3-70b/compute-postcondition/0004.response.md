The code snippet prints `-1`. Since the print function does not assign the output to any variable, the only change is that the value `-1` is printed. The values of the other variables (`N`, `M`, `K`, and `L`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` are integers such that 1 <= `K` <= `N` <= 10^18, 1 <= `M`, `L` <= 10^18, and `M` * `L` >= `K`. Additionally, `M` is less than `N - K + 1` or `M` is less than `L`; the value `-1` is printed.**
