Postcondition: ***`n` must be at least 1, `position` is either less than 0 or greater than 20000, `valid` is `False`, `t` is an integer, `dir` is the other part of the input string. Whether `position` is less than 0 or greater than 20000, `valid` remains `False`, and the values of `n`, `position`, `t`, and `dir` do not change.***
