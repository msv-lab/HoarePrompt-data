Postcondition: ***`n` must be at least 1, `position` is either less than 0 or greater than 20000, `valid` is `False`, `t` is an integer, `dir` is the second part of the input string after splitting. If `dir` is 'South', `position` is updated to `position + t`. Otherwise, the values remain unchanged.***
