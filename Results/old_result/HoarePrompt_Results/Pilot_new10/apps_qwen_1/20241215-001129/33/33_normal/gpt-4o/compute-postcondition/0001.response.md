The code initializes the variable `position` to 0. It does not affect the values of `n`, `t_i`, or `dir_i`. Therefore, the only change is to the `position` variable.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, for each i from 1 to n, `t_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t_i ≤ 10^6, and `dir_i` is one of "North", "South", "West", "East"; `position` is 0.**
