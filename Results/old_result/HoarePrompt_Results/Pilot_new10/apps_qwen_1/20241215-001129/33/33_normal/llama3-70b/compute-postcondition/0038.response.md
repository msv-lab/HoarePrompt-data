The `exit()` function is called, which causes the program to terminate immediately without executing any further code. Since the program exits, no further operations are performed on any variables, and the initial conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`curr_lat` is within the range \([-90, 90]\), `n` is greater than 0, `t` is an integer, `dir` is a string, and the console prints 'NO'**
