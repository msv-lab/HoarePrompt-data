The code `print('NO')` will print 'NO' to the console. This operation does not change the values of the variables `curr_lat`, `n`, `t`, or `dir`. However, since the condition `if curr_lat == -90 and dir != 'North': print('NO')` is explicitly checked in the initial state, this line of code will trigger the print statement.

Given the initial state and the code execution, the output 'NO' will be printed to the console, but the values of `curr_lat`, `n`, `t`, and `dir` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`curr_lat` is within the range \([-90, 90]\), `n` is greater than 0, `t` is an integer, `dir` is a string, and 'NO' is printed to the console.**
