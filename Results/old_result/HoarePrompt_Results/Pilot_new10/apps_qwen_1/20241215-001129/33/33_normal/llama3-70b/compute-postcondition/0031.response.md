The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, since there is no loop context provided, the `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. The values of `curr_lat`, `n`, `t`, and `dir` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`curr_lat` is within the range \([-90, 90]\), `n` is greater than 0, `t` is an integer, `dir` is a string from the input**
