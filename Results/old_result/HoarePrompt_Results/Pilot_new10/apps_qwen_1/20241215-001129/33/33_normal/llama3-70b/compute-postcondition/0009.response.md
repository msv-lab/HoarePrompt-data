`curr_lat` is decremented by `t / 111.195`. The value of `t` depends on `t_i` which is an integer between 1 and \(10^6\). Since `t` is the integer value of the second part of the split string, it is derived from `t_i`. The value of `curr_lat` is decreased by this fractional value. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer with \(1 \leq n \leq 50\); for each \(i\) from 1 to \(n\), `t_i` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t_i \leq 10^6\); `dir_i` is one of the strings "North", "South", "West", "East"; `dir` is the string "South"; `t` is the integer value of the second part of the split string; `curr_lat` is decreased by `t / 111.195`.**
