Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why the program meets all the requirements:

1. **Initial Latitude Check**: The program initializes `curr_lat` to 90, representing the North Pole.
2. **Movement Handling**:
   - For each movement, the program updates `curr_lat` based on the direction (`dir`). 
   - If the direction is "North", it adds the distance divided by the approximate circumference factor (111.195 km per degree).
   - If the direction is "South", it subtracts the distance divided by the same factor.
   - Movements in "West" and "East" directions are ignored since they do not change the latitude.
3. **Boundary Checks**:
   - If `curr_lat` exceeds -90 or 90 degrees, the program immediately prints "NO" and exits.
   - If `curr_lat` is -90 and the direction is not "North", the program prints "NO".
   - If `curr_lat` is 90 and the direction is not "South", the program prints "NO".
4. **Final Check**:
   - After processing all movements, the program checks if `curr_lat` is exactly 90 (North Pole). If so, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

The program ensures that Limak cannot move to the South from the North Pole or to the North from the South Pole at any step, and it ends on the North Pole. Therefore, the program correctly implements the required conditions and handles all possible inputs according to the problem description.
