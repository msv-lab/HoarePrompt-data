Postcondition: ***`curr_lat` is within the range \([-90, 90]\), `n` is greater than 0, `t` is an integer, `dir` is a string from the input. If `dir` is 'North', `curr_lat` is updated to its original value plus `t / 111.195`. If `dir` is 'South', `curr_lat` is reduced by `t / 111.195`. Otherwise, the value of `curr_lat` remains unchanged.***
