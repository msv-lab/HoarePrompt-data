The code `exit()` is used to terminate the program immediately. Since the program is terminated, none of the variables will be updated or remain in the program's scope. The only information that remains from the initial state is the precondition.

Output State: **`curr_lat` is within the range \([-90, 90]\), `n` is greater than 0, `t` is an integer, `dir` is a string, and the console prints 'NO'**
