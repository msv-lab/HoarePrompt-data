The function processes a series of movements defined by distances `t_i` and directions (`North`, `South`, `West`, `East`) for `n` steps, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 50` and `1 ≤ t_i ≤ 10^6`. It checks if the final position of the movement sequence is exactly at position 0. If the final position is not 0, the function sets `valid` to `False`. The function then prints 'YES' if `valid` is `True` (indicating the final position is 0), and 'NO' otherwise. Edge cases include invalid movements (e.g., moving North when the position is already 0, moving South when the position is already 20000).
