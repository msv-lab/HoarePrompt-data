The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the current loop block and move to the next iteration of the loop. However, since no loop is specified in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or change the state of the program.

The output state remains the same as the initial state because the `continue` statement does not modify any variables or perform any actions that would change the state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer with \(1 \leq n \leq 50\); for each \(i\) from 1 to \(n\), `t_i` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t_i \leq 10^6\); `dir_i` is one of the strings "North", "South", "West", "East"; `t` is the integer value of the second part of the split string; `dir` is the second value of the split string; `dir` is not equal to 'North' and `dir` is either 'West' or 'East'**
