`curr_lat` is updated by adding `t / 111.195` to its current value. The value of `t` is divided by 111.195 and added to `curr_lat`. The other variables (`n`, `t`, and `dir`) remain unchanged. The new value of `curr_lat` will be the original value of `curr_lat` plus `t / 111.195`.

Since the range of `curr_lat` is \([-90, 90]\), the new value of `curr_lat` must still be within this range.

Output State: **`curr_lat` is within the range \([-90, 90]\); `n` is greater than 0; `t` is an integer; `dir` is a string from the input; `curr_lat` is updated to its original value plus `t / 111.195`**
