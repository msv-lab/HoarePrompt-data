`t` is assigned the value of `int(t)`, which converts the string `t` into an integer. The other variables (`n`, `position`, `valid`, `dir`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be at least 1, `position` is 0, `valid` is `True`, `t` is an integer, `dir` is the second part of the input split by space.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `position` is 0, `valid` is `True`, `t` is an integer, `dir` is the second part of the input split by space**
