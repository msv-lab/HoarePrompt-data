You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: In this problem we assume the Earth to be a completely round ball and its surface a perfect sphere. The length of the equator and any meridian is considered to be exactly 40 000 kilometers. Thus, travelling from North Pole to South Pole or vice versa takes exactly 20 000 kilometers.

Limak, a polar bear, lives on the North Pole. Close to the New Year, he helps somebody with delivering packages all around the world. Instead of coordinates of places to visit, Limak got a description how he should move, assuming that he starts from the North Pole. The description consists of n parts. In the i-th part of his journey, Limak should move t_{i} kilometers in the direction represented by a string dir_{i} that is one of: "North", "South", "West", "East".

Limak isn’t sure whether the description is valid. You must help him to check the following conditions:  If at any moment of time (before any of the instructions or while performing one of them) Limak is on the North Pole, he can move only to the South.  If at any moment of time (before any of the instructions or while performing one of them) Limak is on the South Pole, he can move only to the North.  The journey must end on the North Pole. 

Check if the above conditions are satisfied and print "YES" or "NO" on a single line.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50).

The i-th of next n lines contains an integer t_{i} and a string dir_{i} (1 ≤ t_{i} ≤ 10^6, $\operatorname{dir}_{i} \in \{\text{North, South, West, East} \}$) — the length and the direction of the i-th part of the journey, according to the description Limak got.


-----Output-----

Print "YES" if the description satisfies the three conditions, otherwise print "NO", both without the quotes.

4000 North

Output
YES

Input

NO

Input

20000 South
1000 North
1000000 West
9000 North
10000 North

Output
YES

Input
3
20000 South
10 East
20000 North

Output
NO

Input
2
1000 North
1000 South

Output
NO

Input
4
50 South
50 North
15000 South
15000 North

Output
YES



-----Note-----

Drawings below show how Limak's journey would look like in first two samples. In the second sample the answer is "NO" because he doesn't end on the North Pole. [Image]
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50. For each i from 1 to n, t_{i} is an integer such that 1 ≤ t_{i} ≤ 10^6, and dir_{i} is one of "North", "South", "West", "East".
def func():
    n = int(input())
    position = 0
    valid = True
    for _ in range(n):
        t, dir = input().split()
        
        t = int(t)
        
        if dir == 'North':
            if position - t < 0:
                valid = False
            position -= t
        elif dir == 'South':
            if position + t > 20000:
                valid = False
            position += t
        elif dir in ('West', 'East'):
            if position == 0 or position == 20000:
                valid = False
        
        if position < 0 or position > 20000:
            valid = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `position` is an integer between 0 and 20000 inclusive, `valid` is `True`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6, and `dir` is one of "North", "South", "West", "East"
    if (position != 0) :
        valid = False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a non-negative integer, `position` is an integer between 0 and 20000 inclusive, `valid` is False, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6, and `dir` is one of "North", "South", "West", "East". This is because if `position` is not equal to 0, then `valid` is set to False, regardless of the value of `n`. If `position` is 0, there is no change to the variables as there is no else part in the code.
    if valid :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `position` is an integer between 0 and 20000 inclusive, `valid` is either True or False, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6, and `dir` is one of "North", "South", "West", "East". If `valid` is True, the console prints 'YES'. If `valid` is False, the console prints 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of movements defined by distances `t_i` and directions (`North`, `South`, `West`, `East`) for `n` steps, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 50` and `1 ≤ t_i ≤ 10^6`. It checks if the final position of the movement sequence is exactly at position 0. If the final position is not 0, the function sets `valid` to `False`. The function then prints 'YES' if `valid` is `True` (indicating the final position is 0), and 'NO' otherwise. Edge cases include invalid movements (e.g., moving North when the position is already 0, moving South when the position is already 20000).
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
