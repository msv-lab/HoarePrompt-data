The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. This means that no further code is executed, and the current state of the variables is preserved until the end.

Output State: **`n` is an integer with \(1 \leq n \leq 50\); for each \(i\) from 1 to \(n\), `t_i` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t_i \leq 10^6\); `dir` is the second value of the split string; `t` is the integer value of the second part of the split string; `curr_lat` is within the range \([-90, 90]\) and is currently equal to -90, and `dir` is not "North"; the program has terminated.**
