Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `a` and `b` are not divisible by `x`. Specifically, the `can_distribute` function checks if `a // x + b // x >= n`, but it does not account for the scenario where the distribution might not be exact, leading to a situation where the minimum number of pieces per plate is not maximized.

For example, consider the input `(n, a, b) = (4, 7, 9)`. The correct output should be `2` because we can distribute the cakes such that each plate gets at least 2 pieces (e.g., 3 plates with 3 pieces from the first cake and 1 plate with 2 pieces from the second cake). However, the current implementation might incorrectly output `3` because it uses integer division, which can lead to an incorrect result when the total number of pieces is not perfectly divisible among the plates.

Hereâ€™s a counterexample:
- Input: `4 7 9`
- Expected Output: `2`
- Actual Output: The program might output `3` due to integer division issues.

Therefore, the program is not correct for every potential case.
