Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\); `a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a \leq 100\) and \(1 \leq b \leq 100\); `low` is the smallest integer such that \(\text{can\_distribute(low)}\) is `True`, and `high` is the largest integer such that \(\text{can\_distribute(high)}\) is `False`; `mid` is \((\text{low} + \text{high}) // 2\).**

Explanation:
- The loop continues to narrow down the range between `low` and `high` until `low` is just greater than `high`.
- The condition `can_distribute(mid)` determines whether the current midpoint satisfies the distribution condition.
- If `can_distribute(mid)` is `True`, `low` is updated to `mid + 1`, moving the search space up.
- If `can_distribute(mid)` is `False`, `high` is updated to `mid`, moving the search space down.
- This process continues until `low` becomes greater than `high`, indicating that the smallest valid `mid` (where `can_distribute(mid)` is `True`) is found at `low`.

Thus, after all iterations, `low` will be the smallest integer satisfying `can_distribute(low) == True`, and `high` will be the largest integer satisfying `can_distribute(high) == False`.
