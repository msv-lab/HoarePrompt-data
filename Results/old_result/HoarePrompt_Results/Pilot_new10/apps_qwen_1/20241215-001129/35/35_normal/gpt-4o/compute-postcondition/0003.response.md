Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq a + b \); `a` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq a \leq 100 \); `b` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq b \leq 100 \); `low` is 1; `high` is \(\min(a, b) + 1\); `mid` is \((\min(a, b) + 2) // 2\); `can_distribute(mid)` is true**
