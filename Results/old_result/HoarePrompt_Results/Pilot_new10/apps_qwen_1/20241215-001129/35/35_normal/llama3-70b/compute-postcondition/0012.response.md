The code `break` does not affect the values of `a`, `b`, or `x`. It simply breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement. Since there is no loop or switch in the given code, the effect of the `break` statement is not explicitly shown here, but the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state where `a` is greater than or equal to `x-1`, `b` is greater than or equal to `x-1`, and `x` is decreased by 1, the only change is to the value of `x`.

Output State: **`a` is greater than or equal to `x-1`, `b` is greater than or equal to `x-1`, `x` is `x-1`**
