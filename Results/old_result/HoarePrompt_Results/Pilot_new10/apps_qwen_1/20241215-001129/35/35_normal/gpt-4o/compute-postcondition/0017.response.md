Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq a + b \); \( a \) and \( b \) are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq a \leq 100 \) and \( 1 \leq b \leq 100 \); `low` is either `1` or `mid + 1` and `high` is either `mid` or remains greater than `low`, where `mid = (low + high) // 2`. If `can_distribute(mid)` returns `True`, `low = mid + 1`; otherwise, `low = 1` and `high` is set to `mid`.**
