The code `print(x)` simply prints the value of `x`. Since `x` is initially 0, the output will be 0. However, since `x` itself does not change in this operation, its value remains the same.

Output State: **`x` is 0, `a` is greater than or equal to `x`, `b` is greater than or equal to `x`, `n` is within the range [2, a+b] inclusive, and the condition \(a \geq x\) and \(b \geq x\) and \((a - x + (b - x)) \geq x\) holds.**
