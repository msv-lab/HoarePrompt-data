`x` is decremented by 1, but the initial conditions state that `a` and `b` are both greater than or equal to `x`, and since the condition `(a - x) + (b - x) >= x` does not change the values of `a` and `b`, their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are both greater than or equal to `x-1`, and `x` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are both greater than or equal to `x-1`, and `x` is decreased by 1.**
