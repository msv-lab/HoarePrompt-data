Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The given `while` loop is `while True:`. This means the loop will always execute as long as we do not explicitly break out of it. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop condition itself; the loop will definitely execute one more time.

2. **Current State**: 
   - `a` is greater than or equal to `x-1`.
   - `b` is greater than or equal to `x-1`.
   - `x` has been decreased by 1 since the previous iteration.

3. **Determine What Needs Adjustment**: Since the loop will always execute one more time due to `while True`, there is no need to adjust any of the current states to ensure the loop can execute again.

Given this analysis, the program state does not need any modifications to proceed to the next iteration of the `while` loop.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` is greater than or equal to `x-1`, `b` is greater than or equal to `x-1`, `x` is decreased by 1**
