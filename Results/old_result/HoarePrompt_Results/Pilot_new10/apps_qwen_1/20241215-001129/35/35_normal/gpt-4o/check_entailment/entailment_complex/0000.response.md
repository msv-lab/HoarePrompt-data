Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
1. **Problem Description Understanding:**
   - We need to distribute `a` and `b` pieces of cake among `n` plates such that:
     - Each plate contains at least one piece of cake.
     - No plate contains pieces of both cakes.
     - The minimum number of pieces on any plate is maximized.

2. **Key Function Analysis:**
   - `func_1(n, a, b)`: This function uses binary search to find the maximum possible number `x` such that each plate contains at least `x` pieces of cake. The binary search range is from 1 to `min(a, b) + 1`.
   - `can_distribute(x)`: This function checks if it is possible to distribute the cakes such that each plate gets at least `x` pieces. It does this by verifying if the sum of the number of plates that can hold at least `x` pieces from each cake is greater than or equal to `n`.

3. **Annotations and Code Validation:**
   - The annotations accurately describe the state transitions and the logic within the functions.
   - The binary search approach ensures that the value returned (`low - 1`) is the maximum possible number `x` satisfying the conditions.
   - The `can_distribute(x)` function correctly implements the logic required by the problem description.

4. **Edge Cases Consideration:**
   - The code handles the edge cases where `a` and `b` are small (e.g., `1` piece per cake) and `n` is large enough to distribute the pieces evenly.
   - The binary search range is set to `min(a, b) + 1`, ensuring that the search space is comprehensive for the possible values of `x`.

5. **Verification through Examples:**
   - Example 1: Input `5 2 3` → Output `1`. The distribution can be 1+1, 1+1, 1+1, 1+0, 1+0.
   - Example 2: Input `4 7 10` → Output `3`. The distribution can be 3+3, 3+3, 3+3, 3+1.

Given that the code and its annotations accurately implement the logic required by the problem description and handle all potential cases as described, the code is correct.
