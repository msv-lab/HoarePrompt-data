The code `low = mid + 1` updates the value of `low` to `mid + 1`. Given that `mid` is defined as `(\min(a, b) + 2) // 2`, the new value of `low` becomes \(\min(a, b) + 3\). The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\); `a` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 100\); `b` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 100\); `low` is \(\min(a, b) + 3\); `high` is \(\min(a, b) + 1\); `mid` is \((\min(a, b) + 2) // 2\); `can_distribute(mid)` is true.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\); `a` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 100\); `b` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 100\); `low` is \(\min(a, b) + 3\); `high` is \(\min(a, b) + 1\); `mid` is \((\min(a, b) + 2) // 2\); `can_distribute(mid)` is true.**
