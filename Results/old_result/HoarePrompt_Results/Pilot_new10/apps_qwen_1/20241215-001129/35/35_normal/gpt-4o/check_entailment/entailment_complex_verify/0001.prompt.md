You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: It's New Year's Eve soon, so Ivan decided it's high time he started setting the table. Ivan has bought two cakes and cut them into pieces: the first cake has been cut into a pieces, and the second one — into b pieces.

Ivan knows that there will be n people at the celebration (including himself), so Ivan has set n plates for the cakes. Now he is thinking about how to distribute the cakes between the plates. Ivan wants to do it in such a way that all following conditions are met:  Each piece of each cake is put on some plate;  Each plate contains at least one piece of cake;  No plate contains pieces of both cakes. 

To make his guests happy, Ivan wants to distribute the cakes in such a way that the minimum number of pieces on the plate is maximized. Formally, Ivan wants to know the maximum possible number x such that he can distribute the cakes according to the aforementioned conditions, and each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.

Help Ivan to calculate this number x!


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers n, a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b) — the number of plates, the number of pieces of the first cake, and the number of pieces of the second cake, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible number x such that Ivan can distribute the cake in such a way that each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 2 3

Output
1

Input
4 7 10

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the first example there is only one way to distribute cakes to plates, all of them will have 1 cake on it.

In the second example you can have two plates with 3 and 4 pieces of the first cake and two plates both with 5 pieces of the second cake. Minimal number of pieces is 3.
Program:
```
(n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(n, a, b))

def func_1(n, a, b):
    (low, high) = (1, min(a, b) + 1)

    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if can_distribute(mid):
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
    return low - 1

def can_distribute(x):
    return a // x + b // x >= n


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `a` and `b` are not divisible by `x`. Specifically, the `can_distribute` function checks if `a // x + b // x >= n`, but it does not account for the scenario where the distribution might not be exact, leading to a situation where the minimum number of pieces per plate is not maximized.

For example, consider the input `(n, a, b) = (4, 7, 9)`. The correct output should be `2` because we can distribute the cakes such that each plate gets at least 2 pieces (e.g., 3 plates with 3 pieces from the first cake and 1 plate with 2 pieces from the second cake). However, the current implementation might incorrectly output `3` because it uses integer division, which can lead to an incorrect result when the total number of pieces is not perfectly divisible among the plates.

Here’s a counterexample:
- Input: `4 7 9`
- Expected Output: `2`
- Actual Output: The program might output `3` due to integer division issues.

Therefore, the program is not correct for every potential case.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
(n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(n, a, b))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, a, and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b.
def func_1(n, a, b):
    low, high = 1, min(a, b) + 1
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        if can_distribute(mid):
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\); `a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a \leq 100\) and \(1 \leq b \leq 100\); `low` is the smallest integer such that \(\text{can\_distribute(low)}\) is `True`, and `high` is the largest integer such that \(\text{can\_distribute(high)}\) is `False`; `mid` is \((\text{low} + \text{high}) // 2\).
    return low - 1
    #The program returns low - 1, where low is the smallest integer such that can_distribute(low) is True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters `n`, `a`, and `b`, and returns the smallest integer `low - 1` such that `can_distribute(low)` is `True`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers representing the number of pieces of the first and second cake, respectively, and n is a positive integer representing the number of plates such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b.
def can_distribute(x):
    return a // x + b // x >= n
    #`a // x + b // x` is compared to `n`, and the program returns `True` if the sum is greater than or equal to `n`, otherwise `False`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `can_distribute(x)` accepts a parameter `x` and returns `True` if distributing `a` and `b` pieces of cake among `n` plates results in each plate having at least `x` pieces of cake. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
