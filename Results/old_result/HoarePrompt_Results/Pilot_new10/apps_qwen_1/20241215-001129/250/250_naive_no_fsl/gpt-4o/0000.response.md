Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program fails to consider all possible ways to add marks to ensure both `x` and `y` can be measured. Let's analyze a case where the program does not work correctly:

Consider the following input:
```
2 300 185 230
0 300
```

According to the problem description, we need to add marks to measure both 185 and 230 centimeters. However, the current implementation only checks for direct addition or subtraction of `x` and `y` from existing marks, without considering combinations of `x` and `y`. 

In this specific case, the program will output:
```
2
185 230
```

This is correct because adding marks at 185 and 230 cm will allow us to measure both distances. However, the program fails to check if adding just one mark at 205 cm would also solve the problem. This is because 205 cm can be derived as `(300 - 95)` where 95 cm is derived from `230 - 185`, but the current logic does not consider this combination.

Therefore, the program is not handling all potential cases correctly, making it incorrect.
