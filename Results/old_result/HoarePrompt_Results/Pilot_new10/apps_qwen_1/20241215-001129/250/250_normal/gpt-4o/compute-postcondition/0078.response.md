The code snippet `print(new_marks.pop())` will remove and print an arbitrary element from the `new_marks` set. Since `new_marks` is a non-empty set containing elements derived from the `marks` list according to specified conditions, removing and printing an element from this set will update the `new_marks` set to exclude that particular element.

The states of other variables such as `marks_set`, `x_found`, `y_found`, and the fact that `new_marks` is a non-empty set remain unchanged.

Output State: **`marks_set` is a set of unique integers from the original `marks` list, `x_found` is `False`, `y_found` is `True` if any `mark + y` or `mark - y` is in `marks_set`, `new_marks` is a non-empty set containing the elements derived from the `marks` list except one element which was printed, and `x_found` and `y_found` remain unchanged unless the conditions for finding `x_found` or `y_found` are met.**
