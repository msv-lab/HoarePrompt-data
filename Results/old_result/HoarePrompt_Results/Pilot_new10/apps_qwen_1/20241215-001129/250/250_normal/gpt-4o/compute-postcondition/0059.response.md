The code snippet adds `mark + y` to `new_marks`. This operation does not affect the values of `marks_set`, `x_found`, or `y_found`. The value of `new_marks` is updated to include `mark + y` for the current `mark` being processed.

Output State: **`marks_set` is a set of unique integers from the original `marks` list; `x_found` remains `False`; `y_found` is `True` if any `mark + y` or `mark - y` is in `marks_set`; `new_marks` includes `mark + y` for the current `mark` in `marks`.**
