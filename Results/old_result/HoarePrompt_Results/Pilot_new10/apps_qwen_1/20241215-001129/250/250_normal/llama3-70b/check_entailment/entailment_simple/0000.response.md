Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Missing Initial Check for `x` and `y`:**
   - The program does not check whether the distances `x` and `y` can be measured using the existing marks. It directly appends `x` and `y` to `additional_marks` if they are not present, without verifying if they can be formed using the existing marks.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Adding Marks:**
   - The program iterates through the `marks` set and checks if the sum of any existing mark `i` and an additional mark `j` (from `additional_marks`) results in a value less than or equal to `l` and not already in `marks`. This approach is not optimal and may not cover all cases.
   - The program should ensure that both `x` and `y` can be measured before deciding to add additional marks. If `x` and `y` can be measured using combinations of existing marks, no additional marks should be added.

3. **Output Format:**
   - The program prints the number of additional marks and then the marks themselves. However, the problem statement specifies that the marks should be printed in a specific format:
     - First line: Minimum number of additional marks required.
     - Second line: Space-separated list of additional marks.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:

Consider the following input:
```
3 250 185 230
0 185 250
```

- Existing marks: `[0, 185, 250]`
- `x = 185`, `y = 230`

According to the problem description, the program should determine that it needs to add the mark `230` because `185` is already present. However, the provided program incorrectly adds both `x` and `y` to `additional_marks`:
```python
if (not need_x) :
    additional_marks.append(x)

if (not need_y) :
    additional_marks.append(y)
```

Since `need_x` and `need_y` are initially `False`, `230` and `185` are added to `additional_marks` unnecessarily. This results in an incorrect output:
```
2
185 230
```

The correct output should be:
```
1
230
```

Thus, the program does not correctly follow the problem description in all cases.
