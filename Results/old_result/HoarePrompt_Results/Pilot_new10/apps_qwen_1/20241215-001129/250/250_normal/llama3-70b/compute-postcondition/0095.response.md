`additional_marks` is updated by appending the value of `i + j`. The value of `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and is not already in the `marks` list. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is the third element of the `marks` list, `j` is the last element of `additional_marks`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `False`, `additional_marks` has at least 2 elements, and `i + j` is less than or equal to `l`; `additional_marks` now contains an additional element which is `i + j`.**
