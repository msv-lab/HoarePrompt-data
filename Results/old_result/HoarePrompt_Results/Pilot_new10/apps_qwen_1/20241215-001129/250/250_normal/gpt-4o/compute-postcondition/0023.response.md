The code snippet `x_found = True` assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `x_found`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `marks_set`, or `mark`. Therefore, the output state will include these variables with their previous values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `l` is an integer such that \(2 \leq l \leq 10^9\), `x` and `y` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < y \leq l\), `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from the original `marks` list, `mark` is the next element in the `marks` list, `x_found` is `True`.**
