Postcondition: ***`marks_set` is a set of unique integers from the original `marks` list, `x_found` remains `False`, `y_found` is `True` if any `mark + y` or `mark - y` is in `marks_set`. If `new_marks` is non-empty, `new_marks` is a set containing the elements derived from the `marks` list except one element which was printed, and `x_found` and `y_found` remain unchanged unless the conditions for finding `x_found` or `y_found` are met. If `new_marks` is empty, `new_marks` is an empty set, `result` is a list containing `x`, and the length of `result` is printed.***
