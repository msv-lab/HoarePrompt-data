Postcondition: ***`i` is the third element of the `marks` list, `j` is the second-to-last element of `additional_marks`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `False`, and if `i + j <= l` and `i + j` is not in `marks`, then `additional_marks` has one more element which is `i + j`. Otherwise, the `additional_marks` list remains unchanged and has at least 2 elements.***
