`need_y` is assigned the value `True`. The condition in the if statement is met, which means `marks[j] - marks[i] == y`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `need_x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `need_x` is set to True if `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `y`, otherwise `need_x` remains unchanged, `need_y` is True.**
