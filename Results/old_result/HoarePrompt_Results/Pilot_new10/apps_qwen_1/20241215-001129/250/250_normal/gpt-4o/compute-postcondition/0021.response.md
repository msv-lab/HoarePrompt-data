Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `l` is an integer such that \(2 \leq l \leq 10^9\), `x` and `y` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < y \leq l\), `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from the original `marks` list. If `mark + y` or `mark - y` is in `marks_set`, the condition remains true. Otherwise, the condition remains false. After executing the if-else block, if the condition inside the if block is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If there is no else part, no additional changes occur.***
