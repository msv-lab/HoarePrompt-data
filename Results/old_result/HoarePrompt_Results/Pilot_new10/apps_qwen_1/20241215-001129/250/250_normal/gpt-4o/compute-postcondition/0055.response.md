The code `new_marks.add(mark - x)` adds the value `mark - x` to the set `new_marks`. Given the precondition, the variable `x` is an integer, and `mark` is an integer from the `marks` list. The value of `mark - x` is added to `new_marks`. 

No other changes are made to the variables in this line of code. Therefore, the states of `marks`, `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `marks_set`, `x_found`, and `y_found` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`marks` must contain at least one element, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `l` is an integer such that \(2 \leq l \leq 10^9\), `x` and `y` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < y \leq l\), `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from the original `marks` list, `x_found` is `False`, `y_found` is `True` if any `mark + y` or `mark - y` is in `marks_set`, `new_marks` is a set containing `mark - x` (where `mark` is an element of `marks`), and the loop continues with the next `mark` from the `marks` list.**
