Output State: **`i` is the last element of the `marks` list, `j` is the last element of `additional_marks` after all iterations, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `False`, and `additional_marks` is a list that contains all unique elements `i + j` such that `i + j \leq l` and `i + j` is not already in `marks`. If the loop does not execute, the values of `i`, `j`, `n`, `need_x`, and `need_y` remain the same, and `additional_marks` remains unchanged.**
