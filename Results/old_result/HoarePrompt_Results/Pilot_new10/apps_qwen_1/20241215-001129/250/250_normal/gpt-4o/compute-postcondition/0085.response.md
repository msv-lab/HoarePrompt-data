The code appends the value of `y` to the list `result`. Since the initial state of `result` is a list containing `x`, after appending `y`, the list `result` will contain both `x` and `y`.

The other variables are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`marks_set` is a set of unique integers from the original `marks` list, `x_found` remains `False`, `y_found` is still `True` if any `mark + y` or `mark - y` is in `marks_set`, `new_marks` is an empty set, `result` is a list containing `x` and `y`.**
