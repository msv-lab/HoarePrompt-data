Postcondition: ***`i` is the third element of the `marks` list, `j` is the last element of `additional_marks`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `False`. If `i + j <= l` and `i + j` is not in `marks`, then `i + j` is added to `marks` and neither `need_x` nor `need_y` changes. Otherwise, no change occurs in the variables.***
