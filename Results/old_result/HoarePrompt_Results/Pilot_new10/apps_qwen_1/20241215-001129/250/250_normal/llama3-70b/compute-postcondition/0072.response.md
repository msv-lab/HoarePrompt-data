Postcondition: **`i` is the first element of the `marks` list, `j` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `False`, `additional_marks` is a list containing `x` and `y`. If `i + j \leq l` and `i + j` is not in the `marks` list, then `additional_marks` will contain `i + j`.**
