Output State: **`i` is `n`, `j` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `need_x` is `True` if there exist any pair `(i, j)` such that `marks[j] - marks[i] == x`, and `need_y` is `True` if there exist any pair `(i, j)` such that `marks[j] - marks[i] == y`.**

### Explanation:
- **Loop Execution Analysis:**
  - The outer loop runs from `0` to `n-1` (`i` ranges from `0` to `n-1`).
  - The inner loop runs from `i` to `n-1` (`j` ranges from `i` to `n-1`).

- **Conditions for `need_x` and `need_y`:**
  - `need_x` becomes `True` if there is any pair `(i, j)` such that `marks[j] - marks[i] == x`.
  - `need_y` becomes `True` if there is any pair `(i, j)` such that `marks[j] - marks[i] == y`.

- **Final Values:**
  - After the loops finish executing, `i` will be `n` because the outer loop condition `i < n` will no longer be satisfied.
  - Similarly, `j` will be `n-1` because the inner loop condition `j < n` will no longer be satisfied.
  - `n` remains the same as the initial value, within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
  - `need_x` and `need_y` will be `True` if any such pairs exist in the `marks` set, otherwise they will remain `False`.

Thus, the final state of the variables after the loop completes all its iterations is as described above.
