Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `i` is the second element of the `marks` list.
   - `j` is the last element of `additional_marks` after all iterations.
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `need_x` is `False`.
   - `need_y` is `False`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `i` in the `marks` list.

3. **Loop Body (Omitted):**
   - For each `i` in `marks`, the loop body adds elements to `additional_marks` if certain conditions are met.

4. **Key Points to Consider:**
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements in the `marks` list.
   - `i` starts as the second element of `marks`.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - If the loop continues to the next iteration, `i` will become the third element of `marks`.
   - `j` remains unchanged because it is determined by the last element of `additional_marks` and not affected by the loop itself.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `need_x` and `need_y` remain `False` unless explicitly changed within the loop body, but we assume they stay `False` based on the provided information.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be set to the third element of `marks`.
   - `j` remains the same as it was after all iterations of the previous loop.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `need_x` and `need_y` remain `False`.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted are:

State: **`i` is the third element of the `marks` list, `j` is the last element of `additional_marks`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `False`**
