The code snippet `new_marks.add(mark + y)` adds the value of `mark + y` to the set `new_marks`. This affects the set `new_marks` by including the new element `mark + y`.

Since no specific value for `mark` or `y` is given, the general form of the update to `new_marks` is clear. The other variables remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`marks_set` is a set of unique integers from the original `marks` list; `x_found` remains `False`; `y_found` is `True` if any `5 + y` or `5 - y` is in `marks_set`; `new_marks` is a set containing `mark + y` derived from the `marks` list according to the specified conditions.**
