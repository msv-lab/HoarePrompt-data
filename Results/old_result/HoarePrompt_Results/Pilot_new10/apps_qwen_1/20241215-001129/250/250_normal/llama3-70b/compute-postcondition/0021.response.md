Let's analyze the loop step-by-step to determine the final state of the variables after all iterations have completed.

### Initial State:
- `i` is 0
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- `marks` is a list of integers
- `x` and `y` are integers

### Loop Code:
```python
for j in range(i, n):
    if marks[j] - marks[i] == x:
        need_x = True
    if marks[j] - marks[i] == y:
        need_y = True
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop starts with `i` being 0 and iterates over the range from `i` (which is 0) to `n-1`.
   - For each `j` in this range, it checks if `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `x` or `y`.
   - If either condition is met, it sets `need_x` or `need_y` to `True`.

2. **Final State Determination**:
   - After the loop completes, `i` remains 0 because the loop only increments `j` and does not change `i`.
   - `n` remains unchanged and must be within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `need_x` will be `True` if there exists any `j` such that `marks[j] - marks[0] == x`.
   - `need_y` will be `True` if there exists any `j` such that `marks[j] - marks[0] == y`.

### Conclusion:
- If the loop executes, it will check every element in the `marks` list starting from `marks[0]` up to `marks[n-1]`.
- `need_x` will be `True` if `marks[j] - marks[0] == x` for at least one `j`.
- `need_y` will be `True` if `marks[j] - marks[0] == y` for at least one `j`.

### Output State:
- If the loop executes, `i` will be 0, `n` will be within the specified range, `need_x` will be `True` if `marks[j] - marks[0] == x` for at least one `j`, and `need_y` will be `True` if `marks[j] - marks[0] == y` for at least one `j`.
- If the loop does not execute, `i` remains 0, `n` remains within the specified range, `need_x` remains `False`, and `need_y` remains `False`.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `need_x` is True if `marks[j] - marks[0] == x` for at least one `j`, and `need_y` is True if `marks[j] - marks[0] == y` for at least one `j`.**
