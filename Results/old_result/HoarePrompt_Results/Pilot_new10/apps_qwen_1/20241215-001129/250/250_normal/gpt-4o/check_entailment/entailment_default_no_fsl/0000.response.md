Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the code fails to ensure that the minimum number of additional marks is added to measure both `x` and `y`. Here are a few issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Finding New Marks**: The logic in the `for` loop attempting to find new marks is flawed. It incorrectly combines `x` and `y` in ways that do not guarantee the minimum number of marks will be added.

2. **Missing Handling of Edge Cases**: The code does not handle cases where neither `x` nor `y` can be measured using the existing marks and the newly added marks. It simply prints the values of `x` and `y` if no marks are found, without ensuring that both distances are measurable.

3. **Inadequate Check for Minimum Marks**: The code does not ensure that the marks are added in a way that minimizes the number of additional marks required. For example, if adding a single mark can solve both problems, the code may add two separate marks instead.

To illustrate, consider the following input:
```
2 300 185 230
0 300
```
The code will print:
```
2
185 230
```
However, the correct output should be:
```
2
185 230
```
But since the code does not ensure the minimum number of marks, it is not fully correct. A more robust solution would involve a more systematic approach to finding the minimum set of marks that can measure both `x` and `y`.
