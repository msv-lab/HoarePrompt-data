The code snippet `new_marks.add(mark - y)` adds the value `mark - y` to the set `new_marks`. This operation does not affect the other variables, so their states remain unchanged. Since the precondition specifies that the loop continues with the next `mark` from the `marks` list, this implies that the process of checking conditions and adding elements to `new_marks` continues for subsequent `mark` values.

Output State: **`marks_set` is a set of unique integers from the original `marks` list; `x_found` remains `False`; `y_found` is `True` if any `mark + y` or `mark - y` is in `marks_set`; `new_marks` is a set containing elements derived from the `marks` list according to the specified conditions, with the additional element `mark - y` added to it; the loop continues with the next `mark` from the `marks` list.**
