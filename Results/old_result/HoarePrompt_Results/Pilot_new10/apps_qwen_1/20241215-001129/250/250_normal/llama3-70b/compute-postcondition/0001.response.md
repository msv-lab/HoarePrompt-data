The code `marks = set(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and then creates a set from these integers. This affects the `marks` variable, which is now a set of integers. The other variables (`n`, `l`, `x`, and `y`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5`, `2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9`, `1 ≤ x < y ≤ l`; `marks` is a set of integers created from the input values.**
