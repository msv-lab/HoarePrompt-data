State before the loop starts: \(i\) is \(n\), \(j\) is \(n-1\), \(n\) is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `False`, `additional_marks` is a list containing `x` and `y`.

According to the code, the loop iterates over the `marks` list using the variable `i`. For the loop to execute, the following conditions need to be met:

1. The `marks` list must be non-empty because the loop iterates over each element in the list.
2. The initial value of `i` is \(n\). Since `i` is used as the iterator in the for loop, `i` should be set to the first element of the `marks` list for the loop to start.
3. The values of `j` and `n` are not directly relevant to the loop's execution since they are not used in the loop itself.

Considering these points, we need to adjust the state to ensure that the loop can start executing. Specifically, we need to adjust `i` to the first element of the `marks` list, and ensure that `marks` is a non-empty list.

State: **`i` is the first element of the `marks` list, `j` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `False`, `additional_marks` is a list containing `x` and `y`, and `marks` is a non-empty list**.
