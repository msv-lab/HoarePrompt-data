`additional_marks` is appended with the value of `x`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, `n`, `need_x`, and `need_y` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `n`, `j` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is still `True` if there exist any pair `(i, j)` such that `marks[j] - marks[i] == y`, and `additional_marks` is a list containing `x`.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `j` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is still `True` if there exist any pair `(i, j)` such that `marks[j] - marks[i] == y`, and `additional_marks` is a list containing `x`.**
