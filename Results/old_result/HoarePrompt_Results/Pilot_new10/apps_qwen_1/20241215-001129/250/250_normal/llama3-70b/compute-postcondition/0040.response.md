Output State: **`i` is the value of `n`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `need_x` is `True`, and `need_y` is `True`.** 

Explanation:
- Initially, `i` is set to 1.
- The loop runs from `i` to `n-1`, so after the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `n`.
- During each iteration, the loop checks if `marks[j] - marks[i] == x` and sets `need_x` to `True` if found.
- Similarly, it checks if `marks[j] - marks[i] == y` and sets `need_y` to `True` if found.
- Since the loop is guaranteed to run from `i` to `n-1`, and the conditions for setting `need_x` and `need_y` are checked within the loop, these flags will be set to `True` if the conditions are met for at least one `j`.

Thus, after the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, and both `need_x` and `need_y` will be `True` if the conditions were met during the loop iterations.
