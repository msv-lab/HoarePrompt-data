According to the given code, the loop iterates over each element in the `additional_marks` list using the variable `j`. We need to determine how the states change as we move to the next iteration of the loop.

1. **Current State Analysis**:
   - `i` is the second element of the `marks` list.
   - `j` is the last element of `additional_marks` after all iterations.
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `need_x` is `False`.
   - `need_y` is `False`.

2. **Loop Iteration Analysis**:
   - The loop runs for each `j` in `additional_marks`.
   - After the loop, `j` will be the next element in `additional_marks` if it hasn't already been processed.

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since `j` is the last element of `additional_marks` after all iterations, the next value of `j` will be the first element of `additional_marks` (if the list isn't empty) or there won't be any further iterations (if the list is empty).
   - The value of `i` does not change during the loop.
   - `n`, `need_x`, and `need_y` remain unchanged unless modified within the loop, but no such modifications are mentioned.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - If `additional_marks` is not empty, `j` will be the first element of `additional_marks` after the loop.
   - If `additional_marks` is empty, the loop will not execute again, and the state will remain unchanged.

Given these points, we can conclude:

- If `additional_marks` is not empty, `j` becomes the first element of `additional_marks`.
- If `additional_marks` is empty, the loop terminates, and the state remains as is.

Since the problem statement doesn't specify whether `additional_marks` is empty or not, we assume the general case where the list might still contain elements.

**State:**
- If `additional_marks` is not empty, `j` is the first element of `additional_marks`.
- If `additional_marks` is empty, the state remains unchanged.

Thus, the final state would be:
- **`i` is the second element of the `marks` list, `j` is the first element of `additional_marks` if it is not empty, otherwise the state remains unchanged, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `False`**.
