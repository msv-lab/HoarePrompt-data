The code sets `need_x` to `True`. The value of `need_y` remains unchanged, and the value of `i` also remains unchanged since it was not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `need_x` is `True`, and `need_y` remains `True`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `need_x` is `True`, `need_y` is `True`**
