`x_found` is assigned the value `True`. The value of `x` and `y` remains unchanged, and the states of `n`, `l`, `marks_set`, `y_found`, `marks`, `mark + x`, and `mark - x` are also unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `l` is an integer such that \(2 \leq l \leq 10^9\), `x` and `y` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < y \leq l\), `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from the original `marks` list, `x_found` is `True`, `y_found` is `False`, `marks` must be non-empty, `mark + x` is in `marks_set` or `mark - x` is in `marks_set`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `l` is an integer such that \(2 \leq l \leq 10^9\), `x` and `y` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < y \leq l\), `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from the original `marks` list, `x_found` is `True`, `y_found` is `False`, `marks` must be non-empty, `mark + x` is in `marks_set` or `mark - x` is in `marks_set`**
