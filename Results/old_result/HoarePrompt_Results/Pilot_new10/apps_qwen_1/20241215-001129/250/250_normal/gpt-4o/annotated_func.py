#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a sequence of integers `marks` and given integers `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y`. It first checks if there exist any `mark` such that `mark + x` or `mark - x` is in `marks_set` and similarly for `y`. If both `x_found` and `y_found` are `True`, it prints `0`. Otherwise, it attempts to find new marks that satisfy the conditions involving `x` and `y` by checking combinations of sums and differences. If such marks are found, it prints `1` followed by one of the new marks. If no such marks are found, it prints the values of `x` and `y` as a list. The function handles cases where `x_found` or `y_found` might not be `True` and ensures all potential conditions are covered.
