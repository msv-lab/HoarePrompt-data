The code `need_x = True` assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `need_x`. The values of the other variables (`i`, `n`, and `marks[j] - marks[i]`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `x`, `need_x` is True**
