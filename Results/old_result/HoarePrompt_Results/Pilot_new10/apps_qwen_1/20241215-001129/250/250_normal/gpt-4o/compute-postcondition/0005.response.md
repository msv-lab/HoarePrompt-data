Let's break down the given task step-by-step:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
   - `l` is an integer such that \(2 \leq l \leq 10^9\)
   - `x` and `y` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < y \leq l\)
   - `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from the original `marks` list
   - `x_found` is `False`
   - `y_found` is `False`

2. **Loop Condition**:
   The loop iterates over each element `mark` in `marks`.

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each `mark` in `marks`, the loop will check if `mark` exists in `marks_set`.
   - The loop does not directly affect the values of `n`, `l`, `x`, or `y`.
   - The loop can potentially change the values of `x_found` and `y_found`.

4. **Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop can execute as long as there are elements in `marks`.
   - Since `marks_set` is derived from `marks`, the loop will run as long as `marks` is non-empty.

5. **Required Adjustments**:
   - We need to ensure that `marks` is non-empty. If `marks` is empty, the loop will not execute.
   - `x_found` and `y_found` can be `False` initially, but the loop might change their values depending on the contents of `marks`.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `marks` is non-empty for the loop to execute. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted accordingly.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `l` is an integer such that \(2 \leq l \leq 10^9\), `x` and `y` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < y \leq l\), `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from the original `marks` list, `x_found` is `False`, `y_found` is `False`, `marks` must be non-empty**.
