`additional_marks` is appended with the value of `i + j`. The values of `i` and `j` remain the same as they were initially. The states of the other variables (`n`, `need_x`, `need_y`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is the third element of the `marks` list, `j` is the last element of `additional_marks`, `additional_marks` contains `i + j`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `False`.

Output State: **`i` is the third element of the `marks` list, `j` is the last element of `additional_marks`, `additional_marks` contains `i + j`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `False`**
