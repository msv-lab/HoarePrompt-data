Postcondition: ***`marks_set` is a set of unique integers from the original `marks` list, `x_found` remains `False`, `y_found` is still `True` if any `mark + y` or `mark - y` is in `marks_set`, `new_marks` is an empty set, `result` is a list containing `x`. The condition `y_found` is not satisfied within the if statement.***
