Postcondition: ***`marks_set` is a set of unique integers from the original `marks` list; `x_found` remains `False`; `y_found` is `True` if any `mark + y` or `mark - y` is in `marks_set`; `new_marks` is a set containing either `mark + x` or `mark - x + y` or `mark - x - y` or `mark - y + x` or `mark - y - x` for each `mark` in `marks` such that at least one of the conditions `(mark + x + y in marks_set or mark + x - y in marks_set or mark - y + x in marks_set or mark + y + x in marks_set or mark + y - x in marks_set or mark - y + x in marks_set)` holds true. If the if condition is satisfied, `mark + x` is added to `new_marks`. Otherwise, if `mark - x + y` or `mark - x - y` is added to `new_marks` or if `mark - y + x` or `mark - y - x` is in `marks_set`, `mark - y` is added to `new_marks`. The loop continues with the next `mark` from the `marks` list.***
