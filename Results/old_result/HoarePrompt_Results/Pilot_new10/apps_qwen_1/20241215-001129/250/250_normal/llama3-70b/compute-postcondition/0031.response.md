The code `need_x = True` does not affect the value of `need_x`. It only assigns `True` to `need_x`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\) and `n` is greater than 1, `need_x` is `True`, `need_y` is `True`, and `marks[2] - marks[0] == x` holds if the condition is checked.**
