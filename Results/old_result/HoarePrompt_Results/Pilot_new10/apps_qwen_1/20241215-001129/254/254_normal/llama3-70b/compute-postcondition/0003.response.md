The code snippet updates the values of `a` and `b`. Initially, `a` is the original value of `b`, and `b` is non-zero. The code assigns `b` to `a` and `a % b` to `b`.

Given that `b` is non-zero, let's denote the original value of `b` as `b_original`. After the operation, `a` becomes `b_original` and `b` becomes `a_original % b_original`. Since `a_original` is the original value of `b`, we can substitute `a_original` with `b_original`. Thus, `b` becomes `b_original % b_original`. The modulus of any number with itself (where the number is non-zero) is 0.

Therefore, after the code execution:
- `a` becomes `b_original`.
- `b` becomes `0`.

The output state is:
Output State: **`a` is `b`'s original value, `b` is 0**.
