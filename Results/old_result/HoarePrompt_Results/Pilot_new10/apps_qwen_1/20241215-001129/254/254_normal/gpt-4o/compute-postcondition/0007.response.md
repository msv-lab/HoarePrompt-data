Postcondition: **`gcd_k1_k2` is the GCD of `k1` and `k2`, `k1` and `k2` are integers read from input, `k3` is an integer read from input, `gcd_all` is the GCD of `gcd_k1_k2`, `k1`, and `k2`. If the GCD of `gcd_k1_k2`, `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` is 1, the function does not return anything (implying no change). Otherwise, the program prints 'NO'.**
