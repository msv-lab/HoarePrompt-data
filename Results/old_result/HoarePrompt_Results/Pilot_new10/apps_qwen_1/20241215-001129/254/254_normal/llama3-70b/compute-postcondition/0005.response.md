The code `a, b = b, a % b` assigns the value of `b` to `a` and the value of `a % b` to `b`. Given the initial state where `a` is `b`'s original value and `b` is non-zero, let's break it down:

1. The value of `a` changes to `b`.
2. The value of `b` changes to `a % b`, which is `b % b`. Since any number modulo itself is 0, `b % b` equals 0.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `a` is now `b`.
- `b` is now `0`.

The output state is:
Output State: **`a` is `b`, `b` is 0**
