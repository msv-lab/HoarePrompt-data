Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The program uses the `func_1` function to calculate the GCD, but incorrectly applies it to find the LCM of three numbers. The formula used in the program is not correct for calculating the LCM of three numbers. The output hints confirm that `func_1` correctly computes the GCD, but the program incorrectly uses it to compute the LCM, leading to incorrect results in determining whether it's possible to light all garlands at least once per second after turning them on. Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the required logic.
