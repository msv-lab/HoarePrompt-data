Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided code uses the `func_1` function, which calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) instead of the Least Common Multiple (LCM). The GCD calculation is incorrect for determining if there exists a moment when all garlands are lit. The output hints confirm that `func_1` returns the GCD, not the LCM. Therefore, the program will not correctly determine if it is possible to light at least one garland each second. The corrected version provided in the explanation addresses this issue by correctly calculating the LCM and checking if the LCM is greater than or equal to the maximum of the three time intervals.
