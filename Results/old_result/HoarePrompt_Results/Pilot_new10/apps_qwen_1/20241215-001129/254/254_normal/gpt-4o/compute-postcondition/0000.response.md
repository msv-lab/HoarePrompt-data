The code `k1, k2, k3 = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `k1`, `k2`, and `k3`. The initial values of `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` are positive integers between 1 and 1500. After executing the code, these values are replaced by the integers read from the input.

Output State: **`k1` is an integer read from input, `k2` is an integer read from input, `k3` is an integer read from input, and 1 â‰¤ `k1`, `k2`, `k3` â‰¤ 1500.**
