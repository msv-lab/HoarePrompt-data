You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp is crazy about round numbers. He especially likes the numbers divisible by 10^{k}.

In the given number of n Polycarp wants to remove the least number of digits to get a number that is divisible by 10^{k}. For example, if k = 3, in the number 30020 it is enough to delete a single digit (2). In this case, the result is 3000 that is divisible by 10^3 = 1000.

Write a program that prints the minimum number of digits to be deleted from the given integer number n, so that the result is divisible by 10^{k}. The result should not start with the unnecessary leading zero (i.e., zero can start only the number 0, which is required to be written as exactly one digit).

It is guaranteed that the answer exists.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains two integer numbers n and k (0 ≤ n ≤ 2 000 000 000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 9).

It is guaranteed that the answer exists. All numbers in the input are written in traditional notation of integers, that is, without any extra leading zeros.


-----Output-----

Print w — the required minimal number of digits to erase. After removing the appropriate w digits from the number n, the result should have a value that is divisible by 10^{k}. The result can start with digit 0 in the single case (the result is zero and written by exactly the only digit 0).


-----Examples-----
Input
30020 3

Output
1

Input
100 9

Output
2

Input
10203049 2

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the example 2 you can remove two digits: 1 and any 0. The result is number 0 which is divisible by any number.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(str, input().split())
    k = int(k)
    count_zeros = 0
    to_remove = 0
    for digit in reversed(n):
        if digit == '0':
            count_zeros += 1
        else:
            to_remove += 1
        if count_zeros == k:
            break
    if count_zeros == k:
        print(to_remove)
    else:
        print(len(n) - 1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle cases where the number `n` itself is already divisible by \(10^k\). In such cases, no digits need to be removed, but the program incorrectly removes at least one digit.

For example, consider the following input:
```
Input
1000 4

Output
1
```

The correct output should be `0`, as the number `1000` is already divisible by \(10^4 = 10000\), and no digits need to be removed. However, the program incorrectly outputs `1` by removing the digit `1`.

To fix this, we need to check if the number is already divisible by \(10^k\) before proceeding with the current logic. Here's an updated version of the function:

```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(str, input().split())
    k = int(k)
    # Check if the number is already divisible by 10^k
    if int(n) % (10**k) == 0:
        print(0)
        return
    
    count_zeros = 0
    to_remove = 0
    for digit in reversed(n):
        if digit == '0':
            count_zeros += 1
        else:
            to_remove += 1
        if count_zeros == k:
            break
    if count_zeros == k:
        print(to_remove)
    else:
        print(len(n) - 1)

func()
```

This updated code first checks if the number is already divisible by \(10^k\). If it is, it prints `0` immediately. Otherwise, it proceeds with the original logic to find the minimum number of digits to remove.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 2,000,000,000, and k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 9.
def func():
    n, k = map(str, input().split())
    k = int(k)
    count_zeros = 0
    to_remove = 0
    for digit in reversed(n):
        if digit == '0':
            count_zeros += 1
        else:
            to_remove += 1
        
        if count_zeros == k:
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is the number of zeros in the string `n` up to the point where `count_zeros` reaches `k`, and `to_remove` is the number of digits removed from the string `n` up to the point where `count_zeros` reaches `k`. If the loop does not execute, `count_zeros` remains 0 and `to_remove` remains 0.
    if (count_zeros == k) :
        print(to_remove)
    else :
        print(len(n) - 1)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is the number of zeros in the string `n` up to the point where `count_zeros` reaches `k`, `to_remove` is the number of digits removed from the string `n` up to the point where either `count_zeros` reaches `k` or the loop does not execute, and if `count_zeros` equals `k`, the function prints the value of `to_remove`; otherwise, the function outputs `len(n) - 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:- The function handles the edge case where `n` contains fewer than `k` zeros by printing `len(n) - 1`.
   - However, the annotation mentions that the function returns `n % k`, which seems to be a misunderstanding or missing part of the logic.

### Functionality Summary

Based on the actual code, the function processes the integer `n` and counts the number of zeros. It then determines the number of digits to remove to achieve exactly `k` zeros and prints the result. If it cannot achieve `k` zeros, it prints `len(n) - 1`.

### Final Summary

Functionality:

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
