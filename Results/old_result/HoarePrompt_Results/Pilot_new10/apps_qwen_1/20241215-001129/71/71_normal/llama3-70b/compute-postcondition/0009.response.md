`w` is incremented by 1. The value of `n` remains unchanged since the code does not affect it. The initial condition that `n` is an integer between 0 and 20,000,000 inclusive and still not divisible by \(10^k\) is preserved.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 0 and 20,000,000 inclusive and still not divisible by \(10^k\); `w` is increased by 1**
