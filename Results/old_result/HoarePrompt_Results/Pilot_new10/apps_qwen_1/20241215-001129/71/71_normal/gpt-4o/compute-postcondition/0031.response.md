The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. The parameter `n` is an integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 2,000,000,000\), and the parameter `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 9\). 

Case_1: `n` is an integer within the specified range and `k` is an integer within the specified range. The function returns `n % k`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer between 0 and 2,000,000,000 inclusive, and `k` is an integer between 1 and 9 inclusive, and return the result of `n` modulo `k`.
