The code snippet prints the value of `to_remove`. Since `to_remove` represents the number of digits removed from the string `n` up to the point where `count_zeros` reaches `k`, and the current value of `count_zeros` is equal to `k`, this means that `to_remove` has already reached its final value. Therefore, the print statement will simply output the current value of `to_remove`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is the number of zeros in the string `n` up to the point where `count_zeros` reaches `k`, `to_remove` is the number of digits removed from the string `n` up to the point where `count_zeros` reaches `k`, and we print the value of `to_remove`.**
