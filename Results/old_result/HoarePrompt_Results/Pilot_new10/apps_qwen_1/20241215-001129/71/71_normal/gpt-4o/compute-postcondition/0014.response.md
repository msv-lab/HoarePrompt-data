`count_zeros` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `count_zeros` is either 1 or 0. If `count_zeros` was initially 1, it becomes 2. If it was initially 0, it becomes 1. The values of `n`, `k`, and `to_remove` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string (without the rightmost digit), `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is either 2 or 1, and `to_remove` is 1 if the new rightmost digit is not '0', otherwise `to_remove` remains 0.**
