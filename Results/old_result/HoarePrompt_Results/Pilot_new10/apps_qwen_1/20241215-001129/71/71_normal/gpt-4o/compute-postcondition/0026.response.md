Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is the number of zeros in the string `n` up to the point where `count_zeros` reaches `k`, and `to_remove` is the number of digits removed from the string `n` up to the point where `count_zeros` reaches `k`. The current value of `count_zeros` is equal to `k` and the current value of `to_remove` is the number of digits removed from `n` up to the point where `count_zeros` reaches `k`.***
