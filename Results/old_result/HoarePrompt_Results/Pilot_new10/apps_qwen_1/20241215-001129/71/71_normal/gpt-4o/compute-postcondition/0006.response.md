The code `count_zeros += 1` increments the value of `count_zeros` by 1. Since `count_zeros` was initially 0, after this operation, `count_zeros` will be 1. The values of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `to_remove`, and `digit`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is 1, `to_remove` is 0, the current value of `digit` is '0'**
