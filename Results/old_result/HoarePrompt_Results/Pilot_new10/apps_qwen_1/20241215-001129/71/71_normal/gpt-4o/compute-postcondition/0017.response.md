The code `break` does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `k`, `count_zeros`, and `to_remove`. It only breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement, but since no such structure is present in the given code snippet, it simply ends the execution of the current block.

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string (without the rightmost digit), `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is either 2 or 1 depending on whether the new rightmost digit is '0', and `to_remove` is 2 if the new rightmost digit is not '0', otherwise `to_remove` is 1.**
