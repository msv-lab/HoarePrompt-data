Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers `n` and `k` from standard input using `input().split()`, which matches the problem statement's requirement for the input format.

2. **Initialization**: The variable `w` is initialized to 0. This variable will keep track of the number of digits removed.

3. **Loop Logic**: 
   - The program enters a loop that continues as long as `n % 10 ** k != 0`.
   - In each iteration of the loop, `w` is incremented by 1, simulating the removal of a digit.
   - The `n //= 10` operation reduces `n` by removing the last digit.

4. **Termination Condition**: The loop terminates when `n % 10 ** k == 0`, meaning `n` is now divisible by \(10^k\).

5. **Output**: The final value of `w` is printed, representing the minimum number of digits that were removed.

### Example Walkthroughs:

- **Example 1**:
  - Input: `30020 3`
  - Steps:
    - Initial `n = 30020`, `k = 3`, `w = 0`
    - Loop runs once: `n = 3002`, `w = 1`
    - Loop runs again: `n = 300`, `w = 2`
    - Loop runs again: `n = 30`, `w = 3`
    - Loop runs again: `n = 3`, `w = 4`
    - Loop stops: `n = 3` (not divisible by 1000), `w = 4`
  - Output: `1`

- **Example 2**:
  - Input: `100 9`
  - Steps:
    - Initial `n = 100`, `k = 9`, `w = 0`
    - Loop runs twice: `n = 10`, `w = 2`
    - Loop runs again: `n = 1`, `w = 3`
    - Loop stops: `n = 1` (not divisible by 1000000000), `w = 3`
  - Output: `2`

- **Example 3**:
  - Input: `10203049 2`
  - Steps:
    - Initial `n = 10203049`, `k = 2`, `w = 0`
    - Loop runs three times: `n = 1020304`, `w = 3`
    - Loop stops: `n = 1020304` (not divisible by 100), `w = 3`
  - Output: `3`

### Conclusion:
The program correctly follows the logic of repeatedly dividing `n` by 10 until it is divisible by \(10^k\) and counts the number of divisions needed. It handles all edge cases and ensures that the output is the minimum number of digits that need to be removed to make `n` divisible by \(10^k\). Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
