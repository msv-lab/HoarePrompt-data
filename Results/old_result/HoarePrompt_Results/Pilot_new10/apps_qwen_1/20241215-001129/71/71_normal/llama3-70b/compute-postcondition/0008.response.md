Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `n` is an integer between 0 and 20,000,000 inclusive.
   - `n` is not divisible by 10.
   - `w` has been increased by 1.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `n % 10 ** k != 0`.

3. **Understanding the Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue until `n` becomes divisible by \(10^k\).
   - Since `n` was not divisible by 10 initially (or 10, 100, 1000, etc., depending on the value of `k`), the loop will eventually adjust `n` to become divisible by \(10^k\).

4. **Determining the Next Iteration State:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must not yet be divisible by \(10^k\).
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is still not divisible by \(10^k\) at the start of the next iteration.

5. **Adjusting the State:**
   - We need to keep `n` in a state where it is not divisible by \(10^k\).
   - We do not need to change the range of `n` since the loop condition only cares about divisibility.
   - We also do not need to change the value of `w` because it has already been incremented and does not affect the loop condition.

6. **Final State for the Next Iteration:**
   - `n` should still be an integer between 0 and 20,000,000 inclusive.
   - `n` should still not be divisible by \(10^k\).
   - `w` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

Thus, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:

State: **`n` is an integer between 0 and 20,000,000 inclusive and still not divisible by \(10^k\)**
