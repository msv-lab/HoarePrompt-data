Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case. Specifically, the code reduces `n` by repeatedly dividing it by 10 until it is divisible by \(10^k\), counting the number of divisions. However, this approach fails to consider cases where there are multiple trailing zeros in the number. For example, if \(n = 10203040\) and \(k = 3\), the correct answer should be 2 (removing the last two digits to get 1020304), but the code would incorrectly count the division by 10 three times (since it would reduce the number to 10203040 -> 1020304 -> 102030 -> 10203), resulting in 3 divisions instead of 2. Therefore, the code does not handle cases where there are multiple trailing zeros appropriately.
