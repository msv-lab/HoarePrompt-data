Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle cases where the number `n` itself is already divisible by \(10^k\). In such cases, no digits need to be removed, but the program incorrectly removes at least one digit.

For example, consider the following input:
```
Input
1000 4

Output
1
```

The correct output should be `0`, as the number `1000` is already divisible by \(10^4 = 10000\), and no digits need to be removed. However, the program incorrectly outputs `1` by removing the digit `1`.

To fix this, we need to check if the number is already divisible by \(10^k\) before proceeding with the current logic. Here's an updated version of the function:

```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(str, input().split())
    k = int(k)
    # Check if the number is already divisible by 10^k
    if int(n) % (10**k) == 0:
        print(0)
        return
    
    count_zeros = 0
    to_remove = 0
    for digit in reversed(n):
        if digit == '0':
            count_zeros += 1
        else:
            to_remove += 1
        if count_zeros == k:
            break
    if count_zeros == k:
        print(to_remove)
    else:
        print(len(n) - 1)

func()
```

This updated code first checks if the number is already divisible by \(10^k\). If it is, it prints `0` immediately. Otherwise, it proceeds with the original logic to find the minimum number of digits to remove.
