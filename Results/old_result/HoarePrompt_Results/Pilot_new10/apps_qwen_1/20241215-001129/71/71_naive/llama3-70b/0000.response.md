Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle cases where the number itself is already divisible by \(10^k\). In such cases, no digits need to be removed, but the program incorrectly increments the counter `w` until the number becomes zero.

For example, consider the input:
```
Input
1000 3
```
The expected output is `0` because the number `1000` is already divisible by \(10^3 = 1000\). However, the program will increment `w` until `n` becomes zero, resulting in an output of `4`.

To fix this, the program should check if the number is already divisible by \(10^k\) before entering the loop. Here's a corrected version:

```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    w = 0
    if n % 10 ** k == 0:
        print(0)
        return
    while n % 10 ** k != 0:
        w += 1
        n //= 10
    print(w)
```

This ensures that the program correctly handles cases where the number is already divisible by \(10^k\).
