Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the number of pairs of shovels whose total cost ends with the maximum possible number of nines. Specifically, the logic to determine `max_9s` is flawed. 

For instance, consider the input `n = 50`. According to the problem description, the maximum number of nines at the end of the sum of the costs of two shovels is 2 (for the pair 49 and 50). However, the program calculates `max_9s` incorrectly. It only counts trailing zeros in `n+1`, which does not reflect the actual number of trailing nines in the sum of shovel costs.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of trailing nines in the sum of any two shovels' costs. This involves understanding how the sum of two numbers ending in certain digits can produce a result with trailing nines. The correct approach would involve checking the sums of all possible pairs of shovels and determining the maximum number of trailing nines.
