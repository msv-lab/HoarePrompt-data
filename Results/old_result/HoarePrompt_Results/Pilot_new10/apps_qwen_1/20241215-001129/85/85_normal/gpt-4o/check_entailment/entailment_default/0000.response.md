Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem. Specifically, the code calculates the number of pairs of shovels whose total cost ends with the maximum possible number of nines, but it does not ensure that the pairs consist of two distinct shovels. The calculation \((n + 1) * max_9s\) is incorrect because it does not take into account the specific shovels chosen to form pairs. For example, consider \(n = 7\):

- The code calculates \(max_9s = 0\) because \(8 \% 10 \neq 0\).
- It then calculates pairs as \((7 + 1) * 0 = 0\), which is incorrect since there are actually 3 valid pairs: (2, 7), (3, 6), and (4, 5).

Similarly, for \(n = 14\), the code incorrectly calculates pairs as 0, whereas the correct number of pairs is 9. The code needs to explicitly find pairs of shovels whose total cost ends with the maximum number of nines, not just calculate a value based on the number of trailing zeros in \(n + 1\).
