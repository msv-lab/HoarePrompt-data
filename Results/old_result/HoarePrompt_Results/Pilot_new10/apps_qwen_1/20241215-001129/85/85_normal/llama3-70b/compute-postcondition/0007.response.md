`ans` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` is 2, and `n` must be at least 2. The previous value of `ans` is not specified, but it is incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, and `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus 1.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, and `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus 1**
