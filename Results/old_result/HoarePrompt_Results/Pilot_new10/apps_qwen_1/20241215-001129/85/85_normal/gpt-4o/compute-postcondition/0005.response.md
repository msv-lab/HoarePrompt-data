To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the condition of the `while` loop:

The loop condition is `(n + 1) % 10 == 0`.

This condition checks if adding 1 to `n` results in a number that ends in 0. In other words, `n` must end in 9 for this condition to be true.

Given that `n` is an integer input from the user, ending in a digit other than 9, and `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`, we need to adjust the state such that `n` ends in 9 for the loop to execute again.

Since `n` currently does not end in 9, we need to modify the state to reflect that `n` must now end in 9.

State: **`n` must end in 9**
