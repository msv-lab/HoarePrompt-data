Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be at least 2

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over values of `i` starting from 1 up to `n // 2 + 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
   - To determine if the loop can execute again, we need to check the condition for the next value of `i`.

4. **Next Value of `i`:**
   - The current value of `i` is 2.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n // 2 + 1`.
   - Since `i` is 2, the next value of `i` would be 3 if `n // 2 + 1` is greater than 2.

5. **Condition for Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to continue, `n // 2 + 1` must be greater than 2.
   - This implies that `n` must be at least 3 because if `n` were 2, then `n // 2 + 1` would be 2, and the loop would stop.

6. **Final State Adjustment:**
   - `i` will be 3 if the loop continues.
   - `n` must be at least 3 to allow the loop to continue.

Therefore, the updated states at the start of the next iteration are:
State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be at least 3**
