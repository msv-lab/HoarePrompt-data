The code initializes the variable `max_9s` to 0. This does not affect the value of `n`, which remains as the integer input from the user within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `max_9s`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input from the user, 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `max_9s` is 0**
