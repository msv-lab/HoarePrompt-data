According to the code, the loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `n // 2 + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be at least 2. The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `n // 2 + 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `n` must be at least 2

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` needs to be increased by 1, so `i` will be 2.
- `n` must still be at least 2, but since we don't know if it's exactly 2 or greater, we'll keep the same requirement.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2**
