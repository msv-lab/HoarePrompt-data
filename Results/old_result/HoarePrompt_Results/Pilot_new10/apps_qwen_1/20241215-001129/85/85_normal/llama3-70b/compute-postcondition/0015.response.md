Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` within the range 2 to \(10^9\) from user input, and counts the number of integers `i` (from 1 to \(n//2\)) for which \((i + (n - i))\) is divisible by \(10\) raised to the power of the number of digits in \((i + (n - i))\) minus one. The function then prints the count of such integers.**
