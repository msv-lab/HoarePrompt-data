Postcondition: ***`remaining_time` is reset, `subtasks_solved` is 0, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is 0, `subtask_time` is the next valid element in `t`, `time_used` is reset, `max_points` remains unchanged, `points` remains unchanged. This is true regardless of whether `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`.***
