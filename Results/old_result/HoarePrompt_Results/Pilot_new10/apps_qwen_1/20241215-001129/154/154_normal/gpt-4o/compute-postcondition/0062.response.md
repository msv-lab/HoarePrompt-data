Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Information:
- `remaining_time` is `M - (complete_tasks * total_time_per_task)`
- `subtasks_solved` is 0
- `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is unchanged
- `subtask_time` is unchanged
- `time_used` is `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`
- `max_points` is the maximum of `max_points` and `points`
- `points` is `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`

### Loop:
```
for subtask_time in t:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `t`, where `t` represents the subtask times.
2. **Initial State**:
   - `subtasks_solved` is 0, meaning no subtasks have been solved yet.
   - `subtask_time` is unchanged, indicating the time taken for each subtask remains constant.
   - `remaining_time` is calculated based on `M`, `complete_tasks`, and `total_time_per_task`.
   - `time_used` is the total time used by `complete_tasks`.
   - `max_points` and `points` are updated based on `complete_tasks` and `k`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
- For the loop to execute, there must be at least one element in `t` (the list of subtask times).
- `subtasks_solved` should be incremented by 1 after each iteration of the loop, starting from 0.

### Required Adjustments:
- Ensure that `t` (the list of subtask times) is non-empty. If `t` is empty, the loop will not execute.
- `subtasks_solved` must start at 0 and will be incremented within the loop.

### Final Answer:
State: **`remaining_time` is `M - (complete_tasks * total_time_per_task)`, `subtasks_solved` is 0, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is unchanged, `subtask_time` is unchanged, `time_used` is `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `max_points` is the maximum of `max_points` and `points`, `points` is `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `t` must be a non-empty list, `subtasks_solved` is 0 before the loop starts and will be incremented within the loop.**
