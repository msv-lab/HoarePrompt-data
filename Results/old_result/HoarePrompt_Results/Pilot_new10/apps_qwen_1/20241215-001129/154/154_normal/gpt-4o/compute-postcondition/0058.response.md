Postcondition: ***`remaining_time` is 0, `subtasks_solved` is \(\min(\text{subtasks\_solved}, (n - (\text{complete\_tasks} + 1)) * k)\), `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is unchanged, `subtask_time` is unchanged, `time_used` is `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `max_points` is the maximum of `max_points` and `points + \text{subtasks\_solved}`, `points` is unchanged. Since the if condition checks if `time_used > M`, and there is no else part, the postcondition remains the same whether the condition is true or false.***
