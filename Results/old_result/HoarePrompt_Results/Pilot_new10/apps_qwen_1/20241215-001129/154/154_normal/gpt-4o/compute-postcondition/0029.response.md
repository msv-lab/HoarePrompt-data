Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Initial States**: 
   - `remaining_time` is 0 or the remaining time after covering all possible subtasks.
   - `subtasks_solved` is `min(subtasks_solved, (n - complete_tasks) * k)`.
   - `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is 0.
   - `subtask_time` is the next element in the list `t`.
   - `max_points` is `max(max_points, points + subtasks_solved)`.

2. **Loop Analysis**:
   - The loop iterates over `complete_tasks` from 0 to `n`.
   - In each iteration, `complete_tasks` increases by 1.

3. **State Adjustments**:
   - Since `complete_tasks` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `complete_tasks` will be `complete_tasks + 1`.
   - `remaining_time` remains unchanged as the loop does not explicitly modify it based on `complete_tasks`.
   - `subtasks_solved` might change if the loop modifies it, but we don't have specific details on how it changes.
   - `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is set to 0 at the beginning of the loop and does not change within the loop.
   - `subtask_time` is the next element in the list `t`, so at the start of the next iteration, it will be the next element in the list.
   - `max_points` might change if the loop updates it, but we don't have specific details on how it changes.

Given these points, let's adjust the states for the next iteration:

- `remaining_time` remains the same.
- `subtasks_solved` might be updated, but we don't know its exact value, so we keep it as `subtasks_solved`.
- `max_subtasks_for_this_task` remains 0.
- `subtask_time` becomes the next element in the list `t`.
- `max_points` might be updated, but we don't know its exact value, so we keep it as `max_points`.

Therefore, the adjusted states at the start of the next iteration are:

State: **`remaining_time` is 0 or the remaining time after covering all possible subtasks, `subtasks_solved` is `subtasks_solved`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is 0, `subtask_time` is the next element in the list `t`, `max_points` is `max_points`**.
