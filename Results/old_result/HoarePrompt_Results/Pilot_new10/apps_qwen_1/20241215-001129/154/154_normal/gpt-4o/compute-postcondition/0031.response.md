The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only causes the exit from the current loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no explicit loop or conditional block mentioned, the `break` statement here would simply cause the exit from the most nested loop or conditional structure. However, based on the given code snippet alone, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`remaining_time` is 0 or the remaining time after covering all possible subtasks, `subtasks_solved` is `subtasks_solved`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is 0, `subtask_time` is the next element in the list `t`, `max_points` is `max_points`, `time_used` is `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`**
