To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop and the effects it has on the variables involved. Let's break down the loop step by step.

### Loop Analysis

1. **Outer Loop (`for complete_tasks in range(n + 1):`)**:
   - This loop iterates from `0` to `n` inclusive.
   - For each iteration, `complete_tasks` ranges from `0` to `n`.
   - `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in the list `t`.
   - `time_used` accumulates over iterations and is updated as `time_used += complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`.

2. **Inner Loop (`for subtask_time in t:`)**:
   - This loop processes each element in the list `t`.
   - For each `subtask_time`, `remaining_time` is updated based on the remaining time after covering the subtask.
   - `subtasks_solved` is updated to account for the maximum number of subtasks that can be completed within the remaining time.
   - `subtasks_solved` is then capped to ensure it does not exceed the limit of `(n - complete_tasks) * k`.

3. **Update `max_points`**:
   - After processing the inner loop, `max_points` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `points + subtasks_solved`.
   - `points` is calculated as `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`.

### Key Observations

- **If the loop does not execute**:
  - All variables retain their initial values.
  - `max_points` remains `0`.
  - `remaining_time` remains `M`.
  - `subtasks_solved` is `0`.
  - `subtask_time` and `total_time_per_task` remain as they were initially.

- **If the loop executes**:
  - The loop will terminate when `time_used > M`.
  - The final value of `max_points` will be the maximum value obtained during the loop iterations.
  - `remaining_time` will be the time left after the last iteration.
  - `subtasks_solved` will be the maximum number of subtasks solved under the constraints.
  - `subtask_time` and `total_time_per_task` remain as they were after the last iteration.

### Final Output State

Given the above analysis, the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **`max_points` is the maximum value of `points + subtasks_solved` obtained during the loop, `remaining_time` is the remaining time after the last iteration, `subtasks_solved` is the maximum number of subtasks solved under the constraints, `subtask_time` is the last `subtask_time` processed, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in the list `t`, `t` is the original list of subtask times, `complete_tasks` is `n`, `points` is `n * (k + 1)`.**
