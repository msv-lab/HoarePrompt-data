Postcondition: ***`remaining_time` is 0 or the remaining time after covering all possible subtasks, `subtasks_solved` remains unchanged, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is 0, `subtask_time` is the next element in the list `t`, `max_points` remains unchanged, `time_used` is `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`. If `time_used` exceeds `M`, no changes occur; otherwise, no specific actions are mentioned in the provided else part.***
