The value of `subtasks_solved` is incremented by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`. The initial value of `subtasks_solved` is 4, and `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is 0, so `subtasks_solved` becomes 4 + 0 = 4. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`remaining_time` is 0, `subtasks_solved` is 4, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is 0**
