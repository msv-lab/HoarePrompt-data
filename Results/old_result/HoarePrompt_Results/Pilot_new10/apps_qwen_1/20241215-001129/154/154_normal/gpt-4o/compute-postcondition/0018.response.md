`subtasks_solved` is incremented by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`. Given the initial state, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is 0, so `subtasks_solved` remains unchanged. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`remaining_time` is 0, `subtasks_solved` is 4, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is 0**
