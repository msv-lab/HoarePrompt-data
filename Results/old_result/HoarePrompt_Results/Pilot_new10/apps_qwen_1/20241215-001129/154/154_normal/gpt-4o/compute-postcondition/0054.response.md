The code `max_points = max(max_points, points + subtasks_solved)` updates `max_points` to be the maximum of its current value and the sum of `points` and `subtasks_solved`. Given the initial state, let's analyze the changes:

- `remaining_time` is 0 (unchanged).
- `subtasks_solved` is \(\min(\text{subtasks\_solved}, (n - complete\_tasks) * k)\) (unchanged).
- `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is unchanged.
- `subtask_time` is unchanged.
- `time_used` is unchanged.
- `max_points` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `points + subtasks_solved`.

Since the exact values of `points` and `subtasks_solved` are not specified, we express the new value of `max_points` in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`remaining_time` is 0, `subtasks_solved` is \(\min(\text{subtasks\_solved}, (n - complete\_tasks) * k)\), `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is unchanged, `subtask_time` is unchanged, `time_used` is unchanged, `max_points` is the maximum of `max_points` and `points + subtasks_solved`, `points` is unchanged.**
