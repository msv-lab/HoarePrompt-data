The code `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]` assigns the value of `dp[i][j - 1]` to `dp[i][j]`. Given that `i` is 1 and `j` is any value from 0 to \(M\), this assignment does not affect the overall structure or values of the `dp` list except for updating one specific cell.

Since `i` is specifically 1 and `j` is any value from 0 to \(M\), the only thing that changes is the value of `dp[1][j]`, which is now equal to `dp[1][j - 1]`.

The rest of the variables remain unchanged: `total` is 0, `i` is 1, `k` is at least 1, `M` is at least 1, `t` is a list of `k` integers in sorted order, and `dp` is a 2D list of dimensions \((k + 1) \times (M + 1)\) with all elements initialized to 0.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 1, `k` is at least 1, `M` is at least 1, `t` is a list of `k` integers in sorted order, `dp` is a 2D list of dimensions \((k + 1) \times (M + 1)\) with all elements initialized to 0, `dp[1][j]` equals `dp[1][j - 1]` for each j from 0 to M.**
