`remaining_time` is decreased by the product of `max_subtasks_for_this_task` and `subtask_time`. The values of `subtasks_solved`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task`, `subtask_time`, `time_used`, `max_points`, and `points` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`remaining_time` is reset - `max_subtasks_for_this_task` * `subtask_time`, `subtasks_solved` is 0, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is 0, `subtask_time` is the next valid element in `t`, `time_used` is reset, `max_points` remains unchanged, `points` remains unchanged.**
