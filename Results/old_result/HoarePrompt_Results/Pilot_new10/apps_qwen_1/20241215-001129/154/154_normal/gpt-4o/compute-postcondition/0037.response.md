Postcondition: **`remaining_time` is `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `subtasks_solved` is 0, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is 0, `subtask_time` is a valid element in the list `t`, `max_points` remains unchanged, `time_used` is `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `points` is `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, and `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`**
