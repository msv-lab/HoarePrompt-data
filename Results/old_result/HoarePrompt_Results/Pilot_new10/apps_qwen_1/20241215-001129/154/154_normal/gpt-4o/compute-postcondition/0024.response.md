The code subtracts `max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time` from `remaining_time`. However, the value of `subtask_time` is not given in the initial state. Since `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is 0, the expression `max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time` evaluates to 0. Therefore, `remaining_time` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`remaining_time` is 0, `subtasks_solved` is 4, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is 0**
