The code snippet sets `subtasks_solved` to the minimum value between its current value and \((n - complete_tasks) * k\). Let's break down the steps:

1. The initial state includes:
   - `remaining_time` is 0
   - `subtasks_solved` is the total number of subtasks that could be solved
   - `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is the last value of `max_subtasks_for_this_task` calculated
   - `subtask_time` is the last valid element in the list `t`
   - `time_used` is `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task + subtasks_solved * subtask_time`
   - `max_points` remains unchanged
   - `points` remains `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`

2. The code updates `subtasks_solved` to be the minimum of its current value and \((n - complete_tasks) * k\).

Since the exact values of `n`, `complete_tasks`, and `k` are not provided, let's denote them as follows:
- Let \( n \) be the total number of subtasks.
- Let \( complete_tasks \) be the number of complete tasks.
- Let \( k \) be the points increment per subtask.

Given these notations, the new value of `subtasks_solved` will be:
\[ subtasks_solved = \min(\text{subtasks\_solved}, (n - complete\_tasks) * k) \]

Therefore, the updated values of the variables are:
- `remaining_time` is still 0
- `subtasks_solved` is updated to the minimum of its current value and \((n - complete_tasks) * k\)
- `max_subtasks_for_this_task` remains unchanged
- `subtask_time` remains unchanged
- `time_used` remains unchanged since only `subtasks_solved` is updated, not `subtask_time` which is used in the calculation of `time_used`
- `max_points` remains unchanged
- `points` remains unchanged

Output State: **`remaining_time` is 0, `subtasks_solved` is \(\min(\text{subtasks\_solved}, (n - complete\_tasks) * k)\), `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is unchanged, `subtask_time` is unchanged, `time_used` is unchanged, `max_points` is unchanged, `points` is unchanged.**
