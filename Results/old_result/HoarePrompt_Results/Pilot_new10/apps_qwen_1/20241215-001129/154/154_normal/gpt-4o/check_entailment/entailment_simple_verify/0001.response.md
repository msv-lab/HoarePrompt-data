Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the provided annotated code, the original assessment is accurate. The annotated version clearly shows that the program correctly implements the logic to calculate the maximum number of points Polycarp can earn within the given time constraint. Each step of the program, from reading input to calculating the maximum points, is logically sound and aligns with the problem requirements. The annotated states confirm that the program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases as described. Therefore, there is no indication that the original assessment was inaccurate.
