The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `k`, `M`, and `t`. 

- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 45\).
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 45\).
- `M` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq M \leq 2 \times 10^9\).
- `t` is a list of `k` positive integers where \(1 \leq t_j \leq 1000000\) for \(1 \leq j \leq k\).

The function returns `max_points`, which is the maximum value of `points + subtasks_solved` obtained during the loop.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept parameters `n`, `k`, `M`, and `t`, and return the maximum value of `points + subtasks_solved` obtained during the loop.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `k`, `M`, and `t`, and returns `max_points`, which is the maximum value of `points + subtasks_solved` obtained during the loop.**
