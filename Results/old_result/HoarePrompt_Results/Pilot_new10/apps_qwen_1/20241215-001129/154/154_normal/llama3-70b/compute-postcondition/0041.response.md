The code `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]` updates the value of `dp[i][j]` to be the same as `dp[i][j - 1]`. This means that the value of `dp[i][j]` is now the same as the value it had before, which was equal to the maximum of its current value (which is the same as `dp[i][j]`) and `dp[i-1][j+1-t[i]] + 1`, and this update occurs if `j + 1` is greater than or equal to `t[i]`.

Since the code does not affect the value of `dp[i-1][j+1-t[i]] + 1` or `j + 1` being greater than or equal to `t[i]`, the condition for updating `dp[i][j+1]` remains the same. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`dp[i][j+1]` is equal to the maximum of its current value (which is the same as `dp[i][j]`) and `dp[i-1][j+1-t[i]] + 1`, `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, and the condition for updating `dp[i][j+1]` remains the same.**
