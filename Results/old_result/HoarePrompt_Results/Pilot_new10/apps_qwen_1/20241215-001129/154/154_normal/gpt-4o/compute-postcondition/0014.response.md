`remaining_time` is reduced by `max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time`. From the initial state, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `remaining_time // subtask_time`, and `subtasks_solved` is increased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`. After the code executes, `remaining_time` is updated to `remaining_time - (remaining_time // subtask_time) * subtask_time`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`remaining_time` is `remaining_time - (remaining_time // subtask_time) * subtask_time`, `subtasks_solved` is increased by `remaining_time // subtask_time`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `remaining_time // subtask_time`**
