The code initializes a 2D list `dp` where each row contains `M + 1` elements initialized to 0. The length of each row corresponds to `k + 1`. The values of `n`, `k`, `M`, and `t` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 45, `k` is an integer between 1 and 45, `M` is an integer between 0 and 2Â·10^9, `t` is a list of `k` integers in sorted order, `dp` is a 2D list of dimensions `(k + 1) x (M + 1)` with all elements initialized to 0**
