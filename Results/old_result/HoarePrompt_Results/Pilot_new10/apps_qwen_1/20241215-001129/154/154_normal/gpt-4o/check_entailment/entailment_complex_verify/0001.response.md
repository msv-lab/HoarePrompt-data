Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code aligns well with the problem description and the original assessment. The program correctly calculates the maximum number of points Polycarp can earn by completing tasks within the given time limit `M`. The logic in the `func_1` function is sound, iterating through possible numbers of fully completed tasks, calculating the remaining time, and determining how many additional subtasks can be completed within that time. The annotations accurately describe the state of the program at various points, confirming that the program handles all necessary calculations correctly. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being True is accurate.
