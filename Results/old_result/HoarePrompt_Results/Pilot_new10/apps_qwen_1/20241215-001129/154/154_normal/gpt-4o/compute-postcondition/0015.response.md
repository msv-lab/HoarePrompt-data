Postcondition: ***`remaining_time` is updated to `remaining_time - (remaining_time // subtask_time) * subtask_time`, `subtasks_solved` is increased by `remaining_time // subtask_time`, and `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is set to `remaining_time // subtask_time`. If `remaining_time < subtask_time`, no changes are made to `remaining_time` and `subtasks_solved`.***
