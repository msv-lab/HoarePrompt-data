Postcondition: ***`remaining_time` is adjusted according to the condition whether it is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`. If `remaining_time` >= `subtask_time`, `subtasks_solved` is increased by `remaining_time // subtask_time` from the previous iteration. If `remaining_time` is less than `subtask_time`, no change occurs to `subtasks_solved`. `subtask_time` remains unchanged, and `t` is a non-empty list. Additionally, if `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is 0, `subtasks_solved` is unchanged in the if part.***
