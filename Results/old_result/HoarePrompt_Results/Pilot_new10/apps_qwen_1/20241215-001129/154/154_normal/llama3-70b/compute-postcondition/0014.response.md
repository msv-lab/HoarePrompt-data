According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop continues as long as `j` is within the range from 1 to `M` inclusive.

At the end of the previous iteration, the given states are:
- `total` is 0
- `i` is 1
- `k` is at least 1
- `M` is at least 1
- `t` is a list of `k` integers in sorted order
- `dp` is a 2D list of dimensions \((k + 1) \times (M + 1)\) with all elements initialized to 0
- `j` is `M`

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Since the loop runs from 1 to `M` inclusive, the next value of `j` should be 1 if `j` was previously `M`.

So, the new state will be:
- `total` remains 0
- `i` remains 1
- `k` remains at least 1
- `M` remains at least 1
- `t` remains a list of `k` integers in sorted order
- `dp` remains a 2D list of dimensions \((k + 1) \times (M + 1)\) with all elements initialized to 0
- `j` becomes 1

State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 1, `k` is at least 1, `M` is at least 1, `t` is a list of `k` integers in sorted order, `dp` is a 2D list of dimensions \((k + 1) \times (M + 1)\) with all elements initialized to 0, `j` is 1**
