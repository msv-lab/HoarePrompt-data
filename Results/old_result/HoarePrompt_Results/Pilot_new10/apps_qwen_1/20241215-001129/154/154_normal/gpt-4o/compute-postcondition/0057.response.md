The code `break` does not change the values of any variables. It only exits the current loop or match-case statement. Since there is no loop or match-case statement in the given code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`remaining_time` is 0, `subtasks_solved` is \(\min(\text{subtasks\_solved}, (n - (\text{complete\_tasks} + 1)) * k)\), `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is unchanged, `subtask_time` is unchanged, `time_used` is `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `max_points` is the maximum of `max_points` and `points + \text{subtasks\_solved}`, `points` is unchanged.**
