Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements a dynamic programming solution to maximize the number of points Polycarp can earn within the given time constraint. The program sorts the subtask times and uses a DP table to keep track of the maximum points that can be earned for each possible combination of subtasks and remaining time. The final result is calculated by summing up the points from the DP table and adding the extra points for fully completed tasks.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the provided solution handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. There are no apparent edge cases or inputs that would cause the program to fail based on the logic implemented.
