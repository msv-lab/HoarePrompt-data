Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements a dynamic programming solution to maximize the number of points Polycarp can earn within M minutes. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes a DP table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum points that can be earned using the first `i` subtasks within `j` minutes.

2. **DP Transition**: For each subtask `i` and each possible time `j`, the program updates the DP table by considering whether to include the current subtask or not:
   - `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]`: This means skipping the current subtask.
   - `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1)`: This means including the current subtask, which adds one point and reduces the remaining time by `t[i - 1]`.

3. **Final Calculation**: The program calculates the total points by summing up the maximum points for each subtask and adding an extra point for completing each task.

4. **Time Complexity**: The solution efficiently handles the constraints (with `n, k` being at most 45 and `M` up to \(2 \times 10^9\)) by using dynamic programming.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to maximize the points Polycarp can earn. There are no obvious edge cases or potential issues that would cause the program to fail according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
