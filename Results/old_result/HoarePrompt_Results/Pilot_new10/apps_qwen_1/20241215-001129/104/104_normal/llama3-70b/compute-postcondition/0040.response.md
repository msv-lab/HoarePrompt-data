The code `print(max_erase)` simply prints the value of `max_erase`. This does not change the value of `max_erase` or any other variable. It only outputs the current value of `max_erase` to the console. Therefore, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of integers, `max_erase` is the maximum value of `j - i - 1` over all pairs `(i, j)` where `i` ranges from 0 to `n-1` and `j` ranges from `i+1` to `n` such that for all `k` in the range `[i, j)`, the condition `a[k] - a[i] == k - i` holds, `i` and `j` are the indices used during the last iteration of the loop that resulted in updating `max_erase`, and `max_erase` is printed.**
