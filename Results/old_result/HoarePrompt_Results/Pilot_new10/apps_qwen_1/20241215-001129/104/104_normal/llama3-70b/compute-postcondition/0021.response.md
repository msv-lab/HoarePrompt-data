The code `max_erase = max(max_erase, j - i - 1)` updates the value of `max_erase` to be the maximum of its current value and `j - i - 1`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1 and `j` is 3. Therefore, `j - i - 1` is `3 - 1 - 1`, which equals `1`.

Since `max_erase` is not initially defined, it is initialized to `1` (the value of `j - i - 1`). The other variables (`n`, `i`, `a`, and `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 1, `a` must have at least one element beyond index 1, `j` is 3, `max_erase` is 1**
