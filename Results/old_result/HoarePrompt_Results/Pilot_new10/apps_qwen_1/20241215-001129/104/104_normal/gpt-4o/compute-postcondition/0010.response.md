The code prints the value of `max_erase`. Since `max_erase` is not modified within the given code snippet, the value of `max_erase` remains unchanged after executing the print statement.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `max_erase` is the maximum of its original value and `a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1` for all `i` in the range 1 to `n-1`, the value of `max_erase` is printed.**
