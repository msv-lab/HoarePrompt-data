Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of integers where the condition `a[k] - a[i] == k - i` holds for all \( k \) in the range \([i, j)\) for some \( j \geq 3 \), `i` is 2, `max_erase` is the precomputed maximum value of \( j - i - 1 \) (updated to be the maximum of its current value and \( j - 3 \))***
