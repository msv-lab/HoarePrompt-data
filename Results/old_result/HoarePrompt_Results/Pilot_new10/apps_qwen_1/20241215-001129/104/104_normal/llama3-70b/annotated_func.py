#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer \( n \) (\( 1 \le n \le 100 \)) representing the number of elements in the array. The second line contains \( n \) integers \( a_i \) (\( 1 \le a_1 < a_2 < \ldots < a_n \le 1000 \)) representing the array written by Giraffe.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max_erase = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
            if all(a[k] - a[i] == k - i for k in range(i, j)):
                max_erase = max(max_erase, j - i - 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of integers, `max_erase` is the maximum value of `j - i - 1` over all pairs `(i, j)` where `i` ranges from 0 to `n-1` and `j` ranges from `i+1` to `n` such that for all `k` in the range `[i, j)`, the condition `a[k] - a[i] == k - i` holds, `i` and `j` are the indices used during the last iteration of the loop that resulted in updating `max_erase`.
    print(max_erase)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer \( n \) and an array of \( n \) integers from the input. It then iterates through all possible subarrays of the given array to find the longest subarray where the difference between each element and the starting element of the subarray is equal to the index difference. The function returns the length of the longest such subarray minus one.
