Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be greater than 2
   - `max_erase` is at least `a[1] - a[0] - 1 + (a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1)`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `n-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.

3. **Next Iteration Check:**
   - For the next iteration, `i` needs to be increased by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 3.
   - Since the loop condition checks if `i` is less than `n`, `n` must remain greater than 3 for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - `i` will be 3.
   - `n` must still be greater than 3.
   - The expression for `max_erase` does not change based on the value of `i` as long as it remains valid for the new value of `i`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `i` is 3
- `n` must be greater than 3
- `max_erase` remains at least `a[1] - a[0] - 1 + (a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1)`

State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `max_erase` is at least `a[1] - a[0] - 1 + (a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1)`**
