Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step.

### Given State:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 100.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `max_erase` is the maximum value of \( j - i - 1 \) where \( j \) ranges from \( i + 1 \) to \( n + 1 \) such that for all \( k \) in the range \([i, j)\), the condition \( a[k] - a[i] == k - i \) holds.
- `i` is 1.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization**: The variable `i` is initialized to 1.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop will iterate over `j` starting from `i + 1` (which is 2) up to `n`.

For the loop to execute, the following conditions must be met:
- `i` must be set to 1, which is already given.
- `j` must start from 2 and go up to `n`.

However, since `j` starts from `i + 1` and goes up to `n`, we need to ensure that there exists some valid `j` within this range for the loop to proceed.

3. **Range Check**:
   - The loop will check if there is a valid `j` such that \( j \geq i + 1 \).
   - This means \( j \) must be at least 2 and up to `n`.

4. **List and Index Validity**:
   - Since `j` must be within the bounds of the list `a`, `a` must have at least one element beyond index 1 (since `j` starts from 2).

### Final State Adjustment:
To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states as follows:
- Ensure `i` is 1.
- Ensure `n` is at least 2 (so that `j` can start from 2).
- Ensure the list `a` has at least one element beyond index 1.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 1, `a` must have at least one element beyond index 1**
