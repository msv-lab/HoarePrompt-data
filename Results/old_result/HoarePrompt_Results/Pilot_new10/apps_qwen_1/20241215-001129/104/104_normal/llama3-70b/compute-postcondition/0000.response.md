The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This integer represents the number of elements in the array. Since no specific value is provided for the input, the value of `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), as per the precondition.

The output state after executing this code is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive)**.
