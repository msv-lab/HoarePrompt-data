Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of integers where the condition `a[k] - a[i] == k - i` holds for all \( k \) in the range \([i, j)\) for some \( j \geq 3 \), `i` is 2, `max_erase` is the precomputed maximum value of \( j - i - 1 \), and the condition `all((a[k] - a[i] == k - i for k in range(i, j)))` is true**
