Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 100.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `i` is 2.
- `max_erase` is the maximum value of \( j - i - 1 \) where \( j \) ranges from \( i + 1 \) to \( n + 1 \) and the condition `a[k] - a[i] == k - i` holds for all \( k \) in the range \([i, j)\).

### Loop Condition:
The for loop iterates over `j` starting from `i + 1` up to `n + 1`.

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i` being 2. This is already set, so no adjustment needed here.

2. **Variable `j`:**
   - The loop will iterate over values of `j` starting from `i + 1`, which is 3.
   - Therefore, `j` must be at least 3 for the loop to start.

3. **List `a`:**
   - The list `a` should contain elements such that the condition `a[k] - a[i] == k - i` holds for all \( k \) in the range \([i, j)\).
   - Since `i` is 2, this means the condition must hold for `k = 3` to `k < j`.

4. **Variable `max_erase`:**
   - `max_erase` is precomputed as the maximum value of \( j - i - 1 \) where the condition holds. This value is already determined, so no adjustment is needed here.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to start executing, `j` must be at least 3. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect this.

### Final State:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 100.
- `a` is a list of integers where the condition `a[k] - a[i] == k - i` holds for all \( k \) in the range \([i, j)\) for some \( j \geq 3 \).
- `i` is 2.
- `max_erase` is the precomputed maximum value of \( j - i - 1 \).

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of integers where the condition `a[k] - a[i] == k - i` holds for all \( k \) in the range \([i, j)\) for some \( j \geq 3 \), `i` is 2, `max_erase` is the precomputed maximum value of \( j - i - 1 \)**
