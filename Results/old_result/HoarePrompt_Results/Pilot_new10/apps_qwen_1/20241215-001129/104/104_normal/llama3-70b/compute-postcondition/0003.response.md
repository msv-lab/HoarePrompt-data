State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers created from user input, `max_erase` is 0, `i` is 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop starts with `i` in the range defined by `n`.
2. For the loop to execute, `i` must be within the range `0 <= i < n`.
3. Given that `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), the smallest value for `n` is 1. Therefore, `i` should be 0 at the start of the loop to meet the condition `0 <= i < n`.
4. The initial state of `a` and `max_erase` does not affect whether the loop can execute, but they are provided as context. The loop will operate on `a` regardless of its initial content, and `max_erase` will be updated during the loop's execution.

Thus, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state such that `i` is 0, while `n` and `a` maintain their given conditions.
