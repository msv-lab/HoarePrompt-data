Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes. According to the problem description, we need to place \(k\) fishes in such a way that the expected value of the number of caught fishes is maximized. However, the current implementation simply calculates the minimum of \(k\) and the total number of valid scoop positions \((n - r + 1) \times (m - r + 1)\) and divides it by the same value. This does not account for the optimal placement of the fishes to maximize the expected number of caught fishes.

For example, consider the input:
```
3 3 2 3
```
The correct solution would place the fishes in the cells (2, 2), (2, 3), and (3, 2) or similar configurations to ensure that the scoop-net, regardless of its position, catches at least 2 fishes. The output should be 2.0, but the current program incorrectly outputs 2.0, which is the expected value but not the result of the optimal placement strategy.

Thus, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases.
