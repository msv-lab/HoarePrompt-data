The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k`. These parameters are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m), and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n*m, 10^5). The function also accepts a parameter `coverage(x, y)` which returns the number of positions the scoop-net would cover if its bottom-left corner is at cell (x, y).

The return value is `total_coverage` divided by (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept integers `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k`, calculate `total_coverage` using the `coverage(x, y)` function, and return the result of `total_coverage` divided by (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1).

Functionality: **The function accepts integers `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k`, and returns `total_coverage` divided by (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1).**
