The code `n, m, r, k = map(int, input().split())` reads four integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k`. Since the input is split and converted to integers, the initial conditions for these variables are no longer applicable, but the constraints still hold true.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r`, and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ `r` ≤ min(`n`, `m`), and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ min(`n` * `m`, 10^5)**
