The function `coverage` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`. Both `x` and `y` are integers. The function returns a computed value based on the formula `(min(x + 1, n - r + 1) - max(x - r + 1 + 1, 0)) * (min(y + 1, m - r + 1) - max(y - r + 1 + 1, 0))`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `coverage` is to accept two integers `x` and `y` and return a value calculated using the given formula.
