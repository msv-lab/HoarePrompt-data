#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, r, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m), and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n*m, 10^5). The function coverage(x, y) returns the number of positions the scoop-net would cover if its bottom-left corner is at cell (x, y).

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `r` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq r \leq \min(n, m)\), `k` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq k \leq \min(n*m, 10^5)\), `heap` is a list containing \(nm\) elements, each of the form `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` where `x` ranges from 0 to `n-1` and `y` ranges from 0 to `m-1`.
    total_coverage = 0
    for _ in range(k):
        cov, x, y = heapq.heappop(heap)
        
        total_coverage -= cov
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `k` is 0, `total_coverage` is the sum of all `-coverage(x, y)` values popped from the heap, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `r` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq r \leq \min(n, m)\), `heap` is an empty list, `cov` is the last `-coverage(x, y)` value popped from the heap, `x` is the last `x` coordinate popped from the heap, `y` is the last `y` coordinate popped from the heap.
    total_positions = (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)
    return total_coverage / total_positions
    #The program returns total_coverage divided by (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four integers `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k`, and performs the following operations: it creates a min-heap of tuples, each containing the negative coverage value and the coordinates `(x, y)`. It then pops `k` elements from the heap, updates the `total_coverage` by subtracting the negative coverage values, and finally returns the ratio of `total_coverage` to the total number of positions `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`.

def coverage(x, y):
    return (min(x + 1, n - r + 1) - max(x - r + 1 + 1, 0)) * (min(y + 1, m - r +
    1) - max(y - r + 1 + 1, 0))
    #`(min(x + 1, n - r + 1) - max(x - r + 1 + 1, 0)) * (min(y + 1, m - r + 1) - max(y - r + 1 + 1, 0))`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `coverage` accepts two integers `x` and `y` representing positions in a grid. It returns a computed value based on the formula \((\min(x + 1, n - r + 1) - \max(x - r + 2, 0)) \times (\min(y + 1, m - r + 1) - \max(y - r + 2, 0))\), where `n` and `m` are the dimensions of the grid, and `r` is a given radius. This value represents the coverage or area around the position `(x, y)` within the grid constraints.
