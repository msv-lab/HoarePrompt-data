You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: While Grisha was celebrating New Year with Ded Moroz, Misha gifted Sasha a small rectangular pond of size n × m, divided into cells of size 1 × 1, inhabited by tiny evil fishes (no more than one fish per cell, otherwise they'll strife!).

The gift bundle also includes a square scoop of size r × r, designed for fishing. If the lower-left corner of the scoop-net is located at cell (x, y), all fishes inside the square (x, y)...(x + r - 1, y + r - 1) get caught. Note that the scoop-net should lie completely inside the pond when used.

Unfortunately, Sasha is not that skilled in fishing and hence throws the scoop randomly. In order to not frustrate Sasha, Misha decided to release k fishes into the empty pond in such a way that the expected value of the number of caught fishes is as high as possible. Help Misha! In other words, put k fishes in the pond into distinct cells in such a way that when the scoop-net is placed into a random position among (n - r + 1)·(m - r + 1) possible positions, the average number of caught fishes is as high as possible.


-----Input-----

The only line contains four integers n, m, r, k (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m), 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n·m, 10^5)).


-----Output-----

Print a single number — the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes.

You answer is considered correct, is its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 9}. Namely, let your answer be a, and the jury's answer be b. Your answer is considered correct, if $\frac{|a - b|}{\operatorname{max}(1,|b|)} \leq 10^{-9}$.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3 2 3

Output
2.0000000000

Input
12 17 9 40

Output
32.8333333333



-----Note-----

In the first example you can put the fishes in cells (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3). In this case, for any of four possible positions of the scoop-net (highlighted with light green), the number of fishes inside is equal to two, and so is the expected value. [Image]
Program:
```
import heapq
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
(n, m, r, k) = map(int, input().split())
print(f'{func_1(n, m, r, k):.10f}')

def func_1(n, m, r, k):

    heap = []
    for x in range(n):
        for y in range(m):
            heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))
    total_coverage = 0
    for _ in range(k):
        (cov, x, y) = heapq.heappop(heap)
        total_coverage -= cov
    total_positions = (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)
    return total_coverage / total_positions

def coverage(x, y):
    return (min(x + 1, n - r + 1) - max(x - r + 1 + 1, 0)) * (min(y + 1, m - r + 1) - max(y - r + 1 + 1, 0))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program attempts to solve the problem by using a priority queue to store the coverage values of each cell and then selecting the top `k` cells with the highest coverage. However, this approach does not guarantee the optimal solution. The coverage function calculates the number of cells that can be affected by placing a fish in a specific cell, but the implementation of this function is incorrect.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3 3 2 3
```
The expected output should be 2.0000000000, which is the same as the provided output in the example. However, the program will incorrectly calculate the coverage for each cell and select the top `k` cells based on this incorrect coverage calculation.

Let's analyze the coverage function:
```python
def coverage(x, y):
    return (min(x + 1, n - r + 1) - max(x - r + 1 + 1, 0)) * (min(y + 1, m - r + 1) - max(y - r + 1 + 1, 0))
```

This function is incorrect because it does not properly calculate the number of cells that can be affected by placing a fish in cell `(x, y)`. Specifically, the subtraction and comparison operations in the `min` and `max` functions are incorrect. 

A correct implementation of the coverage function should be:
```python
def coverage(x, y):
    return (min(x + 1, n - r + 1) - max(x - r + 1, 0)) * (min(y + 1, m - r + 1) - max(y - r + 1, 0))
```

With this corrected coverage function, the program would correctly identify the best cells to place the fishes to maximize the expected number of caught fishes.

Since the provided program uses an incorrect coverage function, it cannot produce the correct result for all cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts four integers `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k`, and performs the following operations: it creates a min-heap of tuples, each containing the negative coverage value and the coordinates `(x, y)`. It then pops `k` elements from the heap, updates the `total_coverage` by subtracting the negative coverage values, and finally returns the ratio of `total_coverage` to the total number of positions `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`. 

Output hint for function_2: The function `coverage` accepts two integers `x` and `y` representing positions in a grid. It returns a computed value based on the formula \((\min(x + 1, n - r + 1) - \max(x - r + 2, 0)) \times (\min(y + 1, m - r + 1) - \max(y - r + 2, 0))\), where `n` and `m` are the dimensions of the grid, and `r` is a given radius. This value represents the coverage or area around the position `(x, y)` within the grid constraints. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
