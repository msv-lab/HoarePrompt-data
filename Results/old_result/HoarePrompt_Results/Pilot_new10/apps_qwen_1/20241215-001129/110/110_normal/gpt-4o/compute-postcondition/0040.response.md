Functionality: **The function accepts four integers `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k`, and performs the following operations: it creates a min-heap of tuples, each containing the negative coverage value and the coordinates `(x, y)`. It then pops `k` elements from the heap, updates the `total_coverage` by subtracting the negative coverage values, and finally returns the ratio of `total_coverage` to the total number of positions `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`.**
