Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly finds a value of `m` such that `n * m + 1` is not a prime number. The function `func_1` correctly identifies whether a number is prime according to the given logic. Since the problem guarantees that such an `m` exists for any input `n` within the specified range, the program will always find and print a valid `m`. The annotated version confirms that the program's logic aligns with the problem requirements and the original assessment.
