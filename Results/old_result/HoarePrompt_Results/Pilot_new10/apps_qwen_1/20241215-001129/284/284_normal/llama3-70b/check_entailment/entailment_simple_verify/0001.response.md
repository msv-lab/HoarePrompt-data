Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the provided annotated code, the original assessment is accurate. The annotated code clearly shows that the program correctly checks if a number is prime and finds a value of `m` such that `n * m + 1` is not a prime number. The `func_1` function correctly implements the primality test, and the main part of the program iterates through possible values of `m` to find a suitable one. The annotations confirm that the program will always find a valid `m` within the specified range, thus proving PolandBall's hypothesis incorrect. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is accurate.
