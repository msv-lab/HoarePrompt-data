State before the loop starts: `num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 1000\) and `num` is greater than or equal to 2.

For the loop to execute, we need to consider the following:

1. The variable `i` should start from 2 and go up to but not include `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`.
2. The value of `num` must be a valid input for the loop, meaning `num` must be greater than or equal to 2 (as given in the initial state).

Let's break down the requirements:

- The loop will start when `i` is set to 2.
- The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`.

Given this, we need to ensure that:

- `i` starts at 2.
- `i` can reach up to `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`.

Since `i` starts at 2, we don't need to adjust `i` itself, but we need to ensure that the upper limit of the loop (`int(num ** 0.5) + 1`) is a valid integer.

So, the key states to be adjusted are:

- `num` must be an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 1000\).
- `num` must be greater than or equal to 2.
- `i` starts at 2.
- The loop can proceed as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`.

The final state to be adjusted is:

State: **`num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 1000\) and `num` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, and the loop can proceed as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`**.
