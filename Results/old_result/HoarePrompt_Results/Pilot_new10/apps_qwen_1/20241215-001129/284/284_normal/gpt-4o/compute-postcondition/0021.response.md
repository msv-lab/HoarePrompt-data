Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer such that \(25 \leq x \leq 1000\), and \(x > 3\), and \(x\) is not divisible by 2 and \(x\) is not divisible by 3, and \(x \mod 5 \neq 0\), and \(x \mod 7 \neq 0\), and \(x \geq 121\). If \(x \% i == 0\) or \(x \% (i + 2) == 0\), the function returns False. If the condition is not met, the function does not return anything and the variable `i` is increased by 6.***
