The value of `i` is incremented by 6. According to the initial state, `x` meets several conditions and there is no change in `x` unless certain divisibility conditions are met. Since the code only increments `i`, the values of `x` and other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an integer such that \(25 \leq x \leq 1000\), and \(x > 3\), and \(x\) is not divisible by 2 and \(x\) is not divisible by 3, and \(x \mod 5 \neq 0\), and \(x \mod 7 \neq 0\), and \(x \geq 121\); and `i` is increased by 6.
