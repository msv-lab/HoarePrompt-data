Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `x` is an integer such that \(1 < x \leq 1000\), and \(x > 3\), and \(x\) is not divisible by 2 and \(x\) is not divisible by 3.
   - `i` is 5.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition is `i * i <= x`.

3. **Current Values:**
   - `i = 5`
   - `i * i = 5 * 5 = 25`

4. **Condition Evaluation:**
   - For the loop to execute, the condition `i * i <= x` must be true.
   - Given `i = 5`, we need `25 <= x` for the loop to execute.

5. **Adjusting the State:**
   - The current value of `x` is such that \(1 < x \leq 1000\) and \(x > 3\).
   - Additionally, \(x\) is not divisible by 2 and not divisible by 3.
   - To ensure the loop executes, `x` must be at least 25.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `x` must be at least 25.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`x` is an integer such that \(25 \leq x \leq 1000\), and \(x > 3\), and \(x\) is not divisible by 2 and \(x\) is not divisible by 3; `i` is 5**
