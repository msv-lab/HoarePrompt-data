Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic required to find a counterexample for PolandBall's hypothesis. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n` from the input, which represents the value from PolandBall's hypothesis.
   
2. **Loop Through Possible Values of `m`**: The program iterates through values of `m` from 1 to 1000. For each value of `m`, it calculates `n * m + 1`.

3. **Prime Check Function (`func_1`)**: 
   - The function `func_1` checks if a given number `x` is a prime number.
   - It handles special cases for small values (less than or equal to 3).
   - It uses a more efficient method to check for primality for larger values (greater than 3) by checking divisibility up to the square root of `x` and skipping even numbers and multiples of 3.

4. **Output the Counterexample**: Once the function `func_1` returns `False` for some `m * n + 1`, the program prints `m` and breaks out of the loop.

5. **Guaranteed Existence of Counterexample**: Since it is guaranteed that there exists an `m` such that `n * m + 1` is not a prime number (as per the problem statement), the program will always find and print such an `m`.

### Why It Meets the Problem Description:
- The program correctly reads an integer `n` as input.
- It checks each value of `m` from 1 to 1000 to see if `n * m + 1` is a prime number using the `func_1` function.
- If `n * m + 1` is found to be composite (non-prime), the program outputs the corresponding `m` and stops further computation.
- The program guarantees to find and output at least one valid `m` within the specified range (1 to 1000).

Given these points, the program adheres to the requirements of the problem description and is thus correct.
