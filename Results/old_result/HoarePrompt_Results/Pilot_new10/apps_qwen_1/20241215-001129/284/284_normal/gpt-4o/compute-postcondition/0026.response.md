Let's analyze the given annotated code step by step to determine the actual functionality of the function.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initial State**:
   - `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 1000\).

2. **First Condition**:
   - `if (x <= 1)`:
     - If `x` is 1 or less, the function returns `False`.
     - This covers the range \(1 \leq x \leq 1\).
   - After this condition, `x` must be in the range \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\).

3. **Second Condition**:
   - `if (x <= 3)`:
     - If `x` is 2 or 3, the function returns `True`.
     - This covers the range \(2 \leq x \leq 3\).
   - After this condition, `x` must be in the range \(4 \leq x \leq 1000\).

4. **Third Condition**:
   - `if (x % 2 == 0 or x % 3 == 0)`:
     - If `x` is divisible by 2 or 3, the function returns `False`.
     - This eliminates multiples of 2 and 3 from further consideration.
   - After this condition, `x` must be in the range \(4 \leq x \leq 1000\) and not divisible by 2 or 3.

5. **Prime Check Loop**:
   - `i = 5` and the loop runs while `i * i <= x`:
     - For each `i`, if `x` is divisible by `i` or `i + 2`, the function returns `False`.
     - This checks divisibility by numbers of the form `6k ± 1` (i.e., numbers not divisible by 2 or 3).
   - After the loop, if no divisors are found, the function returns `True`.
   - This covers the range \(4 \leq x \leq 1000\) and ensures that `x` is a prime number greater than or equal to 25.

### Summary of Functionality

- The function `func_1` accepts an integer `x` in the range \(1 \leq x \leq 1000\).
- It returns `False` for all values from 1 to 3 (inclusive) and for any number that is divisible by 2 or 3.
- For numbers greater than 3 and not divisible by 2 or 3, the function checks if `x` is a prime number using a loop that checks divisibility by numbers of the form `6k ± 1`.
- If `x` passes all these checks, it is determined to be a prime number and the function returns `True`.

### Functionality:

**The function accepts an integer `x` in the range \(1 \leq x \leq 1000\) and returns `False` if `x` is 1, 2, 3, or divisible by 2 or 3. For other values, it returns `True` if `x` is a prime number greater than or equal to 25.**
