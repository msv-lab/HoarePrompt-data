Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the program correctly implements the logic to find a counterexample for PolandBall's hypothesis. The `func_1` function accurately checks if a number is prime, and the main part of the program iterates over possible values of `m` until it finds a non-prime number of the form `n * m + 1`. Since the annotations align with the original program's functionality and the problem description, the original assessment is accurate.
