`temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `temp_counter` was `2 * n + 1`, so the new value of `temp_counter` is `(2 * n + 1) + 1 = 2 * n + 2`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`examples[i]` is `2 * n + 1`, `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 2`, `str(2 * n)` is in `files_set`, `str(2 * n + 1)` is in `files_set` if the loop stopped at `2 * n + 1`, `moves` contains the strings `'move {str(2 * n + 1)} {2 * n + 1}'`, `f'move {examples[i]} {temp_counter}'`**
