To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop statement.

Given:
- `script` is a list containing the commands to move each file in `examples` to its corresponding position based on the iteration count.
- `i` is the total number of files in `examples`.
- `examples` is a list of the first elements of tuples from `files` where the second element of each tuple is equal to 1.
- `regular` remains unchanged as no operations are performed on it within the loop.
- The loop starts with `i` set to the length of `examples` + 1.

The loop statement:
```
for (i, file) in enumerate(regular, start=len(examples) + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Initialization**:
   - The `enumerate` function will start the enumeration at `start=len(examples) + 1`.
   - Therefore, the first value of `i` will be `len(examples) + 1`.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will continue as long as there are elements in the `regular` list that can be enumerated starting from `len(examples) + 1`.

3. **State Adjustments**:
   - To ensure the loop starts correctly, we need to ensure that the starting value of `i` is valid.
   - Since the loop starts at `len(examples) + 1`, we need to confirm that `len(examples) + 1` is a valid starting point.
   - Additionally, the `regular` list should contain at least one element to allow the loop to start.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute, `len(examples) + 1` must be a valid starting point, and the `regular` list must have at least one element. 

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

**State:**
- `script` is a list containing the commands to move each file in `examples` to its corresponding position based on the iteration count.
- `i` is the total number of files in `examples`.
- `examples` is a list of the first elements of tuples from `files` where the second element of each tuple is equal to 1.
- `regular` is a non-empty list with at least one element.
- The starting value of `i` is `len(examples) + 1`.

So, the final state is:

**State: **`script` is a list containing the commands to move each file in `examples` to its corresponding position based on the iteration count, `i` is the total number of files in `examples`, `examples` is a list of the first elements of tuples from `files` where the second element of each tuple is equal to 1, `regular` is a non-empty list with at least one element, `i` is `len(examples) + 1`.**
