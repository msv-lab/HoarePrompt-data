The code appends a new string to the `script` list. The string is formatted to include the variable `file` and the value of `i`. Since `i` is defined as `len(examples) + N + 3`, the new string added to `script` will be `'move {file} len(examples) + N + 3'`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is `len(examples) + N + 3`, `regular` must have at least `len(examples) + N + 3` elements, and `script` contains the strings `['move {file} {i}']`**
