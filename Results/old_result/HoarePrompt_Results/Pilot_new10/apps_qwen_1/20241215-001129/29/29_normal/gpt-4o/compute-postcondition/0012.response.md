`regulars.append(name)` appends the value of `name` to the list `regulars`. Since `name` is the first part of the first file name in the `files` list, and `regulars` is either an empty list or a list containing the first part of the first file name in the `files` list, appending `name` will result in `regulars` being a list containing the first part of the first file name repeated. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of files minus one; `files` is a list of strings that must contain at least one element; `regulars` is a list containing the first part of the first file name in the `files` list (repeated); `examples` is either an empty list or a list containing the name of the file; `file` is the first element in the updated `files` list; `name` is the first part of `file` after splitting; `type_` is the second part of `file` after splitting.**
