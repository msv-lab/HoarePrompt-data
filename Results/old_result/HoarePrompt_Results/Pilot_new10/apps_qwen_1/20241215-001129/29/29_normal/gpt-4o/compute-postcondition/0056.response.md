To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition of the `while` loop:

```python
while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions were true:
- `i` is `i + 1`
- `examples[i]` is not equal to `str(i + 1)`
- `temp_counter` is set to a value less than or equal to `2 * n` plus 1
- `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set` must still be true.

Let's analyze each part of the condition:

1. **Condition 1: `temp_counter <= 2 * n`**
   - The current value of `temp_counter` must satisfy this condition for the loop to continue.

2. **Condition 2: `str(temp_counter) in files_set`**
   - The string representation of `temp_counter` must be in the `files_set` for the loop to continue.

Given that these conditions need to hold true for the loop to proceed, we need to ensure that:
- `temp_counter` is still less than or equal to `2 * n`.
- `str(temp_counter)` is still in `files_set`.

Since `temp_counter` was already set to a value less than or equal to `2 * n` plus 1, and `str(temp_counter)` was in `files_set`, we need to ensure these conditions remain valid for the next iteration. 

Therefore, the state adjustment required is:
- `temp_counter` must be such that `temp_counter <= 2 * n`.
- `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`.

The value of `i` and the condition `examples[i]` is not equal to `str(i + 1)` do not affect the loop continuation directly, so they do not need to be adjusted.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`temp_counter` must be less than or equal to 2 * n and `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`**
