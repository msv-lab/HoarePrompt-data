`temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The value of `temp_counter` was the largest integer such that `temp_counter` <= 2 * n and `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`. After incrementing, `temp_counter` is now `temp_counter + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 1`, `regulars[i]` is updated to `str(temp_counter + 1)`, `regulars` contains at least one element, `target` is `len(examples) + i + 1`, `files_set` is unchanged, `moves` now includes the appended string `'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter + 1}'`.**
