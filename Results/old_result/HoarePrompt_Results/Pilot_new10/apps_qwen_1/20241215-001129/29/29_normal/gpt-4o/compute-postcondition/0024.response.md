Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - `examples` has at least one element.
   - The initial value of `i` is 0.
   - The current value of `examples[i]` is not equal to `str(i + 1)`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `temp_counter <= 2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`.

3. **Objective:**
   - To ensure the loop can execute at least once, we need to adjust the states such that the condition `temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set` is satisfied when the loop starts.

4. **Analysis:**
   - The loop will execute at least once if there exists a `temp_counter` such that both conditions (`temp_counter <= 2 * n` and `str(temp_counter) in files_set`) are true.

5. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - Since `i` is initially 0 and `examples[i]` is not equal to `str(i + 1)`, we know that `examples[0]` is not equal to `'1'`.
   - We need to ensure that `temp_counter` can be set to a value that satisfies both conditions within the first iteration of the loop.

Given the constraints, let's assume the smallest possible value for `temp_counter` that could satisfy the condition:

- If `temp_counter` is set to 1 (the smallest positive integer), then we need to ensure that `1` is in `files_set` and `1 <= 2 * n`.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `temp_counter` should be set to 1, and `1` should be in `files_set`.
   - Additionally, `2 * n` should be large enough to allow `temp_counter` to reach 1 within the loop.

Therefore, the state before the loop should be adjusted to include these conditions:

State: **`examples` has at least one element, the initial value of `i` is 0, the current value of `examples[i]` is not equal to '1', `temp_counter` is 1, and `1` is in `files_set`**
