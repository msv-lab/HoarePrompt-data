`temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Initially, `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 1`, so after incrementing, its value becomes `2 * n + 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`examples` has at least one element, the initial value of `i` is 0, the current value of `examples[i]` is `str(2 * n + 1)`, `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 2`, `str(2 * n)` is in `files_set`, `moves` contains the string `'move {str(2 * n + 1)} {2 * n + 1}'`**
