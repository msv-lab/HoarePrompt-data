The code `files.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)` sorts the list `files` based on the second element of each tuple (which is `type_`) in descending order. This means the list `files` is now sorted such that the tuples with higher `type_` values come first.

Since the initial state of `files` is a list containing `n` tuples, and each tuple contains a string `name` and an integer `type_`, after sorting, the output state is:

- `files` is a list of `n` tuples, sorted in descending order based on the `type_` value of each tuple.

Output State: **`files` is a list of `n` tuples, sorted in descending order based on the `type_` value of each tuple.**
