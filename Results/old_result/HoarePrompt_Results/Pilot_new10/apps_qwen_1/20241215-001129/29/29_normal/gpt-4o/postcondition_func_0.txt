The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of files) and `files` (a list of strings, where each string represents a file with its name and type in the format "name type", and "type" is either "1" indicating an example test or "0" indicating a regular test). The function reorders the files such that example tests (`type='1'`) are placed at indices `1` to `n` and regular tests (`type='0'`) are placed at indices `n+1` to `2*n`. It returns a list of move commands needed to achieve this ordering. If a file needs to be moved more than once, the function ensures it only moves the file to the correct position in one move. If a file cannot be moved to its target position, the function will find the next available slot.
