Let's break down the conditions and the requirements for the loop to execute at least once.

1. The loop condition is `temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set`.
2. We need to ensure that at least one of these conditions is met when the loop starts.

Given the current state:
- `examples[i]` is not equal to `str(i + 2)`
- `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 2`
- `str(2 * n)` is in `files_set`
- `moves` contains the strings `'move {str(2 * n + 1)} {2 * n + 1}'` and `f'move {examples[i]} {i + 1}'`

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition 1: `temp_counter <= 2 * n`**
   - Current `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 2`.
   - For this condition to be false (which means the loop should start), we need `2 * n + 2 > 2 * n`, which is always true.
   - Therefore, no adjustment is needed for this part.

2. **Condition 2: `str(temp_counter) in files_set`**
   - Current `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 2`.
   - We need `str(2 * n + 2)` to be in `files_set` for the loop to execute.
   - Currently, `str(2 * n)` is in `files_set`, but not necessarily `str(2 * n + 2)`.
   - To ensure the loop executes, `str(2 * n + 2)` must be in `files_set`.

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs to be adjusted is to ensure that `str(2 * n + 2)` is in `files_set`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`examples[i]` is not equal to `str(i + 2)`, `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 2`, `str(2 * n)` is in `files_set`, and `str(2 * n + 2)` must be in `files_set`, and `moves` contains the strings `'move {str(2 * n + 1)} {2 * n + 1}'` and `f'move {examples[i]} {i + 1}'`**
