`temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `temp_counter` was less than or equal to `2 * n`, so now it is `temp_counter + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `i + 1`, `examples[i]` is not equal to `str(i + 1)`, `temp_counter` is set to a value less than or equal to `2 * n` plus 1 and `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `examples[i]` is not equal to `str(i + 1)`, `temp_counter` is set to a value less than or equal to `2 * n` plus 1 and `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`**
