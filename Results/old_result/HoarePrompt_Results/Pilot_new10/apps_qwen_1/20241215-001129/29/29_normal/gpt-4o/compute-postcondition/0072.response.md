Let's analyze the given state and the `while` loop condition step by step.

### Given State:
- `regulars` contains at least one element.
- `target` is `len(examples) + i + 1`.
- The current value of `regulars[i]` is not equal to the string representation of `target`.

### While Loop Condition:
```
while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Condition Breakdown:**
   - `temp_counter <= 2 * n`: This condition checks if `temp_counter` is within a certain range.
   - `str(temp_counter) in files_set`: This condition checks if the string representation of `temp_counter` is in the `files_set`.

2. **Initial State and Conditions:**
   - We need to ensure that the loop can execute at least once. For this, `temp_counter` must satisfy both conditions within the first iteration.
   - Since we don't have any information about the initial value of `temp_counter`, we assume it starts from a value that needs adjustment to meet the conditions.

3. **Required Adjustments:**
   - To ensure `temp_counter` is within the range `temp_counter <= 2 * n`, `temp_counter` must be a valid integer.
   - To ensure `str(temp_counter) in files_set`, `temp_counter` must be a value that exists in `files_set`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since we do not have the exact initial value of `temp_counter`, we cannot determine if it already meets the conditions. However, we know that for the loop to execute at least once, `temp_counter` must be set to a value that satisfies both conditions.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `temp_counter` is within the range and is present in `files_set`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`regulars` contains at least one element, `target` is `len(examples) + i + 1`, the current value of `regulars[i]` is not equal to the string representation of `target`, and `temp_counter` must be set to a value such that `temp_counter <= 2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`**.

However, since we only need to provide the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, the relevant adjustment is:

State: **`temp_counter` must be set to a value such that `temp_counter <= 2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`**.
