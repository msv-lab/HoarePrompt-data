The code `moves.append(f'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}')` appends a formatted string to the list `moves`. The string includes the value of `regulars[i]` and `temp_counter`. The variables `files_set`, `regulars`, `target`, `n`, and `i` are not affected by this operation.

- `temp_counter` remains the largest integer such that `temp_counter` <= 2 * n and `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`.
- `regulars` remains unchanged.
- `moves` gets updated by appending the formatted string to the existing list.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is the largest integer such that `temp_counter` <= 2 * n and `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`; `regulars` contains at least one element; `target` is `len(examples) + i + 1`; `files_set` is unchanged; `moves` now includes the appended string `'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}'`.**
