The code initializes an empty list named `examples`. This does not affect the value of `n` or the contents of the `files` list. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of files, and `files` is a list of strings where each string represents a file with its name and type in the format "name type", and "type" is either "1" indicating an example test or "0" indicating a regular test; `examples` is an empty list.**
