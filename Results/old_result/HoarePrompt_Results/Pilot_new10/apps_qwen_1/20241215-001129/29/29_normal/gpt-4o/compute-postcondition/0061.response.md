The code appends a string to the list `moves` with the format `'move {examples[i]} {temp_counter}'`. However, the initial values of `examples[i]` and `temp_counter` are not specified in the initial state. Let's denote `examples[i]` as `example_value` and `temp_counter` as `temp_counter_value`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `moves.append(f'move {examples[i]} {temp_counter}')` appends a formatted string to the `moves` list.
2. `example_value` remains unchanged as the function does not modify its value.
3. `temp_counter_value` also remains unchanged as the function does not modify its value.
4. The new string is added to the `moves` list.

Since the exact values of `examples[i]` and `temp_counter` are not provided, we represent them as placeholders. The output state includes the updated value of the `moves` list and the unchanged values of `examples[i]` and `temp_counter`.

Output State: **`moves` contains 'move example_value temp_counter_value', `examples[i]` is `example_value`, `temp_counter` is `temp_counter_value`**
