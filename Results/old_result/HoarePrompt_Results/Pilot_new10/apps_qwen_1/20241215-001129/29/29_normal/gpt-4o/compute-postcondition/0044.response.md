`temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The value of `temp_counter` was previously less than or equal to `2 * n`. Since it is incremented by 1, it remains less than or equal to `2 * n`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`examples[i]` is not equal to `str(i + 2)`, `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`, `str(2 * n)` is in `files_set`, `str(2 * n + 2)` is in `files_set`, and `moves` contains the strings `'move {str(2 * n + 1)} {2 * n + 1}'` and `f'move {examples[i]} {i + 1}'`**
