To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze how the loop modifies the variables and conditions under which the loop continues.

### Analysis:

1. **Initial Conditions**:
   - `examples[i]` is not equal to `str(i + 1)`.
   - If `examples[i]` is `2 * n + 1`, then:
     - `temp_counter` becomes `2 * n + 2`.
     - `str(2 * n)` and `str(2 * n + 1)` are added to `files_set`.
     - `moves` contains the strings `'move {str(2 * n + 1)} {2 * n + 1}'` and `f'move {examples[i]} {i + 1}'`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over `i` from `0` to `len(examples) - 1`.

3. **State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `examples[i]` is not equal to `str(i + 1)`.
   - If `examples[i]` was `2 * n + 1`, then:
     - `temp_counter` is updated to `2 * n + 2`.
     - `str(2 * n)` and `str(2 * n + 1)` are added to `files_set`.
     - `moves` contains the specified strings.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the next iteration, `i` will increase by 1.
   - The loop will continue if `i < len(examples)`.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since the condition `examples[i] != str(i + 1)` is evaluated at the beginning of each iteration, and `i` increases by 1, the new value of `i` will be checked against `len(examples)`.
   - If `i` is still within the range of `examples`, the loop will continue.
   - If `i` reaches the length of `examples`, the loop will terminate.

### Conclusion:

- `i` will be increased by 1.
- If `i` is less than `len(examples)`, the loop will continue.
- The new state for the start of the next iteration will be:
  - `i` is `i + 1`.
  - `examples[i]` is not equal to `str(i + 1)`.
  - If `examples[i]` is `2 * n + 1`, then:
    - `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 2`.
    - `str(2 * n)` and `str(2 * n + 1)` are in `files_set`.
    - `moves` contains the specified strings.

Given this, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `examples[i]` is not equal to `str(i + 1)`. If `examples[i]` is `2 * n + 1`, then `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 2`, `str(2 * n)` and `str(2 * n + 1)` are in `files_set`, and `moves` contains the strings `'move {str(2 * n + 1)} {2 * n + 1}'` and `f'move {examples[i]} {i + 1}'`. If `examples[i]` is not `2 * n + 1`, no changes are made to the variables, and `moves` contains the initial two strings.**
