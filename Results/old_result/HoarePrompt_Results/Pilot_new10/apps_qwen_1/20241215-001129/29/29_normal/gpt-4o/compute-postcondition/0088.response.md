Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `regulars` contains at least one element.
   - `target` is `len(examples) + i + 1`.
   - `temp_counter` is unchanged.
   - `files_set` is unchanged.
   - `moves` is unchanged.

2. **While Loop Condition:**
   ```python
   while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop continues as long as `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`.
   - For the loop to execute at least one more time, we need to ensure that both conditions hold true for the next iteration:
     - `temp_counter` should be less than or equal to `2 * n`.
     - `str(temp_counter)` should be in `files_set`.

4. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - Since `temp_counter` is unchanged, it must already satisfy the condition `temp_counter <= 2 * n` or be just below it (i.e., `temp_counter < 2 * n`).
   - We need to ensure that `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`.

Given that `temp_counter` is unchanged and we want the loop to execute one more time, we only need to ensure that `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`.

Therefore, the state right before the loop needs to be adjusted to ensure that `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`.

**State:**
State: **`regulars` contains at least one element, `target` is `len(examples) + i + 1`, `temp_counter` is unchanged, `files_set` must contain `str(temp_counter)`, `moves` is unchanged**
