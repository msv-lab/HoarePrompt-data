Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 3`
   - `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n`
   - `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`.
- `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`.

Since `temp_counter` is incremented by 3 in each iteration (from the condition `temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 3`), the new value of `temp_counter` must still satisfy both conditions for the next iteration.

3. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `temp_counter` is increased by 3 in each iteration, the next value of `temp_counter` would be `temp_counter + 3`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `temp_counter + 3` must still be less than or equal to `2 * n`.
   - Additionally, `str(temp_counter + 3)` must be in `files_set`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect these conditions.

**Final State:**
- `temp_counter` must be such that `temp_counter + 3` is less than or equal to `2 * n`.
- `str(temp_counter + 3)` must be in `files_set`.

State: **`temp_counter` must be such that `temp_counter + 3` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and `str(temp_counter + 3)` is in `files_set`**
