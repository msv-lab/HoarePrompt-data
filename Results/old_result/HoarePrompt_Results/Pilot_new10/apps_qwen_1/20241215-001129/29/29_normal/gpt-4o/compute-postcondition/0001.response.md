The code `regulars = []` creates an empty list named `regulars`. This does not affect the values of `n` or `files`, and it leaves `examples` as an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of files, `files` is a list of strings where each string represents a file with its name and type in the format "name type", and "type" is either "1" indicating an example test or "0" indicating a regular test; `regulars` is an empty list, `examples` is an empty list.**
