To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions under which the loop continues:

The loop condition is:
```python
while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
```

This means the loop will continue as long as:
1. `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n`
2. The string representation of `temp_counter` is in `files_set`

Let's break down the given states and the loop condition:

- `regulars` contains at least one element: This state does not affect the loop continuation, so no change is needed here.
- `target` is `len(examples) + i + 1`: This state is not directly related to the loop condition, so no change is needed here.
- `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 1`: For the loop to continue, `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`. Given that `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 1`, it already exceeds `2 * n`, so the first part of the loop condition is false. Therefore, `temp_counter` needs to be adjusted to be less than or equal to `2 * n`.
- `files_set` remains unchanged: The presence of `str(temp_counter)` in `files_set` is crucial. Since `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 1`, `str(2 * n + 1)` must be in `files_set` for the loop to continue. Therefore, `files_set` must contain `str(2 * n + 1)`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `temp_counter` to be within the range and ensure `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`.

State: **`regulars` contains at least one element, `target` is `len(examples) + i + 1`, `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`, and `files_set` must contain `str(temp_counter)`**
