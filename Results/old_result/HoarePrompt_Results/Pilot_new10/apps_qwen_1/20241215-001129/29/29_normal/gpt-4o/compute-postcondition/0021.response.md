`temp_counter` is assigned the value of `n + 1`. The value of `n` is an integer representing the number of files, so `temp_counter` is an integer that is one more than `n`. The states of the other variables (`files`, `regulars`, `examples`, and `moves`) are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of files, `files` is an empty list, `regulars` is a list containing the names of all files with type '0', `examples` is a list containing the names of all files with type '1', `moves` is an empty list, `temp_counter` is `n + 1`**
