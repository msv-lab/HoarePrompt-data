Let's analyze the loop and its effects on the variables step by step.

### Initial State
- `i` is `i + 1`
- `examples[i]` is not equal to `str(i + 1)`
- If `examples[i]` is `2 * n + 1`, then:
  - `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 2`
  - `str(2 * n)` and `str(2 * n + 1)` are in `files_set`
  - `moves` contains the strings `'move {str(2 * n + 1)} {2 * n + 1}'` and `f'move {examples[i]} {i + 1}'`
- If `examples[i]` is not `2 * n + 1`, no changes are made to the variables, and `moves` contains the initial two strings.

### Loop Code
```python
while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
    temp_counter += 1
```

### Observations from Provided Output States
1. After the loop executes 1 time:
   - `temp_counter` is set to a value less than or equal to `2 * n` plus 1 and `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`.
2. After the loop executes 2 times:
   - `temp_counter` is incremented by 1, it must be less than or equal to `2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`.
3. After the loop executes 3 times:
   - `temp_counter` is incremented by 2, it must be less than or equal to `2 * n`, and `str(temp_counter + 1)` must be in `files_set`.

From these observations, we can deduce that each iteration of the loop increments `temp_counter` by 1 until `temp_counter` exceeds `2 * n` or `str(temp_counter)` is no longer in `files_set`.

### Final Analysis
Since the loop continues to increment `temp_counter` until `temp_counter` exceeds `2 * n` or `str(temp_counter)` is no longer in `files_set`, the final value of `temp_counter` will be the smallest value greater than `2 * n` such that `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`. 

Given this, the loop will terminate when `temp_counter` is just beyond the largest value where `str(temp_counter)` is still in `files_set`.

### Output State
After all the iterations of the loop have executed, the state will be:
- `i` remains `i + 1`
- `examples[i]` is not equal to `str(i + 1)`
- `temp_counter` is the smallest value greater than `2 * n` such that `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`
- No other variables are affected by the loop.

Thus, the output state is:
Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `examples[i]` is not equal to `str(i + 1)`, `temp_counter` is the smallest value greater than `2 * n` such that `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`**
