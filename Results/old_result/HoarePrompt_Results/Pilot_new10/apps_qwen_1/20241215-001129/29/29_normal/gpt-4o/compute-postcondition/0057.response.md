`temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The initial condition that `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to 2 * n and `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set` remains valid. Therefore, the updated state is that `temp_counter` is now one more than its original value, while the conditions on `n` and `files_set` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 1`, `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to 2 * n and `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`**
