Postcondition: ***`regulars` contains at least one element, `target` is `len(examples) + i + 1`. If `regulars[i]` is not equal to `str(target)`, then `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and `str(temp_counter - 1)` is in `files_set`. Since there is no else part, these conditions remain unchanged regardless of the if condition's outcome.***
