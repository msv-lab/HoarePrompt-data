Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where there are no example tests. In such a scenario, the `examples` list will remain empty, and the program will incorrectly attempt to rename files starting from the next available number after `2 * n`. This can lead to incorrect renaming if there are regular tests that need to be placed in positions less than `e + 1`.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
100 0
200 0
300 0
```

The program should rename the files to:
```
100 1
200 2
300 3
```

However, the current implementation will fail to handle this correctly because it starts renaming from a number greater than `3`, leading to incorrect file renaming.
