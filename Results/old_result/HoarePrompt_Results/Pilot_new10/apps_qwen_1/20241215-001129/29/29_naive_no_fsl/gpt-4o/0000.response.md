Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical issue when handling the renaming process. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not ensure that all examples are placed in the first positions correctly and that all regular tests are placed in subsequent positions without gaps. 

Consider the following input:

```
3
1 0
2 1
3 0
```

The expected output would be:
```
4
move 1 3
move 2 1
move 3 2
move 1 1
```

However, the current implementation might fail to handle such cases properly. Here's why:

1. The function `func_1` tries to place examples and regular tests into their respective positions but may not always achieve the correct ordering due to the way it handles the `temp_counter`.

2. The `temp_counter` is used to find available positions for renaming, but it might not correctly identify the positions for both examples and regular tests.

To fix this, the function needs to ensure that all examples are placed in the first positions and all regular tests are placed in subsequent positions without any gaps. This requires a more careful handling of the renaming process to ensure that the correct positions are assigned to each file type.
