Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the tournament rule described in the problem. The function `func()` calculates the maximum number of games using the bit length of `n` minus one, which does not take into account the specific pairing rule for the matches. 

For example, consider the case when `n = 4`. According to the problem description, the correct maximum number of games the winner can play is 2. However, the code would incorrectly return `max_games = 2.bit_length() - 1 = 1`, which is wrong. The correct implementation should ensure that the winner can play against players who have played either the same or one fewer game, ensuring the rule is followed throughout the tournament.

To correctly solve this problem, the code needs to dynamically pair players according to the given rule and ensure the winner can play the maximum number of games possible under these constraints.
