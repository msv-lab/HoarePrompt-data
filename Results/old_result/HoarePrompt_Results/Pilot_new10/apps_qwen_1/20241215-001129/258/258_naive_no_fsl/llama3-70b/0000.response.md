Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program attempts to solve the problem by iterating over a discrete grid of points (-1000 to 1000) and calculating the time required for each point. However, this approach is flawed because it only considers integer coordinates and does not account for real number coordinates as specified in the problem description. 

For instance, consider the following input:
```
4 3
-1 0 3
0 0 3
1 0 2
1 1 40
```

The optimal solution requires a real number coordinate, specifically \((-0.2, 0)\), as mentioned in the sample output. The current implementation would not find this optimal solution because it only checks integer coordinates. Therefore, the program does not handle the problem description correctly for every potential case.
