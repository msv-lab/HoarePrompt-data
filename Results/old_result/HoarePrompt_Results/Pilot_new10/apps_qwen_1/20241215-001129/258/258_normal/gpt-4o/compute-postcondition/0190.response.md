Postcondition: ***`i` is `i_end + 2`, `N` is greater than `i_end + 2`, `count` is updated based on the condition `c * math.sqrt((mx - x)`. If `c1 * T < c2 * T`, `x1` remains the original value of `x2`, `y1` remains the original value of `y2`, `c1` remains the original value of `c2`, `x2` remains the original value of `x1`, `y2` remains the original value of `y1`, and `c2` remains the original value of `c1`. Otherwise, no changes are made to these variables.***
