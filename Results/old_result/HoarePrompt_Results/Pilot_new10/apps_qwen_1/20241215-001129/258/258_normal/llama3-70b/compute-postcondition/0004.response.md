The `times.sort()` function sorts the list in-place, meaning it changes the order of elements within the list itself without creating a new list. However, since `times` is the return value of `func_2(x, y, x, y)`, and no specific details about `func_2` are given, we can only infer that `times` is a list containing up to four elements, which are the return values of `func_2`. The sorting operation will sort these elements.

Given that `times` is the return value of `func_2(x, y, x, y)`, and `func_2` returns a list of up to four integers (as inferred from the input parameters), let's denote the return values as `[a, b, c, d]` (where `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers). After sorting, the list will be sorted in ascending order. 

Since we don't have the exact values of `x` and `y`, the specific values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` cannot be determined. But the output state will reflect that `times` has been sorted.

Output State: **`x` is an integer between -1000 and 1000, `y` is an integer between -1000 and 1000, `ans` is positive infinity, `times` is a sorted list of up to four integers returned by `func_2(x, y, x, y)`**
