Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `x` is `initial_x + 1999`
  - `y` is `-999`
  - `times` is a sorted list (in ascending order) of up to four integers
  - `ans` is the minimum value among all `times[K - 1]` values collected during the loop iterations and is unchanged

- **For Loop Statement:**
  ```python
  for y in range(-1000, 1001):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop iterates over the range from `-1000` to `1000` (inclusive). Therefore, the loop condition is based on the variable `y`.

2. **Current State:**
   - `x` is `initial_x + 1999`
   - `y` is `-999`

3. **Next Iteration:**
   To determine the next state, we need to increment `y` by `1` because the loop is iterating over `range(-1000, 1001)`.

4. **Updated Values:**
   - `x` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `y` will be incremented from `-999` to `-998`.
   - `times` and `ans` remain unchanged as there is no information indicating they are modified within the loop body.

### Conclusion:
At the start of the next iteration of the loop, the state should be:
- `x` is still `initial_x + 1999`
- `y` is now `-998`
- `times` is still a sorted list (in ascending order) of up to four integers
- `ans` remains unchanged

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
**`x` is `initial_x + 1999`, `y` is `-998`, `times` is a sorted list (in ascending order) of up to four integers, `ans` is the minimum value among all `times[K - 1]` values collected during the loop iterations and is unchanged.**

State: **`x` is `initial_x + 1999`, `y` is `-998`, `times` is a sorted list (in ascending order) of up to four integers, `ans` is the minimum value among all `times[K - 1]` values collected during the loop iterations and is unchanged**
