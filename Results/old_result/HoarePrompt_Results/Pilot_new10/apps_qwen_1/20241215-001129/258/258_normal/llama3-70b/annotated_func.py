#State of the program right berfore the function call: x, y are the coordinates of a piece of meat (x_i, y_i) and X, Y are the coordinates of the heat source (X, Y), where all values are real numbers. The function calculates the Euclidean distance between the piece of meat and the heat source.
def func_1(x, y, X, Y):
    return math.sqrt((X - x) ** 2 + (Y - y) ** 2)
    #The program returns the Euclidean distance calculated as math.sqrt((X - x)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts four real number parameters `x`, `y`, `X`, and `Y`, and returns the Euclidean distance between the point `(x, y)` and the point `(X, Y)` using the formula `math.sqrt((X - x)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x, y are lists of integers representing the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the pieces of meat respectively, X and Y are real numbers representing the coordinates of the heat source, and meats is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the x-coordinate, y-coordinate, and hardness of a piece of meat as integers.
def func_2(x, y, X, Y):
    return [(c * func_1(x, y, X, Y)) for x, y, c in meats]
    #The program returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the result of the expression `c * func_1(x, y, X, Y)` for each piece of meat, with `x` and `y` being the coordinates of the piece of meat, `c` being the hardness of the piece of meat, and `func_1` being a function that takes `x`, `y`, `X`, and `Y` as parameters
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts four parameters: `x` (a list of integers), `y` (a list of integers), `X` (a real number), and `Y` (a real number). It returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the result of the expression `c * func_1(x, y, X, Y)`, with `x` and `y` being the coordinates of the piece of meat, `c` being the hardness of the piece of meat, and `func_1` being a function that takes `x`, `y`, `X`, and `Y` as parameters. The function iterates over a list of meat pieces (each represented as a tuple containing `x`, `y`, and `c`), applies the expression `c * func_1(x, y, X, Y)` to each piece, and collects the results into a list of tuples.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x, y are integers such that -1000 <= x, y <= 1000. The function `func_2` calculates the time required to grill the meat when the heat source is placed at coordinates (x, y).
def func_3():
    ans = float('inf')
    for x in range(-1000, 1001):
        for y in range(-1000, 1001):
            times = func_2(x, y, x, y)
            times.sort()
            ans = min(ans, times[K - 1])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `ans` is the minimum value obtained from `times[K - 1]` across all iterations of the nested loops where `x` ranges from -1000 to 1000 and `y` ranges from -1000 to 1000, `times` is a sorted list of up to four integers returned by `func_2(x, y, x, y)` for each iteration, `x` and `y` take on all possible integer values within their respective ranges.
    return ans
    #`The program returns ans which is the minimum value obtained from times[K - 1] across all iterations of the nested loops where x ranges from -1000 to 1000 and y ranges from -1000 to 1000, and times is a sorted list of up to four integers returned by func_2(x, y, x, y) for each iteration.`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` iterates over all integer coordinates (x, y) where -1000 ≤ x, y ≤ 1000, calls `func_2(x, y, x, y)` for each coordinate, sorts the returned values from `func_2`, and stores the third largest value (K=4) from each call in a list. It then finds the minimum value from these stored values and returns this minimum value.
