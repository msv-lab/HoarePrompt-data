The code snippet updates the variable `my` based on the formula `my = cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`. Let's break down the steps:

1. The value of `cy` is known, and it is updated as part of the loop.
2. The value of `dx` is known, and it is also updated as part of the loop.
3. The value of `d2` is known, and it is calculated from `dx` and `dy`.
4. The value of `d` is known, and it is updated as part of the loop.

Given these points, we can substitute the known values into the equation to find the new value of `my`.

The formula simplifies to:
\[ my = cy - dx \cdot \frac{\mathsqrt{d2 \cdot d - d \cdot d}}{d2} \]
Since \( d \cdot d = d^2 \), the term \( d2 \cdot d - d \cdot d \) simplifies to \( d2 \cdot d - d^2 \). Therefore, the equation becomes:
\[ my = cy - dx \cdot \frac{\mathsqrt{d2 \cdot d - d^2}}{d2} \]

Since the exact values of `cy`, `dx`, and `d2` are not provided, we keep them in their symbolic form.

The other variables (`i`, `N`, `c1`, `c2`, `d`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`i` is `i_end + 1`, `N` is greater than `i_end + 2`, `c1` is updated to either its original value or `c2` depending on the condition, `c2` is updated to either its original value or `c1` depending on the condition, `d` is `d / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `(dx * dx + dy * dy)`, `mx` is `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * (d - 1)) / d2`, `my` is `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`**
