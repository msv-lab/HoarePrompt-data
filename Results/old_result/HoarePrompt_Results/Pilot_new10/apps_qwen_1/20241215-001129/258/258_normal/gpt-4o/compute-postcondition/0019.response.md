The code assigns the integer value of `data[index + 1]` to `y`. Given the initial state, `index` is 10, so `data[index + 1]` corresponds to `data[11]`. Since `data` is a list of strings, `data[11]` is a string, which is converted to an integer using `int()`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings, `N` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `K` is the integer value of the second element in `data`, `meats` is `[(x, y, c), (x, y, c)]`, `index` is 10, `x` is the integer value of `data[10]`, `y` is the integer value of `data[11]`, `c` is the integer value of the ninth element in `data`**
