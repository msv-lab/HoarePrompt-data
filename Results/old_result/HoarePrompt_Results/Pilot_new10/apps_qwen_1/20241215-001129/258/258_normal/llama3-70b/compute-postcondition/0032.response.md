The code `times.sort()` sorts the list `times`. Since `times` was already sorted in the initial state, sorting it again does not change its order. All other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`x` is `initial_x + 1999`, `y` is `-1000`, `times` is a sorted list of up to four integers returned by `func_2(initial_x + 1999, -1000, initial_x + 1999, -1000)`, `ans` is the minimum value among all `times[K - 1]` values collected during the loop iterations and is unchanged.**
