Postcondition: ***`i` is less than `N - 1`, `x1` is the first element of `meats[i]`, `y1` is the second element of `meats[i]`, `c1` is the third element of `meats[i]`, `x2` is the second element of `meats[j]`, `y2` is the third element of `meats[j]`, `c2` is the fourth element of `meats[j]`. If `c1 * T < c2 * T`, then the elements in `meats[i]` are updated to the corresponding elements in `meats[j]`. Otherwise, the elements in `meats[j]` remain unchanged.***
