You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Takahashi wants to grill N pieces of meat on a grilling net, which can be seen as a two-dimensional plane. The coordinates of the i-th piece of meat are \left(x_i, y_i\right), and its hardness is c_i.
Takahashi can use one heat source to grill the meat. If he puts the heat source at coordinates \left(X, Y\right), where X and Y are real numbers, the i-th piece of meat will be ready to eat in c_i \times \sqrt{\left(X - x_i\right)^2 + \left(Y-y_i\right)^2} seconds.
Takahashi wants to eat K pieces of meat. Find the time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready if he put the heat source to minimize this time.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq N \leq 60
 - 1 \leq K \leq N
 - -1000 \leq x_i , y_i \leq 1000
 - \left(x_i, y_i\right) \neq \left(x_j, y_j\right) \left(i \neq j \right)
 - 1 \leq c_i \leq 100

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
x_1 y_1 c_1
\vdots
x_N y_N c_N

-----Output-----
Print the answer.
It will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error from our answer is at most 10^{-6}.

-----Sample Input-----
4 3
-1 0 3
0 0 3
1 0 2
1 1 40

-----Sample Output-----
2.4

If we put the heat source at \left(-0.2, 0\right), the 1-st, 2-nd, and 3-rd pieces of meat will be ready to eat within 2.4 seconds. This is the optimal place to put the heat source.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program attempts to solve the problem using a binary search approach combined with checking pairs of points. However, there are several issues that make the program incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Distance and Time**: The program calculates the distance between the heat source and each piece of meat and checks if it is less than or equal to `T`. However, the program does not correctly calculate the minimum time to satisfy the requirement of having `K` or more pieces of meat ready. The `func_1` function checks pairs of points and tries to find a feasible position for the heat source, but it does not guarantee that the chosen position will minimize the time for `K` or more pieces of meat to be ready.

2. **Inefficient and Incorrect Logic**: The `func_1` function iterates over all pairs of points and checks if the chosen point can satisfy the condition for `K` pieces of meat. This logic is inefficient and does not ensure that the solution is optimal. It also does not handle cases where the optimal point might not be between any two points but rather could be at a different location.

3. **Binary Search Implementation**: The `func_2` function uses a binary search to find the minimum time `T`. However, the implementation of the binary search and the check function `func_1` do not ensure that the solution is correct for all possible configurations of the points.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem. Therefore, it returns an incorrect result for some inputs and configurations, leading to a final answer of **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
