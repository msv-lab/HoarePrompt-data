The code assigns the value of `data[index + 2]` to `c`. Given that `index` is initially 2, `data[index + 2]` corresponds to the 4th element in the `data` list, which is `y`. Therefore, `c` is assigned the value of `y`.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings containing the original input split by spaces, `N` is the integer value of the first element in `data`, `1 <= N <= 60`, `K` is the integer value of the second element in `data`, `1 <= K <= N`, `meats` is an empty list, `index` is 2, `x` is the integer value of the third element in `data`, `y` is the integer value of the fourth element in `data`, `c` is the integer value of the fourth element in `data`.**
