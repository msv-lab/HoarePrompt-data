The `continue` statement in the code causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. No changes are made to the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `i_end + 2`, `N` is greater than `i_end + 2`, `count` is updated based on the condition `c * math.sqrt((mx - x)`, `d` remains `c1 * T - c2 * T` if `d < 0`, otherwise `d` remains `c1 * T - c2 * T`, `c1` remains the original value of `c2`, `x1` remains the original value of `x2`, `y1` remains the original value of `y2`, `c2` remains the original value of `c1`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `(x1 - x2)`**
