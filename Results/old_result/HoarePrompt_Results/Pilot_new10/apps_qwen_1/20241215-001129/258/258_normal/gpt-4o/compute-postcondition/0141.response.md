`meats[i]` is unpacked into `x1`, `y1`, and `c1`. The value of `i` is taken from its current state, which is `i_end + 1`. After unpacking, the values of `i`, `N`, `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` are updated. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is `i_end + 1`, `N` is greater than `i_end + 2`, `x1` is the first element of `meats[i_end + 1]`, `y1` is the second element of `meats[i_end + 1]`, `c1` is the third element of `meats[i_end + 1]`**
