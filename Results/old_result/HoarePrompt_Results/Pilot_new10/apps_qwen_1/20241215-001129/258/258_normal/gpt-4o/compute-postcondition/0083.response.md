The code assigns the value of `(y1 + y2) / 2` to the variable `cy`. This calculation does not affect the values of `d`, `i`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, or `cx`. Therefore, the output state will include the updated value of `cy` based on the given initial state.

Output State: **`d` is `T * (c1 - c2) / (c1 * c2)`, `i` is less than `N - 1`, `x1` is the first element of `meats[i]`, `y1` is the second element of `meats[i]`, `c1` is the third element of `meats[i]`, `x2` is the second element of `meats[j]`, `y2` is the third element of `meats[j]`, `c2` is the fourth element of `meats[j]`, `cx` is (x1 + x2) / 2, `cy` is (y1 + y2) / 2**
