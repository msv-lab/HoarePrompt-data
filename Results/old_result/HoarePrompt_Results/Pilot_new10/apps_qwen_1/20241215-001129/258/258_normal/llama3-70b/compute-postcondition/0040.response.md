The `times.sort()` method sorts the list `times`. Since the original value of `times` is not explicitly given, we cannot determine the exact sorted order, but we know that sorting changes the order of elements in the list. The other variables (`x`, `y`, `ans`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`x` is `initial_x + 1999`, `y` is `-998`, `times` is a sorted version of the original `times`, `ans` is the minimum value among all `times[K - 1]` values collected during the loop iterations and is unchanged**
