The code calculates `my` using the formula `my = cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`. Let's break down the formula:

- `cy` is \((y1 + y2) / 2\)
- `dx` is \((x1 - x2) / 2\)
- `d2` is \(\left(\frac{x1 - x2}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y1 - y2}{2}\right)^2\)
- `d` is \(\frac{T}{c2} - \frac{T}{c1}\)

Substituting `d * d` into the formula, we get:

\[ my = cy - dx \cdot \mathsqrt{(d2 \cdot d - d \cdot d) / d2} \]

Since \(d \cdot d\) simplifies to \(d^2\), the expression inside the square root becomes:

\[ my = cy - dx \cdot \mathsqrt{d2 \cdot d - d^2} / d2 \]

Given the values of the variables:

- `cy` is \((y1 + y2) / 2\)
- `dx` is \((x1 - x2) / 2\)
- `d2` is \(\left(\frac{x1 - x2}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y1 - y2}{2}\right)^2\)
- `d` is \(\frac{T}{c2} - \frac{T}{c1}\)

The output state is:

Output State: **`i` is `i_end + 1`, `N` is greater than `i_end + 2`, `count` is incremented and less than `K`, `x1` is the first element of `meats[i]`, `y1` is the second element of `meats[i]`, `c1` is the third element of `meats[i]`, `x2` is the first element of `meats[j]`, `y2` is the second element of `meats[j]`, `c2` is the third element of `meats[j]`, `d` is \(\frac{T}{c2} - \frac{T}{c1}\), `cx` is \((x1 + x2) / 2\), `cy` is \((y1 + y2) / 2\), `dx` is \((x1 - x2) / 2\), `dy` is \((y1 - y2) / 2\), `d2` is \(\left(\frac{x1 - x2}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y1 - y2}{2}\right)^2\), `mx` is \((x1 + x2) / 2\), `my` is \(cy - dx \cdot \mathsqrt{d2 \cdot d - d^2} / d2\)**
