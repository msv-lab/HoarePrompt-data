Let's analyze the loop step by step and determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State:
- `x` is `initial_x + 1999`
- `y` is `-1000`
- `times` is a sorted list of up to four integers returned by `func_2(initial_x + 1999, -1000, initial_x + 1999, -1000)`
- `ans` is the minimum value among all `times[K - 1]` values collected during the loop iterations

### Loop Code:
```python
for y in range(-1000, 1001):
    times = func_2(x, y, x, y)
    times.sort()
    ans = min(ans, times[K - 1])
```

### Analysis:
1. **First Iteration (`y = -1000`)**:
   - `x` remains `initial_x + 1999`
   - `y` becomes `-1000`
   - `times` is a sorted list of up to four integers returned by `func_2(initial_x + 1999, -1000, initial_x + 1999, -1000)`
   - `ans` is updated to the minimum value of `times[K - 1]`

2. **Subsequent Iterations**:
   - As `y` increases from `-1000` to `1000`, `x` remains `initial_x + 1999`
   - For each new value of `y`, `times` is updated to a new list of up to four integers returned by `func_2(initial_x + 1999, y, initial_x + 1999, y)`
   - `times` is sorted, and `ans` is updated to the minimum value of `times[K - 1]` among all previous and current values

### Observations:
- The value of `x` remains constant throughout the loop since it is not changed inside the loop.
- The value of `y` starts at `-1000` and increments to `1000`.
- The list `times` is updated for each new value of `y`.
- The variable `ans` is always updated to the minimum value of `times[K - 1]` from all iterations.

### Final Output State:
After the loop completes all its iterations, the following conditions hold:
- `x` is `initial_x + 1999`
- `y` is `1000` (the highest value in the range)
- `times` is a sorted list of up to four integers returned by `func_2(initial_x + 1999, 1000, initial_x + 1999, 1000)`
- `ans` is the minimum value among all `times[K - 1]` values collected during the loop iterations

### Output State:
Output State: **`x` is `initial_x + 1999`, `y` is `1000`, `times` is a sorted list of up to four integers returned by `func_2(initial_x + 1999, 1000, initial_x + 1999, 1000)`, `ans` is the minimum value among all `times[K - 1]` values collected during the loop iterations.**
