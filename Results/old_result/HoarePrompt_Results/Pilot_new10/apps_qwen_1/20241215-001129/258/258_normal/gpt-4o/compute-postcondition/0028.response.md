The given code snippet updates the values of `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` by assigning them to the respective elements of `meats[i]`. This means that `x1` is now the first element of `meats[i]`, `y1` is the second element of `meats[i]`, and `c1` is the third element of `meats[i]`. The values of other variables remain unchanged from their previous state.

Since `j` is incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration, the new value of `j` is `j_current + 1`.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `x1` is the first element of `meats[i]`
- `y1` is the second element of `meats[i]`
- `c1` is the third element of `meats[i]`
- `j` is `j_current + 1`

Output State: **`dx` is \((x1 - x2) / 2\), `x1` is the first element of `meats[i]`, `x2` is the first element of `meats[0]`, `y1` is the second element of `meats[i]`, `y2` is the second element of `meats[0]`, `c1` is the third element of `meats[i]`, `c2` is the third element of `meats[0]`, `d` is \(\frac{(c1 \cdot T - c2 \cdot T)}{(c1 \cdot c2)}\), `cx` is \((x1 + x2) / 2\), `cy` is the average of `y1` and `y2`, `dy` is \((y1 - y2) / 2\), `d2` is \(\left(\frac{x1 - x2}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y1 - y2}{2}\right)^2\), `my` is `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `count` is the number of tuples in `meats` for which \((c * math.sqrt((mx - x)\) is less than `K`, and `j` is `j_current + 1`.
