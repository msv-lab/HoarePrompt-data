Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is `i_end + 1`
   - `N` is greater than `i_end + 2`
   - `count` is updated based on the condition `c * math.sqrt((mx - x)` (where `x` is likely a variable involved in the condition)
   - If `count` is greater than or equal to `K`, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, the function continues without returning anything.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` starting from `i + 1` up to `N`.

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i_end + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `N`. Since `j` starts from `i + 1`, the next value of `j` would be `i + 2`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it `i + 1` which is `i_end + 2`.
   - The condition `N > i_end + 2` must still hold true, as `N` does not change within the loop.
   - The `count` value remains unchanged unless the loop body updates it, but since we are considering the state just before the next iteration, `count` remains the same as it was at the end of the last iteration.

Based on these observations, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` is now `i_end + 2`
- `N` must still be greater than `i_end + 2`
- `count` remains unchanged

So, the adjusted state is:

State: **`i` is `i_end + 2`, `N` is greater than `i_end + 2`, and `count` is updated based on the condition `c * math.sqrt((mx - x)`**.
