The code assigns the value of `times[K - 1]` to `ans` using the `min` function, which means `ans` is updated to be the smaller value between its current value and `times[K - 1]`. Since `ans` was initially the minimum value among all `times[K - 1]` values collected during the loop iterations and is unchanged before this line, `ans` remains the same unless `times[K - 1]` is smaller than the current value of `ans`.

Therefore, the value of `ans` does not change because the problem statement indicates that `ans` is already the minimum value among all `times[K - 1]` values collected during the loop iterations.

Output State: **`x` is `initial_x + 1999`, `y` is `-999`, `times` is a sorted list (in ascending order) of up to four integers, `ans` is the minimum value among all `times[K - 1]` values collected during the loop iterations and is unchanged**
