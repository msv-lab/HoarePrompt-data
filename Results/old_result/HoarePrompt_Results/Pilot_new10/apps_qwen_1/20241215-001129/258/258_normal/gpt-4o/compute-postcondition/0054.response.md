The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current loop iteration and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or change the state of the program. All variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`c1` is the third element of `meats[i]`, `c2` is the third element of `meats[i+2]`, `d` is either `c1 * T - c2 * T` (if `c1 * T < c2 * T`), or `c1 * T - c2 * T` (if `c1 * T >= c2 * T`), `dx` is the same, `dy` is the same, `d2` is the same, `cx` is the same, `cy` is the same, `my` is the same, `count` is the same, and `j` is `i + 2`.**
