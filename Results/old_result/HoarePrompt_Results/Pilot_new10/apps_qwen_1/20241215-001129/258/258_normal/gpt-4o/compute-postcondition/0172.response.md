Postcondition: ***`i` is `i_end + 1`, `N` is greater than `i_end + 2`, `count` is incremented and less than `K`, `x1` is the first element of `meats[i]`, `y1` is the second element of `meats[i]`, `c1` is the third element of `meats[i]`, `x2` is the first element of `meats[j]`, `y2` is the second element of `meats[j]`, `c2` is the third element of `meats[j]`, `d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T`. If `d` is less than 0, the condition remains unchanged. Otherwise, the condition also remains unchanged since there is no else part modifying the state.***
