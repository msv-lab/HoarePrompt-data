The code `times.sort()` sorts the list `times`. Since `times` is already a sorted list of up to four integers returned by `func_2(x, y, x, y)`, sorting it again will not change its order. However, the fact that it is sorted remains true.

- `x` remains an integer between -1000 and 1000.
- `y` remains 1000.
- `ans` remains `times[K - 1]` if `times[K - 1]` is less than positive infinity. Since `times` is sorted and contains up to four integers, `ans` will still be the third element in the list (if it exists) because `K` is typically referring to the index position in a zero-based list.
- `times` remains a sorted list of up to four integers.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`x` is an integer between -1000 and 1000, `y` is 1000, `ans` is `times[2]` if `times[2]` is less than positive infinity, `times` is a sorted list of up to four integers.**
