The code assigns the value of `data[index + 2]` to `c`. Given that `index` is 7, `data[index + 2]` refers to `data[9]`, which is the ninth element in the list `data`. The value of `c` is the integer value of the ninth element in `data`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings, `N` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `K` is the integer value of the second element in `data`, `meats` is `[ (x, y, c) ]`, `index` is 7, `x` is the integer value of the sixth element in `data`, `y` is the integer value of `data[8]`, `c` is the integer value of the ninth element in `data`.**
