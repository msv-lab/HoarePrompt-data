The code `y = int(data[index + 1])` impacts the variable `y` by assigning it the integer value of the element in `data` at the index `index + 1`. Given the initial state, `index` is 7, so the code assigns `y` the integer value of `data[8]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings, `N` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `K` is the integer value of the second element in `data`, `meats` is `[ (x, y, c) ]`, `index` is 7, `x` is the integer value of the sixth element in `data`, `y` is the integer value of `data[8]`, `c` is the integer value of the fifth element in `data`.**
