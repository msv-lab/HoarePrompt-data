Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given States Before the Loop Starts:
- `x` is `initial_x + 1999`
- `y` is `-1000`
- `times` is a sorted list of up to four integers returned by `func_2(initial_x + 1999, -1000, initial_x + 1999, -1000)`
- `ans` is the minimum value among all `times[K - 1]` values collected during the loop iterations

### For Loop Statement:
```
for y in range(-1000, 1001):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Initialization**: The loop will start with `y = -1000` and increment `y` until `y = 1000`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `y` is within the range `-1000` to `1000`.

### States to Adjust:
- **`x`**: The value of `x` is already given and does not change within the loop (it remains `initial_x + 1999`).
- **`y`**: The value of `y` is initially `-1000` and the loop will start executing with this value. To ensure the loop starts, we need to confirm that the loop condition is satisfied.
- **`times`**: The value of `times` is determined by the function call `func_2(initial_x + 1999, -1000, initial_x + 1999, -1000)`. Since this is the initial state, `times` is already set and no adjustment is needed for its initialization.
- **`ans`**: This is the minimum value among all `times[K - 1]` values collected during the loop iterations. The value of `ans` is not relevant to the loop starting condition but rather to the values collected during the iterations.

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs to be considered for the loop to execute is the value of `y`. The loop will start when `y` is `-1000`, and the loop will continue until `y` reaches `1000`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`x` is `initial_x + 1999`, `y` is `-1000`, `times` is a sorted list of up to four integers returned by `func_2(initial_x + 1999, -1000, initial_x + 1999, -1000)`, `ans` is the minimum value among all `times[K - 1]` values collected during the loop iterations**.

Since `y` is already `-1000`, the loop will execute as long as the loop condition is met, which it is because `-1000` is within the range `-1000` to `1000`. No further adjustments are necessary for `y`.
