`x2`, `y2`, and `c2` are assigned the values of the second, third, and fourth elements of `meats[j]`, respectively. The values of `i`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, and `j` remain unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is less than `N - 1`, `x1` is the first element of `meats[i]`, `y1` is the second element of `meats[i]`, `c1` is the third element of `meats[i]`, `x2` is the second element of `meats[j]`, `y2` is the third element of `meats[j]`, `c2` is the fourth element of `meats[j]`**
