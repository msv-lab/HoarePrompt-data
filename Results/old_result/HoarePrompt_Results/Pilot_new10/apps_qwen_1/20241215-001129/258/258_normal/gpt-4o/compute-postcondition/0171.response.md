The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. None of the variables are affected by this statement. The conditions and values of the variables before the `continue` statement remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `i_end + 1`, `N` is greater than `i_end + 2`, `count` is incremented and less than `K`, `x1` is the first element of `meats[i]`, `y1` is the second element of `meats[i]`, `c1` is the third element of `meats[i]`, `x2` is the first element of `meats[j]`, `y2` is the second element of `meats[j]`, `c2` is the third element of `meats[j]`, `d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T`.**
