The code snippet calculates `d2` which is the sum of the squares of `dx` and `dy`. 

- `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`
- `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`

The value of `d2` is computed as `dx * dx + dy * dy`.

Since `x2` and `y2` are not defined in the initial state, they are considered as undefined variables. However, the values of `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `c2`, `d`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, and `dy` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is `i_end + 1`, `N` is greater than `i_end + 2`, `x1` is the first element of `meats[i_end + 1]`, `y1` is the second element of `meats[i_end + 1]`, `c1` is updated to either its original value or `c2` depending on the condition, `c2` is updated to either its original value or `c1` depending on the condition, `d` is `d / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `(dx * dx + dy * dy)`**
