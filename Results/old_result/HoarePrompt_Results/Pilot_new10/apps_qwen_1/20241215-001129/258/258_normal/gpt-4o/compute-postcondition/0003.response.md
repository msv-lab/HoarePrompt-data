The code initializes an empty list `meats`. This does not affect the values of `data`, `N`, or `K`. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the `meats` list.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings containing the original input split by spaces, `N` is the integer value of the first element in `data`, and 1 <= N <= 60; `K` is the integer value of the second element in `data`, and 1 <= K <= N; `meats` is an empty list**
