The code updates `dy` to `(y1 - y2) / 2`. Since `y1` and `y2` are the second elements of `meats[i_end + 1]` and some unspecified `meats[i_end + 2]`, the value of `dy` depends on these two values. The other variables are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is `i_end + 1`, `N` is greater than `i_end + 2`, `x1` is the first element of `meats[i_end + 1]`, `y1` is the second element of `meats[i_end + 1]`, `c1` is updated to either its original value or `c2` depending on the condition, `c2` is updated to either its original value or `c1` depending on the condition, `d` is `d / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`**
