The function `func_2(x, y, x, y)` is called, which returns a list of up to four integers. The output of this function is assigned to the variable `times`. The initial value of `y` is 1000 and it iterates through all values from `-1000` to `1001`, but this iteration is not shown in the given code snippet. The initial value of `ans` is the minimum value obtained from `times[K - 1]` across all iterations, but since the iterations are not shown, we only know that `ans` was previously set based on these iterations.

After calling `func_2(x, y, x, y)`, the `times` list is updated, but without knowing the exact values returned by `func_2`, we cannot specify the exact values in `times`. However, we know that `times` now contains up to four integers returned by the function.

The initial values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged, and `ans` is not affected by this line of code since `ans` was determined before this assignment and not reassigned here.

Output State: **`x` is an integer between -1000 and 1000, `y` is 1000, `times` is a list of up to four integers returned by `func_2(x, y, x, y)`.**
