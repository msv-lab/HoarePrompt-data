The code assigns the value of `(x1 - x2) / 2` to `dx`. This changes the value of `dx` but does not affect the values of `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, `y2`, `c1`, `c2`, `d`, `j`, `dy`, `cx`, `cy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, or `count`.

Output State: **`x1` is the first element of `meats[j]`, `y1` is the second element of `meats[j]`, `c1` is the third element of `meats[j]`, `x2` is the first element of `meats[i]`, `y2` is the second element of `meats[i]`, `c2` is the third element of `meats[i]`, `d` is `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `j` remains unchanged, `dy` remains unchanged, `cx` is updated to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is updated to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `d2` remains unchanged, `mx` remains unchanged, `my` remains unchanged, `count` remains unchanged, `dx` is updated to `(x1 - x2) / 2`**.
