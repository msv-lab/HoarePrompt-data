Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment was accurate. Despite the annotations, the program still uses a grid search with integer coordinates (-1000 to 1000) to find the optimal position for the heat source. This approach does not consider real number coordinates, which is a requirement specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program may miss the optimal solution where the heat source is placed at a non-integer coordinate. The annotated version confirms this issue by showing that the function `func_3` iterates over a grid of integer points, which is not sufficient to cover all possible real number coordinates.
