`data` is a string containing space-separated integers representing the values of N, K, followed by the coordinates and hardness of N pieces of meat. The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, and assigns these strings to the variable `data`. The values of N, K, and the meat data remain in their respective string format within `data`.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings containing the original input split by spaces, N and K are positive integers such that 1 <= N <= 60 and 1 <= K <= N, and each piece of meat is represented by three integers (x, y, c) where -1000 <= x, y <= 1000 and 1 <= c <= 100.**
