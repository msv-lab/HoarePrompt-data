Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program attempts to solve the problem using a binary search approach combined with checking pairs of points. However, there are several issues that make the program incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Distance and Time**: The program calculates the distance between the heat source and each piece of meat and checks if it is less than or equal to `T`. However, the program does not correctly calculate the minimum time to satisfy the requirement of having `K` or more pieces of meat ready. The `func_1` function checks pairs of points and tries to find a feasible position for the heat source, but it does not guarantee that the chosen position will minimize the time for `K` or more pieces of meat to be ready.

2. **Inefficient and Incorrect Logic**: The `func_1` function iterates over all pairs of points and checks if the chosen point can satisfy the condition for `K` pieces of meat. This logic is inefficient and does not ensure that the solution is optimal. It also does not handle cases where the optimal point might not be between any two points but rather could be at a different location.

3. **Binary Search Implementation**: The `func_2` function uses a binary search to find the minimum time `T`. However, the implementation of the binary search and the check function `func_1` do not ensure that the solution is correct for all possible configurations of the points.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem. Therefore, it returns an incorrect result for some inputs and configurations, leading to a final answer of **False**.
