`s` is assigned the value of the string input by the user, and `n` retains its original value, which is the integer length of the string `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is the string input by the user, `n` is the integer length of the string `s`.

Output State: **`s` is the string input by the user, `n` is the integer length of the string `s`**
