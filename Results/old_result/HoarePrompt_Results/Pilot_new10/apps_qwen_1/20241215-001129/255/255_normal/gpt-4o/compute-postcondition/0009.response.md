Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `operations` is incremented by 1.*** 

Explanation: Since the else part is not provided, we assume that if the condition `s[i] != s[i - 1]` is true, then `operations` is incremented by 1. Given the precondition and the if part's postcondition, the overall postcondition remains that `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `operations` is incremented by 1.
