`s` is assigned the value of `input()`, which means the value of `s` changes to whatever string is input by the user. However, since the exact input is not specified, we cannot determine the exact string. But we know that the length of `s` remains `n`, and `n` is still an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive).

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and `s` is now a string input by the user**
