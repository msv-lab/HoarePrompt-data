According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be greater than 1 and `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1, making it 2. Since there are no changes in `n` under any condition, `n` must still be greater than 1.

Let's summarize the state adjustments:

- `i` is increased by 1, so `i` becomes 2.
- `n` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 1.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2**
