The code prints the value of `operations`. Since the code only prints `operations` and does not modify any variables, the value of `n`, `s`, and `operations` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 500, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and `operations` is the number of positions where the character in the string differs from the previous character. The value of `operations` is printed.**
