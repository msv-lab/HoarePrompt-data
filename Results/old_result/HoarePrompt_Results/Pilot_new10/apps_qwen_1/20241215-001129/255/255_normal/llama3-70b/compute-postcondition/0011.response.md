`ans` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `ans` is 3 if `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i - 1]`, and 2 otherwise. Since `i` is 4, we need to consider the value of `s[4]` relative to `s[3]` to determine the exact value of `ans` before incrementing. However, the exact value of `s[4]` and `s[3]` is not provided, so we will keep the conditional nature of `ans`.

Output State: **`s` is the string input by the user, `n` is greater than 4, `i` is 4, and `ans` is either 4 (if `s[4]` is not equal to `s[3]`) or 3 (if `s[4]` is equal to `s[3]`).**
