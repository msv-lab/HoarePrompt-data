Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are updated to `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate` and `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate` respectively. `diff` is positive and divisible by `k`, `k` is at least 1, `min_lcm` is the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, and `min_k` is `candidate` if `current_lcm < min_lcm` or (`current_lcm == min_lcm` and `candidate < min_k`). Otherwise, `min_k` remains unchanged.***
