The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \le a, b \le 10^9\), and the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b` is also a valid input. The function returns the result of \((a * b) // \text{gcd}(a, b)\).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two positive integers `a` and `b`, compute the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`, and return the result of \((a * b) // \text{gcd}(a, b)\).
