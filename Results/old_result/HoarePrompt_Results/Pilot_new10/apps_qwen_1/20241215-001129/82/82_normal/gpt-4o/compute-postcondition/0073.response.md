Let's analyze the given information step by step to determine the states that need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `new_a` is \(((a + (k + 1) - 1) // (k + 1) * (k + 1) + c - 1) // c * c\)
- `new_b` is \((b + (k + 1) - 1) // (k + 1) * (k + 1) + (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\)
- `current_lcm` is the value of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`
- `min_lcm` and `min_k` are updated accordingly if `current_lcm` is smaller than `min_lcm` or equal to `min_lcm` but with a smaller `candidate` value than `min_k`
- `diff` remains positive and divisible by `k + 2`
- `k` is now `k + 1`
- `diff // (k + 1)` remains a positive integer

### Loop Statement:
```
for candidate in [k, diff // k]:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will iterate over the list `[k, diff // k]`. For the loop to execute again, either `k` or `diff // k` (or both) must be valid candidates.

2. **Candidate Values**:
   - `k`: This is set to `k + 1` at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `diff // k`: Since `diff` remains positive and divisible by `k + 2`, it will remain positive and divisible by `k + 1` (which is `k`).

3. **States to Adjust**:
   - `k` is already incremented to `k + 1`.
   - `diff // k` should still be valid as it remains a positive integer divisible by `k + 1`.

### Conclusion:
At the start of the next iteration, the values of `new_a`, `new_b`, `current_lcm`, `min_lcm`, and `min_k` will be updated based on the current candidate (`k` or `diff // k`). However, since we don't know the exact update rules for these values within the loop, we only need to ensure that the loop condition is met.

Given the loop condition and the values of `k` and `diff // k`, we can conclude:

### Final Answer:
State: **`new_a` is \(((a + (k + 1) - 1) // (k + 1) * (k + 1) + c - 1) // c * c\); `new_b` is \((b + (k + 1) - 1) // (k + 1) * (k + 1) + (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\); `current_lcm` is the value of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_lcm` and `min_k` are updated accordingly if `current_lcm` is smaller than `min_lcm` or equal to `min_lcm` but with a smaller `candidate` value than `min_k`, `diff` remains positive and divisible by `k + 2`, `k` is now `k + 2`, and `diff // (k + 1)` remains a positive integer.**

Note: `k` is incremented from `k + 1` to `k + 2` for the next iteration.
