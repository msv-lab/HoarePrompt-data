Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the necessary adjustments for the start of the next iteration of the loop.

### Given Information
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - \(a\) remains the same.
  - \(b\) remains the same.
  - \(diff\) remains the same.
  - \(k\) remains the same.
  - \(min\_lcm\) is updated to `current_lcm` if `current_lcm < min_lcm` or (`current_lcm == min_lcm` and `candidate < min_k`).
  - \(min\_k\) is updated to `candidate` under the same condition.
  - \(new\_a\) is equal to \((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\).
  - \(new\_b\) is equal to \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\).
  - \(current\_lcm\) is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.

- **For loop statement:**
  ```python
  for candidate in [k, diff // k]:
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initial States at Start of Loop:**
   - \(a\) remains the same.
   - \(b\) remains the same.
   - \(diff\) remains the same.
   - \(k\) remains the same.
   - \(min\_lcm\) remains the same (initial value or updated from the previous iteration).
   - \(min\_k\) remains the same (initial value or updated from the previous iteration).
   - \(new\_a\) is calculated based on the initial values of \(a\) and \(candidate\).
   - \(new\_b\) is calculated based on the initial values of \(b\) and \(candidate\).
   - \(current\_lcm\) is calculated as `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.

2. **Loop Iteration Logic:**
   - The loop iterates over two possible candidates: \(k\) and \(diff // k\).

3. **State Adjustments After Each Iteration:**
   - After each iteration, the following states change:
     - \(min\_lcm\) might be updated based on the conditions provided.
     - \(min\_k\) might be updated based on the conditions provided.
     - \(new\_a\) and \(new\_b\) are recalculated for the current candidate.
     - \(current\_lcm\) is recalculated based on the new values of \(new\_a\) and \(new\_b\).

4. **State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - Since the loop has just completed an iteration, the current values of \(a\), \(b\), \(diff\), \(k\), \(min\_lcm\), \(min\_k\), \(new\_a\), \(new\_b\), and \(current\_lcm\) reflect the results of the last candidate processed.

5. **Starting State for Next Iteration:**
   - For the next iteration, the loop will check the next candidate in the list `[k, diff // k]`.
   - If the loop has just finished with the first candidate \(k\), it will now process the second candidate \(diff // k\).
   - If the loop has just finished with the second candidate \(diff // k\), it will stop.

6. **Adjusting States for Next Iteration:**
   - The only changes needed are the candidate being evaluated and the recalculated `new_a`, `new_b`, and `current_lcm`.

### Conclusion

Given that the loop is about to start the next iteration, we need to adjust the states as follows:

- The current candidate is either \(k\) or \(diff // k\). For the next iteration, we will switch to the other candidate.
- Recalculate `new_a` and `new_b` using the new candidate.
- Recalculate `current_lcm` using the new values of `new_a` and `new_b`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`a` remains the same, `b` remains the same, `diff` remains the same, `k` remains the same, `min_lcm` remains the same, `min_k` remains the same, `new_a` is equal to \((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\) where `candidate` is the other candidate (either \(k\) or \(diff // k\)), `new_b` is equal to \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\), and `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.

This ensures that the loop continues to process the next candidate correctly.
