#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers where \(1 \le a, b \le 10^9\) and the function `func_1` is used to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.
def func_1(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`, `y` is 0.
    return x
    #The program returns x which is the GCD of the original values of x and y, and y is 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integers `x` and `y` and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. After the loop terminates, `x` contains the GCD of the original `x` and `y`, and `y` is set to 0. This is achieved through the Euclidean algorithm, which repeatedly replaces `x` with `y` and `y` with `x % y` until `y` becomes 0.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are positive integers.
def func_2(x, y):
    return x * y // func_1(x, y)
    #The program returns the integer division of x multiplied by y, where `func_1(x, y)` is 1 since `x` and `y` are positive integers and the function `func_1(x, y)` returns 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two positive integers `x` and `y`, multiplies them, and returns the result.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers such that \(1 \le a, b \le 10^9\).
def func_3(a, b):

        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: a and b are non-negative integers such that \(1 \le a, b \le 10^9\) and \(a \neq b\)

    for k in range(1, int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1):
        if diff % k == 0:
            for candidate in [k, diff // k]:
                new_a = (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
                new_b = (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate

                if (current_lcm < min_lcm or current_lcm == min_lcm and candidate <
                    min_k):

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` and `b` are non-negative integers such that they are aligned to multiples of `min_k` (the value of `min_k` found to minimize the LCM), `diff` is 0, `min_lcm` is the minimum least common multiple (LCM) found during the loop execution, and `min_k` is the factor corresponding to the smallest LCM.
    return min_k
    #The program returns min_k which is the value found to minimize the LCM
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b` such that \(1 \le a, b \le 10^9\). If `a` equals `b`, it returns 0. Otherwise, it finds the smallest value `min_k` that, when added to both `a` and `b`, results in numbers that are multiples of `min_k` and returns this `min_k` as it minimizes the least common multiple (LCM) of the adjusted `a` and `b`.
