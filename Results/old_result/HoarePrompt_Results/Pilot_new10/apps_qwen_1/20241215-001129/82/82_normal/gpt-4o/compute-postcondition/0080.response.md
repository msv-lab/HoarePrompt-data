Output State: **`new_a` is \(((a + final_k - 1) // final_k * final_k)\); `new_b` is \((b + final_k - 1) // final_k * final_k)\); `current_lcm` is the value of `func_2(new_a, new_b)` when the loop finishes; `min_lcm` is the minimum value of `current_lcm` found during the loop executions; `min_k` is the corresponding `candidate` value when `min_lcm` is updated; `diff` remains positive and divisible by `final_k + 1`; `k` is `final_k + 1` where `final_k` is the last value of `k` when the loop exits; `diff // (k - 1)` remains a positive integer.**
