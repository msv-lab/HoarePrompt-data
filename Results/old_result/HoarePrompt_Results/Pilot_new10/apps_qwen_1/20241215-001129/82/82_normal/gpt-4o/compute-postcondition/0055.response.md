Output State: **`a` and `b` are updated to \((a + k - 1) // k * k\) and \((b + k - 1) // k * k\) respectively, `diff` is positive and divisible by `k`, `k` is the last value it was updated to, `min_lcm` is the minimum value of `current_lcm` found during the loop executions, and `min_k` is the corresponding `candidate` value when `min_lcm` is updated.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over two candidates: `k` and `diff // k`.
- For each candidate, `new_a` and `new_b` are updated based on the formula \((x + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\).
- The `current_lcm` is calculated using `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.
- If `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm` or equal to `min_lcm` but `candidate` is smaller than `min_k`, then `min_lcm` and `min_k` are updated.
- Since the loop will iterate over both candidates, `k` will take the last value it was updated to.
- After the loop completes, `a` and `b` will be the final values they were updated to during the loop, and `min_lcm` and `min_k` will hold the minimum `lcm` and the corresponding `k` value that produced it.
