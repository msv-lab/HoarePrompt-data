The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integers `x` and `y` and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. After the loop terminates, `x` contains the GCD of the original `x` and `y`, and `y` is set to 0. This is achieved through the Euclidean algorithm, which repeatedly replaces `x` with `y` and `y` with `x % y` until `y` becomes 0.
