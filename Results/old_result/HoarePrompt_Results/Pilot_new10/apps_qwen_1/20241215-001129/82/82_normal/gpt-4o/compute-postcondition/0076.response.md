The code assigns the value of `current_lcm` to `func_2(new_a, new_b)`. This means that `current_lcm` is now the result of calling the function `func_2` with the arguments `new_a` and `new_b`. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`new_a` is \((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\), `new_b` is \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\), `current_lcm` is the value of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_lcm` and `min_k` are updated accordingly if `current_lcm` is smaller than `min_lcm` or equal to `min_lcm` but with a smaller `candidate` value than `min_k`, `diff` remains positive and divisible by `k + 2`, `k` is now `k + 2`, and `diff // (k + 1)` remains a positive integer.**
