`min_k` is assigned the value of `candidate`. The other variables remain unchanged based on their initial states. Therefore, the Output State is: `new_a` is \((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\), `new_b` is \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\), `current_lcm` is the value of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_lcm` is now `current_lcm`, `min_k` is now `candidate`, `diff` remains positive and divisible by `k + 2`, `k` is now `k + 2`, and `diff // (k + 1)` remains a positive integer.

Output State: **`new_a` is \((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\), `new_b` is \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\), `current_lcm` is the value of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_lcm` is the value of `current_lcm`, `min_k` is `candidate`, `diff` remains positive and divisible by `k + 2`, `k` is `k + 2`, and `diff // (k + 1)` remains a positive integer.**
