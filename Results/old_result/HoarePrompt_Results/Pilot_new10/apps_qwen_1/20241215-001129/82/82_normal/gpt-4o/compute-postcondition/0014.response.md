`min_k` is assigned the value of `candidate`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`new_a` is equal to `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `a` is its original value, `candidate` is its original value, `new_b` is equal to \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\), `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_lcm` is now equal to `current_lcm`, `min_k` is `candidate`**
