Postcondition: ***`new_a` is equal to `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `a` is its original value, `candidate` is its original value, `new_b` is equal to \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\), `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm` or (`current_lcm` is equal to `min_lcm` and `candidate` is less than `min_k`)**
