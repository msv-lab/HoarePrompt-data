Postcondition: ***`new_a` is \(((a + k - 1) // k * k + c - 1) // c * c\); `new_b` is \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\); `current_lcm` is the value of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_lcm` is updated to `current_lcm` and `min_k` is updated to the current `candidate` value, `diff` remains positive and divisible by `k + 1`, `k` is the next value after being incremented by 1, `diff // k` remains a positive integer. If `current_lcm` is smaller than `min_lcm` or equal to `min_lcm` but with a smaller `candidate` value than `min_k`, `min_lcm` and `min_k` are updated accordingly.***
