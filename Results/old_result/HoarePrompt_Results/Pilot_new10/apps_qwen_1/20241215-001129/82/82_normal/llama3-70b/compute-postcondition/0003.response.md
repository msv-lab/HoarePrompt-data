The code swaps the values of `a` and `b` using tuple unpacking. Initially, `a` is equal to `b`, and `b` is equal to `a % b`. Given that `b` must be non-zero, let's denote `a` as `x` and `b` as `y` where `y = x % y`. After executing the code:

- `a` will take the value of `b` which is `y`.
- `b` will take the value of `a % b` which is `x % y`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is `y`, `b` is `x % y`.

Output State: **`a` is `b`, `b` is `a % b`**
