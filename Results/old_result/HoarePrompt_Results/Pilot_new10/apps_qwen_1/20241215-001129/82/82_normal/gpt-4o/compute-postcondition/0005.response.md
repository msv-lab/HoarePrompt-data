The line `min_k = 0` assigns the value `0` to the variable `min_k`. This does not affect the values of `a`, `b`, `diff`, or `min_lcm`. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \le a \le 10^9\); `b` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \le b \le 10^9\) and \(a \neq b\); `diff` is the absolute difference between `a` and `b`; `min_lcm` is infinity (`float('inf')`); `min_k` is `0`.

Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \le a \le 10^9\); `b` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \le b \le 10^9\) and \(a \neq b\); `diff` is the absolute difference between `a` and `b`; `min_lcm` is infinity (`float('inf')`); `min_k` is `0`**.
