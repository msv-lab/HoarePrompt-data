The given code snippet updates the value of `new_a` based on the formula `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`. However, since the initial values of `a` and `candidate` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `new_a`. We can only express `new_a` in terms of `a` and `candidate`.

Let's go through the steps:

1. The formula `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate` is used to update `new_a`.
2. This formula ensures that `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`.

Since the exact values of `a` and `candidate` are not provided, we express `new_a` as `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.

Output State: **`new_a` is equal to `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `a` is its original value, and `candidate` is its original value.**
