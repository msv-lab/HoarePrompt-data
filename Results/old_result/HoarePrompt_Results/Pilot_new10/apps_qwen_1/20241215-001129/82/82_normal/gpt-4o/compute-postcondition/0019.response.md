The code updates the value of `current_lcm` to the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`. Since `new_a` is defined as \((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\) and `new_b` is also defined as \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\), their values remain unchanged. The function `func_2` is called with these updated values, but the actual value of `current_lcm` is not specified in the given information.

Output State: **`new_a` is equal to \((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\), `a` is its original value, `candidate` is the other value in the list `[k, diff // k]`, `new_b` is equal to \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\), `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`**.
