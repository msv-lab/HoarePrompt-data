`new_b` is assigned the value \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\). The previous value of `b` was \((b + k - 1) // k * k\), and `candidate` is the next value after `k` is incremented by 1. The calculation for `new_b` updates `b` based on `candidate`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is updated to \(((a + k - 1) // k * k + c - 1) // c * c\), `b` is updated to \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\), `diff` is positive and divisible by `k + 1`, `k` is the next value after being incremented by 1, `min_lcm` is the minimum value of `current_lcm` found during the loop executions, `min_k` is the corresponding `candidate` value when `min_lcm` is updated, `diff // k` must be a positive integer.**
