Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given States:
- `a` and `b` are updated to \((a + k - 1) // k * k\) and \((b + k - 1) // k * k\) respectively.
- `diff` is positive and divisible by `k + 1`.
- `k` is the last value it was updated to plus 1.
- `min_lcm` is the minimum value of `current_lcm` found during the loop executions.
- `min_k` is the corresponding `candidate` value when `min_lcm` is updated.

### Loop Statement:
```
for candidate in [k, diff // k]:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization of Variables**:
   - `a` and `b` are updated according to some formula involving `k`.
   - `diff` is already positive and divisible by `k + 1`.
   - `k` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - `min_lcm` and `min_k` are initialized or updated during the loop.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over `[k, diff // k]`.

3. **Variables in the Loop**:
   - `candidate` will take the values `k` and `diff // k` during each iteration.
   - For the loop to execute, `candidate` must be one of these two values.

4. **State Adjustments Needed**:
   - We need to ensure that both `k` and `diff // k` are valid candidates for the loop.
   - Since `k` is incremented by 1, we need to ensure `k` is valid.
   - We also need to ensure `diff // k` is a valid candidate, meaning it should be a positive integer.

Given these points, let's adjust the states:

### Final State Adjustment:
- `k` must be a valid value (it will be incremented by 1 from its previous value).
- `diff // k` must be a positive integer.

### Adjusted State:
State: **`a` and `b` are updated to \((a + k - 1) // k * k\) and \((b + k - 1) // k * k\) respectively, `diff` is positive and divisible by `k + 1`, `k` is the next value after being incremented by 1, `min_lcm` is the minimum value of `current_lcm` found during the loop executions, `min_k` is the corresponding `candidate` value when `min_lcm` is updated, `diff // k` must be a positive integer**.

This ensures that the loop can execute with the correct values for `candidate`.
