The code sets `min_k` to the value of `candidate`. This means `min_k` is now updated to the current value of `candidate`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`a` remains the same, `b` remains the same, `diff` remains the same, `k` remains the same, `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`, `min_k` is equal to `candidate`, `new_a` is equal to \((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\), `new_b` is updated to \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\), and `current_lcm` is the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`**
