The code snippet updates the value of `new_b` to \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\). This calculation is independent of the previous value of `new_b`, so the only change is in the value of `new_b`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `new_a` is \((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\)
- `new_b` is \((b + (k + 1) - 1) // (k + 1) * (k + 1) + (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\)
- `current_lcm` is the value of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`
- `min_lcm` and `min_k` are updated accordingly if `current_lcm` is smaller than `min_lcm` or equal to `min_lcm` but with a smaller `candidate` value than `min_k`
- `diff` remains positive and divisible by `k + 2`
- `k` is now `k + 2`
- `diff // (k + 1)` remains a positive integer

After running the code snippet:
- `new_b` is updated to \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\)

Output State: **`new_a` is \((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\), `new_b` is \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\), `current_lcm` is the value of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_lcm` and `min_k` are updated accordingly if `current_lcm` is smaller than `min_lcm` or equal to `min_lcm` but with a smaller `candidate` value than `min_k`, `diff` remains positive and divisible by `k + 2`, `k` is now `k + 2`, and `diff // (k + 1)` remains a positive integer.**
