You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Neko loves divisors. During the latest number theory lesson, he got an interesting exercise from his math teacher.

Neko has two integers $a$ and $b$. His goal is to find a non-negative integer $k$ such that the least common multiple of $a+k$ and $b+k$ is the smallest possible. If there are multiple optimal integers $k$, he needs to choose the smallest one.

Given his mathematical talent, Neko had no trouble getting Wrong Answer on this problem. Can you help him solve it?


-----Input-----

The only line contains two integers $a$ and $b$ ($1 \le a, b \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

Print the smallest non-negative integer $k$ ($k \ge 0$) such that the lowest common multiple of $a+k$ and $b+k$ is the smallest possible.

If there are many possible integers $k$ giving the same value of the least common multiple, print the smallest one.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 10

Output
2
Input
21 31

Output
9
Input
5 10

Output
0


-----Note-----

In the first test, one should choose $k = 2$, as the least common multiple of $6 + 2$ and $10 + 2$ is $24$, which is the smallest least common multiple possible.
Program:
```
import math

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().strip().split()
    a = int(data[0])
    b = int(data[1])
    print(func_3(a, b))

def func_1(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x

def func_2(x, y):
    return x * y // func_1(x, y)

def func_3(a, b):
    if a == b:
        return 0
    diff = abs(a - b)
    min_lcm = float('inf')
    min_k = 0
    for k in range(1, int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1):
        if diff % k == 0:
            for candidate in [k, diff // k]:
                new_a = (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
                new_b = (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
                current_lcm = func_2(new_a, new_b)
                if current_lcm < min_lcm or (current_lcm == min_lcm and candidate < min_k):
                    min_lcm = current_lcm
                    min_k = candidate
    return min_k


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided program seems to correctly implement the logic to find the smallest non-negative integer \( k \) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) is minimized. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **GCD Calculation**: The `func_1` function correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
2. **LCM Calculation**: The `func_2` function correctly calculates the LCM of two numbers using the relationship \( \text{LCM}(x, y) = \frac{x \times y}{\text{GCD}(x, y)} \).
3. **Optimal \( k \) Search**: In `func_3`, the program iterates through possible values of \( k \) from 1 up to the square root of the absolute difference between \( a \) and \( b \). This approach ensures that we efficiently explore potential candidates for \( k \).
4. **Candidate Selection**: For each \( k \), the program calculates the next multiple of \( k \) greater than or equal to \( a + k \) and \( b + k \). It then checks if the LCM of these multiples is smaller than the current minimum LCM found. If so, it updates the minimum LCM and corresponding \( k \).

To validate this, let's consider the examples provided:

- **Example 1: \( a = 6 \), \( b = 10 \)**
  - \( k = 2 \) gives LCM of \( 8 \) and \( 12 \), which is \( 24 \).
  - No other \( k \) provides a smaller LCM.

- **Example 2: \( a = 21 \), \( b = 31 \)**
  - \( k = 9 \) gives LCM of \( 30 \) and \( 40 \), which is \( 120 \).
  - No other \( k \) provides a smaller LCM.

- **Example 3: \( a = 5 \), \( b = 10 \)**
  - \( k = 0 \) gives LCM of \( 5 \) and \( 10 \), which is \( 10 \).
  - No other \( k \) provides a smaller LCM.

By checking the logic and running the program with various test cases, including edge cases like when \( a \) and \( b \) are equal or close together, the program consistently finds the correct minimal \( k \). Therefore, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().strip().split()
    a = int(data[0])
    b = int(data[1])
    print(func_3(a, b))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers where \(1 \le a, b \le 10^9\) and the function `func_1` is used to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.
def func_1(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`, `y` is 0.
    return x
    #The program returns x which is the GCD of the original values of x and y, and y is 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integers `x` and `y` and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. After the loop terminates, `x` contains the GCD of the original `x` and `y`, and `y` is set to 0. This is achieved through the Euclidean algorithm, which repeatedly replaces `x` with `y` and `y` with `x % y` until `y` becomes 0.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are positive integers.
def func_2(x, y):
    return x * y // func_1(x, y)
    #The program returns the integer division of x multiplied by y, where `func_1(x, y)` is 1 since `x` and `y` are positive integers and the function `func_1(x, y)` returns 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two positive integers `x` and `y`, multiplies them, and returns the result.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers such that \(1 \le a, b \le 10^9\).
def func_3(a, b):
    if (a == b) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: a and b are non-negative integers such that \(1 \le a, b \le 10^9\) and \(a \neq b\)
    diff = abs(a - b)
    min_lcm = float('inf')
    min_k = 0
    for k in range(1, int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1):
        if diff % k == 0:
            for candidate in [k, diff // k]:
                new_a = (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
                new_b = (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
                current_lcm = func_2(new_a, new_b)
                if (current_lcm < min_lcm or current_lcm == min_lcm and candidate <
                    min_k):
                    min_lcm = current_lcm
                    min_k = candidate
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` and `b` are non-negative integers such that they are aligned to multiples of `min_k` (the value of `min_k` found to minimize the LCM), `diff` is 0, `min_lcm` is the minimum least common multiple (LCM) found during the loop execution, and `min_k` is the factor corresponding to the smallest LCM.
    return min_k
    #The program returns min_k which is the value found to minimize the LCM
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b` such that \(1 \le a, b \le 10^9\). If `a` equals `b`, it returns 0. Otherwise, it finds the smallest value `min_k` that, when added to both `a` and `b`, results in numbers that are multiples of `min_k` and returns this `min_k` as it minimizes the least common multiple (LCM) of the adjusted `a` and `b`.
