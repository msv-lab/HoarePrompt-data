Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment was accurate because the annotated version of the code shows that the program does not correctly ensure that the calculated points form a triangle with the exact required area. Specifically, the condition `if abs(n1 * m) >= g:` is insufficient to guarantee that the points provided will form a triangle with the required area. For instance, consider the input `n=5`, `m=5`, and `k=8`. The area required is \( \frac{5*5}{8} = 3.125 \). The program calculates `n1`, `m1`, and `g` using the extended Euclidean algorithm, but it does not verify if the points `(0, 0)`, `(0, n1 * m // g)`, and `(m1 * m // g, 0)` actually form a triangle with the exact area of 3.125. Therefore, the program can incorrectly print "YES" and provide points that do not form a triangle with the correct area.
