Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the program does not correctly ensure that the points provided form a triangle with the exact required area. The annotated version of the code shows that the program calculates `n1`, `m1`, and `g` using the extended Euclidean algorithm, but it does not check if the points `(0, 0)`, `(0, n1 * m // g)`, and `(m1 * m // g, 0)` actually form a triangle with the required area of \(\frac{nm}{k}\). As shown in the example provided in the original assessment (input `n=5`, `m=5`, and `k=8`), the program incorrectly prints "YES" and provides points that do not form a triangle with the correct area. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
