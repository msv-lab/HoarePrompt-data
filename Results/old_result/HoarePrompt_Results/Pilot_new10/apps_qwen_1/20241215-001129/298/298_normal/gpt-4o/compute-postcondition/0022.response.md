Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, `area` is defined as `n * m / k`. The output depends on the following conditions:
- If `2 * area <= n`, the output is `'0 1'`.
- If `2 * area > n` and `2 * area <= m`, the output is `'1 2 * (n * m / k)'`.
- If `2 * area > m`, `m` is halved (`m // 2`), and the output is `'0 0'`.***

This postcondition summarizes the possible outputs based on the conditions specified in the if-else block, while maintaining the initial constraints on the variables.
