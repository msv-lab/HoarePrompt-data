Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to generate valid points for certain values of \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\) that result in a non-zero integer area. Hereâ€™s an example:

Consider the input `3 4 5`. The area required is \(\frac{3 \times 4}{5} = 2.4\), which is not an integer. Therefore, the correct output should be `NO`. However, the code incorrectly handles this case because it only checks if the area is an integer and prints `NO` if it is not, without considering the possibility of generating points for a non-integer area.

To fix this, the code needs to ensure that the area is an integer and then find valid points to form a triangle with that area. The current approach only checks for the integer condition and does not properly handle the case where the area is not an integer but still possible to form a triangle with the given constraints.
