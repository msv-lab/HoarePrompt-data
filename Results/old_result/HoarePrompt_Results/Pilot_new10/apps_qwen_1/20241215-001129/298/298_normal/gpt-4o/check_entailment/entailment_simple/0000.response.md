Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The annotated program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Specifically, the logic for determining the coordinates of the points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, and $(x_3, y_3)$ is flawed. Let's break down why:

1. **Area Calculation and Check**:
   - The area calculation is correct: `area = n * m / k`.
   - The check to ensure the area is an integer is also correct: `if (area != int(area)) : print('NO')`.

2. **Handling Area as Zero**:
   - When `area == 0`, printing "NO" is correct because the area cannot be zero unless either \(n\) or \(m\) is zero, which is not within the valid range \(1 \le n, m \le 10^9\).

3. **Finding Points**:
   - The logic for finding the points is problematic. The code tries to place points in specific locations but does not ensure that the area of the triangle will always be exactly \(\frac{nm}{k}\). For example:
     - If the code prints `print(f'{2 * area} 1')`, it assumes that placing a point at \((2 \cdot \text{area}, 1)\) will work, but this does not guarantee the correct area without further verification.
     - Similarly, the other conditions do not necessarily ensure that the area will be exactly \(\frac{nm}{k}\).

4. **Triangle Area Formula**:
   - The area of a triangle with vertices \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\) is given by:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \right|
     \]
   - The current implementation does not use this formula to ensure the area is exactly \(\frac{nm}{k}\).

5. **Specific Cases**:
   - Consider the case when \(n = 4\), \(m = 3\), and \(k = 3\):
     - The required area is \(\frac{4 \times 3}{3} = 4\).
     - The current code might output points like \((1, 0)\), \((2, 3)\), \((4, 1)\), but it does not guarantee these points form a triangle with the exact area of 4.
   - The current logic does not ensure that the chosen points will always satisfy the area requirement.

To meet the problem description correctly, the program needs to ensure that the area of the triangle formed by the points is exactly \(\frac{nm}{k}\) and that the points lie within the given bounds. A correct approach would involve using the triangle area formula and carefully selecting points to ensure the area is precisely \(\frac{nm}{k}\).
