Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle the case where \( \frac{nm}{k} \) is not an integer. According to the problem description, the area of the triangle should be exactly \( \frac{nm}{k} \). However, the code only checks if \( nm \% k \) is non-zero, which means it incorrectly prints "NO" even if \( \frac{nm}{k} \) is not an integer. This is evident from the following part of the code:

```python
if n * m % k:
    print('NO')
    exit()
```

This condition is checking if \( nm \% k \) is non-zero, but the problem requires \( \frac{nm}{k} \) to be an integer. Therefore, the code fails to correctly identify cases where \( \frac{nm}{k} \) is an integer but not a whole number, leading to incorrect outputs.

For example, consider the input \( n = 2, m = 3, k = 4 \):
- Here, \( nm = 6 \) and \( \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \), which is not an integer.
- The code would incorrectly print "NO" because \( 6 \% 4 \neq 0 \).

To fix this, the code should check if \( \frac{nm}{k} \) is an integer, i.e., \( nm \% k == 0 \).
