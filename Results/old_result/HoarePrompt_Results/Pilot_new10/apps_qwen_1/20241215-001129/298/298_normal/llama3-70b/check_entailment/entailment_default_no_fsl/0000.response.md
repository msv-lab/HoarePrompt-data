Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the code checks if `n * m % k == 0` and then proceeds to use the results from `func_3` to determine if the area condition can be met. However, the logic to check if the area condition can be met is flawed.

Hereâ€™s why the code is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Area Check**: The code checks if `abs(n1 * m) >= g`, where `g` is the result of `func_3(n, m)`. This check is not sufficient to ensure that the area of the triangle can be exactly `nm / k`.

2. **Triangle Area Calculation**: The code constructs a triangle with vertices at `(0, 0)`, `(0, n1 * m // g)`, and `(m1 * m // g, 0)`. However, this construction does not guarantee that the area of the triangle will be exactly `nm / k`. The area of the constructed triangle is `n1 * m1 * nm / g`, which simplifies to `nm * gcd(n, m) / g`. Since `g` is `gcd(n, m)`, the area simplifies to `nm`, which is always true, but it does not ensure the specific area condition required (`nm / k`).

To illustrate, consider the following counterexample:
- Input: `4 3 3`
- Expected Output: A triangle with area `4`, which is `nm / k = 4`.

However, the provided code constructs a triangle with vertices at `(0, 0)`, `(0, 4)`, and `(3, 0)`, which has an area of `6`, not `4`.

Thus, the code fails to meet the problem requirements for all potential cases, leading to an incorrect solution.
