The code `print(f'1 0')` simply prints the string '1 0' and does not affect the values of any variables. The precondition remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `area` is `n * m / k`, the output is '1 2 * (n * m / k)', and the condition `2 * area <= m` still holds true.**
