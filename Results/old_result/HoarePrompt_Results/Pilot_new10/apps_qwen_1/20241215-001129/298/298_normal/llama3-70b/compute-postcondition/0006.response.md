Let's analyze the given code and annotations step by step to determine the functionality of the function `func_2`.

### Analysis:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `a` and `b` are positive integers where \(1 \le a, b \le 10^9\) and \(b \neq 0\).

2. **Base Case**:
   - If `b == 0`, the function returns `(1, 0)`.
     - This means the function handles the case where `b` is zero directly by returning `(1, 0)`.

3. **Recursive Case**:
   - If `b != 0`, the function recursively calls itself with parameters `(b, a % b)`.
   - After the recursive call, it updates the values of `x` and `y` as follows:
     ```python
     x, y = func_2(b, a % b)
     return y, x - a // b * y
     ```
   - This is reminiscent of the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the coefficients `x` and `y` such that `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`.

### Potential Edge Cases and Missing Logic:

- **Base Case Handling**: The base case correctly handles the situation when `b` is zero by returning `(1, 0)`.
- **Recursive Case**: The recursive case handles the general case where `b` is not zero by using the properties of the Euclidean algorithm.
- **Constraints**: The constraints \(1 \le a, b \le 10^9\) and \(b \neq 0\) are respected by the code.

### Functionality Summary:

The function `func_2` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` within the specified constraints and uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the GCD of `a` and `b` along with the coefficients `x` and `y` such that `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`. If `b` is zero, it directly returns `(1, 0)`. Otherwise, it performs a recursive call and updates the values of `x` and `y` accordingly.

### Conclusion:

Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` and returns a tuple `(x, y)` where `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`. If `b` is zero, it returns `(1, 0)`.**
