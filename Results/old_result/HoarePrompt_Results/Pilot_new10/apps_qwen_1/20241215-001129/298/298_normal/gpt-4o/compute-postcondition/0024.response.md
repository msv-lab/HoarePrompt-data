Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, and `area` is defined as `n * m / k`. The overall state of the program is as follows:
- If `area` is not an integer, the console prints 'NO'.
- If `area` equals 0, the output is determined by the initial values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
- If `area` is not 0:
  - `'0 1'` if `2 * area <= n`.
  - `'1 2 * (n * m / k)'` if `2 * area > n` and `2 * area <= m`.
  - `'0 0'` if `2 * area > m` and `m` is halved (`m // 2`).***
