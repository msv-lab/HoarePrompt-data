Functionality: **The function `func_3` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` (where \(1 \le a, b \le 10^9\)). It calls another function `func_2(a, b)` which returns two values `x` and `y`. The function then returns these two values along with their linear combination `x*a + y*b`.** 

This summary includes the fact that the function calls `func_2(a, b)` and returns the result of this call along with the linear combination of `x` and `y` with `a` and `b`, respectively. It also adheres to the format and covers all the potential cases mentioned in the code and annotations.
