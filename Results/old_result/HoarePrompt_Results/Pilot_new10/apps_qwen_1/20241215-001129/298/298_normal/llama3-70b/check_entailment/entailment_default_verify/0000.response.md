Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the program does not ensure that the calculated points form a triangle with the exact required area. The output hints show that `func_3` correctly computes the coefficients using the extended Euclidean algorithm, but the program does not validate whether the area condition is met. Specifically, the condition `abs(n1 * m) >= g` is insufficient to guarantee that the points form a triangle with the exact required area. The program could still output invalid points even if the area condition is not met precisely. Therefore, the original assessment is correct in pointing out that the program does not handle this critical aspect properly.
