Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case. Specifically, the code checks if `n * m % k == 0` to determine if a solution exists. However, even if `n * m % k == 0`, the code does not guarantee that a valid set of points can be found. 

For instance, consider the case where \( n = 4 \), \( m = 4 \), and \( k = 7 \). Here, \( nm = 16 \) and \( nm / k = 16 / 7 \), which is an integer. According to the problem description, there should be no solution since the area of the triangle cannot be exactly \( nm / k \) with the given constraints. However, the code incorrectly prints "YES" and provides some coordinates, indicating that it does not handle this edge case properly.

Additionally, the code does not ensure that the calculated points form a triangle with the exact specified area. The logic to generate the points is based on the outputs of the helper functions, but it does not validate if the area condition is met precisely. This oversight leads to potential incorrect outputs for various inputs, making the program incorrect according to the problem description.
