Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to check if the calculated area \(\frac{nm}{k}\) can form a valid triangle with integer coordinates. Let's analyze this:

1. **Area Calculation**: The program correctly checks if \(nm \mod k \neq 0\), which means if \(nm\) is not divisible by \(k\), it prints "NO" immediately. This part is correct.

2. **Triangle Formation**: The program then attempts to calculate \(n1, m1, g\) using `func_3`, but it does not ensure that the points \((0, 0)\), \((0, n1 * m // g)\), and \((m1 * m // g, 0)\) actually form a triangle with the required area. It assumes that these points will always form a valid triangle, which is not guaranteed.

For example, consider the following input:
- \(n = 5\), \(m = 5\), \(k = 3\)

Here, \(nm = 25\) and \(\frac{25}{3}\) is approximately \(8.33\), so the area should be 8.33. However, the program will calculate \(n1, m1, g\) and then use these values to form the points \((0, 0)\), \((0, 8)\), and \((8, 0)\), which do not form a triangle with the required area because the area of the triangle formed by these points is exactly 8, not 8.33.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases, and therefore, the correctness is **False**.
