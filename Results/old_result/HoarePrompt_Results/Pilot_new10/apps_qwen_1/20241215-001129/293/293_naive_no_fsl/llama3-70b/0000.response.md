Correctness: **False**

The program provided does not correctly implement the algorithm described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic inside the while loop does not accurately simulate the traversal of the tree as per the given rules.

For instance, consider the input `2 3`. According to the problem description, Amr should follow the sequence "LRLRLRL...". Let's trace the steps:

1. Start at the root (node 1).
2. First command 'L': Go to the left child of node 1 (node 2).
3. Second command 'R': Go to the right child of node 2 (node 3), which is the exit.

So, Amr visits nodes 1 and 2 before reaching the exit. This means the answer should be 2. However, the provided program outputs 5 for this input, which is incorrect.

The program incorrectly calculates the number of nodes visited by always adding `n // 2 - 1` or `n // 2` without considering the actual traversal rules and skipping mechanisms. This leads to an incorrect count of visited nodes for many cases, making the program incorrect.
