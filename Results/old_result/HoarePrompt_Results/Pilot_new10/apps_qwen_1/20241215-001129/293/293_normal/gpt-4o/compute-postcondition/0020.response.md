`visited_count` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `visited_count` is 3, so after incrementing, `visited_count` becomes 4. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `total_leaves` is \(2^h\), `visited_count` is 4, `path` is a non-empty list with two less elements, `current_level` is 1, and `current_node` is either \(2 \times current_node + 1\) or 4 depending on the next `direction`.
