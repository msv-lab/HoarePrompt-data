The code `current_node = 2 * current_node + 1` updates the value of `current_node` based on its previous value. Given the initial state, `current_node` was 0. Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

- `current_node` is updated to `2 * 0 + 1`, which equals 1.

The values of the other variables (`total_leaves`, `visited_count`, `path`, `current_level`, and `direction`) remain unchanged because they are not affected by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`total_leaves` is \(2^h\), `visited_count` is 1, `path` is non-empty, `current_level` is 0, `current_node` is 1, and `direction` is '0'.**
