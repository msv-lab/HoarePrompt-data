The variable `visited_count` is initialized to 0. This assignment does not affect the values of `h`, `n`, or `total_leaves`. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`h` is an integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 50; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ \(2^h\); `total_leaves` is \(2^h\); `visited_count` is 0**
