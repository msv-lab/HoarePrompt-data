The code `n //= 2` divides `n` by 2 and rounds down to the nearest whole number, updating `n` with the result. The value of `ans` is dependent on the initial value of `n`.

Since the initial state is that `n` must be greater than 1 and `ans` is updated based on whether `n` is even or odd, let's consider the impact of this operation:

1. If `n` was initially even, `ans` was incremented by `(n // 2 - 1)`.
2. If `n` was initially odd, `ans` was incremented by `n // 2`.

After executing `n //= 2`, the new value of `n` will be the result of `n` divided by 2 and rounded down. However, the exact value of `n` and the updated value of `ans` depend on the initial value of `n`.

Let's denote the initial value of `n` as `n_initial`. The output state will be:

- `n` is now `n_initial // 2`.
- The value of `ans` remains unchanged unless the condition for updating `ans` changes due to the new value of `n`.

Given these points, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is `n_initial // 2`; `ans` is updated based on the initial value of `n_initial` (if `n_initial` was even, `ans` was incremented by `(n_initial // 2 - 1)`; if `n_initial` was odd, `ans` was incremented by `n_initial // 2`).**
