`ans` is incremented by `n // 2`. The value of `n` is greater than 1, so `n // 2` is a positive integer less than `n`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 1; `ans` is `ans + n // 2`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `ans` is `ans + n // 2`**
