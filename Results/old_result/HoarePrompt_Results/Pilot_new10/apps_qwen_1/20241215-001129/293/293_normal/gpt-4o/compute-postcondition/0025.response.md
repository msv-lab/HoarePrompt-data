The code `print(visited_count)` simply prints the value of `visited_count`, which is \(h\). Since printing does not assign a new value to any variable, the value of `visited_count` remains unchanged. All other variables also remain in their initial states.

Output State: **`total_leaves` is \(2^h\), `visited_count` is \(h\), `path` is an empty list, `current_level` is \(h-1\), and `current_node` is the node reached by traversing the path represented by `path`.**
