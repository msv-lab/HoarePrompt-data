`result` is assigned the value of `result * base + digit`. The previous value of `result` is the second element in the `digits` list. The new value of `result` will be the second element of `digits` multiplied by `base` and then added to `digit`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `digits` is a non-empty list with at least two elements; `base` is an integer representing the base of the number system (2 ≤ base ≤ 40); `result` is the value of the second element of `digits` * `base` + `digit`.

Output State: **`digits` is a non-empty list with at least two elements; `base` is an integer representing the base of the number system (2 ≤ base ≤ 40); `result` is the value of the second element of `digits` * `base` + `digit`**
