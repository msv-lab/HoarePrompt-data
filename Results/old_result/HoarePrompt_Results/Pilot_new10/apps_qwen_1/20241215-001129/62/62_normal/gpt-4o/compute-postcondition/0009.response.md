The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `digits`, which is a list of integers representing the digits of a number in a given base, and `base`, which is an integer representing the base of the number system (2 ≤ base ≤ 40). The list `digits` does not contain leading zeros, and all its elements are within the valid range for the given base (0 ≤ digit < base). The function returns the decimal representation of the number formed by the digits in the list `digits` when interpreted in the given base `base`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `digits` and an integer `base`, and returns the decimal representation of the number formed by the digits in `digits` when interpreted in the given base `base`.**
