Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input according to the problem description. It reads the number of digits `n` and the base `bx` for the first number, followed by the digits themselves. Similarly, it reads the number of digits `m` and the base `by` for the second number, followed by the digits themselves.

2. **Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` converts a list of digits (in a given base) to its corresponding decimal value. This function works as intended, iterating over each digit and computing the number in the target base. The function correctly handles the conversion process without leading zeros.

3. **Comparison Logic**: After converting both numbers to their decimal representations, the program compares them using the standard comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `=`) and prints the appropriate character.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as different bases and digit lengths correctly. Since the bases are between 2 and 40, and the digits are valid within the respective bases, the program will handle all valid inputs as per the problem description.

Since the program correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases, it is deemed correct.
