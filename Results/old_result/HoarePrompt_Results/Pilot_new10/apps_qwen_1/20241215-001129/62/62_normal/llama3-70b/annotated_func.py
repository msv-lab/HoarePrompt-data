#State of the program right berfore the function call: digits is a list of integers representing the digits of a number in a specific base, and base is an integer representing the base of the number system (2 ≤ base ≤ 40). The list digits does not contain leading zeros, and all digits are less than the base.
def func_1(digits, base):
    result = 0
    for digit in digits:
        result = result * base + digit
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `digits` is a non-empty list, `base` is an integer representing the base of the number system (2 ≤ base ≤ 40), `result` is the number represented by the list `digits` in the specified base.
    return result
    #The program returns the number represented by the list 'digits' in the specified base 'base'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `digits` and an integer `base`, and returns the number represented by the list `digits` in the specified base `base`.
