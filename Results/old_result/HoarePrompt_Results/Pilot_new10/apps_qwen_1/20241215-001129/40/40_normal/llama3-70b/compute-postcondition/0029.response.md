The given code snippet does not contain any executable statements; it only defines the `substr` variable as a slice of the string `s` from index `i` to `j`. Since there are no operations that change the values of the variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **- `i` remains the same. - `n` remains the same. - `max_len` remains the same unless it was updated during the loop. - `substr` is now the substring from index `i` to `i + 1`.**
