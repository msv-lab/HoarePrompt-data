The code updates the value of `max_len` to be the maximum of `max_len` and the length of `substr`. Given the initial state, `max_len` is initially 0, and `substr` is a substring of `s` starting from index 0 and ending just before index `j`. Since `substr` is not equal to its reverse, its length is at least 1 (as an empty string would be equal to its reverse).

Thus, `max_len` will be updated to the length of `substr`, which is at least 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `max_len` is `len(substr)`, `substr` is a substring of `s` starting from index 0 and ending just before index `j`.**
