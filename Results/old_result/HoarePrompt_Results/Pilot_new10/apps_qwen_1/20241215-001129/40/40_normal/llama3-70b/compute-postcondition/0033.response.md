Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understand the initial state:**
   - `max_len` is the length of the longest palindromic substring found in `s` from index `i` to index `n-1`.
   - `substr` is the longest palindromic substring found in `s` from index `i` to index `n-1`.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `n` is a positive integer.

2. **Analyze the for loop:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from 0 to `n-1`.

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Update the state:**
   - Since `i` is currently `n`, it needs to be decreased to a value less than `n` for the loop to continue.
   - Therefore, `i` should be `n-1`.

5. **Adjust the other variables:**
   - `max_len` and `substr` are determined based on the current value of `i` and `n`, so they remain unchanged unless the loop body changes them.
   - `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

6. **Final state before the next iteration:**
   - `max_len` remains the same.
   - `substr` remains the same.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `n` is still a positive integer.

Therefore, the updated state is:

**State: `max_len` is the length of the longest palindromic substring found in `s` from index `i` to index `n-1`, `substr` is the longest palindromic substring found in `s` from index `i` to index `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is a positive integer.**
