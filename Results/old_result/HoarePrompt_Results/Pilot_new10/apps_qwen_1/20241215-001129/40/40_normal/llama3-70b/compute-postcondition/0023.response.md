Postcondition: ***`i` is not equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `max_len` is the length of the longest palindromic substring found in `s`, and `substr` is a substring of `s` from index `i` to index `j-1`. If `substr` is not equal to its reverse, then `max_len` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `j - i`. There is no change to the values if `substr` is equal to its reverse.***
