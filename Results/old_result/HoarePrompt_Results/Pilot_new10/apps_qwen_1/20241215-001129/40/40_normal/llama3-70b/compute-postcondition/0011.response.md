The code updates `max_len` to be the maximum of its current value and the length of `substr`. Given that `substr` is an empty string (`""`), `len(substr)` is 0. Since `max_len` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, and `n` must be greater than 0, the value of `max_len` will not change because the new value (0) is not greater than the previous value of `max_len`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `max_len` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `substr` is an empty string if `s` is not empty.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `max_len` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `substr` is an empty string if `s` is not empty.**
