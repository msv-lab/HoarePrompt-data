The code updates `max_len` to be the maximum of its current value and the length of `substr`. Given the initial state where `substr` is a substring of `s` from index `i` to index `j-1`, the length of `substr` is `j - i`.

Since `substr` is a substring, `len(substr)` is a positive integer representing the number of characters in `substr`. `max_len` will now be updated to be the maximum of its original value (`max_len`) and the length of `substr`.

Therefore, the output state will be:

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `max_len` is max(`max_len`, `j - i`), `substr` is a substring of `s` from index `i` to index `j-1`**
