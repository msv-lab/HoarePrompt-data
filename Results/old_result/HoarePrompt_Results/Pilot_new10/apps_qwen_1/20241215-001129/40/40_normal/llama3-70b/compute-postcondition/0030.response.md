The code updates `max_len` to be the maximum of its current value and the length of `substr`. Since `substr` is defined as the substring from index `i` to `i + 1`, its length is 2. However, the exact values of `max_len` and `i` are not specified in the initial state, so we can only say that `max_len` will be updated to the maximum of its current value and 2.

Output State: **`max_len` is updated to max(`max_len`, 2), `i` remains the same, `n` remains the same, `substr` is now the substring from index `i` to `i + 1`.**
