The code updates the `max_len` variable to be the maximum value between the current `max_len` and the length of the `substr`. Given the initial conditions:

- `i` is not equal to `n`
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `max_len` is the length of the longest palindromic substring found in `s`
- `substr` is the substring of `s` from index `i` to index `j`

The impact of the code is to update `max_len` to the maximum of its current value and the length of `substr`.

Since `max_len` is initially the length of the longest palindromic substring found in `s`, and `len(substr)` is the length of the current substring `substr`, `max_len` will be updated to the larger of these two lengths.

Output State: **`i` is not equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `max_len` is the maximum of the current `max_len` and the length of `substr`, `substr` is the substring of `s` from index `i` to index `j`.**
