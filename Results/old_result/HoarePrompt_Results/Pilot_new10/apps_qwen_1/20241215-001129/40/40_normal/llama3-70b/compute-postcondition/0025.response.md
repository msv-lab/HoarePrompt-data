The code assigns the substring of `s` from index `i` to index `j` to the variable `substr`. The original `substr` variable, which was a substring of `s` from index `i` to index `j`, remains unchanged in terms of its reference to the substring, but its name is now reassigned to the new substring value.

The states of other variables (`i`, `n`, `max_len`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is not equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `max_len` is the length of the longest palindromic substring found in `s`, and `substr` is now the substring of `s` from index `i` to index `j`.**
