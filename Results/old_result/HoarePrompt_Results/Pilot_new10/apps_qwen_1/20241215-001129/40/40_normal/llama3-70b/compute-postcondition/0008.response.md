Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `max_len` is the maximum length between the original `max_len` (which is 0) and the length of `substr` (which is `len(substr)`), and `substr` is a substring of `s` starting from index 0 and ending just before index `j`. If `substr` is not equal to its reverse, `max_len` is updated to `len(substr)`.***
