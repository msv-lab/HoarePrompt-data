The code `substr = s[i:j]` assigns a substring of the string `s` from index `i` to index `j-1` (since Python slicing is inclusive of the start index and exclusive of the end index) to the variable `substr`. However, the indices `i` and `j` are not specified in the given code snippet. Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `i` and `j`, we cannot determine the exact value of `substr`. The only thing we can say is that `substr` now holds a substring of `s` starting from index `i` and ending at index `j-1`.

Given this, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `max_len` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `substr` is an empty string if `s` is not empty and must not be equal to its reverse, `substr` is a substring of `s` from index `i` to index `j-1`**
