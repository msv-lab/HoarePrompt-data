Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `max_len` is the length of the longest palindromic substring found in `s`, and `substr` is the longest palindromic substring found.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initial State**: `s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, `n` must be greater than 0, and `max_len` is 0.
2. **Loop Code**: The loop iterates over all possible substrings of `s` starting from index `i` to `j` where `j` ranges from `i+1` to `n`.

3. **First Iteration**:
   - For `i=0`, the loop checks substrings `s[0:1]`, `s[0:2]`, ..., `s[0:n]`.
   - `max_len` is updated whenever a palindromic substring longer than the current `max_len` is found.
   - After the first iteration, `i` becomes 1.

4. **Second Iteration**:
   - For `i=1`, the loop checks substrings `s[1:2]`, `s[1:3]`, ..., `s[1:n]`.
   - `max_len` is updated if a longer palindromic substring is found.
   - After the second iteration, `i` becomes 2.

5. **General Iteration**:
   - The loop continues until `i` reaches `n-1`.
   - After `i` reaches `n`, the loop terminates.
   - At this point, `i` is `n`, and `max_len` contains the length of the longest palindromic substring found in `s`.

6. **Substring (`substr`)**:
   - The `substr` that resulted in updating `max_len` is the longest palindromic substring found.

7. **Case When Loop Does Not Execute**:
   - If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute at all.
   - In this case, `i` remains 0, `max_len` remains 0, and `substr` is not defined (or can be considered as an empty string).

Thus, the final output state is that `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `max_len` is the length of the longest palindromic substring found in `s`, and `substr` is the longest palindromic substring found.
