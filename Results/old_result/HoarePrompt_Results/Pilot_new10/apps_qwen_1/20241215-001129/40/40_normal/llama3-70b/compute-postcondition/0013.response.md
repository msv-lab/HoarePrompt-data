According to the code, the loop depends on the variables `i`, `n`, and the substring logic defined by `substr`. The loop starts from `j = i + 1` and goes up to `j = n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions hold:
- `i` is 0
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `max_len` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration
- `substr` is an empty string if `s` is not empty. If `substr` is not equal to its reverse, the postcondition holds true as per the if part's description; otherwise, no change occurs since there is no else part provided.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must be met:
- `i` must remain 0 (since the loop starts from `i + 1` and increases `j` in each iteration)
- `n` must be greater than 0 (to ensure there are more elements to iterate over)
- `max_len` remains unchanged
- `substr` must not be equal to its reverse, because if it is, the loop would not continue based on the given conditions.

State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `max_len` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `substr` is an empty string if `s` is not empty and must not be equal to its reverse**
