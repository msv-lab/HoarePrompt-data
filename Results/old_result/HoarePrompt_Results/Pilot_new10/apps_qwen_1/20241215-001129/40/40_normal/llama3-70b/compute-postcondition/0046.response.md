Postcondition: ***`max_len` is the maximum of its current value and 0; `substr` is a substring of `s` from index `i` to `j-1`; `i` is `n`; `n` is a positive integer. If `substr` is not equal to its reverse (`substr` != `substr[::-1]`), then `max_len` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `j - i`. Otherwise, the postcondition remains unchanged.***
