According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`, which is the length of the string `s`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 because the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters.
- `n` is the length of `s`.
- `max_len` is 0.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state such that `n` is greater than 0. The value of `max_len` and the content of `s` do not directly affect whether the loop can execute, as long as `s` is a non-empty string (which implies `n` is at least 1).

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` must be greater than 0, `max_len` is 0**
