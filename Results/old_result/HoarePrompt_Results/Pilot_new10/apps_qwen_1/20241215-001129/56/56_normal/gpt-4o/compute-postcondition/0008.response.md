Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The initial state at the end of the previous iteration is given as follows:
   - `n` is an integer.
   - `i` is an integer.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the range from 60 to -1 in reverse order. This means the loop starts with `i = 60` and decreases `i` by 1 in each iteration until `i` reaches 0.

3. **Loop Body**: The problem statement mentions that if the `i`-th bit of `n` is set (i.e., equals 1), no changes are made to `n`. If the `i`-th bit of `n` is not set (i.e., equals 0), no changes are made to `n` as well because there is no else part. 

4. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to continue executing, `i` must be decremented and checked in the next iteration. Since the loop decreases `i` by 1 in each iteration, `i` will be 59 at the start of the next iteration.

5. **State Adjustment**: Since the loop condition only involves decrementing `i` and checking its value, the value of `n` does not change in this loop. Therefore, `n` remains the same.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated value of `i`.

**State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is 59**
