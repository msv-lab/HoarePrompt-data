The code `print(' '.join(map(str, a)))` joins the elements of the list `a` into a single string with each element separated by a space and then prints it. Since `a` is a list of the first `k` zeros in descending order, let's assume `k` is known (for example, `k=5` would make `a=[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`). The print statement does not affect the values of `n`, `i`, or `'Yes'`. Therefore, the only change is in the output, which is the string representation of the list `a`.

Assuming `k=5` for illustration:

- Initial State: `n` is 0, `a` is `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, `i` is the number of iterations performed, and 'Yes' is printed to the console.

After executing the code:
- The list `a` remains unchanged: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
- The number of iterations `i` remains unchanged.
- 'Yes' is still printed to the console.

The output of the print statement is the string `"0 0 0 0 0"`.

Output State: **`n` is 0, `a` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `i` is the number of iterations performed, and 'Yes' is printed to the console.**
