The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Since `i` was not defined in the initial state and no value was assigned to it before this line of code, we can assume `i` starts as 0 (as is common in many programming contexts). After executing `i += 1`, the value of `i` becomes 1. The values of `n`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is 2; `x` is 3; `a` is a list containing 3; `i` is 1**
