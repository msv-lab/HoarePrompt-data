Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer obtained from user input, 1 ≤ `n` ≤ \(10^{18}\), `k` is an integer obtained from user input, 1 ≤ `k` ≤ \(10^{5}\), and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`; `a` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `x` is `n.bit_length() - 1`. The current value of `x` is less than or equal to `i`***
