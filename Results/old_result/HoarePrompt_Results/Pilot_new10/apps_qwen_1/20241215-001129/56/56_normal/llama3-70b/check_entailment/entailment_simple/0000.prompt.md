You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Jamie is preparing a Codeforces round. He has got an idea for a problem, but does not know how to solve it. Help him write a solution to the following problem:

Find k integers such that the sum of two to the power of each number equals to the number n and the largest integer in the answer is as small as possible. As there may be multiple answers, you are asked to output the lexicographically largest one. 

To be more clear, consider all integer sequence with length k (a_1, a_2, ..., a_{k}) with $\sum_{i = 1}^{k} 2^{a_{i}} = n$. Give a value $y = \operatorname{max}_{1 \leq i \leq k} a_{i}$ to each sequence. Among all sequence(s) that have the minimum y value, output the one that is the lexicographically largest.

For definitions of powers and lexicographical order see notes.


-----Input-----

The first line consists of two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5) — the required sum and the length of the sequence.


-----Output-----

Output "No" (without quotes) in a single line if there does not exist such sequence. Otherwise, output "Yes" (without quotes) in the first line, and k numbers separated by space in the second line — the required sequence.

It is guaranteed that the integers in the answer sequence fit the range [ - 10^18, 10^18].


-----Examples-----
Input
23 5

Output
Yes
3 3 2 1 0 

Input
13 2

Output
No

Input
1 2

Output
Yes
-1 -1 



-----Note-----

Sample 1:

2^3 + 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0 = 8 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 23

Answers like (3, 3, 2, 0, 1) or (0, 1, 2, 3, 3) are not lexicographically largest.

Answers like (4, 1, 1, 1, 0) do not have the minimum y value.

Sample 2:

It can be shown there does not exist a sequence with length 2.

Sample 3:

$2^{-1} + 2^{-1} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1$

Powers of 2:

If x > 0, then 2^{x} = 2·2·2·...·2 (x times).

If x = 0, then 2^{x} = 1.

If x < 0, then $2^{x} = \frac{1}{2^{-x}}$.

Lexicographical order:

Given two different sequences of the same length, (a_1, a_2, ... , a_{k}) and (b_1, b_2, ... , b_{k}), the first one is smaller than the second one for the lexicographical order, if and only if a_{i} < b_{i}, for the first i where a_{i} and b_{i} differ.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, and k is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5.
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if (n < k) :
        print('No')
    else :
        a = []
        i = 0
        while n > 0:
            x = n.bit_length() - 1
            
            if x <= i:
                break
            
            a.append(x)
            
            n -= 2 ** x
            
            i += 1
            
        #State of the program after the loop has been executed: To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations, let's analyze the behavior of the loop step by step.
        #
        #### Step-by-Step Analysis
        #
        #1. **Initialization**:
        #   - `n` is an integer with \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\).
        #   - `k` is an integer with \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\), and `n \geq k`.
        #   - `a` is an empty list.
        #   - `i` is 0.
        #
        #2. **Loop Execution**:
        #   - The loop continues as long as `n > 0`.
        #   - In each iteration:
        #     - `x = n.bit_length() - 1`: This calculates the highest bit position set in `n`.
        #     - If `x <= i`, the loop breaks.
        #     - Otherwise, `a.append(x)`: Adds the value of `x` to the list `a`.
        #     - `n -= 2 ** x`: Decrements `n` by the value of \(2^x\).
        #     - `i += 1`: Increments the index `i`.
        #
        #3. **Observations from Example Iterations**:
        #   - After 1 iteration: `n` becomes `n - 2`, `i` is increased by 1.
        #   - After 2 iterations: `n` remains unchanged (since the next `x` would not satisfy the condition to append to `a`), `i` is increased by 1.
        #   - After 3 iterations: `n` becomes 2, `x` is 3, `a` contains [3], and `i` is 1.
        #
        #4. **General Pattern**:
        #   - The loop extracts the highest bit set in `n` and appends it to `a` until no more bits are left.
        #   - The loop terminates when `n` becomes 0 or when the highest bit is less than or equal to `i`.
        #
        #5. **Final State**:
        #   - When the loop terminates, `n` will be 0.
        #   - `a` will contain a list of integers representing the highest bits extracted from `n` in descending order.
        #   - `i` will be the number of iterations performed.
        #
        #### Final Output State
        #
        #Given the above analysis, the final output state after all iterations of the loop will be:
        #
        #**Output State: `n` is 0, `a` is a list of integers representing the highest bits extracted from the original value of `n` in descending order, and `i` is the number of iterations performed.**
        if (len(a) < k) :
            print('No')
        else :
            a = a[:k]
            a.sort(reverse=True)
            print('Yes')
            print(' '.join(map(str, a)))
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is 0, `a` is a list of integers representing the highest bits extracted from the original value of `n` in descending order, and `i` is the number of iterations performed. If the length of `a` is less than `k`, the string 'No' is printed. Otherwise, 'Yes' is printed.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer obtained from user input, 1 ≤ `n` ≤ \(10^{18}\), `k` is an integer obtained from user input, 1 ≤ `k` ≤ \(10^{5}\). If `n` is less than `k`, 'No' is printed. Otherwise, `n` is 0, `a` is a list of integers representing the highest bits extracted from the original value of `n` in descending order, `i` is the number of iterations performed, and if the length of `a` is less than `k`, 'No' is printed. Otherwise, 'Yes' is printed.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
