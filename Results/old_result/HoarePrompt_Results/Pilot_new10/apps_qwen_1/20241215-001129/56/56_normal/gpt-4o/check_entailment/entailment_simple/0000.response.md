Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of why it works as expected:

1. **Reading Input**: 
   - The program reads the input and extracts `n` and `k`. It ensures that both `n` and `k` are within their respective bounds.
   
2. **Bit Manipulation**:
   - The program uses bit manipulation to identify the positions of the bits set to 1 in `n`. Specifically, it iterates through the bits from 60 down to 0 and appends the positions of these bits to the `bits` list if they are set.
   - This step correctly identifies the binary representation of `n` and stores the relevant positions.

3. **Validation**:
   - The program checks if the number of bits identified (`len(bits)`) is greater than `k`. If so, it returns "No", indicating that it's impossible to form a sequence of length `k` with the given `n`.
   - This validation ensures that the problem constraints are met.

4. **Extending the Sequence**:
   - If the length of `bits` is less than `k`, the program extends the sequence by reducing the largest bit by 1 and appending it twice. This ensures that the sum of the resulting sequence still matches `n` while making the largest element as small as possible.
   - This step ensures that the sequence has the required length `k`.

5. **Lexicographical Sorting**:
   - The sequence is then sorted in reverse order to ensure that the sequence is lexicographically largest among all valid sequences.
   - This sorting ensures that the sequence is the lexicographically largest possible.

6. **Returning the Result**:
   - Finally, the program returns "Yes" followed by the constructed sequence in the required format.

### Edge Cases and Correctness:

- **Case 1**: When `n` is a power of 2 and `k` is large enough to accommodate this.
  - The program correctly identifies the single bit position and extends the sequence if necessary.
  
- **Case 2**: When `n` requires multiple bits and `k` is sufficient.
  - The program correctly constructs the sequence by adjusting the largest bit and ensuring the sequence length is `k`.
  
- **Case 3**: When `n` cannot be represented with `k` bits.
  - The program correctly returns "No".
  
- **Case 4**: When `n` is a small number and `k` is very large.
  - The program correctly handles the extension of the sequence by reducing the largest bit.

In summary, the program accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all potential cases as required. Therefore, the correctness of the program is confirmed as **True**.
