`smallest` is assigned the value of the last element in `bits` and then `bits` is modified by removing that last element. The original values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer, `k` is a positive integer, `bits` is a list containing the indices of the bits set to 1 in `n` with the smallest index removed, and `smallest` is the index of the bit that was removed from `bits`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is a positive integer, `bits` is a list containing the indices of the bits set to 1 in `n` with the smallest index removed, `smallest` is the index of the bit that was removed from `bits`.**
