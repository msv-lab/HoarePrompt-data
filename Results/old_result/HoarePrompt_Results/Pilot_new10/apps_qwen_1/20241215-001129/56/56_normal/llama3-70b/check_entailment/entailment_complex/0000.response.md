Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Here's a detailed explanation of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers, `n` and `k`, from the standard input. These values meet the constraints specified in the problem description: \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\).

2. **Base Case Check**: The program checks if \(n < k\). If true, it immediately prints "No" because it is impossible to represent \(n\) using exactly \(k\) terms. This satisfies the requirement to output "No" if such a sequence does not exist.

3. **Bit Extraction Loop**:
   - The loop extracts the highest bit set in `n` and appends it to the list `a`. This is done by calculating `x = n.bit_length() - 1`, which gives the position of the highest set bit in `n`.
   - The loop continues as long as `n > 0` and the highest bit (`x`) is greater than `i`. Once a bit is used, `n` is decremented by \(2^x\), effectively removing the highest bit from `n`.
   - The loop terminates when `n` becomes 0 or when no more higher bits are available.

4. **Validation and Output**:
   - After the loop, the program checks if the length of `a` is less than `k`. If true, it prints "No" because we cannot form a sequence of length `k` with the bits extracted.
   - If the length of `a` is at least `k`, the program truncates `a` to the first `k` elements and sorts them in descending order to ensure lexicographical maximality.
   - Finally, it prints "Yes" followed by the truncated and sorted list of bits.

### Key Points:
- **Correctness of Bit Extraction**: The loop correctly extracts the highest bits of `n` and ensures they are stored in descending order.
- **Handling Edge Cases**: The program handles the case where \(n < k\) correctly by printing "No".
- **Lexicographical Maximality**: By sorting the bits in descending order and truncating to the first `k` elements, the program ensures the lexicographically largest sequence is produced.
- **Output Format**: The program adheres to the specified output format, printing "Yes" followed by the required sequence or "No" if applicable.

Given the above points, the program meets all the requirements of the problem description and produces the correct output for every valid input. Therefore, the program is correct.
