To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions under which the loop `while n > 0:` will run.

The loop will execute as long as `n > 0`. Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer obtained from user input.
- `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^{18}`.
- `n` is initially greater than or equal to `k`.

Since the loop condition is `n > 0`, and we know that `n` is initially greater than or equal to `k`, the only state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute at least once is ensuring that `n` is greater than 0.

Given that `n` is initially greater than or equal to `k` (and since `k` is at least 1), `n` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to start executing. Since the problem doesn't provide any additional constraints or modifications to `n` between the given state and the loop, we can assume `n` remains greater than 0 as long as it was initially valid.

Therefore, no adjustments are necessary to the current state for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is an integer obtained from user input, `k` is an integer obtained from user input, 1 ≤ `n` ≤ \(10^{18}\), 1 ≤ `k` ≤ \(10^{5}\), and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`; `a` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
