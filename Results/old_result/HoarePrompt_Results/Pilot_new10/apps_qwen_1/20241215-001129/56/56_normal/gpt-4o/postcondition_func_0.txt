The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\) and `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\). The function returns 'No' if `k` is greater than `n` or if the number of bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `n` is greater than `k`. Otherwise, it processes the list of bit indices, adjusts them as needed, sorts the list in reverse order, and returns 'Yes' followed by a space-separated string of the modified bit indices.
