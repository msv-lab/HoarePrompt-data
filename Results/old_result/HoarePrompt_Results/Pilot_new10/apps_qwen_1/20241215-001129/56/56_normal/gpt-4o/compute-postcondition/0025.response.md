`bits.append(smallest - 1)` appends the value of `smallest - 1` to the list `bits`. Given that `smallest` is the last element in `bits` before the pop operation, and assuming the pop operation did not change the value of `smallest`, the new value appended to `bits` is `smallest - 1`. 

The initial state also mentions that `len(bits) < k` holds true, which means the length of `bits` is less than `k`. After appending `smallest - 1` to `bits`, the length of `bits` increases by 1, but it still remains less than `k`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is a positive integer, `bits` is a list containing `smallest - 1` (added to the end), `smallest` is the last element in `bits` before the pop operation, and `len(bits) < k` still holds true.**
