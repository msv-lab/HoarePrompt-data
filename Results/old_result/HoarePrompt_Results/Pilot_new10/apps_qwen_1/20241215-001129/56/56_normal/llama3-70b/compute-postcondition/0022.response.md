The code `x = n.bit_length() - 1` calculates the bit length of `n` (the number of bits required to represent `n` in binary) and subtracts 1 from it. Given that `n` must be greater than 0, the bit length of `n` is at least 1. Subtracting 1 from this value gives us `x`.

- The bit length of any positive integer `n` is at least 1, so `n.bit_length()` will be at least 1.
- Subtracting 1 from this value means `x` will be 0 for the smallest positive integer (1), and increase accordingly for larger values of `n`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `x` is `n.bit_length() - 1`**
