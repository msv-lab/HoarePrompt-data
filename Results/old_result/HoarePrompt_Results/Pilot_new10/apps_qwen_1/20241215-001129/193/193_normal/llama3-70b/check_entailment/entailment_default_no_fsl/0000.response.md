Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code simply calculates the absolute difference between `x` and `y`, which does not solve the problem correctly. The problem requires transforming an equilateral triangle of side length `x` into one of side length `y` in the minimum number of steps, where each step involves changing the length of one side to maintain a non-degenerate triangle. 

The given code does not account for the constraints and logic needed to achieve the transformation in the minimum number of steps. For example, consider the input `(10, 4)`. The correct output should be `2` because the sequence could be: `(10, 10, 10) → (8, 10, 10) → (4, 4, 4)`. However, the code would incorrectly output `6` because it only computes the absolute difference. Thus, the code fails to meet the problem requirements for multiple cases.
