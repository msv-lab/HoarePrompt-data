The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `x` and `y`. Before the code execution, `x` and `y` are integers such that `3 <= y < x <= 100,000`. After the code execution, the values of `x` and `y` will be updated to the integers entered by the user, maintaining the condition `3 <= y < x <= 100,000`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 3 <= y < x <= 100,000; `y` is an integer such that 3 <= y < x <= 100,000**
