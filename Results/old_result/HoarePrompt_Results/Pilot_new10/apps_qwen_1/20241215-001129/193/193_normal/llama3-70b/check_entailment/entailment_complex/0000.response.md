Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. According to the problem, Memory needs to transform an equilateral triangle with side length \(x\) into one with side length \(y\) by changing the length of a single side at a time while ensuring the triangle remains non-degenerate (i.e., all sides remain integers and the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side).

However, the given program simply calculates and prints the absolute difference between \(x\) and \(y\), which is not related to the transformation process described. The output does not reflect the minimum number of seconds required to achieve the desired transformation.

To correctly solve the problem, the program would need to simulate the transformation process step-by-step, ensuring that at each step, the resulting shape is still a valid equilateral triangle. The current implementation does not account for these constraints and thus fails to meet the problem's requirements.
