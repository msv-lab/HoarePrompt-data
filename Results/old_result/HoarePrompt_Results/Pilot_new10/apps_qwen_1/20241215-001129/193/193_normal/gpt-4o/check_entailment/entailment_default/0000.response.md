Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. According to the problem description, the goal is to transform an equilateral triangle of side length \( x \) into an equilateral triangle of side length \( y \) by modifying the length of a single side in each second, ensuring the triangle remains non-degenerate (i.e., the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side).

However, the code calculates the result as \(\left\lfloor \frac{x - y}{2} \right\rfloor + \left( x - y \right) \% 2\), which does not account for the constraints of forming a valid triangle during each step. For example, consider the input \( x = 6 \) and \( y = 3 \):

- The code outputs \( 4 \), but the correct steps would be: 
  - \((6, 6, 6) \rightarrow (6, 6, 3) \rightarrow (6, 4, 3) \rightarrow (3, 4, 3) \rightarrow (3, 3, 3)\).
  - This requires 4 steps, but the code incorrectly calculates the result as 4.

Additionally, the code does not ensure that the intermediate steps maintain the properties of a valid triangle. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
