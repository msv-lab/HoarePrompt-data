Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code calculates the absolute difference between `x` and `y`, which is not what the problem description requires. The problem asks for the minimum number of seconds required to transform an equilateral triangle of side length `x` into one of side length `y` by modifying one side at a time while ensuring the triangle remains non-degenerate (i.e., the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side).

The given code does not account for the constraints of forming a valid triangle at each step. For example, if `x = 6` and `y = 3`, the correct sequence would be:

1. Start with (6, 6, 6).
2. Modify one side to 3: (6, 6, 3).
3. Modify another side to 4: (6, 4, 3).
4. Modify the last side to 3: (3, 4, 3).
5. Finally, make all sides equal to 3: (3, 3, 3).

This sequence requires 4 modifications, not just the difference between `x` and `y`. Therefore, the code does not solve the problem as described.
