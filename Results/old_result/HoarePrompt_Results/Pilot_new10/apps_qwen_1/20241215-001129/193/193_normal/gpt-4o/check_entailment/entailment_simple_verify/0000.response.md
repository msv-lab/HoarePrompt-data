Final: **False**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the provided examples show that the program does not accurately solve the problem. The logic `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2` does not account for the constraints of forming a non-degenerate triangle during each step. The program incorrectly assumes that we can uniformly decrease the side lengths, which is not always optimal. For instance, in the input `(22, 4)`, the annotated version shows that the correct minimum number of steps is indeed `6`, but the program outputs `6` using an incorrect formula. Therefore, the original assessment was accurate.
