Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. According to the problem description, the goal is to transform an equilateral triangle with side length \(x\) into an equilateral triangle with side length \(y\) by modifying the length of one side at a time while ensuring that the result is always a valid triangle (i.e., the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side).

However, the program simply calculates the absolute difference between \(x\) and \(y\) and prints it. This approach does not take into account the constraints of forming a valid triangle during each step. For instance, consider the input \(x = 10\) and \(y = 5\):

- The program would output `5`, but this is incorrect because the sequence of transformations would be invalid. For example, transforming from \(10\) to \(5\) in one step would violate the triangle inequality since \(5 + 5 = 10\) does not satisfy \(10 > 5\).

A correct solution would involve decrementing \(x\) by the smallest possible amount in each step while ensuring the resulting sides form a valid triangle until reaching \(y\).
