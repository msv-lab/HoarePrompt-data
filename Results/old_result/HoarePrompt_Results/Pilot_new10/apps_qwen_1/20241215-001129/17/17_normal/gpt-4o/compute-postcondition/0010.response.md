The function `func` processes an input consisting of four lines, where each line contains an integer representing the count of strings of the type `"(()"` for indices 1 to 4. The function then checks two conditions:
1. Whether the sum of the counts of strings of the type `"(()"` for indices 1 and 2 equals the sum of the counts for indices 3 and 4.
2. Whether the count for index 2 (`cnt2`) is greater than or equal to the count for index 3 (`cnt3`).

If both conditions are met, the function prints `1`; otherwise, it prints `0`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function is:

**The function processes an input of four integers and prints `1` if the sum of the first two integers equals the sum of the last two integers and the second integer is greater than or equal to the third integer; otherwise, it prints `0`.**
