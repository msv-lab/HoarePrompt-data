Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, the logic in the if-else block does not ensure that a regular bracket sequence can be formed from the given strings. Here's why:

1. **Problem Description Requirement**: The task is to check if it is possible to arrange the given strings in some order to form a regular bracket sequence. A regular bracket sequence must have matching pairs of parentheses and should allow the insertion of "+" and "1" to form a valid arithmetic expression.

2. **Current Program Logic**: The current program checks if `cnt3` (the count of "())" strings) is greater than `cnt1` (the count of "(((" strings)). If `cnt3 > cnt1`, it prints `0`, indicating that it is not possible to form a regular bracket sequence. Otherwise, it prints `1`, indicating that it is possible.

3. **Flaw in Logic**:
   - The condition `cnt3 > cnt1` does not fully capture the requirement to form a regular bracket sequence. For instance, even if `cnt3 <= cnt1`, it doesn't guarantee that a regular sequence can be formed. Consider the following scenario:
     - `cnt1 = 1`, `cnt2 = 0`, `cnt3 = 1`, `cnt4 = 0`. Here, `cnt3 <= cnt1`, but the sequence "(()" cannot be balanced with "())" to form a regular sequence.

4. **Correct Approach**: To properly determine if a regular bracket sequence can be formed, one needs to ensure that:
   - The total number of opening parentheses (`(`) is at least the total number of closing parentheses (`)`).
   - At any point in the sequence, the number of opening parentheses encountered so far is never less than the number of closing parentheses encountered so far.

Given the above points, the current implementation is insufficient to meet the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem statement.
