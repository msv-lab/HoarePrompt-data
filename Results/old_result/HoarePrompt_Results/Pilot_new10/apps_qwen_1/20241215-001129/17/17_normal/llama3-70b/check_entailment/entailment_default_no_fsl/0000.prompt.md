You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A string is called bracket sequence if it does not contain any characters other than "(" and ")". A bracket sequence is called regular if it it is possible to obtain correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters "+" and "1" into this sequence. For example, "", "(())" and "()()" are regular bracket sequences; "))" and ")((" are bracket sequences (but not regular ones), and "(a)" and "(1)+(1)" are not bracket sequences at all.

You have a number of strings; each string is a bracket sequence of length $2$. So, overall you have $cnt_1$ strings "((", $cnt_2$ strings "()", $cnt_3$ strings ")(" and $cnt_4$ strings "))". You want to write all these strings in some order, one after another; after that, you will get a long bracket sequence of length $2(cnt_1 + cnt_2 + cnt_3 + cnt_4)$. You wonder: is it possible to choose some order of the strings you have such that you will get a regular bracket sequence? Note that you may not remove any characters or strings, and you may not add anything either.


-----Input-----

The input consists of four lines, $i$-th of them contains one integer $cnt_i$ ($0 \le cnt_i \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

Print one integer: $1$ if it is possible to form a regular bracket sequence by choosing the correct order of the given strings, $0$ otherwise.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
1
4
3

Output
1

Input
0
0
0
0

Output
1

Input
1
2
3
4

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example it is possible to construct a string "(())()(()((()()()())))", which is a regular bracket sequence.

In the second example it is possible to construct a string "", which is a regular bracket sequence.
Program:
```
def func():
    (cnt1, cnt2, cnt3, cnt4) = map(int, [input() for _ in range(4)])
    if cnt3 > cnt1:
        print(0)
    else:
        print(1)


```
Output hints: The function reads four integers from the user, each representing the counts of "(((", "()", "())", and "))" respectively. It then compares the count of "())" with the count of "((( )". If the count of "())" is greater than the count of "((( ", it prints `0`; otherwise, it prints `1`. The function does not return any value.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
