#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of four lines, where the i-th line contains one integer cnt_i representing the number of strings of the type i ("((") for 1 <= i <= 4 (")("). Each cnt_i satisfies 0 <= cnt_i <= 10^9.
def func():
    cnt1 = int(input())
    cnt2 = int(input())
    cnt3 = int(input())
    cnt4 = int(input())
    if (cnt1 + cnt2 == cnt3 + cnt4 and cnt2 >= cnt3) :
        print(1)
    else :
        print(0)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `cnt1` is an integer with 0 <= `cnt1` <= 10^9, `cnt2` is an integer, `cnt3` is an integer, `cnt4` is an integer. If `cnt1` + `cnt2` equals `cnt3` + `cnt4` and `cnt2` >= `cnt3`, then no change is made to the values. Otherwise, either (cnt1 + cnt2 != cnt3 + cnt4) or (cnt2 < cnt3).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes an input consisting of four lines, where each line contains an integer representing the count of strings of the type `"(()"` for indices 1 to 4. The function then checks two conditions:
1. Whether the sum of the counts of strings of the type `"(()"` for indices 1 and 2 equals the sum of the counts for indices 3 and 4.
2. Whether the count for index 2 (`cnt2`) is greater than or equal to the count for index 3 (`cnt3`).

If both conditions are met, the function prints `1`; otherwise, it prints `0`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function is:

**The function processes an input of four integers and prints `1` if the sum of the first two integers equals the sum of the last two integers and the second integer is greater than or equal to the third integer; otherwise, it prints `0`.**
