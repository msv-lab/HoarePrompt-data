You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A string is called bracket sequence if it does not contain any characters other than "(" and ")". A bracket sequence is called regular if it it is possible to obtain correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters "+" and "1" into this sequence. For example, "", "(())" and "()()" are regular bracket sequences; "))" and ")((" are bracket sequences (but not regular ones), and "(a)" and "(1)+(1)" are not bracket sequences at all.

You have a number of strings; each string is a bracket sequence of length $2$. So, overall you have $cnt_1$ strings "((", $cnt_2$ strings "()", $cnt_3$ strings ")(" and $cnt_4$ strings "))". You want to write all these strings in some order, one after another; after that, you will get a long bracket sequence of length $2(cnt_1 + cnt_2 + cnt_3 + cnt_4)$. You wonder: is it possible to choose some order of the strings you have such that you will get a regular bracket sequence? Note that you may not remove any characters or strings, and you may not add anything either.


-----Input-----

The input consists of four lines, $i$-th of them contains one integer $cnt_i$ ($0 \le cnt_i \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

Print one integer: $1$ if it is possible to form a regular bracket sequence by choosing the correct order of the given strings, $0$ otherwise.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
1
4
3

Output
1

Input
0
0
0
0

Output
1

Input
1
2
3
4

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example it is possible to construct a string "(())()(()((()()()())))", which is a regular bracket sequence.

In the second example it is possible to construct a string "", which is a regular bracket sequence.
Program:
```
def func():
    cnt1 = int(input())
    cnt2 = int(input())
    cnt3 = int(input())
    cnt4 = int(input())
    if cnt1 + cnt2 == cnt3 + cnt4 and cnt2 >= cnt3:
        print(1)
    else:
        print(0)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program checks if it is possible to form a regular bracket sequence by ensuring that the total number of opening and closing brackets can be paired up correctly, and that there are enough matching pairs of parentheses. Specifically, it checks if \(cnt1 + cnt2 = cnt3 + cnt4\) and \(cnt2 \geq cnt3\). This ensures that the number of unmatched opening and closing brackets can be balanced, and that there are enough "()" pairs to start the sequence correctly.

Let's verify this with the given examples:

1. **Example 1**: 
   - Input: `3 1 4 3`
   - \(cnt1 + cnt2 = 3 + 1 = 4\) and \(cnt3 + cnt4 = 4 + 3 = 7\). Since \(cnt1 + cnt2 \neq cnt3 + cnt4\), the output is `0`.
   
2. **Example 2**: 
   - Input: `0 0 0 0`
   - \(cnt1 + cnt2 = 0 + 0 = 0\) and \(cnt3 + cnt4 = 0 + 0 = 0\). Since \(cnt1 + cnt2 = cnt3 + cnt4\) and \(cnt2 \geq cnt3\), the output is `1`.

3. **Example 3**: 
   - Input: `1 2 3 4`
   - \(cnt1 + cnt2 = 1 + 2 = 3\) and \(cnt3 + cnt4 = 3 + 4 = 7\). Since \(cnt1 + cnt2 \neq cnt3 + cnt4\), the output is `0`.

In all these cases, the program behaves as expected. Therefore, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function `func` processes an input consisting of four lines, where each line contains an integer representing the count of strings of the type `"(()"` for indices 1 to 4. The function then checks two conditions: 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
