The `print(0)` statement simply prints the number 0 to the console. It does not affect the values of the variables `cnt1`, `cnt2`, `cnt3`, or `cnt4`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`cnt1` is an integer with 0 <= `cnt1` <= 10^9, `cnt2` is an integer, `cnt3` is an integer, `cnt4` is an integer, and either (cnt1 + cnt2 != cnt3 + cnt4) or (cnt2 < cnt3)**
