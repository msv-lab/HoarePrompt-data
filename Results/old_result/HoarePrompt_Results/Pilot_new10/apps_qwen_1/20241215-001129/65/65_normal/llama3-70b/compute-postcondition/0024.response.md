The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `s`. `n` and `k` are non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 100, and `s` is a string consisting of lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet representing the colors of the balloons. 

Case_1: The function returns the length of the string `s`.
Case_2: The function returns the value of `k`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept parameters `n`, `k`, and `s`, and return the length of the string `s` or the value of `k` based on the given conditions.
