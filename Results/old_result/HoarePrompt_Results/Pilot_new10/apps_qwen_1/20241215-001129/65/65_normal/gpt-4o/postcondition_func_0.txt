The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k` (both within the range of 1 to 100) and a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters representing the colors of the balloons. It counts the occurrences of each color in the string and checks if it is possible to distribute the colors such that no color appears more than `k` times. If such a distribution is possible, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
