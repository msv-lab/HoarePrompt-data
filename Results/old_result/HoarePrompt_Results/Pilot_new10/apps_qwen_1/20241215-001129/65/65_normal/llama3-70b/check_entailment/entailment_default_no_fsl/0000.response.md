Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It reads the number of balloons `n` and the number of friends `k`, followed by a string `s` representing the colors of the balloons. It then counts the frequency of each color using a dictionary. Finally, it checks if the maximum frequency of any color is less than or equal to `k`. If so, it prints 'YES', indicating that Kefa can distribute the balloons without any friend being upset. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The code handles all potential cases as specified, ensuring that no friend receives more than one balloon of the same color.
