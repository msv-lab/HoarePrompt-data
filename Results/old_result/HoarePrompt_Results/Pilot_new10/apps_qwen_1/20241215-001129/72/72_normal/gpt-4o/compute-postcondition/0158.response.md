The value of `row` is decreased by 2. The initial value of `row` was increased by `-1`, so the new value of `row` is its original value plus `-1` minus 2, which simplifies to the original value of `row` minus 3. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`remaining_questions` > 1, `m` â‰¥ 1, `col` is 2, `max_questions` is increased by 1, and `sergei_questions` remains unchanged; `row` is decreased by 3**
