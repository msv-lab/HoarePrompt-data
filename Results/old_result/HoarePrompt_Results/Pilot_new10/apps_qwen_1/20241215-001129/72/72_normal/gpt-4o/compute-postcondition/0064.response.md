The code `direction = 1` simply assigns the value `1` to the variable `direction`. This assignment does not affect the values of `col`, `max_questions`, or `row`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`col` is equal to `y`; `max_questions` is `max_questions - 1`; `row` is equal to `x + direction`; `direction` is 1**
