`row` is decremented by 2, so the new value of `row` is `row - 2`. The value of `col` and `m` remain unchanged. The values of `sergei_questions`, `max_questions`, and `direction` also remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` must be at least 1, `row` is equal to `n - 2`, the current value of `col` is `y`, `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1 if `row == x and col == y` is true, otherwise `sergei_questions` remains unchanged; `max_questions` is incremented by 1; `direction` is `-1`.**
