The code increments `max_questions` by 1. The values of `row`, `col`, and `sergei_questions` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`row` is equal to `x` and `col` is equal to `y`; `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1 if `row == x and col == y` was true, otherwise it remains unchanged; `max_questions` is increased by 1**
