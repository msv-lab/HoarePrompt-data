The value of `row` is incremented by `direction`, while `max_questions`, `col`, and `sergei_questions` remain unchanged. Since `direction` is not specified in the initial state, we will keep it as `direction`.

Output State: **`max_questions` is decreased by 1, `row` is equal to `x + direction`, `col` is equal to `y`, and `sergei_questions` remains unchanged.**
