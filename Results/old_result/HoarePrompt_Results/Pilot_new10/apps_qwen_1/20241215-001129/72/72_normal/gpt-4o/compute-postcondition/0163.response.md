The code `row += 2` increments the value of `row` by 2. Given the initial conditions, the only variable affected is `row`. The initial state specifies that `row` is 2, so after executing the code, `row` will be 4.

The output state is: **`remaining_questions` > 1, `m` â‰¥ 1, `col` is 2, `max_questions` is decreased by 1, and the condition for increasing `sergei_questions` remains unchanged; `row` is 4.**
