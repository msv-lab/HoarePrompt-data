Functionality: ** The function processes inputs `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` which represent grid dimensions and a number of questions, respectively. It calculates the minimum and maximum number of questions Sergei can answer. Based on the position `x` and `y`, it updates the count of questions Sergei can answer. Finally, it prints the maximum, minimum, and updated count of questions Sergei can answer. **

This summary covers the following points:
- The function processes five integer inputs: `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y`.
- It calculates the length of a full cycle (`full_cycle_length`) and the number of full cycles (`full_cycles`).
- It determines the minimum and maximum number of questions Sergei can answer based on the number of full cycles and the position `x`.
- It updates the count of questions Sergei can answer based on the specific position `x` and `y`.
- It prints the maximum, minimum, and updated count of questions Sergei can answer.

The summary includes all the steps performed by the code, including handling the edge cases where `n > 1` or `n == 1`.
