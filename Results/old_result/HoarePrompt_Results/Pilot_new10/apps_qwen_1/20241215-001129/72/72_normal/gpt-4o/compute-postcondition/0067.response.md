Postcondition: ***`row` and `col` are updated based on the value of `direction`. If `direction == 1` and `row == n`, then `row` is set to `x - 3`, `col` remains `y`, `max_questions` is incremented by 1, and `sergei_questions` remains unchanged. If `direction == 1` and `row != n`, then `row` is set to `x + direction`, `col` remains `y`, `max_questions` is incremented by 1, and `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1 if `row == x and col == y` is true, otherwise `sergei_questions` remains unchanged. If `direction != 1`, then `col` remains `y`, `max_questions` is decremented by 1, and `row` is set to `x + 3` if `row` is not `-1`, otherwise `row` is set to `-1`.***
