`row` is incremented by `direction`. The values of the other variables (`remaining_questions`, `m`, `col`, `sergei_questions`, and `max_questions`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `col` is 0, `sergei_questions` is increased by 1 if the current value of `row` is equal to `x` and the current value of `col` is equal to `y` is false, `max_questions` is `max_questions - 1`, `row` is `row + direction`.**
