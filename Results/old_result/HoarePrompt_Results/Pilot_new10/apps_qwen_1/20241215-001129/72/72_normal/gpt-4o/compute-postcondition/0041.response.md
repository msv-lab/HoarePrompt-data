`sergei_questions` is incremented by 1. The value of `m`, `row`, `col`, `max_questions`, and `col_end` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is at least 1; `row` and `col` are coordinates; `max_questions` and `sergei_questions` are counters; `col` is `col_end + 1`; `sergei_questions` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`m` is at least 1; `row` and `col` are coordinates; `max_questions` and `sergei_questions` are counters; `col` is `col_end + 1`; `sergei_questions` is increased by 1**
