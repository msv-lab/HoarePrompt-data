Postcondition: ***`max_questions` is incremented by 1, `sergei_questions` and `max_questions` maintain their original conditions unless `row == x` and `col == y`, in which case `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1 and `col` is `col + 1`; `row` is incremented by `direction`. If `row == n`, `row` remains `r - 3` and `col` is unchanged. Otherwise, the conditions remain as they were before the if-else block.***
