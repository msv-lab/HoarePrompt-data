The code `row -= 2` decrements the value of `row` by 2. Given the initial state where `row` is incremented by -1, the new value of `row` will be the current value of `row` plus -1 (from the initial state) plus -2 (from the code).

Let's assume the initial value of `row` is \( r \). According to the initial state:
- `max_questions` is incremented by 1.
- `sergei_questions` and `max_questions` maintain their original conditions unless `row == x` and `col == y`, in which case `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1, and `col` is `col + 1`; `row` is incremented by -1, `direction` is -1.

From the initial state, let's assume `row` is initially \( r \):
1. `row` is incremented by -1, so the new value of `row` is \( r - 1 \).
2. Then, `row -= 2`, so the new value of `row` is \( (r - 1) - 2 = r - 3 \).

The values of the other variables (`max_questions`, `sergei_questions`, `col`, and `direction`) remain unchanged from their original conditions unless the condition `row == x` and `col == y` is met, which is not relevant here since the row decrement does not depend on these conditions.

Output State: **`max_questions` is incremented by 1, `sergei_questions` and `max_questions` maintain their original conditions, `row` is `r - 3`, `col` is unchanged, and `direction` is -1.**
