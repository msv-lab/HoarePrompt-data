`row` is incremented by the value of `direction`. The exact value of `row` depends on the value of `direction`. The precondition that `remaining_questions` must be greater than 1, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `col` is 0, and `max_questions` is increased by 1 remains unchanged.

Output State: **`remaining_questions` > 1, `m` â‰¥ 1, `col` is 0, `max_questions` is increased by 1, `row` is increased by `direction`**
