The code sets `max_questions` to the value of `full_cycles`. This does not change the values of `full_cycle_length`, `full_cycles`, `remaining_questions`, `min_questions`, `n`, or `m`. The only change is in the assignment of `max_questions`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `full_cycle_length` is `(2 * n - 2) * m` if `n > 1` else `m`, `full_cycles` is `k // full_cycle_length`, `remaining_questions` is `k % full_cycle_length`, `min_questions` is `full_cycles`, `max_questions` is `full_cycles`**
