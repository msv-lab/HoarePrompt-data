The code `max_questions += 1` increments the value of `max_questions` by 1. The initial state is that `row` is equal to `x` and `col` is equal to `y`. If the condition `row == x and col == y` is true, then `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `sergei_questions` remains unchanged. Since the code only modifies `max_questions`, the conditions for `sergei_questions` remain the same.

Output State: **`row` is equal to `x`, `col` is equal to `y`, `max_questions` is incremented by 1, and `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1 if `row == x and col == y` is true, otherwise `sergei_questions` remains unchanged.**
