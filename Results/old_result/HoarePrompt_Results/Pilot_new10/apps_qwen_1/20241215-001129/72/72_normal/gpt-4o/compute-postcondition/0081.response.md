Postcondition: **`col` is 0, `m` is at least 1, `row` and `col` are coordinates, `max_questions` is the number of times `row` reaches `n-1` plus the number of times `row == x and col == y` is true during the iterations, `sergei_questions` is the number of times `row == x and col == y` is true during the iterations where `direction == 1` plus 1 (if the condition `row == x and col == y` is met), `remaining_questions` is 1, and `direction` is not 1.**
