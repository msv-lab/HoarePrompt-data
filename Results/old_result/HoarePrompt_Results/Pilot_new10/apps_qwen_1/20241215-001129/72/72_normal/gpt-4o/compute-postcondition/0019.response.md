The variable `direction` is assigned the value `1`. This is the only change made by the code. The values of all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `full_cycle_length` is `(2 * n - 2) * m`, `full_cycles` is `k // full_cycle_length`, `remaining_questions` is `k % full_cycle_length`, `min_questions` is `(k // full_cycle_length) // (2 * n - 2)`, `max_questions` is `(k // full_cycle_length + n - 1) // (2 * n - 2)`, `sergei_questions` is either `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)` if `x` is either 0 or `n - 1`, otherwise `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2) + (full_cycles % (2 * n - 2) >= x); direction is 1, row is 0**
