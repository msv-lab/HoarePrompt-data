The value of `row` is incremented by `direction`. The values of `col`, `sergei_questions`, and `max_questions` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `row` is equal to `x + direction`, `col` is equal to `y`, `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1 if `row == x and col == y` was true, otherwise it remains unchanged; `max_questions` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`row` is equal to `x + direction`, `col` is equal to `y`, `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1 if `x + direction == x and y == y` was true, otherwise it remains unchanged; `max_questions` is increased by 1**
