The code calculates the remainder when `k` is divided by `full_cycle_length` and assigns it to `remaining_questions`. Since `k` and `full_cycle_length` are unchanged from the previous state, the value of `remaining_questions` is `k % full_cycle_length`.

The output state includes the updated value for `remaining_questions` while keeping the other variables in their previous state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `full_cycle_length` is `(2 * n - 2) * m` if `n > 1` else `m`, `full_cycles` is `k // full_cycle_length`, `remaining_questions` is `k % full_cycle_length`**
