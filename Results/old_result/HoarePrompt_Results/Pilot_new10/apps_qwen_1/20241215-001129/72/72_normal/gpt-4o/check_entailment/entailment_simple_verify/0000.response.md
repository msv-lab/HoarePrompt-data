Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the provided annotated code and the original assessment, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum, minimum, and the number of times the teacher asks Sergei. The annotated code aligns with the problem description and the steps taken in the program to handle different scenarios, including the calculation of full cycles, handling special cases, and accurately counting questions for Sergei. The original assessment correctly identified that the program is correct, and the annotated version confirms this accuracy. Therefore, the original assessment remains accurate.
