`max_questions` is decremented by 1. The value of `m`, `row`, `col`, `sergei_questions`, `remaining_questions`, and `direction` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`col` is 0; `m` is at least 1; `max_questions` is the number of times `row` reaches `n-1` plus the number of times `row == x and col == y` is true during the iterations minus 1; `sergei_questions` is the number of times `row == x and col == y` is true during the iterations where `direction == 1` plus 1 (if the condition `row == x and col == y` is met); `remaining_questions` is 1; `direction` is not 1.**
