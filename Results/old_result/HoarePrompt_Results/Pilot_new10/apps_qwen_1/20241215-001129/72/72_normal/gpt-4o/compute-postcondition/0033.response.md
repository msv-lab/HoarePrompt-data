`max_questions` is decremented by 1. The initial values of `m`, `row`, and `col` are unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `m` must be at least 1, the current value of `row` is `x`, and the current value of `col` is `y`, `max_questions` is decreased by 1, and `sergei_questions` remains unchanged.
