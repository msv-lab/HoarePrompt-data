According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `col` and `m`. The loop will execute as long as `m` is at least 1 because the range function will generate values from 0 to `m-1`. Before the loop starts, `remaining_questions` must be greater than 1 does not directly ensure that the loop will execute, but `m` must be greater than or equal to 1.

So, we need to adjust the state to ensure that the loop can start executing, which means `m` must be greater than or equal to 1 and `col` starts from 0.

State: **`remaining_questions` must be greater than 1, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `col` is 0**
