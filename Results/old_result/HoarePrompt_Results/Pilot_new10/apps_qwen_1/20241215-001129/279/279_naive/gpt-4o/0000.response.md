Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Specifically, the program does not handle the scenario where there are multiple cycles in the permutation, and it does not ensure that each skewer visits all 2n placements. Here's a counterexample:

Consider the following input:
```
4
4 3 2 1
1 0 0 1
```

For this input, the permutation `p` is `[4, 3, 2, 1]`, and the sequence `b` is `[1, 0, 0, 1]`.

- The permutation `p` forms a single cycle `[4, 3, 2, 1]`.
- According to `b`, the skewers at positions 1 and 4 need to be reversed.

The program correctly identifies that there is only one cycle and calculates `no_reverse_components` as 0 because not all elements in the cycle are reversed. However, the output of the program is `0`, which is incorrect. 

To meet the requirement, Pavel needs to reverse at least one skewer in this cycle to ensure that each skewer visits all 2n placements. Therefore, the minimum number of changes required is `1`.

Hence, the program does not handle this case correctly, making it incorrect.
