`p` is assigned the values from the input split into a list of integers. The input is expected to be a space-separated string of integers representing a permutation of integers from 1 to n. The values of `n` and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and `b` is a sequence of n integers consisting only of 0s and 1s.**
