`ans` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `ans` was 0 (since no other value is given), so it is now 1. The array `p` and the integer `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), and for the array `p`, the element at index `i` is not equal to `i + 1`.**
