Postcondition: **`no_reverse_components` is the sum of `1` for each cycle in `cycles` where all elements in `b` at those cycle indices are `0`. `input` is `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is a list containing a single string which is the string representation of `n`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `p` is a list of integers from `1` to `n` if `n` > `0`, otherwise an empty list, `b` is a list of integers, `visited` is a list of `n` elements where each element is `True`, `cycles` is a list containing all the cycles found during the loop execution, `cycle` is the last cycle found if `visited[i]` is `False`, and `i` is `n` if the loop executes `n` times, otherwise `i` is less than `n`. The length of `cycles` is exactly `1`.**
