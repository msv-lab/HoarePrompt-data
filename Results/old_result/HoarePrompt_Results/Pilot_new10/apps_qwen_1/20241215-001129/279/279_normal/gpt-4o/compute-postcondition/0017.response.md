The code appends the value of `x` to the list `cycle`. The previous value of `x` is 0, so `cycle` becomes `[0, 0]`.

Output State: **`input` is `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is a list containing a single string which is the string representation of `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x` is 0, `p` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`, `b` is an empty list, `visited` is a list of `n` elements with the first element now set to `True`, `cycles` is an empty list, `cycle` is `[0, 0]`**
