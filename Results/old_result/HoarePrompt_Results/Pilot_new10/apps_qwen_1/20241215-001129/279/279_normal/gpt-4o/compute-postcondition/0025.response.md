Postcondition: ***`input` is `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is a list containing a single string which is the string representation of `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x` is 0, `p` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`, `b` is an empty list, `visited` is a list of `n` elements all set to `True`, `cycles` is a list containing all the cycles found during the execution of the loop with the last cycle being `cycle`, and `cycle` is a list containing the last cycle found, if `visited[i]` is `False`. If `visited[i]` is `True`, the same conditions apply as above.***
