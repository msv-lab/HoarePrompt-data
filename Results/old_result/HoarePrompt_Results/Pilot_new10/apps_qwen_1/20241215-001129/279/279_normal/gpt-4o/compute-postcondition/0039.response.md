The code `cycle.append(x)` appends the value of `x` to the list `cycle`. Given that `x` is currently 1, the value of `cycle` changes from `[1, 0]` to `[1, 0, 1]`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`input` is `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is a list containing a single string which is the string representation of `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x` is 1, `p` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`, `b` is an empty list, `visited` is a list of `n` elements where the first element is `False`, the second element is `False`, and the rest are `True` with `visited[1]` set to `True`, `cycles` is a list containing all the cycles found during the execution of the loop with the last cycle being `[1, 0]`, `cycle` is now `[1, 0, 1]`**
