Postcondition: ***`input` is `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is a list containing a single string which is the string representation of `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x` is 0, `p` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`, `b` is an empty list, `visited` is a list of `n` elements where the first element is `False` and the remaining elements are `True`, `cycles` is a list containing all the cycles found during the execution of the loop with the last cycle being the entire cycle of nodes starting from node 1 plus the new cycle represented by `cycle`, `cycle` is the complete cycle found, if `visited[i]` is `False`, the same conditions apply as above.***
