The code `data = input().split()` reads a line from the input and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. The previous values of the affected variables are:

- `input` is reassigned to `sys.stdin.read`
- `data` is a list obtained by splitting the input line.

Since the initial state specifies that the input consists of three lines, the first line containing an integer `n`, the second line containing a permutation of integers, and the third line containing a sequence of zeros and ones, the `input().split()` will split the first line into a list containing a single string representation of `n`.

The output state after executing the code will be:

Output State: **`input` is reassigned to `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is a list containing a single string which is the string representation of `n`.**
