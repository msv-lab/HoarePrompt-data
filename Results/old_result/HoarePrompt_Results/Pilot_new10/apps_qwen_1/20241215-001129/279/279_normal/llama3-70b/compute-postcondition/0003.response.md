The given code assigns the value `0` to the variable `ans`. No other changes are made to the variables `n`, `p`, or `b`. Therefore, the value of `ans` is now `0`, while the values of `n`, `p`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `b` is a list of `n` integers consisting only of 0s and 1s, `ans` is 0**
