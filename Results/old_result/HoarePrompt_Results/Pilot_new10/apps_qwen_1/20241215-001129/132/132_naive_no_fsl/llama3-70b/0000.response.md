Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program checks if the sum of stones in both sequences is equal and if the sorted sequences are identical. However, this approach is not sufficient to determine if the transformation between the two sequences is valid according to the problem description.

Consider the following counterexample:

- Input:
```
3
2 3 9
1 7 9
```

- Expected Output:
```
No
```

- Program Output:
```
Yes
```

In this case, the program outputs "Yes" because the sums of the two sequences are equal (14), and the sorted sequences are also equal (`[2, 3, 9]` and `[1, 7, 9]` after sorting). However, the transformation from `2 3 9` to `1 7 9` is not possible under the given rules, as no jury member can add stones. The program fails to account for the rule that jury members can only take or move one stone at a time, which means the difference in the number of stones in each pile should not exceed 1 unless the total number of stones remains the same.

To correctly verify the transformation, the program needs to check if the absolute difference between corresponding elements in the two sequences is at most 1 for all piles, while maintaining the total number of stones.
