You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There is a beautiful garden of stones in Innopolis.

Its most beautiful place is the $n$ piles with stones numbered from $1$ to $n$.

EJOI participants have visited this place twice. 

When they first visited it, the number of stones in piles was $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$, correspondingly. One of the participants wrote down this sequence in a notebook. 

They visited it again the following day, and the number of stones in piles was equal to $y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n$. One of the participants also wrote it down in a notebook.

It is well known that every member of the EJOI jury during the night either sits in the room $108$ or comes to the place with stones. Each jury member who comes there either takes one stone for himself or moves one stone from one pile to another. We can assume that there is an unlimited number of jury members. No one except the jury goes to the place with stones at night.

Participants want to know whether their notes can be correct or they are sure to have made a mistake.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input file contains a single integer $n$, the number of piles with stones in the garden ($1 \leq n \leq 50$).

The second line contains $n$ integers separated by spaces $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$, the number of stones in piles recorded in the notebook when the participants came to the place with stones for the first time ($0 \leq x_i \leq 1000$).

The third line contains $n$ integers separated by spaces $y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n$, the number of stones in piles recorded in the notebook when the participants came to the place with stones for the second time ($0 \leq y_i \leq 1000$).


-----Output-----

If the records can be consistent output "Yes", otherwise output "No" (quotes for clarity).


-----Examples-----
Input
5
1 2 3 4 5
2 1 4 3 5

Output
Yes

Input
5
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1

Output
Yes

Input
3
2 3 9
1 7 9

Output
No



-----Note-----

In the first example, the following could have happened during the night: one of the jury members moved one stone from the second pile to the first pile, and the other jury member moved one stone from the fourth pile to the third pile.

In the second example, the jury took stones from the second and fourth piles.

It can be proved that it is impossible for the jury members to move and took stones to convert the first array into the second array.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    y = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if sum(x) != sum(y):
        print('No')
    else:
        x.sort()
        y.sort()
        if x == y:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program fails to handle the case where the number of stones in each pile can change through both adding and removing stones. Specifically, the program only checks if the total number of stones is the same and if the sorted lists of stones are equal. However, it does not consider scenarios where the redistribution of stones could still result in the final counts.

For example, consider the following input:
```
Input
3
2 3 9
1 7 9
```
The program will incorrectly output "Yes" because the total number of stones is the same (14), and the sorted lists are also the same. However, the redistribution of stones from the first and third piles to form the second pile is not accounted for. The correct output should be "No" because no sequence of valid jury actions can transform the initial state `[2, 3, 9]` into the final state `[1, 7, 9]`.

A correct solution would need to check if the difference between corresponding elements is at most 1 for all pairs `(x_i, y_i)` and ensure that the absolute difference in the total number of stones is within the limits allowed by the jury's actions.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and x and y are lists of integers such that len(x) == len(y) == n and 0 ≤ x[i] ≤ 1000 and 0 ≤ y[i] ≤ 1000 for all i in range(n).
def func():
    n = int(input())
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    y = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if (sum(x) != sum(y)) :
        print('No')
    else :
        x.sort()
        y.sort()
        if (x == y) :
            print('Yes')
        else :
            print('No')
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is an integer between 1 and 50; `x` is a list of integers with length `n`, sorted in ascending order; `y` is a list of integers with length `n`, containing integers entered by the user and sorted in ascending order; the sum of elements in `x` is equal to the sum of elements in `y`; if `x` is equal to `y`, then 'Yes' is printed to the console; otherwise, 'No' is printed to the console.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 50; `x` is a list of integers with length `n`; `y` is a list of integers with length `n`, containing integers entered by the user. If the sum of elements in `x` is not equal to the sum of elements in `y`, the output is 'No'. Otherwise, `x` and `y` are both sorted in ascending order and their sums are equal. If `x` equals `y`, the output is 'Yes'; otherwise, the output is 'No'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads three inputs: an integer `n` and two lists of integers `x` and `y`. It checks if the sum of elements in `x` is equal to the sum of elements in `y`. If not, it prints 'No'. If the sums are equal, it sorts both lists and checks if they are identical. If they are, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
