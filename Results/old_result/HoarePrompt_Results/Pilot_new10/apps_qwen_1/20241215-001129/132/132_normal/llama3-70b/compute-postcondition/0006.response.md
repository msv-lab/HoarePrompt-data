`x` is sorted, which means the elements in the list `x` are rearranged in ascending order. The other variables (`n`, `y`) are not affected. The sum of elements in `x` remains equal to the sum of elements in `y`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 50; `x` is a list of integers with length `n`, sorted in ascending order; `y` is a list of integers with length `n`, containing integers entered by the user; the sum of elements in `x` is equal to the sum of elements in `y`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50; `x` is a list of integers with length `n`, sorted in ascending order; `y` is a list of integers with length `n`, containing integers entered by the user; the sum of elements in `x` is equal to the sum of elements in `y`**
