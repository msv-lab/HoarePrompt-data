`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged as no operations are performed on them within this code snippet. The length of `x` and `y` will still be equal to the new value of `n`, which is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive).

Output State: **`n` is the integer input value between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `x` and `y` are lists of integers such that len(`x`) == len(`y`) == `n` and 0 ≤ `x[i]` ≤ 1000 and 0 ≤ `y[i]` ≤ 1000 for all i in range(`n`).**
