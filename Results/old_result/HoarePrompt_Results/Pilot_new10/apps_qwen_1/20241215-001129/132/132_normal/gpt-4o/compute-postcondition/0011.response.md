Let's analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function first takes an integer input `n` where `1 ≤ n ≤ 50`.
   - It then takes two lists `x` and `y` as input, both containing `n` integers each, with each element ranging from 0 to 1000.

2. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the sum of elements in list `x` and assigns it to `total_x`.
   - Similarly, it calculates the sum of elements in list `y` and assigns it to `total_y`.

3. **Conditional Check**:
   - The function compares `total_y` and `total_x`.
   - If `total_y` is greater than `total_x`, it prints "No".
   - Otherwise, it prints "Yes".

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `n` is not within the valid range (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), the function should handle this case. However, the code provided does not explicitly handle this scenario. The input validation is implicit in the constraints given, but no explicit check is performed in the code.

### Summary of Functionality:

- The function `func` accepts an integer `n` (with the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and two lists `x` and `y`, each containing `n` integers.
- It calculates the sum of the elements in `x` and `y` and compares these sums.
- If the sum of elements in `y` is greater than the sum of elements in `x`, it prints "No".
- Otherwise, it prints "Yes".

### Final Summary:

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and two lists `x` and `y`, each containing `n` integers. It calculates the sum of elements in `x` and `y` and prints "No" if the sum of `y` is greater than the sum of `x`, otherwise it prints "Yes". Note that the function assumes `n` is within the valid range, but does not explicitly handle cases where `n` is outside this range.**
