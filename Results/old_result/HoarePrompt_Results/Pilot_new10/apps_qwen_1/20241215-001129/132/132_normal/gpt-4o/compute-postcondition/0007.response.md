Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50; `y` is a list of `n` integers (new values); `total_x` is the sum of all elements in the list `x`; `total_y` is the sum of all elements in the list `y`. The sum of all elements in the list `y` is less than or equal to the sum of all elements in the list `x`.**
