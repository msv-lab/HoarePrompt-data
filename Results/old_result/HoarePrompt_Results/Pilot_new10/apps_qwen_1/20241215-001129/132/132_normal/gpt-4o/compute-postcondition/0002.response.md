The code `y = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings based on whitespace, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to `y`. The value of `n` remains unchanged because the code does not directly affect `n`. The original list `x` is no longer relevant since its values are not mentioned in the code, and only `y` is updated.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50; `y` is a list of `n` integers (new values)**
