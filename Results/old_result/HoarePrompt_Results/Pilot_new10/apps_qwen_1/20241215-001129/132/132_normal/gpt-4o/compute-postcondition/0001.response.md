The code `x = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts them to integers, and assigns them to the list `x`. The length of `x` will be equal to `n`, which is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive). The values in `x` will be the same as the input integers.

The initial state is:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.
- `x` and `y` are lists of `n` integers each, where 0 ≤ `x[i]` ≤ 1000 and 0 ≤ `y[i]` ≤ 1000 for all 0 ≤ i < `n`.

After executing the code, `x` will be updated with the new list of integers, and `y` will remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50; `x` is a list of `n` integers (new values); `y` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ `y[i]` ≤ 1000 for all 0 ≤ i < `n`.**
