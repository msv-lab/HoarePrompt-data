Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program only checks if `n` is 2 and prints "NO" without attempting to find a valid sequence of fractions for other values of `n`. For example, consider `n = 4`:

- According to the problem description, we need to find fractions such that their sum equals `1 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4}`.
- A valid sequence could be \(\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4}\).

However, the given program will output "NO" for `n = 4`, which is incorrect because a valid sequence exists. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases.
