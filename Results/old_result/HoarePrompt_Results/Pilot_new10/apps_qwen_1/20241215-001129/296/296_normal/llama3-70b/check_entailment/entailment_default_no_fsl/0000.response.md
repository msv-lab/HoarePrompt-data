Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to generate the correct sequence of fractions for certain values of \( n \). For example, when \( n = 6 \), the correct output should include fractions that sum up to \( 1 - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{6} \). The code generates fractions \(\frac{1}{2}\) and \(\frac{1}{3}\), which sum to \(\frac{5}{6}\), but it does not generalize this approach for other values of \( n \).

For instance, consider \( n = 12 \). The required sum is \( 1 - \frac{1}{12} = \frac{11}{12} \). The code would not produce a valid sequence of fractions that sum to \(\frac{11}{12}\) because it only considers the fractions \(\frac{1}{6}\) and \(\frac{1}{12}\), which do not suffice. Therefore, the code does not meet the problem description for every potential case, leading to an incorrect solution.
