Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle all potential cases as specified in the problem description. Specifically, the code does not generate a sequence of fractions that satisfies the conditions for all possible values of \( n \). Here are the issues:

1. **Case When \( n \) is Even and Greater than 2**: For \( n = 6 \), the code correctly outputs "YES" and provides a valid sequence: \(\frac{1}{2}\) and \(\frac{1}{3}\). However, for other even \( n \), the code does not necessarily provide a valid sequence. For example, if \( n = 4 \), the code would suggest \( \frac{1}{2} \) and \( \frac{1}{4} \), but \( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \neq 1 - \frac{1}{4} \).

2. **Case When \( n \) is Odd**: For odd \( n \), the code suggests \( \frac{1}{\frac{n}{2}} \) and \( \frac{1}{n} \), but this does not always satisfy the equation. For instance, if \( n = 5 \), the suggested fractions would be \( \frac{1}{2} \) and \( \frac{1}{5} \), but \( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{5} = \frac{7}{10} \neq 1 - \frac{1}{5} \).

3. **General Case Handling**: The code only considers specific pairs of fractions and does not ensure that the sum of the fractions equals \( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \) for all \( n \). A more general approach is needed to generate a valid sequence for any \( n \).

Thus, the code does not meet the requirements for every potential case and hence the correctness is **False**.
