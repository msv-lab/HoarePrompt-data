Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The annotated program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Output Format**: The problem requires the output to specify whether such a sequence exists ("YES" or "NO"). However, the program only prints "YES" when `n` is not 2. For any `n > 2`, it does not verify if a valid sequence of fractions exists that satisfies the given conditions. It directly assumes such a sequence exists without checking the feasibility.

2. **Verification of Fraction Sequence**: The problem requires finding a sequence of fractions $\frac{a_i}{b_i}$ such that $\sum_{i=1}^k \frac{a_i}{b_i} = 1 - \frac{1}{n}$. The program does not perform any verification to check if the sum of the fractions equals $1 - \frac{1}{n}$. Instead, it assumes that for any `n` greater than 2, a simple sequence $\frac{1}{2}$ and $\frac{1}{n}$ will suffice, which is not generally true for all values of `n`.

3. **Guaranteed Existence**: The problem guarantees that if such a sequence exists, there will be one of length at most 100,000. The program does not ensure that the sequence it provides meets this condition, nor does it check for its existence before printing the result.

For example, consider `n = 4`. According to the program's logic, it would print "YES" and provide the sequence $\frac{1}{2}$ and $\frac{1}{4}$. However, the correct sequence for `n = 4` would be $\frac{1}{2}$, $\frac{1}{4}$, and $\frac{1}{4}$ because $\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} = 1 - \frac{1}{4}$. The program does not account for these cases where more than two fractions might be needed.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the problem description for all potential cases.
