The code initializes an empty list named `divisors`. This does not assign any new values to `n`, but it does affect the `divisors` variable by setting it to an empty list. The precondition that `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and `n` is greater than 2 remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and `n` is greater than 2; `divisors` is an empty list**
