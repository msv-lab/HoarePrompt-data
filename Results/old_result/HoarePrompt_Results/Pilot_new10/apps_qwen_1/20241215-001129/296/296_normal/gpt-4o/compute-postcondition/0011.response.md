Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State:
- `total` is unspecified.
- `i` is 2.
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and `n` is greater than 2.
- `divisors` is `[2, i, n // i]`.
- `i` is not equal to `n // i` if `n % i == 0`. Otherwise, `divisors` remains an empty list.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over values of `i` starting from 2 up to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2. This means the loop has just completed its first iteration (since `i` was incremented).
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3. The condition for the next iteration is that `i` must be within the range `2` to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.

### Adjusting the States:
- **`total`**: Since there is no information about `total` being updated or affected by this loop, `total` remains unspecified.
- **`i`**: As the loop is about to start again, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 3.
- **`n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is determined by the input and does not change inside the loop.
- **`divisors`**: Since the loop is about to start again, the current value of `divisors` remains as `[2, i, n // i]` unless the condition changes due to `i` being 3. Given that `i` is not equal to `n // i` if `n % i == 0`, we need to check if the condition still holds true for `i = 3`.

### Conclusion:
- `i` needs to be 3.
- `divisors` will remain `[2, i, n // i]` unless the condition `i != n // i` fails for `i = 3`.

### Updated State:
- `total` is unspecified.
- `i` is 3.
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and `n` is greater than 2.
- `divisors` is `[2, 3, n // 3]` unless the condition `3 != n // 3` fails.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`total` is unspecified, `i` is 3, `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and `n` is greater than 2, `divisors` is `[2, 3, n // 3]` unless the condition `3 != n // 3` fails.**
