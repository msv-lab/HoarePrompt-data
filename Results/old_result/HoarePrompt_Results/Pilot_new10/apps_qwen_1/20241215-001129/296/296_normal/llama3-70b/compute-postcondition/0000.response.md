The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of `int(input())` to `n`. This means that `n` now holds the integer value input by the user. Since the initial state specified that `n` is a positive integer such that `2 <= n <= 10^9`, after the execution of this line, `n` will still satisfy this condition, as the `input()` function and subsequent conversion to an integer will ensure a valid positive integer within the given range.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9**
