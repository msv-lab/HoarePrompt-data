`k` is assigned the value 2. The value of `n` remains unchanged within the given range (2 <= n <= 10^9) and the condition that `n` is not equal to 2. The program prints 'YES', which is not affected by the assignment of `k`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9 and `n` is not equal to 2; `k` is 2; the program prints 'YES'**
