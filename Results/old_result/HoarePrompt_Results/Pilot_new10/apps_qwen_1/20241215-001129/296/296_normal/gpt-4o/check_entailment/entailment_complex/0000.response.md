Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, the program only checks for divisors up to the square root of \( n \) and does not ensure that the sum of the fractions equals \( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation:

1. **Divisor Calculation**: 
   - The program correctly identifies all divisors of \( n \) that are greater than 1 and less than or equal to \( \sqrt{n} \).
   - However, it does not consider the requirement that \( \sum\limits_{i=1}^k \frac{a_i}{b_i} = 1 - \frac{1}{n} \).

2. **Sum of Fractions**:
   - The program returns a list of fractions \(\left(\frac{1}{d}\right)\) for each divisor \(d\) of \(n\), but it does not ensure that their sum equals \( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \).
   - For example, for \( n = 6 \), the divisors are 2 and 3, and the fractions would be \(\frac{1}{2}\) and \(\frac{1}{3}\). However, the sum of these fractions is \(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{5}{6}\), which is not equal to \(1 - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{6}\) in this specific context.

3. **Handling Prime Numbers**:
   - If \( n \) is a prime number, the program correctly returns 'NO' because no valid sequence of fractions can satisfy the condition when \( n \) is prime.
   - For composite numbers, the program still returns 'YES' and lists all divisors, but it does not ensure that the sum of the fractions equals \( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \).

To meet the problem description, the program needs to generate a sequence of fractions that sums to \( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \). The current implementation does not address this critical requirement.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not fully meet the problem description.
