The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9. The function returns either 'NO' or 'YES\nk\n' followed by each tuple (a, b) from the list `fractions` formatted as 'a b', where k is the length of the list `divisors`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` and return 'NO' in Case_1 and Case_2, and 'YES\nk\n' followed by each tuple (a, b) from the list `fractions` formatted as 'a b' in Case_3, where k is the length of the list `divisors`.
