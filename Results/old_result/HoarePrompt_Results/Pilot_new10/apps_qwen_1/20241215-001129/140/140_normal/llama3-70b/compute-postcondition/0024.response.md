Output State: **`node` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex and its value is a list of vertices that the key vertex has directed edges to, `visited` and `rec_stack` are lists used to keep track of visited nodes and the recursion stack during depth-first search, respectively, `visited[node]` is True, `rec_stack[node]` is True, `graph[node]` is empty or all neighbors have been processed. If `func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack)` returns True for any neighbor, the function returns True. If `rec_stack[neighbor]` is True for any neighbor, the function returns True. Otherwise, the function returns None.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initial State**: The `node` is a vertex, `graph` is a dictionary representing the graph, `visited` and `rec_stack` are lists used to keep track of visited nodes and the recursion stack, and both `visited[node]` and `rec_stack[node]` are set to True.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each neighbor of `node`.
   - If a neighbor is not yet visited (`visited[neighbor]` is False), the function `func_1` is called.
   - If `func_1` returns True, the function immediately returns True.
   - If a neighbor is already visited (`visited[neighbor]` is True) and is also in the recursion stack (`rec_stack[neighbor]` is True), the function immediately returns True.
   - If none of these conditions are met (i.e., the neighbor is visited and not in the recursion stack), the loop continues to the next neighbor.

3. **Termination Conditions**:
   - If `graph[node]` is empty, the loop does not execute, and the function returns None.
   - If `graph[node]` is not empty, the loop processes all neighbors. If any call to `func_1` returns True, the function returns True. If no such calls return True and the loop completes, the function returns None.

4. **Final State**: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the `node`, `graph`, `visited`, and `rec_stack` lists remain unchanged. The function returns True if any call to `func_1` returns True, otherwise it returns None if no such calls were made.
