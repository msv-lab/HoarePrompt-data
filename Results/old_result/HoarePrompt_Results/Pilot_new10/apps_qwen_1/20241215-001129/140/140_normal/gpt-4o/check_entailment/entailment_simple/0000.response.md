Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic to determine whether a directed graph can become acyclic by removing at most one edge. Here's a breakdown of why the program meets the problem description:

1. **Input Parsing**: 
   - The program reads the input data correctly and parses it into the necessary variables (`n`, `m`, and `edges`). This is evident from the way `sys.stdin.read` and `split` are used to read the input and then parse it into `n`, `m`, and `edges`.

2. **Graph Representation**:
   - The program constructs an adjacency list representation of the graph using `defaultdict(list)`. For each edge `(u, v)` in the input, it adds `v` to the list corresponding to `u` in the graph.

3. **Cycle Detection**:
   - The program uses the `has_cycle` function to check if the graph contains a cycle. This function calculates the in-degrees of all vertices and performs a topological sort using Kahn's algorithm. If there are more than zero vertices left in the queue at the end of the algorithm, it indicates that the graph is cyclic, returning `True`.

4. **Edge Removal and Cycle Check**:
   - The main function `func_1` checks if the graph is already acyclic by calling `has_cycle`. If it is, it immediately returns `'YES'`.
   - If the graph contains a cycle, it iterates over all edges and temporarily removes each edge one by one. After removing an edge, it checks again if the graph is acyclic using `has_cycle`. If the graph becomes acyclic, it returns `'YES'`.
   - If none of the edge removals make the graph acyclic, it finally returns `'NO'`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints `'YES'` or `'NO'` based on the result of the above checks, which is consistent with the problem description.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the graph can become acyclic by removing at most one edge, as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
