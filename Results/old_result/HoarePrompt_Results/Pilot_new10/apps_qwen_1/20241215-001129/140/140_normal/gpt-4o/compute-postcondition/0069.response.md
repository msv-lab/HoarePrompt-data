Postcondition: ***`graph[node]` is a non-empty list, `queue` is either the original queue without the leftmost node or the original queue plus the neighbor, `in_degree[neighbor]` is -2 for all neighbors of the removed node and retains its original value for other neighbors; `count` is increased by 1. If `in_degree[neighbor]` equals 0, then `queue` includes the neighbor. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
