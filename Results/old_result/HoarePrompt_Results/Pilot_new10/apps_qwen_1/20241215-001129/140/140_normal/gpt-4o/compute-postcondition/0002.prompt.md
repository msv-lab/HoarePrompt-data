You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for understanding the program state at the start of the for loop. You will be provided with the program state before the first execution of the for loop, which you need to modify. You will also see the for loop statement. Please do not make any assumptions. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State before the for loop: `total` is 10.
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute?


Example Answer 1:
According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, total is 10 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and i is now 1. 
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 1,  `n` must be greater than 0**

Example 2:
State before the loop starts: `total` is 0, students_list is a list of students.
```
for index, student in enumerate(students_list):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute?


Example Answer 2:
According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the student_list.  If the list has at least 1 student the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, total is 0. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 student and the index is 0 and student is the first student in the list.
State: **`total` is 0,  students_list is a list of students that must have at least 1 student, student is the first student in the list, index is 0**


Your Task:
State before the loop starts: Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute.

### Initial State
- `graph`: A dictionary where keys are integers representing vertices, and values are lists of integers representing the vertices that each key vertex has outgoing edges to.
- `n` and `m`: Integers such that \(2 \leq n \leq 500\) and \(1 \leq m \leq \min(n(n - 1), 100000)\), representing the number of vertices and edges in the graph, respectively.
- `in_degree`: A dictionary where each key from 1 to `n` is mapped to 0.

### For Loop Statement
```python
for u in graph:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Variable `u`:**
   - The loop iterates over the keys in the `graph` dictionary.
   - For the loop to start executing, there must be at least one key in the `graph` dictionary.

2. **Variable `graph`:**
   - Since the loop iterates over the keys of `graph`, `graph` must contain at least one key (vertex) for the loop to execute.

3. **Other Variables (`n`, `m`, `in_degree`):**
   - These variables do not directly influence the condition for the loop to start. However, they provide context about the structure and size of the graph.
   - `n` specifies the number of vertices.
   - `m` specifies the number of edges.
   - `in_degree` is a dictionary initialized to zero for all vertices, but it does not affect the loop starting condition.

### Conclusion
The critical adjustment needed is ensuring that the `graph` dictionary contains at least one key (vertex). 

Therefore, the final state after considering the necessary adjustments is:

**State: `graph` must contain at least one key (vertex), and `n` is within the specified range [2, 500], `m` is within the specified range [1, min(n(n - 1), 100000)], and `in_degree` is a dictionary where each key from 1 to `n` is mapped to 0.**

In summary:
- `graph` must contain at least one key (vertex).
- `n` must be in the range \(2 \leq n \leq 500\).
- `m` must be in the range \(1 \leq m \leq \min(n(n - 1), 100000)\).
- `in_degree` is a dictionary where each key from 1 to `n` is mapped to 0.
```
for v in graph[u]:
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute?
