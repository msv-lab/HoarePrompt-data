Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic to determine if a directed graph can become acyclic by removing at most one edge. Let's break down the reasoning:

1. **Graph Construction**: The code constructs the graph using the given edges and stores it in a dictionary (`graph`).

2. **Cycle Detection**: The `has_cycle` function is used to check if the graph contains any cycles. This function works by calculating the in-degrees of all vertices and performing a topological sort using a queue. If the count of visited nodes is not equal to the number of vertices (`n`), it indicates the presence of a cycle.

3. **Edge Removal and Cycle Check**: In the `func_1` function, the code attempts to remove each edge temporarily and checks if the graph becomes acyclic. If removing any edge results in a graph without a cycle, the function returns 'YES'. If no such edge is found, it returns 'NO'.

Given the problem description and the output hints, the code follows the specified logic accurately. Hereâ€™s a brief outline of how the code handles different cases:

- **Initial Graph Check**: If the initial graph does not contain a cycle, the function immediately returns 'YES'.
- **Edge Removal Check**: For each edge, the graph is modified by removing the edge temporarily, and the cycle detection function is called. If the modified graph is acyclic, the function returns 'YES'. After the check, the edge is restored to maintain the original graph structure.

Since the code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and the output hints, and it handles all potential cases as required, the correctness is **True**.
