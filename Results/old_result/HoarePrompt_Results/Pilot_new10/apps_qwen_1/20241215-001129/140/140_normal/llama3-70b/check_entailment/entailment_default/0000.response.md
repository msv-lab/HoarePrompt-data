Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly determine whether the graph can be made acyclic by removing at most one edge. The function `func_1` performs a depth-first search (DFS) to detect cycles, but it does not handle the scenario where removing an edge can break a cycle. Specifically, the function does not check if removing any single edge can make the graph acyclic. Instead, it only checks if a cycle exists starting from each node.

To illustrate why the code is incorrect, consider the following example:

### Example:

**Input:**
```
3 4
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Explanation:**
By removing the edge `3 -> 2`, the graph becomes acyclic. However, the provided code would not detect this because it does not attempt to remove any edges and check the result.

### Another Example:

**Input:**
```
5 6
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1
2 1
4 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
NO
```

**Explanation:**
In this case, no single edge removal can make the graph acyclic. The provided code would incorrectly return "YES" because it does not attempt to remove any edges and check the result.

The code only checks for cycles but does not attempt to remove any edges and verify if the resulting graph is acyclic. Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
