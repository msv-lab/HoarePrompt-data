Postcondition: **`graph[node]` is a non-empty list, `queue` is the original queue without the leftmost node, `in_degree[neighbor]` is -2 for all neighbors of the removed node and retains its original value for other neighbors; `count` is increased by 1, the current value of `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0**
