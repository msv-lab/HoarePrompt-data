Output State: **`graph` remains a dictionary where keys are integers representing vertices, and values are lists of integers representing the vertices that each key vertex has outgoing edges to; `n` and `m` remain as originally defined, but they do not change; `in_degree` is a dictionary where each key from 1 to `n` is mapped to an integer representing the total number of incoming edges to that vertex, and this integer is incremented by the number of times each vertex `v` appears in the lists of vertices that have outgoing edges from any vertex `u`.**
