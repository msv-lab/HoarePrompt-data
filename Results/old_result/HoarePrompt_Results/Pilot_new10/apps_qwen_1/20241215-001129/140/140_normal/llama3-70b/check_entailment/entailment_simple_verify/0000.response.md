Final: **False**

Reason: The annotated version of the code clearly shows that the program performs a DFS to detect cycles in the graph but does not account for the possibility of making the graph acyclic by removing at most one edge. The function `func_1` only checks for cycles and does not consider edge removals. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate because the program does not meet the requirement of determining if the graph can become acyclic by removing at most one edge.
