`node` is assigned the value of the leftmost element from `queue` using the `popleft` method, which removes and returns that element from the queue. The `queue` is modified by removing this element. The `in_degree` values for the neighbors of the removed node are set to -1 as per the precondition. The `graph` structure and the `in_degree` values for other nodes remain unchanged.

Output State: **`graph[node]` is a non-empty list, `queue` is the original queue without the leftmost node, `in_degree[neighbor]` is -1 for all neighbors of the removed node, and `in_degree[original_neighbor]` retains its original value for other neighbors.**
