The code `queue.append(neighbor)` appends the neighbor to the queue. This means that the queue now includes the neighbor along with its original elements.

- The initial state of `queue` does not include the neighbor.
- After the code is executed, the neighbor is added to the queue.
- The other conditions remain unchanged: `graph[node]` is a non-empty list, `in_degree[neighbor]` is -2 for all neighbors of the removed node and retains its original value for other neighbors, `count` is increased by 1, and the current value of `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0 (for the removed node's neighbors).

Output State: **`graph[node]` is a non-empty list, `queue` is the original queue plus the neighbor, `in_degree[neighbor]` is -2 for all neighbors of the removed node and retains its original value for other neighbors; `count` is increased by 1, the current value of `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0**
