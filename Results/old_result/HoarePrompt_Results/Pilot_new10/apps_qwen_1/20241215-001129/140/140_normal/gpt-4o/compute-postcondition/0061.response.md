Output State: **`graph[node]` is a non-empty list, `queue` contains all nodes with in-degree zero, `in_degree[neighbor]` is -1 for all neighbors that were added to the queue, and `in_degree[original_neighbor]` retains its original value for other neighbors.** 

Explanation:
- The loop processes each node's neighbors, decrementing the in-degree of each neighbor.
- When a neighbor's in-degree reaches zero, it is added to the queue.
- This process continues until there are no more nodes with in-degree zero left to process.
- After the loop completes, all nodes that originally had an in-degree of zero will have been processed, and their in-degrees will be set to -1 (since they are now in the queue).
- Nodes that did not have their in-degrees reduced to zero remain in their original state, with their in-degree values unchanged.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., there are no nodes with in-degree zero initially):
- `queue` remains empty.
- `in_degree` values remain unchanged.
- `graph[node]` is still a non-empty list (as per the initial state).

Thus, the final output state captures the complete behavior of the loop, including both the cases where the loop executes and where it does not.
