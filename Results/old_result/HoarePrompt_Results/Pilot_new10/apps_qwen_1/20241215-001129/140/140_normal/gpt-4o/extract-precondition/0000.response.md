Precondition: **graph is a dictionary where keys are integers representing vertices, and values are lists of integers representing the vertices that each key vertex has outgoing edges to; n and m are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500 and 1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000), representing the number of vertices and edges in the graph, respectively.**
