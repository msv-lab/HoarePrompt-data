The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `edges`, where `n` is the number of vertices in a directed graph, `m` is the number of edges, and `edges` is a list of tuples representing directed edges. The function constructs a graph using the given edges and checks if the graph contains a cycle. If the graph initially does not contain a cycle, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, it attempts to remove each edge temporarily, checking if the graph still contains a cycle after each removal. If removing any edge results in a graph without a cycle, the function returns 'YES'. If no such edge is found, the function returns 'NO'.
