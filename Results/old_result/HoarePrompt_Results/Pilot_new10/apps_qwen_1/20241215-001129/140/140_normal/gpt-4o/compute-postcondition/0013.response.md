The code `in_degree[v] += 1` increments the value of `in_degree[v]` by 1. Since the initial state of `graph[u]` contains at least one element, this does not affect `in_degree` directly. Therefore, the only change is to the `in_degree[v]` variable.

Output State: **`graph[u]` must contain at least one element; `in_degree[v]` is increased by 1**
