Output State: **`graph[node]` is an empty list, `queue` is the set of all nodes that have an in-degree of 0 after processing all neighbors of the initial node, `in_degree[neighbor]` is updated to reflect the removal of the node and any subsequent nodes processed, and `count` is equal to the number of nodes processed (including the initial node).** 

Explanation:
- The loop iteratively processes each neighbor of the current node, decrementing the in-degree of each neighbor.
- When the in-degree of a neighbor reaches 0, it gets added to the queue, indicating it is ready to be processed next.
- This process continues until all neighbors of the initial node and any subsequent nodes that become available due to their in-degrees reaching 0 are processed.
- Once all neighbors and their dependent nodes are processed, `graph[node]` becomes an empty list because all its neighbors have been removed.
- The `queue` contains all nodes that have an in-degree of 0 after processing, as they are now ready to be processed next.
- The `in_degree` dictionary is updated to reflect the removal of the initial node and any subsequent nodes that were processed.
- The `count` variable keeps track of the total number of nodes processed, including the initial node.

If the loop does not execute at all, it means the initial node does not have any neighbors, and thus `graph[node]` remains a non-empty list containing the node itself, `queue` remains unchanged, and `in_degree` and `count` retain their original values. However, based on the problem statement, we assume the graph is non-empty, so this scenario is less likely to occur.
