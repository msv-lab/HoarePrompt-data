Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program attempts to detect cycles in the graph using depth-first search (DFS) with recursion. However, it does not handle the case where removing an edge would make the graph acyclic. Specifically, the function `func_1` only checks for cycles but does not consider whether removing an edge could eliminate a cycle.

To illustrate this, consider the following input:

```
3 4
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1
```

For this input, the graph contains a cycle \(1 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 1\). The program correctly identifies this cycle and prints 'NO'. However, if we were to remove the edge \(3 \rightarrow 1\), the graph would become acyclic. The current implementation does not attempt to remove edges and check if the graph becomes acyclic after each removal.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirement of determining if the graph can become acyclic by removing at most one edge.
