Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic to determine if a directed graph can become acyclic by removing at most one edge. Here's why:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the input correctly and constructs the graph using adjacency lists.
2. **Checking for Cycle**: The `has_cycle` function uses topological sorting through Kahn's algorithm (BFS-based approach) to detect cycles. It calculates the in-degrees of each node and performs a BFS to check if all nodes can be visited without forming a cycle.
3. **Edge Removal and Rechecking**: The main function `func_1` iterates over each edge, temporarily removes it, and checks if the graph becomes acyclic. If any removal makes the graph acyclic, it returns 'YES'. If no such removal exists, it returns 'NO'.

Given the logic and the examples provided, the program seems to handle all cases correctly. There are no apparent flaws in the logic or potential edge cases that the program fails to address. Thus, the program is correct according to the problem description.
