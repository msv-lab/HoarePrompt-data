Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program provided does not handle the case where removing any single edge is sufficient to make the graph acyclic. The function `func_1` performs a depth-first search (DFS) to detect cycles, but it does not attempt to remove each edge individually to check if the graph becomes acyclic after the removal. 

For instance, consider the following input:

```
3 3
1 2
2 3
3 1
```

In this case, the graph contains a cycle $1 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 1$. However, the program will output 'YES' because it does not check the effect of removing each edge individually. Removing any one of the edges would make the graph acyclic, but the current implementation does not perform this check.

To fix this, the program needs to iterate through each edge and temporarily remove it, then check if the graph becomes acyclic using the DFS approach.
