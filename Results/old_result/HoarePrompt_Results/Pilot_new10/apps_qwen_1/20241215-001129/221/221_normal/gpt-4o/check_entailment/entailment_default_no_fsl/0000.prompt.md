You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Two positive integers a and b have a sum of s and a bitwise XOR of x. How many possible values are there for the ordered pair (a, b)?


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers s and x (2 ≤ s ≤ 10^12, 0 ≤ x ≤ 10^12), the sum and bitwise xor of the pair of positive integers, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer, the number of solutions to the given conditions. If no solutions exist, print 0.


-----Examples-----
Input
9 5

Output
4

Input
3 3

Output
2

Input
5 2

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first sample, we have the following solutions: (2, 7), (3, 6), (6, 3), (7, 2).

In the second sample, the only solutions are (1, 2) and (2, 1).
Program:
```
def func():
    a = b ^ x
    b = a ^ x


```
Output hints: Let's analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions step by step.

### Annotated Code Analysis:
```python
def func():
    a = b ^ x
    b = a ^ x
```

### Return Postconditions:
- The function does not explicitly return anything.
- The function accepts two parameters `s` and `x`, both of which are non-negative integers with the constraints \(2 \leq s \leq 10^{12}\) and \(0 \leq x \leq 10^{12}\).
- The function modifies the variables `a` and `b` using bitwise XOR operations.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State**: The function does not take any parameters, so we assume `a` and `b` are already defined and initialized somewhere outside the function.
2. **First Line**: `a = b ^ x`
   - This line computes the bitwise XOR of `b` and `x` and assigns the result to `a`.
3. **Second Line**: `b = a ^ x`
   - This line computes the bitwise XOR of `a` (which now holds the result of `b ^ x`) and `x` and assigns the result back to `b`.

### Potential Edge Cases and Missing Logic:
- The function does not return any value, but it modifies `a` and `b` based on the given `x`.
- The initial values of `a` and `b` are not specified in the annotated code or the return postconditions.
- There are no constraints or checks on the initial values of `a` and `b`.

### Summary:
The function `func` takes no explicit parameters but modifies the variables `a` and `b` using bitwise XOR operations with the value `x`. The function does not return any value.

### Final Functionality Summary:
**The function modifies the variables `a` and `b` using bitwise XOR operations with the value `x` and does not return any value.**

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
