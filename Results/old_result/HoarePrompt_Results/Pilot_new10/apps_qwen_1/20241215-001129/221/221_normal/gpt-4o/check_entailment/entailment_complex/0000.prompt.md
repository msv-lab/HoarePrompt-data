You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Two positive integers a and b have a sum of s and a bitwise XOR of x. How many possible values are there for the ordered pair (a, b)?


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers s and x (2 ≤ s ≤ 10^12, 0 ≤ x ≤ 10^12), the sum and bitwise xor of the pair of positive integers, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer, the number of solutions to the given conditions. If no solutions exist, print 0.


-----Examples-----
Input
9 5

Output
4

Input
3 3

Output
2

Input
5 2

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first sample, we have the following solutions: (2, 7), (3, 6), (6, 3), (7, 2).

In the second sample, the only solutions are (1, 2) and (2, 1).
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s and x are non-negative integers such that 2 ≤ s ≤ 10^12 and 0 ≤ x ≤ 10^12.
def func():
    a = b ^ x
    b = a ^ x
#Overall this is what the function does:Let's analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions step by step.

### Annotated Code Analysis:
```python
def func():
    a = b ^ x
    b = a ^ x
```

### Return Postconditions:
- The function does not explicitly return anything.
- The function accepts two parameters `s` and `x`, both of which are non-negative integers with the constraints \(2 \leq s \leq 10^{12}\) and \(0 \leq x \leq 10^{12}\).
- The function modifies the variables `a` and `b` using bitwise XOR operations.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State**: The function does not take any parameters, so we assume `a` and `b` are already defined and initialized somewhere outside the function.
2. **First Line**: `a = b ^ x`
   - This line computes the bitwise XOR of `b` and `x` and assigns the result to `a`.
3. **Second Line**: `b = a ^ x`
   - This line computes the bitwise XOR of `a` (which now holds the result of `b ^ x`) and `x` and assigns the result back to `b`.

### Potential Edge Cases and Missing Logic:
- The function does not return any value, but it modifies `a` and `b` based on the given `x`.
- The initial values of `a` and `b` are not specified in the annotated code or the return postconditions.
- There are no constraints or checks on the initial values of `a` and `b`.

### Summary:
The function `func` takes no explicit parameters but modifies the variables `a` and `b` using bitwise XOR operations with the value `x`. The function does not return any value.

### Final Functionality Summary:
**The function modifies the variables `a` and `b` using bitwise XOR operations with the value `x` and does not return any value.**
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
