You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Two positive integers a and b have a sum of s and a bitwise XOR of x. How many possible values are there for the ordered pair (a, b)?


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers s and x (2 ≤ s ≤ 10^12, 0 ≤ x ≤ 10^12), the sum and bitwise xor of the pair of positive integers, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer, the number of solutions to the given conditions. If no solutions exist, print 0.


-----Examples-----
Input
9 5

Output
4

Input
3 3

Output
2

Input
5 2

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first sample, we have the following solutions: (2, 7), (3, 6), (6, 3), (7, 2).

In the second sample, the only solutions are (1, 2) and (2, 1).
Program:
```
def func():
    a = b ^ x
    b = a ^ x


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not actually calculate the number of solutions for the given conditions. It merely swaps the values of `a` and `b` using XOR operations, which does not address the problem's requirement to count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy both the sum `s` and the bitwise XOR `x`.

To solve this problem correctly, the program needs to consider the properties of the sum and XOR operations. Specifically, for any given `s` and `x`, the parity (odd/even nature) of `s` and `x` must be consistent with the properties of the XOR operation. Additionally, the program needs to check if the given `s` and `x` allow for valid pairs `(a, b)` and count them accordingly.

Since the provided code does not perform these necessary checks and calculations, it fails to meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s and x are non-negative integers such that 2 ≤ s ≤ 10^12 and 0 ≤ x ≤ 10^12.
def func():
    a = b ^ x
    b = a ^ x

### Annotated Code Analysis:
```python
def func():
    a = b ^ x
    b = a ^ x
```

### Return Postconditions:
- The function does not explicitly return anything.
- The function accepts two parameters `s` and `x`, both of which are non-negative integers with the constraints \(2 \leq s \leq 10^{12}\) and \(0 \leq x \leq 10^{12}\).
- The function modifies the variables `a` and `b` using bitwise XOR operations.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State**: The function does not take any parameters, so we assume `a` and `b` are already defined and initialized somewhere outside the function.
2. **First Line**: `a = b ^ x`
   - This line computes the bitwise XOR of `b` and `x` and assigns the result to `a`.
3. **Second Line**: `b = a ^ x`
   - This line computes the bitwise XOR of `a` (which now holds the result of `b ^ x`) and `x` and assigns the result back to `b`.

### Potential Edge Cases and Missing Logic:
- The function does not return any value, but it modifies `a` and `b` based on the given `x`.
- The initial values of `a` and `b` are not specified in the annotated code or the return postconditions.
- There are no constraints or checks on the initial values of `a` and `b`.

### Summary:
The function `func` takes no explicit parameters but modifies the variables `a` and `b` using bitwise XOR operations with the value `x`. The function does not return any value.

### Final Functionality Summary:
**The function modifies the variables `a` and `b` using bitwise XOR operations with the value `x` and does not return any value.**

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
