The function `func` accepts two parameters `s` and `x`. Both `s` and `x` are non-negative integers such that `2 ≤ s ≤ 10^12` and `0 ≤ x ≤ 10^12`. The function has two cases:
- **Case_1**: `s` is a non-negative integer such that `2 ≤ s ≤ 10^12` and `x` is a non-negative integer such that `0 ≤ x ≤ 10^12`. If `s` is less than `x`, the function returns `False`.
- **Case_2**: `s` is a non-negative integer such that `2 ≤ s ≤ 10^12` and `x` is a non-negative integer such that `0 ≤ x ≤ 10^12`. If `s` is greater than or equal to `x`, the function returns `True`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two parameters `s` and `x`, both non-negative integers with specific constraints, and return `True` if `s` is greater than or equal to `x`, otherwise return `False`.
