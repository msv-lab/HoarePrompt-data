Postcondition: ***`z` is at least 1, there exists an integer `i` such that `z % i == 0`; `a` is `i * x`, `b` is `a / i`; `l <= a <= r`, `l <= b <= r`, `math.gcd(a, b) == x`, `a * b // math.gcd(a, b) == y`; if `a` equals `b`, `count` is increased by 1; if `a` does not equal `b`, `count` is increased by 2.***
