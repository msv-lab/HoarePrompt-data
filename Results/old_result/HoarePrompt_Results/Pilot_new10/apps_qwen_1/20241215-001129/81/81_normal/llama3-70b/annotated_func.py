#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers such that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^9\) and \(1 \leq x \leq y \leq 10^9\). The function `func_1` is used to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers a and b, and it is assumed that within the main program, the values of a and b are set to x and y respectively, or some multiples thereof that satisfy the conditions for being a good pair.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`, `b` is 0
    return a
    #The program returns `a`, which is the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of these two integers using the Euclidean algorithm. The function ensures that after the loop, `a` contains the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`, and `b` is set to 0. This function does not handle cases where `a` or `b` are negative, although the input constraints ensure non-negativity.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that \( \text{func\_1}(a, b) \) returns their greatest common divisor (GCD), and \( a \times b \) is divisible by their GCD.
def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b // func_1(a, b)
    #`a * b` divided by their greatest common divisor (GCD)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, computes their greatest common divisor (GCD) using `func_1(a, b)`, and returns the result of dividing their product by their GCD.
