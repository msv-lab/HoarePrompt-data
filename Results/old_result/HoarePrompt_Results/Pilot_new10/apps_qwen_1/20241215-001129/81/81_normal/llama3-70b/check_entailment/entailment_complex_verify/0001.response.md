Final: **False**

Reason: The annotated version of the code provides clarity on the functionality of the functions `func_1` and `func_2`, but it does not address the fundamental issue with the main logic of the program. The program checks each pair `(a, b)` in the range `[l, r]` and uses `func_1` and `func_2` to verify if the GCD and LCM conditions are met. However, the main loop only iterates over pairs `(a, b)` where `a <= b`, which means it misses pairs where `a > b`.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to consider all pairs `(a, b)` where `l <= a, b <= r` and `a != b` separately. The current implementation only considers pairs where `a <= b`, which is insufficient. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate because the program does not correctly account for all possible good pairs.
