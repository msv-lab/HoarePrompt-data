Postcondition: ***`z` is at least 1 and \( z \% (i + 2) == 0 \); \( a \) and \( b \) are integers such that \( a = (i + 1) \times x \) and \( b = z // (i + 1) \times x \); both \( a \) and \( b \) satisfy \( l \leq a \leq r \) and \( l \leq b \leq r \); \( \mathit{math.gcd}(a, b) == x \); \( a \times b // \mathit{math.gcd}(a, b) == y \); the count is updated to either count + 1 or count + 2 depending on whether \( a \) equals \( b \); \( z \% (i + 2) == 0 \).***

This postcondition encompasses both the if and the absence of an else part, maintaining the integrity of the original conditions and updates to the variables as described.
