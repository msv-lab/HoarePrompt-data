Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `a` is `a_initial % b_initial`
   - `b` is `a_initial`

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop continues as long as `b` is non-zero (`while b:`).

3. **Loop Body**:
   - The loop body is omitted, but based on the Euclidean algorithm, the loop updates `a` and `b` such that `a` becomes `b` and `b` becomes `a % b`.

4. **Current State**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `b` is non-zero. For the loop to execute one more time, `b` must remain non-zero.

Given that `b` is non-zero at the end of the previous iteration, we need to ensure that the next iteration of the loop also has `b` as non-zero. Since the loop updates `a` and `b` in a way that `b` becomes `a % b`, the condition for `b` to be non-zero in the next iteration is already satisfied because `b` was non-zero in the current iteration.

Therefore, no additional adjustments to the states are necessary for the loop to execute one more time.

**Answer:**
State: **`a` is `a_initial % b_initial`, `b` is `a_initial`**
