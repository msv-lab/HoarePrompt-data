The code snippet updates the values of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD). Let's analyze the impact step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `a` is `a_initial`.
   - `b` is `a_initial % b_initial`.

2. **Code Execution:**
   - `a, b = b, a % b`
   - This line of code reassigns the value of `b` to `a`, and assigns the value of `a % b` to `a`.

3. **New Values Calculation:**
   - After the first assignment (`a, b = b, a % b`), `b` becomes the old value of `a`, which is `a_initial`.
   - The new value of `a` is calculated as `a_initial % b_initial`.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `a` is now `a_initial % b_initial`.
- `b` is now `a_initial`.

The output state after the code execution is:
Output State: **`a` is `a_initial % b_initial`; `b` is `a_initial`.**
