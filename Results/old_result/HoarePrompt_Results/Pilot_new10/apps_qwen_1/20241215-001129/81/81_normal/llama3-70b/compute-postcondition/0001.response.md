The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are positive integers such that their greatest common divisor (GCD) is calculated using `func_1(a, b)`, and the product of `a` and `b` is divisible by their GCD.

The function returns the result of dividing `a * b` by their GCD.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two positive integers `a` and `b`, and return the result of dividing their product by their greatest common divisor (GCD).

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both positive integers, and returns the result of dividing their product by their greatest common divisor (GCD).**
