Postcondition: ***`z` is at least 1 and \( z \% (i + 2) == 0 \); \( a = i \times x \); \( b = z // i \times x \); both \( a \) and \( b \) satisfy \( l \leq a \leq r \) and \( l \leq b \leq r \); \( \mathit{math.gcd}(a, b) == x \); \( a \times b // \mathit{math.gcd}(a, b) == y \); the count is updated to either count + 1 or count + 2 depending on whether \( a \) equals \( b \); \( z \% (i + 2) == 0 \).***

Explanation: Since there is no else part, the postcondition of the if part directly serves as the overall postcondition of the entire if-else block. The if statement checks the conditions specified in the if part and updates the count accordingly, and these conditions are already included in the postcondition of the if part. Therefore, the overall postcondition remains the same as the postcondition of the if part.
