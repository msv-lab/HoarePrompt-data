Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly determines Lara's position based on the given number of moves \( k \). Let's break down how the program works:

1. The total number of moves \( k \) is first reduced modulo \( n \times 2 - 2 \). This accounts for the repeating pattern of Lara's movement through the dungeon.

2. If \( k < n - 1 \), it means Lara is still in the downward movement phase from cell (1,1) to cell (n,1). The program calculates the exact row and column by adding 1 to \( k \) and keeping the column as 1.

3. If \( k \geq n - 1 \), it means Lara has completed the downward movement and started the snake-like movement. The program calculates the row and column based on the remaining moves after subtracting \( n - 1 \) (which covers the downward movement).

The program handles all potential cases within the given constraints and correctly determines Lara's position for any valid \( k \). Therefore, the program is correct.
