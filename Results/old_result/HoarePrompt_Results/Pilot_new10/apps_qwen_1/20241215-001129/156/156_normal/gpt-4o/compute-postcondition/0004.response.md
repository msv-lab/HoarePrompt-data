`full_rows` is assigned the value of `k` divided by `(m - 1)`. The division operation here is integer division, which means the result is the quotient of the division without any decimal part. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `full_rows` based on the given formula and the unchanged values of `n` and `m`.

Output State: **`n` is an even positive integer between 2 and \(10^9\); `m` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n, m \leq 10^9\); `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k < n \cdot m\) and \(k \geq 0` after decrementing by `n - 1`; `full_rows` is `k // (m - 1)`**
