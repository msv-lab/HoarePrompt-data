#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that n is even and 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9, and k is an integer such that 0 ≤ k < n·m.
def func_1(n, m, k):
    if (k < n - 1) :
        print(k + 1, 1)
    else :
        k -= n - 1
        full_rows = k // (m - 1)
        remaining_steps = k % (m - 1)
        if (full_rows % 2 == 0) :
            row = n - full_rows
            col = 2 + remaining_steps
        else :
            row = n - full_rows
            col = m - remaining_steps
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an even positive integer between 2 and \(10^9\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n, m \leq 10^9\), `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k < n \cdot m\) and \(k \geq 0\) after decrementing by `n - 1`, `full_rows` is `k // (m - 1)`, `remaining_steps` is `k % (m - 1)`, `row` is either `n - full_rows` or depends on whether `full_rows` is even or odd, and `col` is either `2 + (k % (m - 1))` if `full_rows` is even or `m - remaining_steps` if `full_rows` is odd.
        print(row, col)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is a positive even integer such that 2 ≤ n, `m` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k < n·m. If `k < n - 1`, then `k` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `k` is decremented by `n - 1`, and the following holds: `full_rows = k // (m - 1)`, `remaining_steps = k % (m - 1)`, `row` is either `n - full_rows` depending on whether `full_rows` is even or odd, and `col` is either `2 + (k % (m - 1))` if `full_rows` is even or `m - remaining_steps` if `full_rows` is odd.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (an even positive integer between 2 and \(10^9\)), `m` (a positive integer such that \(2 \leq m \leq 10^9\)), and `k` (an integer such that \(0 \leq k < n \cdot m\)). It prints the coordinates `(row, col)` based on the given values of `n`, `m`, and `k`. If `k < n - 1`, it prints `(k + 1, 1)`. Otherwise, it adjusts `k` by subtracting `n - 1`, calculates `full_rows` and `remaining_steps`, and determines the row and column based on whether `full_rows` is even or odd. Specifically, if `full_rows` is even, the row is `n - full_rows` and the column is `2 + remaining_steps`; if `full_rows` is odd, the row is `n - full_rows` and the column is `m - remaining_steps`.
