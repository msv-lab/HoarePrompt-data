Let's go through the code step by step:

1. The initial state is:
   - `n` is an integer
   - `m` is an integer
   - `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k < n * 2 - 2\) and `n` is even
   - The current value of `k` satisfies \(k < n * 2 - 2\)

2. The code snippet is:
   ```python
   print(n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1, (k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1)
   ```

3. Let's analyze the expression inside the `print` function:
   - First part: `n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1`
     - `(k - n + 1) % (n - 1)` computes the remainder when `k - n + 1` is divided by `n - 1`. Since \(0 \leq k < n * 2 - 2\) and `n` is even, `k - n + 1` ranges from `-n + 1` to \(n * 2 - 3\). The remainder when this range is divided by `n - 1` will be in the range \(0\) to \(n - 2\).
     - Subtracting this remainder from `n - 1` and then subtracting 1 gives us a value that depends on the specific values of `k`, `n`, and the modulo operation.
   - Second part: `(k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1`
     - This computes the quotient of `k - n + 1` divided by `n - 1` and then adds 1. The quotient will be 0 if `k - n + 1` is less than `n - 1`, and it will increase by 1 for each additional `n - 1`.

4. Since the exact value of `k` is not specified, we need to consider the general case:
   - For the first part, let's denote `(k - n + 1) % (n - 1)` as `r`. Then the expression becomes `n - r - 1`.
   - For the second part, `(k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1` will give the quotient plus 1.

5. Combining these results, the output will be:
   - The first value printed is `n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1`, which simplifies to `n - r - 1` where `r` is the remainder.
   - The second value printed is `(k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1`.

6. The final output state is:
   - `n` is an integer
   - `m` is an integer
   - `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k < n * 2 - 2\) and `n` is even
   - The current value of `k` satisfies \(k < n * 2 - 2\)
   - The printed values are `n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1` and `(k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k < n * 2 - 2\) and `n` is even, and the current value of `k` satisfies \(k < n * 2 - 2\); printed values are `n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1` and `(k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1`**
