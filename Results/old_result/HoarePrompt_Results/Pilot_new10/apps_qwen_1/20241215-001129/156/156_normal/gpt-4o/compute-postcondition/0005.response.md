`remaining_steps` is assigned the value of `k % (m - 1)`. This means that `remaining_steps` will be the remainder when `k` is divided by `m - 1`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `full_rows` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is an even positive integer between 2 and \(10^9\); `m` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n, m \leq 10^9\); `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k < n \cdot m\) and \(k \geq 0\) after decrementing by `n - 1`; `full_rows` is `k // (m - 1)`; `remaining_steps` is `k % (m - 1)`**
