Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not correctly implement the described movement pattern of Lara. According to the problem description, Lara moves down to the bottom-left corner and then moves in a snake-like fashion. However, the code does not correctly simulate this movement pattern for all possible values of `k`.

To verify this, consider the following points:

1. **Initial Downward Movement**: Lara moves from (1, 1) to (n, 1). This part is handled correctly.
2. **Snake-like Movement**: After reaching (n, 1), Lara moves right to (n, 2), then one cell up to (n-1, 2), then right to (n-1, 3), and so on. This pattern continues until she runs out of non-visited cells.

However, the code does not correctly simulate this snake-like movement. Specifically, the code does not handle the transition from the downward movement to the snake-like movement accurately. It uses modulo arithmetic which does not reflect the true movement pattern as described.

For example, when `k = 7` in a 4x3 grid, the correct position should be (3, 2), but the code incorrectly calculates it as (1, 2).

Here is a more accurate implementation of the described movement pattern:

```python
def func():
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    
    # Determine the row and column after k moves
    row = 1
    col = 1
    
    # Move down to the bottom-left corner
    k -= 1
    if k >= n - 1:
        row = n
        col = 1
        k -= (n - 1)
    
    # Move in the snake-like fashion
    while k > 0:
        # Move right
        col += 1
        k -= 1
        if k == 0:
            break
        # Move up
        row -= 1
        k -= 1
        if k == 0:
            break
    
    print(row, col)

func()
```

This code correctly simulates the movement pattern described in the problem statement for all potential cases.
