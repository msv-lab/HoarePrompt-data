Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the provided annotated version of the code, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly handles all scenarios as described:

1. **Initial Movement Downward**: The program correctly prints the position for the first `n-1` moves, which corresponds to moving down from the top-left corner to the bottom-left corner.

2. **Snake-like Movement**: After the initial downward movement, the program correctly calculates the number of full rows (`full_rows`) and the remaining steps (`remaining_steps`) for the snake-like pattern. It then correctly determines the row and column based on whether the number of full rows is even or odd.

3. **Boundary Conditions**: The program handles the boundary conditions appropriately. For instance, if `k` is less than `n-1`, it directly prints the position corresponding to moving down. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n-1`, it correctly adjusts `k` by subtracting `n-1` and then calculates the position accordingly.

The annotated version clearly shows that the program maintains the required state throughout the execution, and the logic for both the initial downward movement and the subsequent snake-like movement is sound. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is accurate.
