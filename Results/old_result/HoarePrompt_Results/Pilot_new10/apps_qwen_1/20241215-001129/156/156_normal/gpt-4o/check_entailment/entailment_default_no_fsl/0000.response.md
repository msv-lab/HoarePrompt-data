Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has a flaw in calculating the final position for certain values of `k`. Specifically, the code does not handle the case where `k` is exactly equal to `n * m - 1`. In this case, Lara should be in the bottom-right cell (n, m), but the code incorrectly calculates the position.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

**Input**
```
4 3 11
```

**Expected Output**
```
1 2
```

However, the correct output should be:
```
4 3
```

Let's break down why the current implementation fails:

1. **Initial Path**: Lara moves from (1,1) to (4,1).
2. **Snake Movement**: After reaching (4,1), she starts moving in the snake pattern:
   - Right: (4,2)
   - Up: (3,2)
   - Left: (3,1)
   - Right: (3,2)
   - Up: (2,2)
   - Left: (2,1)
   - Right: (2,2)
   - Up: (1,2)
   - Left: (1,1)
   - Right: (1,2)
   - Up: (1,1)
   - Left: (1,2)

After 11 steps, Lara should be at (4,3).

The current implementation, however, calculates the position based on the formula for full rows and remaining steps, which does not account for the exact last step when `k` is `n*m - 1`.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases, leading to the conclusion that the Correctness is **False**.
