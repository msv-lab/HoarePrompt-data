Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly determine Lara's position after she has moved `k` times. Let's analyze the code step-by-step:

1. **Initial Path**: Lara starts at `(1, 1)` and moves down to `(n, 1)`. This covers `n-1` steps.
2. **Snake Path**: After reaching `(n, 1)`, Lara moves to the right and then up in a snake-like pattern.

The code attempts to handle these two phases separately:
- For `k < n - 1`, it directly prints the position `(k + 1, 1)`.
- For `k >= n - 1`, it subtracts `n - 1` from `k` and then calculates the row and column based on the remaining steps.

However, the code has a flaw in how it handles the transition from the initial vertical path to the snake-like movement. Specifically, the calculation of `full_rows` and `remaining_steps` does not correctly map the steps to the appropriate row and column.

Let's consider a specific case to illustrate the issue:
- For `n = 4`, `m = 3`, and `k = 7`:
  - The first `n-1 = 3` steps are vertical movement from `(1, 1)` to `(4, 1)`.
  - Remaining steps: `k - (n - 1) = 7 - 3 = 4`.
  - `full_rows = 4 // (m - 1) = 4 // 2 = 2` (even).
  - `remaining_steps = 4 % (m - 1) = 4 % 2 = 0`.

According to the code:
- Row: `n - full_rows = 4 - 2 = 2`.
- Column: `2 + remaining_steps = 2 + 0 = 2`.

However, the correct position should be `(3, 2)` because Lara would have moved from `(4, 1)` to `(3, 2)` in the snake-like pattern.

This discrepancy shows that the code does not accurately determine Lara's position for all cases. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
