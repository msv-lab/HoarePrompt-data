The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `a`. Since the initial state of `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), the length of the list `a` will be equal to `n`. However, the specific values of the elements in `a` are not given, so they remain as integers between 1 and 100.

The initial value of `n` is not directly affected by the code but is used to determine the length of the list `a`. The variable `a` now holds a list of `n` integers.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100**
