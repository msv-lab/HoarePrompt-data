Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the initial conditions:**
   - `current_cost` remains unchanged if `length` is not greater than `t + 1`.
   - If `length` is greater than `t + 1`, then `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + length - (t + 1)`, and `length` is the next element in the list `a`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - The exact value of `current_cost` and `length` is not specified, but we know that the loop processed the current `length` and either updated `current_cost` or left it unchanged.

3. **Consider the next iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another element in the list `a` to process.
   - If the current `length` is greater than `t + 1`, the next `length` will be the next element in the list `a`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly:**
   - Since the loop will continue if there are more elements in the list `a`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `length` to be the next element in the list `a`.

5. **Finalize the answer:**
   - The state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `current_cost` remains unchanged (as it did not get updated in the last iteration), and `length` is now the next element in the list `a`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`current_cost` remains unchanged, `length` is the next element in the list `a`**
