The code `print(best_t, min_cost)` does not change any variable's value; it only prints the values of `best_t` and `min_cost`. The variables `n`, `a`, `t`, and `current_cost` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 1000 \), `a` is a list of integers where \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 100 \), `min_cost` is the minimum value of `current_cost` encountered during the loop execution, `best_t` is the value of `t` that gave the minimum `current_cost`, `t` is 100 (the maximum value of `t` in the loop), and `current_cost` is the final cost calculated after the loop completes; `best_t` and `min_cost` are printed.**
