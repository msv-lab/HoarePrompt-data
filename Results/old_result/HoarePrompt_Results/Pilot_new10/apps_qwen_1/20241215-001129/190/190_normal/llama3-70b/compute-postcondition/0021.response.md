The code `min_cost = cost` assigns the value of `cost` to `min_cost`. This means that `min_cost` now holds the same value as `cost`, but `cost` remains unchanged. All other variables are unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000; `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` integers; `mid` is the element at index `n // 2` in the list `sticks` and is greater than 0; `cost` is the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each element in `sticks` and its adjacent elements, calculated with `i = mid - 2`; `t` is the element at index `n // 2` in the list `sticks`; `i` is `mid - 2`; `min_cost` is equal to `cost`.**
