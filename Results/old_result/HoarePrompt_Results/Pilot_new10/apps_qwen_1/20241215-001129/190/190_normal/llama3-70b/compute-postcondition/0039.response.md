`min_t` is assigned the value of `i`. From the initial state, `i` is equal to `mid + k + 1`. Therefore, `min_t` is now equal to `mid + k + 1`. The other variables (`cost`, `min_cost`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cost` is the computed value of sum(min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i - 1))) for x in sticks), `i` is `mid + k + 1`, `min_cost` is equal to `cost`, `min_t` is `mid + k + 1`**
