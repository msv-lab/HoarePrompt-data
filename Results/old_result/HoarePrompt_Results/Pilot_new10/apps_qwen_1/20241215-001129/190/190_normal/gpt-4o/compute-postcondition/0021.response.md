The code updates `current_cost` by adding `length - (t + 1)` to its current value. However, the values of `length` and `t` are not specified in the initial state, and they are not provided in the code snippet. The initial state also mentions that `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 and that `a` is a list of integers starting with 4. Since the code does not affect these variables, their states remain unchanged. The only variable affected is `current_cost`.

Let's denote the updated value of `current_cost` as `current_cost + (length - (t + 1))`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers starting with 4, `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + (length - (t + 1))`**
