Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case. Specifically, the code calculates the median of the stick lengths and considers only the median and its neighboring values to minimize the cost. However, the problem requires finding the optimal \( t \) such that all stick lengths are almost good for \( t \) (i.e., \( |a_i - t| \leq 1 \)) and the total cost is minimized. The code only checks the median and its neighbors, which might not always yield the minimum cost.

Consider the following counterexample:

Input:
```
4
1 2 3 4
```

Expected output:
```
2 2
```

Explanation: The optimal choice for \( t \) here is 2. All stick lengths can be changed to 2 with a total cost of 2 (i.e., \( |1-2| + |2-2| + |3-2| + |4-2| = 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 2 \)).

However, the provided code would consider the median (which is 2) and its neighbors (1 and 3). For \( t = 2 \), the cost is 2. For \( t = 1 \), the cost would be \( |1-1| + |2-1| + |3-1| + |4-1| = 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 \). For \( t = 3 \), the cost would be \( |1-3| + |2-3| + |3-3| + |4-3| = 2 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 4 \).

Thus, the code might incorrectly choose \( t = 1 \) or \( t = 3 \) instead of \( t = 2 \), which leads to a higher cost.

Since the code does not handle all potential cases correctly, the program is **incorrect**.
