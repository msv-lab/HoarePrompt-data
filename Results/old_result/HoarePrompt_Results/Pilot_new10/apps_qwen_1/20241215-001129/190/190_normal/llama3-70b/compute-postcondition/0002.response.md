The code `sticks.sort()` sorts the list `sticks` in ascending order. Since the initial state of `sticks` is a list of `n` integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 100\) for each \(i\), after sorting, the smallest value in the list will be the first element, and the largest value will be the last element.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input value (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000); `sticks` is a sorted list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100 for each i, with the smallest value being the first element and the largest value being the last element.**
