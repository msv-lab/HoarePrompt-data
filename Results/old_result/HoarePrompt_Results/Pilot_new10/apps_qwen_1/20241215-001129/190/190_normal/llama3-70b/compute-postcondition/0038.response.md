`min_cost` is assigned the value of `cost`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and `min_t` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `cost` is the computed value of sum(min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i - 1))) for x in sticks), `i` is `mid + k + 1`, `min_cost` is now equal to `cost`, and `min_t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`cost` is the computed value of sum(min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i - 1))) for x in sticks), `i` is `mid + k + 1`, `min_cost` is equal to `cost`, `min_t` remains unchanged**
