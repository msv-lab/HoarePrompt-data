Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is `n // 2 + 1`
   - `cost` is the sum of `min(abs(x - (n // 2 + 1)), abs(x - n // 2))` for each `x` in `sticks`
   - `min_t` is `i`
   - If `cost` is less than `min_cost`, then `min_cost` remains unchanged and `min_t` is `i`. Otherwise, `min_cost` and `min_t` remain unchanged.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(mid + 1, 101):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Determine the New State:**
   - The loop starts with `i = mid + 1` and increments `i` by 1 until `i` reaches 101.
   - Since we need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to find the value of `i` that would trigger the next iteration.
   - The next value of `i` after the current iteration would be `i + 1`.
   - Therefore, the new value of `i` would be `mid + 2`.

4. **Adjust Other Variables:**
   - The value of `cost`, `min_cost`, and `min_t` remains unchanged as per the given conditions. 

So, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `i` should be `mid + 2`
- `cost` remains unchanged
- `min_cost` remains unchanged
- `min_t` remains unchanged

**Final State:**
State: **`i` is `mid + 2`, `cost` is the sum of `min(abs(x - (n // 2 + 1)), abs(x - n // 2))` for each `x` in `sticks`, `min_cost` remains unchanged, `min_t` remains unchanged**
