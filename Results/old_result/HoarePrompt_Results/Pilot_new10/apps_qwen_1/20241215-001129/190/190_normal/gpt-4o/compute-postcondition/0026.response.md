The code updates `min_cost` to be equal to `current_cost`. Since `current_cost` is initially `0`, `min_cost` will also be `0`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 1000 \), `a` is a list of integers where \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 100 \), `min_cost` is \(0\), `best_t` is \(-1\), `t` is \(1\), and `current_cost` is \(0\)**
