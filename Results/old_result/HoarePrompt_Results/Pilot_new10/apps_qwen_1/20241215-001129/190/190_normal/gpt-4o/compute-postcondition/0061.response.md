`current_cost` is assigned the value of itself plus `length - (t + 1)`. Given that `length` is an integer and greater than or equal to `t - 1`, and the current value of `length` is greater than `t + 1`, the value of `length - (t + 1)` is a positive integer. Therefore, `current_cost` is updated by adding this positive integer to its previous value. The conditions on `length` remain valid after the code has been executed.

Output State: **`length` is an integer and greater than or equal to `t - 1`, and the current value of `length` is greater than `t + 1`; `current_cost` is increased by `length - (t + 1)`**
