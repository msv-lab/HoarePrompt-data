Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after the loop has executed.

### Initial State
- `a` is an empty list.
- `current_cost` is 0.
- `min_cost` is the minimum cost encountered.
- `t` is 99.
- `best_t` is the value of `t` that gave the minimum `current_cost` (which is equal to `t` if the if condition is true).

### Loop Code
```python
for length in a:
    if length < t - 1:
        current_cost += t - 1 - length
    elif length > t + 1:
        current_cost += length - (t + 1)
```

### Analysis of the Loop

1. **Empty List Case**: 
   - If `a` is an empty list, the loop will not execute at all.
   - Therefore, `current_cost` remains 0.
   - `min_cost` remains undefined because no `current_cost` is calculated.
   - `best_t` remains 99.

2. **Non-empty List Case**:
   - When the loop executes, it iterates over each `length` in the list `a`.
   - For each `length`:
     - If `length < t - 1`, `current_cost` is updated by adding `t - 1 - length`.
     - If `length > t + 1`, `current_cost` is updated by adding `length - (t + 1)`.

3. **Final Values After All Iterations**:
   - After the loop finishes, `current_cost` will be the sum of all adjustments made according to the conditions in the loop.
   - Since the loop only processes elements in `a`, `a` itself does not change; it remains as it was before the loop.
   - `min_cost` will be the minimum value of `current_cost` encountered during the loop, if any `current_cost` is calculated.
   - `best_t` will be the value of `t` that gave the minimum `current_cost` if there was any calculation, otherwise it remains 99.

### Final Output State

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `current_cost` is the sum of all adjustments made according to the conditions in the loop, `min_cost` is the minimum value of `current_cost` encountered during the loop, and `best_t` is the value of `t` that gave the minimum `current_cost` if any, otherwise it is 99.**
