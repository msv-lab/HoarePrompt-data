Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, the next element in `a` is 4, and `current_cost` is updated based on the new `length` (4). If `length > t + 1`, then `current_cost` is increased by `3 - t`. Otherwise, the value of `current_cost` remains unchanged.***
