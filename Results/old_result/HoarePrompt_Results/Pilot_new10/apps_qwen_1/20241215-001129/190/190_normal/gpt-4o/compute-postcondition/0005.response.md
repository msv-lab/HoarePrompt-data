The code initializes `current_cost` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `a`, `min_cost`, `best_t`, or `t`. The only change is that `current_cost` is now set to 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 100\), `min_cost` is set to infinity (`float('inf')`), `best_t` is -1, `t` is now 1, `current_cost` is 0.**
