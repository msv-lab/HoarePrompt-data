The code assigns the value of `current_cost` to `min_cost`. Since `current_cost` is the final cost calculated and it is lower than `min_cost`, `min_cost` will now hold the same value as `current_cost`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is an empty list, `current_cost` is the final cost calculated, `min_cost` is equal to `current_cost`, `t` is the final value of `t` after the loop execution, and `current_cost` is the final cost calculated.**
