The function `func` accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of integers. The length of the list `a` is `n`, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 1000`, and each element `a_i` in the list satisfies `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100`. 

Based on the given output cases, the function returns:
- Case_1: An integer value representing some specific operation or condition related to the list `a`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a list `a` of integers, where the length of the list is between 1 and 1000, and each element in the list is between 1 and 100, and return an integer value based on some specific condition or operation involving the list `a`.
