The function accepts an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`, representing the lengths of sticks. It finds the optimal value of `t` (where \(1 \leq t \leq 100\)) that minimizes the cost of cutting the sticks such that the cost is the sum of the differences between the stick lengths and the closest multiple of `t`. The function then prints the optimal `t` and the corresponding minimum cost.
