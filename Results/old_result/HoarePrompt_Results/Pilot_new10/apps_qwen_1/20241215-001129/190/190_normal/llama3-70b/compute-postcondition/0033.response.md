`min_cost` is assigned the value of `cost`. The value of `cost` is defined as the computed value of the given expression, and the list `sticks` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `cost` is the computed value of sum(min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i - 1))) for x in sticks), `sticks` is a list of integers, `min_cost` is equal to `cost`.

Output State: **`cost` is the computed value of sum(min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i - 1))) for x in sticks), `sticks` is a list of integers, `min_cost` is equal to `cost`**
