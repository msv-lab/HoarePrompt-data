The `current_cost` is incremented by `t - 1 - length`. Since `length` is the next element in the list `a`, let's denote it as `a[i+1]` assuming `length` is derived from the list `a` at index `i`. The `current_cost` is updated based on this value. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`current_cost` is `current_cost` + `t - 1 - a[i+1]`, `length` is the next element in the list `a`**
