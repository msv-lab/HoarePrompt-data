`current_cost` is incremented by the value of `length - (t + 1)`. Given that `length` is 4, the value added to `current_cost` is `4 - (t + 1)`, which simplifies to `3 - t`. The state of `n` and `a` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, the next element in `a` is 4, `current_cost` is updated based on the new `length` (4), `current_cost` is increased by `3 - t`**
