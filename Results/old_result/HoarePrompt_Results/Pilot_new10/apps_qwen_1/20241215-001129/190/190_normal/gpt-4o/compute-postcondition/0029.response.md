According to the code, the loop iterates over `t` from 1 to 100. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states hold:

- `n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 1000 \)
- `a` is a list of integers where \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 100 \)
- `min_cost` is either \(0\) (if `current_cost` is less than `min_cost`), or still \(\infty\) (if `current_cost` is not less than `min_cost`)
- `best_t` is still \(-1\)
- `t` is still \(1\)
- `current_cost` is still \(0\)

Since the loop starts from `t = 1` and increments `t` by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` needs to be set to 2.

All other states remain unchanged as there is no indication in the given snippet that they change during the loop execution based on the conditions provided.

State: **`n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 1000 \), `a` is a list of integers where \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 100 \), `min_cost` is either \(0\) (if `current_cost` is less than `min_cost`), or still \(\infty\) (if `current_cost` is not less than `min_cost`), `best_t` is still \(-1\), `t` is now \(2\), and `current_cost` is still \(0\)**
