`current_cost` is incremented by `t - 1 - length`. The value of `t` and `length` are not specified in the initial state, so we keep them as they are. The initial conditions state that `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 and `a` is a list starting with 4. These conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list starting with 4, `current_cost` is increased by `t - 1 - length`**
