Let's break down the given information and the loop to understand what states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 100\).
- `min_cost` is set to infinity (`float('inf')`).
- `best_t` is -1.

### For Loop:
```
for t in range(1, 101):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Range of `t`:**
   - The loop runs for values of `t` from 1 to 100 (inclusive).

2. **Initial Values:**
   - `min_cost` is initially set to infinity (`float('inf')`), which means it will be updated during the loop.
   - `best_t` is initialized to -1, which will be updated if a better `t` value is found.

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will iterate over each value of `t` from 1 to 100.
   - Each iteration involves evaluating some condition or updating `min_cost` and `best_t`.

4. **Dependency on Variables:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `t` is within the range 1 to 100.
   - The initial values of `n`, `a`, `min_cost`, and `best_t` determine how the loop behaves but do not directly affect whether the loop can start.

### Required Adjustments:
- Since the loop iterates over a fixed range (1 to 100), no adjustments to `t` are needed because the loop will always execute for these values.
- The loop will execute regardless of the initial values of `n`, `a`, `min_cost`, and `best_t`.

Therefore, the states do not need to be adjusted beyond ensuring that `t` is correctly defined in the range from 1 to 100.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 100\), `min_cost` is set to infinity (`float('inf')`), `best_t` is -1, `t` is now 1**.
