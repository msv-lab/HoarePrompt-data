Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the problem description. Specifically, the code calculates the cost based on the assumption that the target value \( t \) is the median of the adjusted lengths, but it does not ensure that all stick lengths are almost good for \( t \). The cost calculation in the code is based on adjusting each stick to the nearest possible value within the range \([t-1, t+1]\), but it does not guarantee that all sticks will be within this range after adjustment. This leads to incorrect results for certain inputs.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
10 1 4
```
The code will output:
```
3 7
```
However, the correct solution would be to set \( t = 4 \) and adjust the lengths to \([4, 2, 4]\) with a total cost of \( |10 - 4| + |1 - 2| + |4 - 4| = 6 + 1 + 0 = 7 \). But since the code does not correctly handle the adjustment process, it fails to find the optimal \( t \).

Another example is:
```
3
1 2 3
```
The code will output:
```
2 0
```
But the correct solution would be to set \( t = 2 \) and adjust the lengths to \([2, 2, 2]\) with a total cost of \( |1 - 2| + |2 - 2| + |3 - 2| = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2 \).

These examples show that the code does not correctly implement the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
