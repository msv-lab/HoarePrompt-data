Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 1000 \), `a` is a list of integers where \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 100 \), `min_cost` is the minimum value of `current_cost` encountered during the loop execution, `best_t` is the value of `t` that gave the minimum `current_cost`, `t` is 100 (the maximum value of `t` in the loop), and `current_cost` is the final cost calculated after the loop completes.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over all possible values of `t` from 1 to 100.
- For each `t`, it calculates `current_cost` based on the conditions provided.
- If `current_cost` is less than `min_cost`, `min_cost` is updated to `current_cost`, and `best_t` is updated to the current value of `t`.
- After all iterations, `min_cost` will hold the smallest `current_cost` encountered, and `best_t` will be the value of `t` that produced this minimum cost.
- Since the loop iterates up to `t = 100`, `t` will be 100 after the loop finishes.
- `current_cost` will be the final value calculated after the last iteration of the loop.
