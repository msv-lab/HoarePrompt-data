`current_cost` is incremented by the value of `length - (t + 1)`. The initial state does not specify the exact values of `length` and `t`, but it indicates that `length` is greater than `t + 1`. Therefore, the expression `length - (t + 1)` will be a positive integer. The precondition that the length of `a` is greater than or equal to `t - 1` and greater than `t + 1` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`current_cost` is increased by `length - (t + 1)`, the length of `a` is greater than or equal to `t - 1` and greater than `t + 1`.**
