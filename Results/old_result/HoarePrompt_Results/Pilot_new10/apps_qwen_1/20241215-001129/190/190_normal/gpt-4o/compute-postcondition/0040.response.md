The code `current_cost += t - 1 - length` updates the value of `current_cost` by adding the result of `t - 1 - length` to the current value of `current_cost`. Since `length` is the new length of `a` and `a` must contain at least one element, we know that `length` is at least 1. The initial state does not provide specific values for `t` and `current_cost`, so we will keep them as they are.

Here is the step-by-step analysis:

1. The value of `current_cost` is updated by adding `t - 1 - length` to its current value.
2. The value of `length` is the new length of `a`, which is at least 1.
3. The value of `t` remains unchanged from its previous state.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`current_cost` is updated to its previous value plus `t - 1 - length`, where `length` is the new length of `a` and is at least 1.**
