Postcondition: **`total` is 0, `i` is -1, `n` is the original length of `s`, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of `[` in `s` (or -1 if `[` is not present), `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of `]` in `s` (or -1 if no `]` is present). If `[` and `]` do not exist or `ind` is greater than or equal to `bind`, then -1 is printed to the console. Otherwise, `i` is set to `end_colon`, `start_colon` is set to `ind + 1`, `end_colon` is a valid index greater than `start_colon`, and the result, which is `4 + pipe_count`, is printed, where `pipe_count` is the number of `'|'` characters in the substring `s[start_colon + 1:end_colon]`.**
