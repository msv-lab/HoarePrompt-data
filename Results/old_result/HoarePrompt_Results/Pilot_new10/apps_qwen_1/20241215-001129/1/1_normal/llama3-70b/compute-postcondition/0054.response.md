Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `s` is a non-empty string, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `f` is an unspecified boolean value, `ind` is the index of the first `':'` following a `['`, otherwise `ind` is -1, `bind` is `n - 2`, `i` is now `n - 2`. If `f` is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. There is no else part specified, so the postcondition remains unchanged if `f` is false.***
