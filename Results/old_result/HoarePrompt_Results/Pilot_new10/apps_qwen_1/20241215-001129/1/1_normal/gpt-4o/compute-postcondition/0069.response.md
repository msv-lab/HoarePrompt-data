Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Loop Variables and Conditions**:
   - The loop runs over the range from `start_colon + 1` to `end_colon`.
   - For the loop to execute, `start_colon + 1` must be less than `end_colon`.

2. **Current State**:
   - `total` is 0.
   - `i` is -1.
   - `ind` is a non-negative integer and must be less than `bind`.
   - `start_colon` is `ind + 1`.
   - `end_colon` is the index of the last colon found during the loop execution or -1 if no colon is found.
   - `pipe_count` is 0.
   - `(start_colon != -1 and end_colon != -1 and start_colon < end_colon)`.

3. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since `i` is currently -1, we need to ensure that the loop can start executing. This means `start_colon + 1` should be less than `end_colon`.
   - We need to ensure that `end_colon` is not -1 (indicating at least one colon was found) and that `start_colon` is indeed less than `end_colon`.

4. **Modifying the State**:
   - Given that `start_colon = ind + 1`, `ind` must be such that `start_colon` is a valid index (i.e., `ind` must be a non-negative integer).
   - `end_colon` must be greater than `start_colon` to allow the loop to execute.

5. **Final State**:
   - `total` remains 0.
   - `i` must be adjusted to start the loop correctly.
   - `ind` must be a non-negative integer.
   - `start_colon` must be calculated as `ind + 1`.
   - `end_colon` must be a valid index greater than `start_colon`.

### Final Answer:

State: **`total` is 0, `i` must be adjusted to start the loop correctly, `ind` is a non-negative integer, `start_colon` is `ind + 1`, `end_colon` is a valid index greater than `start_colon`**.
