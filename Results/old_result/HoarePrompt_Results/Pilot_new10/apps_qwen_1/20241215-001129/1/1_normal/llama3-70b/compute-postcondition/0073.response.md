The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string, `n` is the length of `s`, `f` is `True` if a `':'` follows a `['`, otherwise `f` is `False`, `ind` is a valid index within `s`, `bind` is a valid index within `s` such that `bind > ind + 1`, `i` is `bind + 1`, and `ans` is 2.
