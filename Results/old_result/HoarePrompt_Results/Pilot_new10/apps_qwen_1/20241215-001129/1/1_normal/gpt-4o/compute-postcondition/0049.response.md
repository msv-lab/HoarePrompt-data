Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `bind` (if `start_colon` is set), `ind` is a non-negative integer (original value), `bind` is a non-negative integer (original value), `start_colon` is either `ind + 1` (if a colon is found) or `-1` (if no colon is found).**

### Explanation:
- **`total`**: The variable `total` is initialized to 0 and is not modified within the loop. Therefore, its value remains 0 after all iterations.
- **`i`**: The loop increments `i` until it reaches `bind`. If a colon (`:`) is found before reaching `bind`, `i` will be set to the index where the colon was found, and the loop breaks. Thus, `i` will be `bind` if the loop terminates normally (i.e., a colon is found and sets `start_colon`), or `i` will be the index of the colon if found.
- **`ind`**: The value of `ind` remains the same as its initial value because it is not modified within the loop.
- **`bind`**: The value of `bind` remains the same as its initial value because it is not modified within the loop.
- **`start_colon`**: This variable will be set to the index of the first colon found within the range `(ind + 1, bind)`. If no colon is found, it will remain `-1`.

Since the loop only modifies `i` and potentially `start_colon`, and these modifications only occur if a colon is found, the final values of `i` and `start_colon` depend on whether a colon is present in the specified range. If no colon is found, `start_colon` will remain `-1`, and `i` will be `bind`.
