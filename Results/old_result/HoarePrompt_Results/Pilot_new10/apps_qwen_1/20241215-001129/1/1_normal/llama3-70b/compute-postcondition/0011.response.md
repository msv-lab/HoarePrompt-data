The code `break` does not change any variable values and simply breaks out of the current loop or conditional block. Since there is no loop or conditional block specified in the initial state, we assume this `break` statement is outside of any such structure. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is the string input by the user, `n` must be greater than 0, `ind` is the index `i` (where the character ':' is located), `f` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
