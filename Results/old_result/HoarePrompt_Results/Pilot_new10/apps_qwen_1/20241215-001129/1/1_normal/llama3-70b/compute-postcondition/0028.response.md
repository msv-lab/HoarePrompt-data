Postcondition: ***`s` is the string input by the user, `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1, `n` must be greater than 0, and `f` is True. If `s[i]` is `[`, no changes occur. If `f` is True and `s[i]` equals `:`, `ind` is set to the value of `i` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
