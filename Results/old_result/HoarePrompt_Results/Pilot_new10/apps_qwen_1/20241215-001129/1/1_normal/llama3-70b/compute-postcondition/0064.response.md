The code assigns the value `4` to the variable `ans`. This does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `n` is the length of `s`, `f` is `True` if a `':'` follows a `['`, otherwise `f` is `False`, `ind` is the index of the first `':'` following a `['`, otherwise `ind` is `-1`, `bind` is the index of the `':'` if a match is found, otherwise `bind` is `-1`, and `ans` is `4`.**
