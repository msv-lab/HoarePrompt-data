The code `break` does not change any variable values; it only breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or match-case statement. Since there is no such structure in the given code snippet, the variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`s` is a string input by the user, `n` must be greater than 0, `ind` is either -1 if `s[0] != '['` or 0 if `s[0] == '['`.**
