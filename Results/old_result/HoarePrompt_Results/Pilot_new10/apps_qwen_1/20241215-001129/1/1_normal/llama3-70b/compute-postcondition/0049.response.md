Postcondition: **`total` is 0, `s` is a non-empty string, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `f` is an unspecified boolean value, `ind` is the index of the first `':'` following a `['`, otherwise `ind` is -1, `bind` is an unspecified integer value. If `s[i]` is `']'`, then `f` is set to `True`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged (or we break out of the most internal loop or if statement).**
