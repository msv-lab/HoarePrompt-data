The code assigns the value of `i` to `end_colon`. Before the assignment, `end_colon` is either `ind + 1` if a colon is found or `-1` if no colon is found. Since `end_colon` is being assigned the value of `i`, the value of `end_colon` will now be `i`.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `bind - 1`, `ind` is a non-negative integer and must be less than `bind`, `start_colon` is `ind + 1`, `end_colon` is `i`, and the current value of `s[i]` is `:` if a colon is found, otherwise `end_colon` remains `-1`**
