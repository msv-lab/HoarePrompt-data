Output State: **`s` is the string input by the user, `n` is the length of `s`, `f` is True if any '[' is found in the string, `ind` is the index of the first ':' following a '[', otherwise `ind` is -1.** 

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each character in the string `s` until either a `:` is found after a `[` (in which case `ind` is set to the index of this `:`) or the end of the string is reached.
- The flag `f` is set to `True` as soon as a `[` is encountered, indicating that a `[` was found in the string.
- After the loop completes, `f` will be `True` if any `[` is found in the string, and `ind` will hold the index of the first `:` following the last `[` if such a `:` exists, or `-1` otherwise.

Since the loop stops after finding the first `:` following a `[`, the final values of `f` and `ind` depend on whether such a sequence exists in the string `s`.
