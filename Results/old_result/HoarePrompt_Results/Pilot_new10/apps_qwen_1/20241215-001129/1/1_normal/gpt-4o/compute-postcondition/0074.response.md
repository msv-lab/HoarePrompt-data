`pipe_count` is incremented by 1. The values of the other variables (`total`, `i`, `ind`, `start_colon`, and `end_colon`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is 0, `i` is `start_colon + 2`, `ind` is a non-negative integer, `start_colon` is `ind + 1`, `end_colon` is a valid index greater than `start_colon`, and `pipe_count` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `start_colon + 2`, `ind` is a non-negative integer, `start_colon` is `ind + 1`, `end_colon` is a valid index greater than `start_colon`, `pipe_count` is increased by 1**
