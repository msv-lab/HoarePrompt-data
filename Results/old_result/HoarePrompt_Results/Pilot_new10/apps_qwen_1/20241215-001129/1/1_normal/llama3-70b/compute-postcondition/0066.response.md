Postcondition: **`s` is a non-empty string, `n` is the length of `s`, `f` is `True` if a `':'` follows a `['`, otherwise `f` is `False`, `ind` is not `-1` and is a valid index within `s`, `bind` is not `-1` and is a valid index within `s` such that `bind > ind + 1`, `ans` is `4`, the current value of `i` is a valid index within `s` and the character at position `i` in `s` is `'|'`**
