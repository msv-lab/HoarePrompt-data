Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `s` is a non-empty string, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0, `f` is true, `ind` is the index of the first `':'` following a `['`, otherwise `ind` is -1, `bind` is equal to `i`, `s[i]` is not equal to `']'`, and `s[i]` is set to `':'`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
