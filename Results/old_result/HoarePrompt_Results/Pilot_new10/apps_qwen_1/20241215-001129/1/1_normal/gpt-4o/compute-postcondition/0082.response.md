Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `i` is -1, `ind` is a non-negative integer and must be less than `bind`. If `start_colon` is -1, `end_colon` is -1, or `start_colon` is greater than or equal to `end_colon`, the console prints `-1`. Otherwise, `i` is `end_colon`, `start_colon` is `ind + 1`, `end_colon` is a valid index greater than `start_colon`, and `result` is `4 + pipe_count`, where `pipe_count` is the number of `'|'` characters in the substring `s[start_colon + 1:end_colon]` (result is printed).***
