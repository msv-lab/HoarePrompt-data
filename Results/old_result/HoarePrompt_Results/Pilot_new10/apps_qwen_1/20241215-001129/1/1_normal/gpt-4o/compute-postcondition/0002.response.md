The code assigns the value `-1` to the variable `ind`. The values of the other variables (`s` and `n`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`s` is a string input by the user, `n` is the length of `s`, `ind` is -1**
