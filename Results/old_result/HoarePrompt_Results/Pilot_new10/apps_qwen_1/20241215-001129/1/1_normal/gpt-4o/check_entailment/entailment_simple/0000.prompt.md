You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: An accordion is a string (yes, in the real world accordions are musical instruments, but let's forget about it for a while) which can be represented as a concatenation of: an opening bracket (ASCII code $091$), a colon (ASCII code $058$), some (possibly zero) vertical line characters (ASCII code $124$), another colon, and a closing bracket (ASCII code $093$). The length of the accordion is the number of characters in it.

For example, [::], [:||:] and [:|||:] are accordions having length $4$, $6$ and $7$. (:|:), {:||:}, [:], ]:||:[ are not accordions. 

You are given a string $s$. You want to transform it into an accordion by removing some (possibly zero) characters from it. Note that you may not insert new characters or reorder existing ones. Is it possible to obtain an accordion by removing characters from $s$, and if so, what is the maximum possible length of the result?


-----Input-----

The only line contains one string $s$ ($1 \le |s| \le 500000$). It consists of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], : and |.


-----Output-----

If it is not possible to obtain an accordion by removing some characters from $s$, print $-1$. Otherwise print maximum possible length of the resulting accordion.


-----Examples-----
Input
|[a:b:|]

Output
4

Input
|]:[|:]

Output
-1
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input string s consists of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |, and its length is between 1 and 500000 inclusive.
def func():
    s = input()
    n = len(s)
    ind = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '[':
            ind = i
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string input by the user, `n` is the length of `s`, `ind` is either equal to `-1` (if no character `[` is found in `s`) or equal to the index of the first occurrence of `[` in `s`.
    bind = -1
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if s[i] == ']':
            bind = i
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `total` is 0, `i` is `-1`, `n` is the original length of `s`, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of `[` in `s` (or `-1` if `[` is not present), `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of `]` in `s` (or `-1` if no `]` is present).
    if (ind == -1 or bind == -1 or ind >= bind) :
        print(-1)
    else :

            if s[i] == ':':
                start_colon = i
                break
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `total` is 0, `i` is `bind` (if `start_colon` is set), `ind` is a non-negative integer (original value), `bind` is a non-negative integer (original value), `start_colon` is either `ind + 1` (if a colon is found) or `-1` (if no colon is found).
        end_colon = -1
        for i in range(bind - 1, ind, -1):
            if s[i] == ':':
                end_colon = i
                break
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `total` is 0, `i` is `-1`, `ind` is a non-negative integer and must be less than `bind`, `start_colon` is `ind + 1`, `end_colon` is the index of the last colon found during the loop execution or `-1` if no colon is found.
        if (start_colon == -1 or end_colon == -1 or start_colon >= end_colon) :
            print(-1)
        else :
            pipe_count = 0
            for i in range(start_colon + 1, end_colon):
                if s[i] == '|':
                    pipe_count += 1
                
            #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `total` is 0, `i` is `end_colon`, `ind` is a non-negative integer, `start_colon` is `ind + 1`, `end_colon` is a valid index greater than `start_colon`, and `pipe_count` is the number of `'|'` characters in the substring `s[start_colon + 1:end_colon]`
            result = 4 + pipe_count
            print(result)
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`total` is 0, `i` is -1, `ind` is a non-negative integer and must be less than `bind`. If `start_colon` is -1, `end_colon` is -1, or `start_colon` is greater than or equal to `end_colon`, the console prints `-1`. Otherwise, `i` is `end_colon`, `start_colon` is `ind + 1`, `end_colon` is a valid index greater than `start_colon`, and `result` is `4 + pipe_count`, where `pipe_count` is the number of `'|'` characters in the substring `s[start_colon + 1:end_colon]` (result is printed).
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `total` is 0, `i` is -1, `n` is the original length of `s`, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of `[` in `s` (or -1 if `[` is not present), `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of `]` in `s` (or -1 if no `]` is present). If `[` and `]` do not exist or `ind` is greater than or equal to `bind`, then -1 is printed to the console. Otherwise, `i` is set to `end_colon`, `start_colon` is set to `ind + 1`, `end_colon` is a valid index greater than `start_colon`, and the result, which is `4 + pipe_count`, is printed, where `pipe_count` is the number of `'|'` characters in the substring `s[start_colon + 1:end_colon]`.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
