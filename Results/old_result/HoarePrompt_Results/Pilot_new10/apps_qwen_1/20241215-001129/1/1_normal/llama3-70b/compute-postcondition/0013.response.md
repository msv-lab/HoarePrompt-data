Postcondition: ***`s` is the string input by the user, `n` must be greater than 0, `ind` is the index `i` (where the character ':' is located), and `f` is True. This is because the if condition `s[i] == ':'` is evaluated, and if true, `ind` is set to the index `i` and `f` is set to True. Since there is no else part, these changes apply regardless of whether the condition evaluates to true or false.***
