Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `s` is a non-empty string, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `f` is an unspecified boolean value, `ind` is the index of the first `':'` following a `['`, otherwise `ind` is -1. If `f` is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `f` is false, the state remains unchanged.***
