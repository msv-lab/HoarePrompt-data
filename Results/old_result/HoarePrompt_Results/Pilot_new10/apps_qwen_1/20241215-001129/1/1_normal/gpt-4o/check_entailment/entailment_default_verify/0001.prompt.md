You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: An accordion is a string (yes, in the real world accordions are musical instruments, but let's forget about it for a while) which can be represented as a concatenation of: an opening bracket (ASCII code $091$), a colon (ASCII code $058$), some (possibly zero) vertical line characters (ASCII code $124$), another colon, and a closing bracket (ASCII code $093$). The length of the accordion is the number of characters in it.

For example, [::], [:||:] and [:|||:] are accordions having length $4$, $6$ and $7$. (:|:), {:||:}, [:], ]:||:[ are not accordions. 

You are given a string $s$. You want to transform it into an accordion by removing some (possibly zero) characters from it. Note that you may not insert new characters or reorder existing ones. Is it possible to obtain an accordion by removing characters from $s$, and if so, what is the maximum possible length of the result?


-----Input-----

The only line contains one string $s$ ($1 \le |s| \le 500000$). It consists of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], : and |.


-----Output-----

If it is not possible to obtain an accordion by removing some characters from $s$, print $-1$. Otherwise print maximum possible length of the resulting accordion.


-----Examples-----
Input
|[a:b:|]

Output
4

Input
|]:[|:]

Output
-1
Program:
```
def func():
    s = input()
    n = len(s)
    ind = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '[':
            ind = i
            break
    bind = -1
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if s[i] == ']':
            bind = i
            break
    if ind == -1 or bind == -1 or ind >= bind:
        print(-1)
    else:
        start_colon = -1
        for i in range(ind + 1, bind):
            if s[i] == ':':
                start_colon = i
                break
        end_colon = -1
        for i in range(bind - 1, ind, -1):
            if s[i] == ':':
                end_colon = i
                break
        if start_colon == -1 or end_colon == -1 or start_colon >= end_colon:
            print(-1)
        else:
            pipe_count = 0
            for i in range(start_colon + 1, end_colon):
                if s[i] == '|':
                    pipe_count += 1
            result = 4 + pipe_count
            print(result)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to check if a string can be transformed into an accordion by removing some characters. Here's why:

1. **Bracket Matching**: The program first checks for the presence of opening and closing brackets `[` and `]` and ensures they are not in reverse order and that they are not missing.
2. **Colon Validation**: It then looks for the first and last colon within the valid range defined by the brackets. This ensures that there is a proper structure with colons delimiting the vertical lines.
3. **Vertical Line Count**: Finally, it counts the number of vertical lines between the two colons and calculates the total length of the accordion string.

Given these steps, the program correctly handles all described cases and edge cases, such as:
- Strings without brackets.
- Strings with misplaced brackets.
- Strings missing colons.
- Strings with multiple colons but no vertical lines.

Since the program adheres to the problem description for all potential cases, it is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function processes an input string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters `[`, `]`, `:`, and `|`. It finds the indices of the first `[` and last `]`, and then looks for the first `:` within the substring defined by these indices. If a `:` is found, it then searches for the last `:` within the same substring. If both `:` are found and their positions are correct, it counts the number of `|` characters between them and calculates the result as `4 + pipe_count`. If any of the necessary characters are missing or the indices are incorrect, it prints `-1`. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
