`bind` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `i` is `n - 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is 0, `s` is a non-empty string, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `f` is an unspecified boolean value, `ind` is the index of the first `':'` following a `['`, otherwise `ind` is -1, `bind` is `n - 2`, `i` is now `n - 2`.
