Let's break down the task step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Loop Variables and Conditions:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(n - 1, -1, -1)`, where `n` is the length of the string `s`.
   - The loop variable `i` starts from `n - 1` and decrements by 1 until it reaches -1.

2. **Determine Loop Execution Condition:**
   - For the loop to execute, the condition `n - 1 >= -1` must be true.
   - This simplifies to `n >= 0`.

3. **Check Initial States:**
   - `s` is the string input by the user.
   - `n` is the length of `s`.
   - `f` is `False`.
   - `ind` is the index of the first `':'` following a `['`, otherwise `ind` is `-1`.
   - `bind` is `-1`.

4. **Ensure `n` is Greater Than or Equal to 0:**
   - Since `n` is the length of `s`, it is always non-negative (i.e., `n >= 0`).

5. **Adjust Other Variables if Needed:**
   - The initial values of `f`, `ind`, and `bind` do not affect the loop's execution directly. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted.

### Conclusion:

The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is ensuring that `n` is greater than or equal to 0. Since `n` is the length of the string `s`, this condition is inherently satisfied as long as `s` is a valid string.

### Final Answer:

State: **`total` is 0 (though `total` was not mentioned, we keep it as per example formatting), `s` is a non-empty string (ensuring `n` is greater than 0), `n` must be greater than or equal to 0, `f` is False, `ind` is the index of the first ':' following a '[', otherwise `ind` is -1, `bind` is -1**. 

Note: We kept `total` as 0 to match the format, but it doesn't affect the loop's execution based on the given information.
