Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string, `n` is the length of `s`, `f` is `True` if a `':'` follows a `['`, otherwise `f` is `False`, `ind` is the index of the first `':'` following a `['`, otherwise `ind` is `-1`, `bind` is the index of the `':'` if a match is found, otherwise `bind` is `-1`. Either `ind` is not `-1` or `bind` is not `-1`. The condition `ind >= bind` is satisfied.***
