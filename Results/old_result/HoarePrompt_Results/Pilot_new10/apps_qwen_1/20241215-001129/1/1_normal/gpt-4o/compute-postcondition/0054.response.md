The code `break` does not change any variable values but indicates the exit from the current loop or block. Since no loop or block scope was specified in the context, the only effect is that the program breaks out of the current loop or block. The values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `bind`, `ind` is a non-negative integer and must be less than `bind`, `start_colon` is `ind + 1`, `end_colon` is `i`, the current value of `s[i]` is `:` and we break out of the most internal loop or block.**
