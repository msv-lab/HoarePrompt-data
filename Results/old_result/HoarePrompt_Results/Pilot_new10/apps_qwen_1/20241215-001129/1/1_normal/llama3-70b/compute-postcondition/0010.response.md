The code `ind = i` assigns the value of `i` to `ind`. The previous value of `ind` is -1, and the character at index `i` of `s` is ':'. The states of the other variables (`s`, `n`, and `f`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is the string input by the user, `n` must be greater than 0, `ind` is the index `i` (where the character ':' is located), `f` is True.

Output State: **`s` is the string input by the user, `n` must be greater than 0, `ind` is the index `i` (where the character ':' is located), `f` is True**
