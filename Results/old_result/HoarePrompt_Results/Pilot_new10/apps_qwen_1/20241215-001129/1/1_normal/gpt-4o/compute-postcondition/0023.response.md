According to the code, the loop iterates over a range from `n - 1` down to `0` with a step of `-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
- `total` is 0
- `i` is `n - 2`
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `ind` can be either `-1` or the index of the first occurrence of `[`
- `bind` is the index of the current closing bracket `']'` (which is `n - 2`)

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1 from `n - 2` to `n - 3`. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and the condition `n > 0` still holds.

Let's adjust the states:
- `i` changes from `n - 2` to `n - 3`
- `ind` and `bind` remain the same since the loop body does not modify these variables.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `n - 3`, `n` must be greater than 0, `ind` can be either `-1` or the index of the first occurrence of `[`, `bind` is the index of the current closing bracket `']'` (which is `n - 3`).**
