Functionality: **The function processes an input string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters `[`, `]`, `:`, and `|`. It finds the indices of the first `[` and last `]`, and then looks for the first `:` within the substring defined by these indices. If a `:` is found, it then searches for the last `:` within the same substring. If both `:` are found and their positions are correct, it counts the number of `|` characters between them and calculates the result as `4 + pipe_count`. If any of the necessary characters are missing or the indices are incorrect, it prints `-1`.**
