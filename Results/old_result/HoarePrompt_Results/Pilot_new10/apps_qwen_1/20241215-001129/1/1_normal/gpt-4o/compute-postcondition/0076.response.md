Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, we have:
   - `total` is 0
   - `i` is `start_colon + 2`
   - `ind` is a non-negative integer
   - `start_colon` is `ind + 1`
   - `end_colon` is a valid index greater than `start_colon`

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `start_colon + 1` to `end_colon`.

3. **Current Iteration**:
   - The current value of `i` is `start_colon + 2`.
   - We need to check if `i` is still within the range `[start_colon + 1, end_colon)`.

4. **Range Check**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `end_colon`.
   - Given that `i` starts as `start_colon + 2` and the loop increments `i` by 1 each time, the condition for the next iteration is `i < end_colon`.

5. **Incrementing `i`**:
   - After the current iteration, `i` will be incremented to `i + 1`.

6. **Variables that Need Adjustment**:
   - `i` will be updated to `i + 1`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` should still be less than `end_colon`.
   - Therefore, the new value of `i` will be `start_colon + 3`.

7. **Other Variables**:
   - `total`, `ind`, `start_colon`, and `end_colon` remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, which is not mentioned here.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `start_colon + 3`, `ind` is a non-negative integer, `start_colon` is `ind + 1`, `end_colon` is a valid index greater than `start_colon`**
