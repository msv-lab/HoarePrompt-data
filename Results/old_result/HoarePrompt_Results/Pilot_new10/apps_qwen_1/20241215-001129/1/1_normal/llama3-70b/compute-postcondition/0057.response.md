To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop code and the given output states step by step.

### Loop Code Analysis
```python
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    if s[i] == ']':
        f = True
    elif s[i] == ':':
        if f:
            bind = i
            break
```

### Initial Conditions
- `s` is a non-empty string.
- `n` is the length of `s`.
- `f` is `False`.
- `ind` is the index of the first `':'` following a `['`, otherwise `ind` is `-1`.
- `bind` is `-1`.

### Loop Execution Analysis

#### Case 1: No Match Found
- If the loop runs through all characters without finding a `':'` following a `['`:
  - `f` remains `False`.
  - `bind` remains `-1`.
  - `ind` remains unchanged.

#### Case 2: Match Found
- The loop will exit when it finds a `':'` following a `['` (i.e., `s[i] == ':'` and `f` is `True`).
  - `f` is set to `True` the first time a `']'` is encountered.
  - `bind` is set to the current index `i` where `':'` is found, and the loop breaks.

### Final Output State
- The loop will run from `n-1` down to `0`.
- If a match is found (`':'` following a `['`), the loop will exit, setting `f` to `True` and `bind` to the index of the `':'`.
- If no match is found, `f` remains `False`, and `bind` remains `-1`.

### Final Output State
**Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `n` is the length of `s`, `f` is `True` if a `':'` follows a `['`, otherwise `f` is `False`, `ind` is the index of the first `':'` following a `['`, otherwise `ind` is `-1`, `bind` is the index of the `':'` if a match is found, otherwise `bind` is `-1`.**
