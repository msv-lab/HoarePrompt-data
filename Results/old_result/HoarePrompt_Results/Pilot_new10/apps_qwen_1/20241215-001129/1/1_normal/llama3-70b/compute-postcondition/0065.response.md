Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial States:
- `s` is a non-empty string.
- `n` is the length of `s`.
- `f` is `True` if a `':'` follows a `['`, otherwise `f` is `False`.
- `ind` is the index of the first `':'` following a `['`, otherwise `ind` is `-1`.
- `bind` is the index of the `':'` if a match is found, otherwise `bind` is `-1`.
- `ans` is `4`.

### For Loop:
```
for i in range(ind + 1, bind):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`**: The loop iterates from `ind + 1` to `bind - 1`. Therefore, the loop will execute only if `ind + 1` is less than or equal to `bind`. This means we need to ensure that `bind` is greater than `ind`.

2. **Variable `ind`**: `ind` should be a valid index within the string `s`. Since `ind` is defined as the index of the first `':'` following a `['`, it should be a non-negative integer. However, since `ind` is `-1` when no such `':'` is found, we need to ensure that `ind` is not `-1` for the loop to execute.

3. **Variable `bind`**: Similarly, `bind` should be a valid index within the string `s`. Since `bind` is `-1` when no match is found, we need to ensure that `bind` is not `-1` for the loop to execute.

### Adjusted States:
To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states as follows:
- Ensure that `bind` is greater than `ind + 1`.
- Ensure that `ind` is not `-1`.
- Ensure that `bind` is not `-1`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `n` is the length of `s`, `f` is `True` if a `':'` follows a `['`, otherwise `f` is `False`, `ind` is not `-1` and is a valid index within `s`, `bind` is not `-1` and is a valid index within `s` such that `bind > ind + 1`, `ans` is `4`**
