You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: An accordion is a string (yes, in the real world accordions are musical instruments, but let's forget about it for a while) which can be represented as a concatenation of: an opening bracket (ASCII code $091$), a colon (ASCII code $058$), some (possibly zero) vertical line characters (ASCII code $124$), another colon, and a closing bracket (ASCII code $093$). The length of the accordion is the number of characters in it.

For example, [::], [:||:] and [:|||:] are accordions having length $4$, $6$ and $7$. (:|:), {:||:}, [:], ]:||:[ are not accordions. 

You are given a string $s$. You want to transform it into an accordion by removing some (possibly zero) characters from it. Note that you may not insert new characters or reorder existing ones. Is it possible to obtain an accordion by removing characters from $s$, and if so, what is the maximum possible length of the result?


-----Input-----

The only line contains one string $s$ ($1 \le |s| \le 500000$). It consists of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], : and |.


-----Output-----

If it is not possible to obtain an accordion by removing some characters from $s$, print $-1$. Otherwise print maximum possible length of the resulting accordion.


-----Examples-----
Input
|[a:b:|]

Output
4

Input
|]:[|:]

Output
-1
Program:
```
def func():
    s = input()
    n = len(s)
    ind = -1
    f = False
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '[':
            f = True
        elif s[i] == ':':
            if f:
                ind = i
                break
    bind = -1
    f = False
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if s[i] == ']':
            f = True
        elif s[i] == ':':
            if f:
                bind = i
                break
    if ind == -1 or bind == -1:
        print(-1)
    elif ind >= bind:
        print(-1)
    else:
        ans = 4
        for i in range(ind + 1, bind):
            if s[i] == '|':
                ans += 1
        print(ans)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly identifies whether a given string `s` can be transformed into an accordion by removing some characters. It also calculates the maximum possible length of the resulting accordion if transformation is possible.

Here's a breakdown of how the program works:
1. It finds the first occurrence of `[` and the first occurrence of `:` after it (`ind`).
2. It finds the last occurrence of `]` and the first occurrence of `:` before it (`bind`).
3. If either `ind` or `bind` is not found, or if `ind` is greater than or equal to `bind`, it prints `-1`.
4. Otherwise, it counts the number of `|` characters between `:` and `]` and adds 4 (for `[ : : ]`) to get the maximum possible length of the resulting accordion.

This approach handles all valid and invalid cases as described in the problem statement. The program correctly identifies strings that cannot be transformed into an accordion and calculates the maximum length for those that can. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function processes a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, characters `[`, `]`, `:`, and `|`. It finds the first `:` following a `[` and the last `:` preceding a `]`. If either of these `:` is not found, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it counts the number of `|` characters between the indices of the found `:` and prints the count. If no matching `:` is found, it defaults to printing `4`. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
