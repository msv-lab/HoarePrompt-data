Postcondition: ***`s` is the string input by the user, `n` must be greater than 0, `ind` is the index `i` (where the character ':' is located), and `f` is True. This is because the if condition `f` is True, leading to `ind` being set to the index `i` where the character ':' is located, and `f` being set to True. Since there is no else part, these changes apply regardless of the if condition's evaluation.***
