Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop**:
   - The loop iterates over each pair `(dr, dc)` in the `directions` list.
   - The loop body is omitted, but the important part is that `dr` and `dc` represent possible movements.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Loop to Execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, the `directions` list must contain at least one pair of values `(dr, dc)`.
   - Since the loop is iterating over `directions`, there must be at least one valid direction available.

3. **List the Necessary Adjustments**:
   - The state before the loop starts includes the initial values of `current`, `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `empty_pos`, `directions`, `new_row`, `new_col`, `new_pos`, `new_state`, `new_state_str`, and `visited`.
   - To ensure the loop can execute, the `directions` list must have at least one element.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute are:

State: **`current` is the first element of the queue, `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `directions` is a list containing at least one pair of values, `new_row` is the last `dr` used, `new_col` is the last `dc` used, `new_pos` is the last calculated position `dr * 2 + dc + 1`, `new_state` is a list equal to `current` with the elements at positions `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped, `new_state_str` is a string created by joining the elements of `new_state`, `visited` is a set containing all unique states encountered during the process**
