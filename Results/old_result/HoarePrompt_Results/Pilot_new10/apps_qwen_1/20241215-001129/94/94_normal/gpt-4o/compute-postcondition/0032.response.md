The code initializes `new_state` as a list of the `current` state. This does not modify any of the existing variables but creates a new list that is a copy of `current`. The values of `queue`, `visited`, `directions`, `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `new_row`, `new_col`, `new_pos`, and `new_pos` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`current` is the current state, `queue` contains the elements of the previous queue, `visited` is a set containing the elements seen so far, `directions` must be non-empty, `empty_row` is the quotient of `empty_pos` divided by 2, `empty_col` is the remainder of `empty_pos` divided by 2, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is \(2 \times empty_row + 2 \times dr + empty_col + dc\), `new_pos` is `new_row * 2 + new_col`, `new_state` is a list of `current`**
