Postcondition: **`current` is `start`; `queue` is a deque containing the elements after the leftmost element is removed; `visited` is a set containing the element `start`. `directions` must be non-empty; `empty_row` is the quotient of `empty_pos` divided by 2; `empty_col` is the remainder of `empty_pos` divided by 2; `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`; `new_state` is a list copy of `current` but with the elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped; `new_state_str` is a string representation of the list `new_state` obtained by joining its elements; `new_state_str` is not in `visited`**
