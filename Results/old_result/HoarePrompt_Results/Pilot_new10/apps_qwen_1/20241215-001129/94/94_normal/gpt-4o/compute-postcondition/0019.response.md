To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the information given:

1. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `current` is the current state.
   - `queue` is a deque containing the elements after the leftmost element is removed.
   - `visited` is a set containing the elements seen so far.
   - `directions` must be non-empty.
   - `empty_row` is the quotient of `empty_pos` divided by 2.
   - `empty_col` is the remainder of `empty_pos` divided by 2.
   - `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`.
   - `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over each direction `(dr, dc)` in `directions`.
   - For each direction, if `new_row` and `new_col` are within bounds (0 <= new_row < 2 and 0 <= new_col < 2), and the new state represented by `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, then `queue` is updated to include `new_state_str`, and `visited` includes `new_state_str`.

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop condition involves checking the bounds and the presence of the new state in `visited`, and given that we don't know if the loop condition was met in the previous iteration, we assume that the loop may continue with the next direction in `directions`.
   - `directions` must remain non-empty for the loop to continue.
   - `empty_row` and `empty_col` are derived from `empty_pos`, so they do not change between iterations.
   - `new_row` and `new_col` depend on the values of `dr` and `dc` and the current value of `empty_row` and `empty_col`, but we do not know their exact values yet.

Given these points, we can conclude that for the loop to execute one more time, `directions` must still be non-empty. If it is, then the loop can proceed to the next direction.

State: **`current` is the current state, `queue` is a deque containing the elements after the leftmost element is removed, `visited` is a set containing the elements seen so far, `directions` must be non-empty, `empty_row` is the quotient of `empty_pos` divided by 2, `empty_col` is the remainder of `empty_pos` divided by 2.**

However, since we do not know if the conditions for adding a new state to `queue` and `visited` were met in the previous iteration, we cannot specify the exact state of `queue` and `visited` without additional information. Therefore, the focus is on ensuring `directions` remains non-empty for the loop to continue.

Final State: **`current` is the current state, `queue` is a deque containing the elements after the leftmost element is removed, `visited` is a set containing the elements seen so far, `directions` must be non-empty, `empty_row` is the quotient of `empty_pos` divided by 2, `empty_col` is the remainder of `empty_pos` divided by 2.**
