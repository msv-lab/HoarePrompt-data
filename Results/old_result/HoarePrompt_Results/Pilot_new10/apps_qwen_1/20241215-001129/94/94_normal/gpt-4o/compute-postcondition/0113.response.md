Output State: **`current` is the final state in the queue, `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `directions` is an empty list (since all possible moves have been exhausted), `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`. If `new_row` and `new_col` are within the bounds of the 2x2 grid (i.e., 0 <= new_row < 2 and 0 <= new_col < 2), the function checks if the new state (`new_state_str`) created by swapping the empty tile with the neighboring tile does not exist in `visited`. If it doesn't exist, `new_state_str` is added to both `visited` and `queue`. After all possible moves have been explored, no further iterations occur, meaning that the loop terminates when there are no more valid moves left.**

Explanation:
- **`current`**: The final state in the queue indicates that the loop has processed all possible states and stopped when no more valid moves are available.
- **`empty_row`**: Remains as `empty_pos // 2` because this value is derived from the position of 'X' and does not change throughout the loop.
- **`empty_col`**: Remains as `empty_pos % 2` for the same reason.
- **`empty_pos`**: The index of 'X' in `current` remains unchanged since it is a property of the current state.
- **`directions`**: Becomes an empty list because all possible directions have been considered and exhausted.
- **`new_row`** and **`new_col`**: These are calculated based on the current `empty_row`, `empty_col`, and direction `(dr, dc)`. However, since no more valid moves exist, these variables will remain as they were in the last iteration where a valid move was found. If no valid moves were found, these values will reflect the last attempt that did not result in a new state.

This state represents the final configuration of the board after exploring all possible moves from the initial state.
