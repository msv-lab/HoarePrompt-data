According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `directions` variable. The loop will execute if `directions` contains at least one element. 

Before the loop starts, the following conditions are given:
- `current` is a list with a reduced length by one.
- `empty_row` is 0.
- `empty_col` is 1.

For the loop to execute, the `directions` list must contain at least one element. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect this requirement.

State: **`current` is a list with a reduced length by one, `empty_row` is 0, `empty_col` is 1, `directions` must have at least one element**
