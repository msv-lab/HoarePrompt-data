The code updates the values of `new_row` and `new_col` based on the current values of `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `dr`, and `dc`. Specifically, `new_row` is set to `empty_row + dr`, and `new_col` is set to `empty_col + dc`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`current` is a list with a reduced length by one, `empty_row` is 0, `empty_col` is 1, `directions` must have at least one element, `new_row` is `dr`, `new_col` is `dc + 1`, `new_pos` is `dr * 2 + dc + 1`, `new_state` is a copy of `current` with the elements at positions 1 and `dr * 2 + dc + 1` swapped, `new_state_str` is the string created by joining the elements of `new_state`, and `directions` must have at least one element; `new_row` is updated to `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is updated to `empty_col + dc`.
