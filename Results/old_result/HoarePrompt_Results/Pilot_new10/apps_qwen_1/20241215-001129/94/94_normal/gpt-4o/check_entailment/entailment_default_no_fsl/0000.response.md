Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly implement the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1` incorrectly combines the two rows of the puzzle into a single string, rather than returning the starting configuration of the puzzle as a 2x2 grid. This means that `func_2` receives an incorrect input format and cannot correctly determine the reachable states of the puzzle.

For example, consider the following input:

```
AB
XC
XA
BC
```

The correct starting configurations for Bessie and Elsie are:
- Bessie: AB XC
- Elsie: XA BC

Using the current implementation, `func_1` will incorrectly process these inputs as:
- Bessie: "ABXC"
- Elsie: "XABC"

This will cause `func_2` to misinterpret the initial states and fail to correctly determine if the puzzles can reach the same configuration.

To fix this, `func_1` should return the original 2x2 grid configuration instead of concatenating the strings.
