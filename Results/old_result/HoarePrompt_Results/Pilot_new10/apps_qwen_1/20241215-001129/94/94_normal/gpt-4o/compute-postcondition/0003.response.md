To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the condition of the `while` loop and the current state of the variables involved.

The `while` loop condition is `queue` being non-empty. This means that as long as there are elements in the `queue`, the loop will continue to execute.

Right before the loop, the following states are given:
- `start` is a string representing a 2 × 2 grid configuration of Bessie's puzzle.
- `queue` is a deque containing the single element `start`.
- `visited` is a set containing the element `start`.
- `directions` is `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`.

For the loop to execute at least one more time, the `queue` must contain at least one element. Since the `queue` is currently containing only the element `start`, it already satisfies the condition for the loop to execute.

No adjustments are necessary for the `queue` to ensure the loop executes one more time because it already contains one element (`start`).

The other variables (`visited` and `directions`) do not affect the loop condition, so they do not need adjustment either.

Therefore, the state right before the loop remains unchanged, and the loop can proceed to its first iteration without any modifications.

State: **`start` is a string representing a 2 × 2 grid configuration of Bessie's puzzle; `queue` is a deque containing the single element `start`; `visited` is a set containing the element `start`; `directions` is `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]**.
