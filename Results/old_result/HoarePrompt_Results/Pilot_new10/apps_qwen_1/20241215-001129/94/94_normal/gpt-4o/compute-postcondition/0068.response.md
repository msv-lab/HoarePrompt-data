Output State: **`current` is a list with a reduced length by one, `empty_row` is 0, `empty_col` is 1, `directions` must have at least one element, `new_row` is `dr`, `new_col` is `dc + 1`, `new_pos` is `dr * 2 + dc + 1`, `new_state` is a copy of `current` with the elements at positions 1 and `dr * 2 + dc + 1` swapped, `new_state_str` is the string created by joining the elements of `new_state`, and `directions` must have at least one element; `new_row` is updated to `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is updated to `empty_col + dc`. The value of `new_pos` is calculated as `new_row * 2 + new_col`.**

The value of `new_pos` is directly derived from the updated values of `new_row` and `new_col`.
