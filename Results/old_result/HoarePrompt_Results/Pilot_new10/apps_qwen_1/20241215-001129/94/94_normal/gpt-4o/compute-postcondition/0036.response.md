The code appends the `new_state_str` to the `queue`. Since `new_state_str` is the string formed by joining the elements of the `new_state` list, and `visited` contains the new string `new_state_str`, appending this string to `queue` does not change the values of `new_state_str` or `visited`. The `queue` now contains the new string.

Output State: **`new_state_str` is the string formed by joining the elements of the `new_state` list; `visited` contains the new string `new_state_str`; `queue` contains the new string `new_state_str`**
