The code updates the values of `new_row` and `new_col` directly. Initially, `new_row` is defined as `empty_row + dr` and `new_col` is defined as `empty_col + dc`. After executing the code snippet, these assignments are updated directly.

Therefore, the values of `new_row` and `new_col` are now explicitly updated to `empty_row + dr` and `empty_col + dc`, respectively. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`current` is the current state, `queue` contains the elements of the previous queue, `visited` is a set containing the elements seen so far, `directions` must be non-empty, `empty_row` is the quotient of `empty_pos` divided by 2, `empty_col` is the remainder of `empty_pos` divided by 2, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is \(2 \times empty_row + 2 \times dr + empty_col + dc\)**
