The given code snippet does not directly affect any variable values or states. It simply performs a string join operation using the `new_state` list, which results in creating a new string. Since no variables are assigned new values or operations are performed that change existing values, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states; `new_state_str` is the string formed by joining the elements of the `new_state` list.**
