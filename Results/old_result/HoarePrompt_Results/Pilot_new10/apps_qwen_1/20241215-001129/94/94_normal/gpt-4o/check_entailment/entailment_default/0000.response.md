Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly determine if the puzzles can reach the same configuration. The issue lies in the way the initial puzzle configurations are processed by `func_1`.

- `func_1` combines the two rows of the puzzle into a single string. However, this single string does not capture the relative positions of the tiles in the 2x2 grid. For example, the puzzle configurations "AB" and "XC" will produce the string "ABXC", which is the same for both puzzles. This means `func_1` fails to differentiate between different initial configurations.

- The subsequent steps using `func_2` to generate all reachable states from the initial state are correct. However, since `func_1` does not provide a unique representation for different initial configurations, `func_2` is not able to accurately determine if the two puzzles can reach the same configuration.

For instance, consider the following inputs:

- Input 1:
  ```
  AB
  XC
  XB
  AC
  ```

- The correct output should be "YES" because Bessie can slide her 'A' tile down to match Elsie's configuration.

However, due to the way `func_1` processes the input, both puzzles end up with the same string "ABXC". As a result, the program incorrectly concludes that the puzzles cannot reach the same configuration and prints "NO".

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the problem description for every potential case.
