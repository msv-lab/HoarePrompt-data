The code initializes a set named `visited` and adds the value of `start` to it. The value of `start` remains unchanged, and the `queue` is not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`start` is a string representing a 2 Ã— 2 grid configuration of Bessie's puzzle; `queue` is a deque containing the single element `start`; `visited` is a set containing the element `start`.**
