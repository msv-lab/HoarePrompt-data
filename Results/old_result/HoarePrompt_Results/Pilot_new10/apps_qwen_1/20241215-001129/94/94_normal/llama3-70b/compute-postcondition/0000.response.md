Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variable**: The loop variable `i` ranges from `0` to `3` (inclusive), meaning it will iterate 4 times. Therefore, `i` must be in the range `[0, 3]` for the loop to execute fully.

2. **Initial States of Variables**:
   - `puzzle1`: A string representing the initial configuration of Bessie's puzzle.
   - `puzzle2`: A string representing the initial configuration of Elsie's puzzle.
   - Both `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` are guaranteed to have exactly one tile with each letter ('A', 'B', 'C') and exactly one empty position ('X').

3. **Loop Execution Condition**: Since the loop runs 4 times, regardless of the values of `puzzle1` and `puzzle2`, the loop will always execute as long as `i` is within the specified range.

Given this analysis, we do not need to adjust the states of `puzzle1` or `puzzle2` because the loop will always execute 4 times given the constraints on `i`.

**Conclusion**: The states of `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. The only relevant state to consider is the value of `i`, which must be in the range `[0, 3]`.

State: **`i` is in the range [0, 3]**
