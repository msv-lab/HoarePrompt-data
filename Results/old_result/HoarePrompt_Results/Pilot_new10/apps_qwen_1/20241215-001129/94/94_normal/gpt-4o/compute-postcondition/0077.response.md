According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `queue`. If `queue` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the `queue` is empty. For the loop to be executed one more time, the `queue` must contain at least one element.

Here are the states that need to be adjusted:

- `queue` must contain at least one element.

Since no other states are directly related to the condition of the `while` loop, they do not need to be modified.

State: **`current` is a list representing the final configuration of the puzzle, `empty_row` is the row index of the empty tile in `current`, `empty_col` is the column index of the empty tile in `current`, `directions` is a list containing the possible movements, `new_row` is the last `dr` used, `new_col` is the last `dc` used, `new_pos` is the last calculated position `dr * 2 + dc + 1`, `new_state` is a list equal to `current` with the elements at positions `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped, `new_state_str` is a string created by joining the elements of `new_state`, `visited` is a set containing all unique states encountered during the process, and `queue` must contain at least one element.**
