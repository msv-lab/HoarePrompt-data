Postcondition: ***`current` is the first element of the queue, `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `directions` is a list of pairs excluding the first pair, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `new_state` is a copy of `current` with the elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped, `new_state_str` is a string created by joining the elements of `new_state`. If `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, then `new_state_str` is added to `visited` and `new_state_str` is added to `queue`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
