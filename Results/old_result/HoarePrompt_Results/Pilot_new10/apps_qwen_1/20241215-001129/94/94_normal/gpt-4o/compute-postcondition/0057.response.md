The code updates the values of `new_row` and `new_col` by adding `dr` to `empty_row` and `dc` to `empty_col`. The previous values of `new_row` and `new_col` are `dr` and `dc + 1` respectively. After the update, `new_row` will be `empty_row + dr` and `new_col` will be `empty_col + dc`.

Output State: **`current` is a list with a reduced length by one, `empty_row` is 0, `empty_col` is 1, `directions` must have at least one element, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `dr * 2 + dc + 1`, `new_state` is a list equal to `current` with the elements at positions 1 and `dr * 2 + dc + 1` swapped, `new_state_str` is a string created by joining the elements of `new_state`, and `new_state_str` is not in `visited`.**
