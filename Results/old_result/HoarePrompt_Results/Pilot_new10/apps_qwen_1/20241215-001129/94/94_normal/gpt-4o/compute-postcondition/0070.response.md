The code swaps the elements at positions `empty_pos` and `new_pos` in the `new_state` list. Given the initial state, `empty_pos` is `empty_row` (which is 0) and `new_pos` is `new_pos` (which is `dr * 2 + dc + 1`). 

So, the swap operation will be:

```python
new_state[0], new_state[dr * 2 + dc + 1] = new_state[dr * 2 + dc + 1], new_state[0]
```

This means the element at position 0 (initially `empty_row`) and the element at position `dr * 2 + dc + 1` (initially `new_pos`) will be swapped.

Other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`current` is a list with a reduced length by one, `empty_row` is 0, `empty_col` is 1, `directions` must have at least one element, `new_row` is `dr`, `new_col` is `dc + 1`, `new_pos` is `dr * 2 + dc + 1`, `new_state` is a copy of `current` with the elements at positions 0 and `dr * 2 + dc + 1` swapped, `new_state_str` is the string created by joining the elements of `new_state`, `new_row` is updated to `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is updated to `empty_col + dc`.**
