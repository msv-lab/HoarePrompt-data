The code `new_state = list(current)` creates a new list `new_state` which is a copy of the list `current`. This means that the elements of `current` are now also part of `new_state`. However, the original list `current` remains unchanged.

- `current` remains as the next element of the queue.
- `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `empty_pos`, `directions`, `new_row`, `new_col`, and `new_pos` remain unchanged because they are not being reassigned in this line of code.

Therefore, the only change is the creation of `new_state`, which is a copy of `current`.

Output State: **`current` is the next element of the queue, `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `directions` is a list of pairs excluding the next pair, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `new_state` is a copy of `current`**
