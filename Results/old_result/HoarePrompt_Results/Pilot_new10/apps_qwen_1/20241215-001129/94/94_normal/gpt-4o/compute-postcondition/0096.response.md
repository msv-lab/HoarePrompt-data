The code creates a new list `new_state` by copying the current state of the queue into it. No other changes are made to the variables. The values of the other variables remain the same as their initial states.

Output State: **`current` is the first element of the queue, `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `directions` is a list of pairs excluding the first pair, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `new_state` is a copy of `current`**
