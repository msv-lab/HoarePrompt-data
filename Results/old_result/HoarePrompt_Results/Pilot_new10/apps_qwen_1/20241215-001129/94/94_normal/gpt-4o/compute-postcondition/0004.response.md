The code `current = queue.popleft()` removes and returns the leftmost element of the deque `queue`, assigning it to the variable `current`. The variable `queue` will no longer contain this element.

Output State: **`current` is `start`, `queue` is a deque containing the elements after the leftmost element is removed, `visited` is a set containing the element `start`, `directions` is `[(−1, 0), (1, 0), (0, −1), (0, 1)]`**
