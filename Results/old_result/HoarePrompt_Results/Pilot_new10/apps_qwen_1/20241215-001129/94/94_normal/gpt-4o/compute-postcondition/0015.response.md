The code adds the string representation of `new_state` (which is `new_state_str`) to the set `visited`. Since `new_state_str` is not already in `visited`, adding it to the set means that `visited` now contains one additional element.

- The set `visited` originally contained the element `start`.
- After the code runs, `visited` will contain `start` and `new_state_str`.

All other variables remain unchanged:
- `current` remains as `start`.
- `queue` remains as a deque containing the elements after the leftmost element is removed.
- `directions` remains non-empty.
- `empty_row` remains the quotient of `empty_pos` divided by 2.
- `empty_col` remains the remainder of `empty_pos` divided by 2.
- `new_row` remains `empty_row + dr`.
- `new_col` remains `empty_col + dc`.
- `new_state` remains a list copy of `current` but with the elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped.
- `new_state_str` remains the string representation of the list `new_state` obtained by joining its elements.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`current` is `start`; `queue` is a deque containing the elements after the leftmost element is removed; `visited` is a set containing the elements `start` and `new_state_str`; `directions` must be non-empty; `empty_row` is the quotient of `empty_pos` divided by 2; `empty_col` is the remainder of `empty_pos` divided by 2; `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`; `new_state` is a list copy of `current` but with the elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped; `new_state_str` is a string representation of the list `new_state` obtained by joining its elements.**
