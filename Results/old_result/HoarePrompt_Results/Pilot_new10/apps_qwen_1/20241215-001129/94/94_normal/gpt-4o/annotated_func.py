#State of the program right berfore the function call: puzzle is a string representing a row of a 2 × 2 grid in Bessie's or Elsie's puzzle, where the positions of the tiles are labeled 'A', 'B', and 'C', and the empty cell is labeled 'X'. The string contains exactly two characters, and among them, one is 'X' and the other is either 'A', 'B', or 'C'.
def func_1(puzzle):

    #puzzle[0] + puzzle[1], which is a string containing exactly two characters, one of which is 'X' and the other is either 'A', 'B', or 'C'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `puzzle` representing a row of a 2 × 2 grid and returns a string containing the two characters in `puzzle`, one of which is 'X' and the other is either 'A', 'B', or 'C'.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: start is a string representing a 2 × 2 grid configuration of Bessie's puzzle, where the positions of the tiles are labeled 'A', 'B', and 'C', and the empty cell is labeled 'X'.

    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `current` is the final configuration of the puzzle, `empty_row` is the row index of the empty tile in `current`, `empty_col` is the column index of the empty tile in `current`, `directions` is `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`, `queue` is an empty deque, `visited` is a set containing all unique states encountered during the process.
    return visited
    #The program returns a set named 'visited' containing all unique states encountered during the process
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a string `start` representing a 2 × 2 grid configuration of Bessie's puzzle, where the positions of the tiles are labeled 'A', 'B', and 'C', and the empty cell is labeled 'X'. It uses a breadth-first search algorithm to explore all possible moves of the empty tile and keeps track of all unique states encountered. The function returns a set containing all these unique states.
