To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the changes that occur within the loop based on the given conditions.

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `current` is the first element of the queue.
   - `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`.
   - `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`.
   - `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`.
   - `directions` is a list of pairs excluding the first pair.
   - `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`.
   - `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over each direction in `directions`.
   - For each direction `(dr, dc)`, the loop checks if `new_row` and `new_col` are within the bounds of the 2x2 grid (i.e., `0 <= new_row < 2` and `0 <= new_col < 2`).
   - If they are within bounds, it checks if the new state (`new_state_str`) created by swapping the empty tile with the neighboring tile does not exist in `visited`.
   - If it doesn't exist, `new_state_str` is added to both `visited` and `queue`.
   - If it already exists, the state remains unchanged.

3. **Next Iteration Analysis:**
   - At the start of the next iteration, `dr` and `dc` will be the next pair in the `directions` list.
   - `empty_row` and `empty_col` will remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration because the loop did not change them.
   - `empty_pos` will remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration because the loop did not change it.
   - `directions` will be the list of pairs excluding the next pair.

Based on this analysis:

- The `current` value will be updated to the next element in the queue.
- `directions` will exclude the current direction being processed and move to the next direction.
- `new_row` and `new_col` will be calculated based on the next direction in `directions`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`current` is the next element of the queue, `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `directions` is a list of pairs excluding the next pair, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr` where `(dr, dc)` is the next direction in `directions`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc` where `(dr, dc)` is the next direction in `directions`.**
