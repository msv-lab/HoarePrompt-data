Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not check if the two puzzles can be transformed into the same configuration through a series of valid moves. Instead, it incorrectly attempts to swap the positions of the empty cells and then checks if the resulting configurations are lexicographically equal.

Hereâ€™s why this approach is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Logic**: The program simply swaps the positions of the empty cells (`X`) in the two puzzles and then checks if the resulting configurations are the same. This does not reflect the actual sliding moves that are allowed, where a tile can only be moved into an adjacent empty cell.

2. **No Simulation of Moves**: The program does not simulate the sliding moves to see if one configuration can be transformed into the other. It only checks for a simple string equality after swapping the empty cells, which is not sufficient to determine if the puzzles can be made identical through valid moves.

3. **Invalid Assumption**: The assumption that swapping the empty cells will lead to a valid solution is incorrect because the valid moves depend on the current positions of the tiles, not just the empty cells.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should simulate the sliding moves and check if it is possible to transform one puzzle into the other configuration. Here is a conceptual outline of how such a program could be structured:

1. Identify the initial positions of all tiles and the empty cell in both puzzles.
2. Use a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) to explore all possible sequences of valid moves from the initial configuration of one puzzle.
3. Check if any of these sequences can lead to the configuration of the other puzzle.

By following these steps, the program would accurately determine if the two puzzles can be brought to the same configuration through valid moves.
