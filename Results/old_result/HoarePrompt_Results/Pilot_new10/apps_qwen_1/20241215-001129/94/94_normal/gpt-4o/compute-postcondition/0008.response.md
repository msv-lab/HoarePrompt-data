The code `new_row, new_col = empty_row + dr, empty_col + dc` updates the values of `new_row` and `new_col` based on the current `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `dr`, and `dc`. The values of `empty_row` and `empty_col` remain unchanged. Since `dr` and `dc` are not defined in the initial state, we will keep them as `dr` and `dc` in the output state.

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

- `new_row` is assigned the value of `empty_row + dr`.
- `new_col` is assigned the value of `empty_col + dc`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`current` is `start`, `queue` is a deque containing the elements after the leftmost element is removed, `visited` is a set containing the element `start`, `directions` must be non-empty, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is the quotient of `empty_pos` divided by 2, `empty_col` is the remainder of `empty_pos` divided by 2, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`**
