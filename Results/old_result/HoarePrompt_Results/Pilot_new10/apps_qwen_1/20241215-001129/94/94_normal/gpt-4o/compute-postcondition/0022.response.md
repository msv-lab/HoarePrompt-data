The code initializes `new_state` as a list copy of `current`. No other changes are made to the variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except that `new_state` is now a list version of `current`.

Output State: **`current` is the current state, `queue` is a deque containing the elements after the leftmost element is removed, `visited` is a set containing the elements seen so far, `directions` must be non-empty, `empty_row` is the quotient of `empty_pos` divided by 2, `empty_col` is the remainder of `empty_pos` divided by 2, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is \(2 \times empty_row + 2 \times dr + empty_col + dc\), `new_state` is a list version of `current`.**
