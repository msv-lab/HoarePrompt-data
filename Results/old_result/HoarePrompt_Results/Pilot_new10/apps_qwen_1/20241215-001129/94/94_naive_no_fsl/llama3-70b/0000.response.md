Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical flaw. The function `func_1` swaps the positions of the empty cells in both puzzles and then checks if the sorted versions of the puzzles are equal. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not ensure that the relative positions of the tiles 'A', 'B', and 'C' are the same in both puzzles after the swap.

For instance, consider the following input:
```
AB
XC
CA
BX
```

- Puzzle 1: AB XC
- Puzzle 2: CA BX

After swapping the empty cells, we get:
- Puzzle 1: AB CX
- Puzzle 2: BA CX

Even though the sorted versions of these puzzles (`ABCX` and `BACX`) might appear the same, the relative positions of the tiles 'A', 'B', and 'C' are different. Therefore, the puzzles cannot be considered the same configuration.

To correctly solve this problem, one needs to generate all possible configurations that can be reached from each puzzle and check if any of these configurations match. The current implementation does not account for this, making it incorrect.
