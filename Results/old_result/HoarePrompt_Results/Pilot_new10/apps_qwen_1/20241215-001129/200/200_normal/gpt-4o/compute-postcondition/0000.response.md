`n` and `s` are assigned the values from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. This means that `n` and `s` will hold integer values read from the input, but their specific values are not known yet. The other conditions and values remain unchanged.

Output State: **$n$ is an integer such that $1 \le n \le 10^3$, $s$ is an integer such that $1 \le s \le 10^{12}$, and `v_i` is an integer such that $1 \le v_i \le 10^9$ for all $i$ in the range $1 \le i \le n$; `n` and `s` are assigned integer values from the input.**
