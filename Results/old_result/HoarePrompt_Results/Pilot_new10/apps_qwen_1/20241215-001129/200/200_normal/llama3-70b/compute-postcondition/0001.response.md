The code `v = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers input from the user and converts them into a list of integers. This means the values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged, but `v` is updated to reflect the new list of integers.

Since the initial state does not specify exact values for `n` and `s`, we will keep them as they are. However, we know that `v` will now contain the integers entered by the user.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer entered by the user, `s` is the second integer entered by the user, `v` is a list of integers where each element is the integer value of the corresponding input.**
