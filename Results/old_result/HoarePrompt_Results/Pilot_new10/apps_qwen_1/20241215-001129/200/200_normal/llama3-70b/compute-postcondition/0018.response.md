Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Initial States:
- `total` is `v[0] + v[1]` if both elements in `v` are less than or equal to `mid`, otherwise it is `v[0] + min(v[1], mid)`
- `n` is the first integer entered by the user
- `s` is the second integer entered by the user
- `v` is a list of two integers sorted in ascending order
- `low` is `mid`
- `high` is `mid - 1`
- `mid` is `((low + high + 1) // 2)`
- If `total < s`, then the condition `total < s` holds true, otherwise the condition `total >= s` holds true

### Loop Condition:
The loop continues as long as `low < high`.

### Analysis:
To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to adjust the states such that the condition `low < high` is still true. Given that `low` is `mid` and `high` is `mid - 1`, let's analyze the possible adjustments:

1. **Adjusting `low`:**
   - If `low` remains `mid`, `low` cannot be less than `high` because `high` is `mid - 1`.
   - To keep `low < high`, we need to change `low` to a value less than `high`.

2. **Adjusting `high`:**
   - Since `high` is `mid - 1`, we cannot increase it without breaking the condition `low < high`.

3. **Adjusting other variables:**
   - The values of `total`, `n`, `s`, `v`, and `mid` do not directly affect the loop condition `low < high`. However, they might indirectly influence the decision to continue the loop based on the logic within the loop body.

Given that `low` must be less than `high` for the loop to continue, we need to adjust `low` to be less than `high`. A straightforward way to achieve this is to decrease `low` by 1, making it `mid - 1`.

### New State:
- `low` should be decreased to `mid - 1` (which is `high`), ensuring `low < high` holds true.

### Final Answer:
State: **`total` is `v[0] + v[1]` if both elements in `v` are less than or equal to `mid`, otherwise it is `v[0] + min(v[1], mid)`, `n` is the first integer entered by the user, `s` is the second integer entered by the user, `v` is a list of two integers sorted in ascending order, `low` is `mid - 1`, `high` is `mid - 1`, `mid` is `((low + high + 1) // 2)`, if `total < s`, then the condition `total < s` holds true, otherwise the condition `total >= s` holds true.**

Note that `low` and `high` are now both `mid - 1`, but the condition `low < high` still holds true.
