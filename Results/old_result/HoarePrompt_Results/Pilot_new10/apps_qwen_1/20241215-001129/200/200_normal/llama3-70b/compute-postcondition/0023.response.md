Postcondition: ***`total` is `v[0] + v[1]` if both elements in `v` are less than or equal to `mid`, otherwise it is `v[0] + min(v[1], mid)`. `n` is the first integer entered by the user; `s` is the second integer entered by the user; `v` is a list of two integers sorted in ascending order; `low` is `mid - 1`; `high` is `mid - 1`; `mid` is `((low + high + 1) // 2)`. After executing the if-else block, if `total < s`, `total` remains unchanged; otherwise, `total` remains unchanged as well. The condition `total < s` or `total >= s` still holds true.***
