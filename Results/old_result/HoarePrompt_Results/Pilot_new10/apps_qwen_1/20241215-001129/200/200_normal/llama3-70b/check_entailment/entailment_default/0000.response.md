Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the case where the required volume `s` is larger than the total volume of kvass available. Specifically, the binary search logic aims to find the minimum amount of kvass that can be poured into the least keg, but it does not check if the total volume of kvass is sufficient to meet the requirement `s`. 

Consider the following example:
- Input:
  ```
  3 10
  4 3 5
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  -1
  ```

- Actual Output:
  The code will incorrectly attempt to find the minimum amount of kvass that can be poured into the least keg without checking if the total volume of kvass is sufficient. In this case, the total volume is 12 liters, which is greater than 10, but the code will not correctly handle this scenario and will produce an incorrect result.

To fix this, you need to add a check at the beginning of the function to verify if the total volume of kvass is at least `s`. If it is not, the function should immediately return `-1`. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    (n, s) = map(int, input().split())
    v = list(map(int, input().split()))
    v.sort()
    
    # Check if the total volume is sufficient
    if sum(v) < s:
        print(-1)
        return
    
    (low, high) = (0, min(v))
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high + 1) // 2
        total = sum(min(mid, x) for x in v)
        if total < s:
            low = mid
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    
    if sum(min(low, x) for x in v) != s:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(low)
```

This corrected version ensures that the function checks if the total volume of kvass is sufficient before attempting to find the minimum amount that can be poured into the least keg.
