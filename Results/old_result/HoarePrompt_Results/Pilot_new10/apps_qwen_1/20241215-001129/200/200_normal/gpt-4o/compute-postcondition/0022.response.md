The code `remaining_kvass -= possible_to_take` subtracts the value of `possible_to_take` from `remaining_kvass`. Given the initial conditions:

- `remaining_kvass` is 0.
- `possible_to_take` is `min(volumes[i] - min_keg_volume, 0)`.

Since `remaining_kvass` is initially 0, subtracting `possible_to_take` (which is non-positive because `min(volumes[i] - min_keg_volume, 0)` returns the minimum of `volumes[i] - min_keg_volume` and 0) will keep `remaining_kvass` as 0 if `possible_to_take` is 0 or a negative number, and it would not change if `possible_to_take` is exactly 0.

Output State: **`remaining_kvass` is 0, `possible_to_take` is `min(volumes[i] - min_keg_volume, 0)`**
