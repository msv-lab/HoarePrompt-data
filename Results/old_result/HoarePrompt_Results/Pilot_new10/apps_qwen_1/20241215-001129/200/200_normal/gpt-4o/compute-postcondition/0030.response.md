Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `s` is an integer such that \(1 \le s \le 10^{12}\), `volumes` is a list of integers such that \(1 \le v_i \le 10^9\) for all \(i\) in the range \(1 \le i \le n\) and `volumes` is sorted in ascending order; `total_volume` is the sum of the elements in the `volumes` list and is greater than or equal to `s`; `min_keg_volume` is the first element in the `volumes` list; `i` is \(i + 1\) and must be less than `n`; if `volumes[i] <= min_keg_volume`, then the postcondition remains unchanged; otherwise, `remaining_kvass` is reduced by the minimum between `volumes[i] - min_keg_volume` and `remaining_kvass`.***
