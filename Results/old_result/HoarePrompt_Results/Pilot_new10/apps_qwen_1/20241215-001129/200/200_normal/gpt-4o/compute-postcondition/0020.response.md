The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. It does not affect the values of variables outside the loop. In this case, since the `continue` statement is not within any explicit loop structure mentioned in the initial state, we assume it might be part of an implied loop or a conditional block. However, without the explicit loop or condition, the impact of `continue` is minimal and the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `s` is an integer such that \(1 \le s \le 10^{12}\)
- `volumes` is a list of integers such that \(1 \le v_i \le 10^9\) for all \(i\) in the range \(1 \le i \le n\) and `volumes` is sorted in ascending order
- `total_volume` is the sum of the elements in the `volumes` list and `total_volume` is greater than or equal to `s`
- `min_keg_volume` is the first element in the `volumes` list
- if `remaining_kvass` equals 0, `possible_to_take` is `s`. Otherwise, `remaining_kvass` is 0 and `possible_to_take` is `s`
- `i` is `i + 1`

The `continue` statement does not change these values. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `s` is an integer such that \(1 \le s \le 10^{12}\), `volumes` is a list of integers such that \(1 \le v_i \le 10^9\) for all \(i\) in the range \(1 \le i \le n\) and `volumes` is sorted in ascending order; `total_volume` is the sum of the elements in the `volumes` list and `total_volume` is greater than or equal to `s`; `min_keg_volume` is the first element in the `volumes` list; if `remaining_kvass` equals 0, `possible_to_take` is `s`. Otherwise, `remaining_kvass` is 0 and `possible_to_take` is `s`; `i` is `i + 1`**
