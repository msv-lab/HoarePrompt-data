Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the analysis provided show that the program now correctly handles the edge cases and ensures that the total amount of kvass is sufficient before attempting to distribute it. The binary search approach is correctly implemented to find the smallest possible amount of kvass in the least keg while ensuring the total is at least `s`. The original assessment suggested the program did not handle the case where it is impossible to pour exactly `s` liters, but the updated version explicitly checks this condition and prints `-1` accordingly. Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations.
