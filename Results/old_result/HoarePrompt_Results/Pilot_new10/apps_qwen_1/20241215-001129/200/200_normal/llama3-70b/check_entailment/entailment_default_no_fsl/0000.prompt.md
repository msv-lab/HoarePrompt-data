You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The Fair Nut likes kvass very much. On his birthday parents presented him $n$ kegs of kvass. There are $v_i$ liters of kvass in the $i$-th keg. Each keg has a lever. You can pour your glass by exactly $1$ liter pulling this lever. The Fair Nut likes this drink very much, so he wants to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass. But he wants to do it, so kvass level in the least keg is as much as possible.

Help him find out how much kvass can be in the least keg or define it's not possible to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $s$ ($1 \le n \le 10^3$, $1 \le s \le 10^{12}$) — the number of kegs and glass volume.

The second line contains $n$ integers $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n$ ($1 \le v_i \le 10^9$) — the volume of $i$-th keg.


-----Output-----

If the Fair Nut cannot pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass, print $-1$. Otherwise, print a single integer — how much kvass in the least keg can be.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3
4 3 5

Output
3

Input
3 4
5 3 4

Output
2

Input
3 7
1 2 3

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example, the answer is $3$, the Fair Nut can take $1$ liter from the first keg and $2$ liters from the third keg. There are $3$ liters of kvass in each keg.

In the second example, the answer is $2$, the Fair Nut can take $3$ liters from the first keg and $1$ liter from the second keg.

In the third example, the Fair Nut can't pour his cup by $7$ liters, so the answer is $-1$.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, s) = map(int, input().split())
    v = list(map(int, input().split()))
    v.sort()
    (low, high) = (0, min(v))
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high + 1) // 2
        total = sum((min(mid, x) for x in v))
        if total < s:
            low = mid
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    if sum((min(low, x) for x in v)) != s:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(low)


```
Output hints: Let's analyze the provided annotated code step-by-step to determine the functionality of the function `func`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Parameters:**
   - The function takes two inputs: `n` and `s` (both integers).
   - Constraints: \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\) and \(1 \leq s \leq 10^{12}\).
   - There is also a list of `n` integers `v`, where each `v_i` (1 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^9).

2. **Sorting the List:**
   - The list `v` is sorted in ascending order using `v.sort()`.

3. **Binary Search for Minimum Total Volume:**
   - The function uses a binary search approach to find the smallest integer `low` such that the sum of the minimum values between `low` and each element in `v` is at least `s`.
   - The variables `low` and `high` are initialized to 0 and `min(v)` respectively.
   - The binary search continues until `low` is no longer less than `high`.

4. **Binary Search Loop:**
   - Inside the loop, `mid` is calculated as \(\text{low} + \frac{\text{high} - \text{low} + 1}{2}\).
   - The total volume `total` is computed as the sum of `min(mid, x)` for each element `x` in `v`.
   - If `total` is less than `s`, `low` is updated to `mid`.
   - Otherwise, `high` is updated to `mid - 1`.

5. **Post-Loop Conditions:**
   - After the loop, the function checks if the sum of the minimum values between `low` and each element in `v` equals `s`.
   - If the sum is not equal to `s`, it prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `low`.

### Potential Edge Cases and Missing Logic:
- **Edge Case:** If `v` contains only one element, the binary search might not work as expected. However, since `v` is sorted, this edge case is handled by the binary search logic.
- **Edge Case:** If `low` reaches the maximum possible value and the condition is still not met, the loop will exit with `low` being the best possible solution.

### Summary of Functionality:

The function `func` accepts two integers `n` and `s`, along with a list of `n` integers `v`. It sorts the list `v` and performs a binary search to find the smallest integer `low` such that the sum of the minimum values between `low` and each element in `v` is at least `s`. If such a `low` is found and the sum equals `s`, it prints `low`. Otherwise, it prints `-1`.

**Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` and `s`, along with a list of `n` integers `v`, sorts the list, and finds the smallest integer `low` such that the sum of the minimum values between `low` and each element in `v` is at least `s`. If the sum equals `s`, it prints `low`; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
