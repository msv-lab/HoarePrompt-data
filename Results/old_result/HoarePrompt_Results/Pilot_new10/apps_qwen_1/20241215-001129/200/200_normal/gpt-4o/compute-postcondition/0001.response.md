The code `volumes = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes input from the user, splits the input into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `volumes`. The variables `n` and `s` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the values of `n` and `s` remain as they were initially, and the list `volumes` is populated with integers from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that $1 \le n \le 10^3$, `s` is an integer such that $1 \le s \le 10^{12}$, `volumes` is a list of integers such that $1 \le v_i \le 10^9$ for all $i$ in the range $1 \le i \le n$.**
