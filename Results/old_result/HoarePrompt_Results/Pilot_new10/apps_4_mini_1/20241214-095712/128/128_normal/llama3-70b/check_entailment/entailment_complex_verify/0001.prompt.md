You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Summer holidays! Someone is going on trips, someone is visiting grandparents, but someone is trying to get a part-time job. This summer Noora decided that she wants to earn some money, and took a job in a shop as an assistant.

Shop, where Noora is working, has a plan on the following n days. For each day sales manager knows exactly, that in i-th day k_{i} products will be put up for sale and exactly l_{i} clients will come to the shop that day. Also, the manager is sure, that everyone, who comes to the shop, buys exactly one product or, if there aren't any left, leaves the shop without buying anything. Moreover, due to the short shelf-life of the products, manager established the following rule: if some part of the products left on the shelves at the end of the day, that products aren't kept on the next day and are sent to the dump.

For advertising purposes manager offered to start a sell-out in the shop. He asked Noora to choose any f days from n next for sell-outs. On each of f chosen days the number of products were put up for sale would be doubled. Thus, if on i-th day shop planned to put up for sale k_{i} products and Noora has chosen this day for sell-out, shelves of the shop would keep 2·k_{i} products. Consequently, there is an opportunity to sell two times more products on days of sell-out.

Noora's task is to choose f days to maximize total number of sold products. She asks you to help her with such a difficult problem.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and f (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ f ≤ n) denoting the number of days in shop's plan and the number of days that Noora has to choose for sell-out.

Each line of the following n subsequent lines contains two integers k_{i}, l_{i} (0 ≤ k_{i}, l_{i} ≤ 10^9) denoting the number of products on the shelves of the shop on the i-th day and the number of clients that will come to the shop on i-th day.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer denoting the maximal number of products that shop can sell.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 2
2 1
3 5
2 3
1 5

Output
10
Input
4 1
0 2
0 3
3 5
0 6

Output
5


-----Note-----

In the first example we can choose days with numbers 2 and 4 for sell-out. In this case new numbers of products for sale would be equal to [2, 6, 2, 2] respectively. So on the first day shop will sell 1 product, on the second — 5, on the third — 2, on the fourth — 2. In total 1 + 5 + 2 + 2 = 10 product units.

In the second example it is possible to sell 5 products, if you choose third day for sell-out.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, f) = map(int, input().split())
    days = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (k, l) = map(int, input().split())
        days.append((k, l))
    days.sort(key=lambda x: x[1] - x[0], reverse=True)
    sold = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if i < f:
            sold += min(days[i][0] * 2, days[i][1])
        else:
            sold += min(days[i][0], days[i][1])
    print(sold)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze whether the logic implemented in the code adheres to all aspects of the requirements specified.

Here is a breakdown of the critical components in the problem:

1. **Input Details**: We're given `n` days, each with `k_i` products and `l_i` clients.

2. **Sell-out Days**: Noora can select `f` days for sell-outs where the products available are doubled.

3. **Sales Calculation**: The goal is to maximize the total number of products sold, accounting for the number of clients and the availability of products.

### Evaluation of the Program:

- The program reads inputs correctly and constructs a list of product-client pairs for each day.
- It sorts this list based on the difference `l_i - k_i`: this logic attempts to prioritize days where the potential to increase sales is most beneficial by choosing days where clients exceed products available (or where they are closest).
- The sales are calculated in a loop where for the first `f` days (the sell-out days), it adds double the products or the number of clients, whichever is less. For the remaining days, it takes the minimum of products and clients.
  
### Testing Edge Cases:

Let's consider if there are undiscovered edge cases where this logic may fail.

1. **Case with No Sell-Out Days (`f = 0`)**:
   - Input: 
     ```
     3 0
     1 1
     2 3
     0 5
     ```
   - Expected output: 3 (at day 1, 1 sold; at day 2, 2 sold; at day 3, 0 sold).
   - The program handles this correctly, so it outputs 3.

2. **All Days Selected for Sell-Out**:
   - Input: 
     ```
     3 3
     2 1
     3 5
     2 2
     ```
   - The code should double the products on all 3 days leading to: 
     ```
     Day 1: min(4, 1) = 1
     Day 2: min(6, 5) = 5
     Day 3: min(4, 2) = 2
     ```
   - Total should be 8, which the program should output correctly.

3. **Critical Scenario of No Clients**:
   - Input: 
     ```
     3 2
     3 0
     5 0
     2 0
     ```
   - Here, even if `f = 2` days are chosen for sell-out:
     ```
     Day 1: min(6, 0) = 0
     Day 2: min(10, 0) = 0
     Day 3: min(4, 0) = 0
     ```
   - Total expected: 0. If the program handles this correctly, it should still yield 0.

### Conclusion

After exploring various scenarios including edge cases that involve no clients, full selection of days for sell outs, and typical operational conditions, the program adheres to the requirements of maximizing sales correctly. 

Thus, I conclude that the program behaves correctly under the outlined problem description.

Correctness: **True**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the number of days, f is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ f ≤ n) representing the number of days chosen for sell-out, and for each of the n days, k_i and l_i are non-negative integers (0 ≤ k_i, l_i ≤ 10^9) representing the number of products available and the number of clients on day i respectively.
def func():
    n, f = map(int, input().split())
    days = []
    for _ in range(n):
        k, l = map(int, input().split())
        
        days.append((k, l))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer, `days` is a list containing `n` tuples of integers `(k, l)` received as input, `_` is `n - 1`, each `k` is an input integer, each `l` is an input integer.
    days.sort(key=lambda x: x[1] - x[0], reverse=True)
    sold = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if i < f:
            sold += min(days[i][0] * 2, days[i][1])
        else:
            sold += min(days[i][0], days[i][1])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer, `days` is sorted in descending order, `_` is `n - 1`, and `sold` is equal to the sum of the minimums based on the logic defined in the loop: for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`, if `i < f`, `sold` increments by `min(days[i][0] * 2, days[i][1])`; otherwise, it increments by `min(days[i][0], days[i][1])`.
    print(sold)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts input representing the number of days (`n`) and the number of days chosen for sell-out (`f`), as well as the number of products available (`k_i`) and the number of clients (`l_i`) for each day. It then calculates and prints the total number of products sold based on these inputs. For the first `f` days, it allows doubling the available products when calculating the sold amount, while for the remaining days, it uses the actual available products. It assumes valid input will be provided as specified, but it does not ensure any edge case handling for improper input values.

Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
