#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000) denoting the number of days; f is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ f ≤ n) representing the number of days to choose for sell-out; days is a list of n tuples, each containing two non-negative integers (k_i, l_i) where k_i (0 ≤ k_i ≤ 10^9) is the number of products on the shelves and l_i (0 ≤ l_i ≤ 10^9) is the number of clients on the i-th day.
def func_1(n, f, days):
    regular_sales = []
    potential_sales_increase = []
    for (k, l) in days:
        regular_sales.append(min(k, l))
        
        potential_sales_increase.append(min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer, `days` is a list of `n` tuples, `regular_sales` contains `n` elements where each element is `min(k_i, l_i)` for each tuple `(k_i, l_i)` in `days`, `potential_sales_increase` contains `n` elements where each element is `min(2 * k_i, l_i) - min(k_i, l_i)` for each corresponding tuple `(k_i, l_i)` in `days`.
    total_sales = sum(regular_sales)
    potential_sales_increase.sort(reverse=True)
    total_sales += sum(potential_sales_increase[:f])
    return total_sales
    #The program returns total_sales, which is the sum of regular_sales plus the sum of the first f elements of potential_sales_increase.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` representing the number of days, a non-negative integer `f` representing the number of days selected for potential sales increase, and a list of tuples `days` where each tuple contains two non-negative integers. It calculates the total sales by summing up the minimum of products available and clients for each day (regular sales) and adds the top `f` potential sales increases (calculated as the difference between the potential double sales and the regular sales) to the total. The function returns this total sales value.
