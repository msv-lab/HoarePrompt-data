Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer, `days` is a list of `n` tuples, `regular_sales` contains `n` elements where each element is `min(k_i, l_i)` for each tuple `(k_i, l_i)` in `days`, `potential_sales_increase` contains `n` elements where each element is `min(2 * k_i, l_i) - min(k_i, l_i)` for each corresponding tuple `(k_i, l_i)` in `days`.**
