The value of `total_sales` is assigned the sum of `regular_sales`, which is a list containing `n` elements, where each element is defined as `min(k_i, l_i)` for each tuple `(k_i, l_i)` in `days`. The other variables `n`, `f`, `days`, `regular_sales`, and `potential_sales_increase` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state expresses the updated value of `total_sales`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer, `days` is a list of `n` tuples, `regular_sales` contains `n` elements where each element is `min(k_i, l_i)` for each tuple `(k_i, l_i)` in `days`, `potential_sales_increase` contains `n` elements where each element is `min(2 * k_i, l_i) - min(k_i, l_i)`, and `total_sales` is the sum of `regular_sales`.**
