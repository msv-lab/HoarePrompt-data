The variable `sold` is assigned the value `0`. This does not affect any of the other variables already defined in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State reflects the unchanged values along with the newly assigned value of `sold`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer, `days` is sorted in descending order based on the value of `(l - k)` for each tuple, `_` is `n - 1, sold` is 0.**
