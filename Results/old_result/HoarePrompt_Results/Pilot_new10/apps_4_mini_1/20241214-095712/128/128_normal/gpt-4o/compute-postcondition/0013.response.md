The variable `potential_sales_increase` is sorted in reverse order, which means its elements will be rearranged from the largest to the smallest value. The previous values of `potential_sales_increase` are not affected, and the sorting process has no impact on other variables. 

The specific values before sorting remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer, `days` is a list of `n` tuples, `regular_sales` contains `n` elements where each element is `min(k_i, l_i)` for each tuple `(k_i, l_i)` in `days`, `potential_sales_increase` is now sorted in descending order, and `total_sales` is the sum of `regular_sales`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer, `days` is a list of `n` tuples, `regular_sales` contains `n` elements where each element is `min(k_i, l_i)` for each tuple `(k_i, l_i)` in `days`, `potential_sales_increase` is sorted in descending order, `total_sales` is the sum of `regular_sales`.**
