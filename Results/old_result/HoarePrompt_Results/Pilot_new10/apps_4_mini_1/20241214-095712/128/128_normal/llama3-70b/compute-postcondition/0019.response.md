Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer, `days` is sorted in descending order, `_` is `n - 1`, and `sold` is set to `0 + min(days[0][0] * 2, days[0][1])` if `i` is less than `f`, otherwise `sold` is set to `min(days[0][0], days[0][1])`. The value of `i` remains 0 throughout the execution.***
