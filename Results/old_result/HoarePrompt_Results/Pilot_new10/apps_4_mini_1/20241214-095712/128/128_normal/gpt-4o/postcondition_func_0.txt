The function accepts a positive integer `n` representing the number of days, a non-negative integer `f` representing the number of days selected for potential sales increase, and a list of tuples `days` where each tuple contains two non-negative integers. It calculates the total sales by summing up the minimum of products available and clients for each day (regular sales) and adds the top `f` potential sales increases (calculated as the difference between the potential double sales and the regular sales) to the total. The function returns this total sales value.
