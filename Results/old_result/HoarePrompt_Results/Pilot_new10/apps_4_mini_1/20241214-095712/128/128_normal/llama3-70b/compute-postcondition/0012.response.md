The `days` list is sorted based on the difference `l - k` for each tuple `(k, l)` in descending order. The values of `n`, `f`, and `_` remain unchanged after the sorting operation. The `days` list is now in a new order determined by the sorting criteria. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer, `days` is sorted in descending order based on the value of `(l - k)` for each tuple, `_` is `n - 1`.**
