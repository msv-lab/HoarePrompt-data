The value being appended to `regular_sales` is the minimum of `k` and `l`, where `k` is the last element of the last tuple in `days` and `l` is the second element of the last tuple in `days`. Since `days` is not empty and contains tuples, both `k` and `l` will be defined based on the last tuple's values.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer, `days` is a list of `n` tuples, `k` is the last element of the last tuple in `days`, `l` is the second element of the last tuple in `days`, and we append `min(k, l)` to `regular_sales`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer, `days` is a list of `n` tuples, `k` is the last element of the last tuple in `days`, `l` is the second element of the last tuple in `days`, `regular_sales` now includes `min(k, l)`**.
