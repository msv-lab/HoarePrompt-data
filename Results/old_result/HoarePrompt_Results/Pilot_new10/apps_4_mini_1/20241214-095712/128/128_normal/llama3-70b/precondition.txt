n is a positive integer representing the number of days (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), f is a non-negative integer representing the number of sell-out days to choose (0 ≤ f ≤ n), and for each day i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), k_{i} and l_{i} are non-negative integers indicating the number of products available (0 ≤ k_{i} ≤ 10^9) and the number of clients (0 ≤ l_{i} ≤ 10^9) respectively.
