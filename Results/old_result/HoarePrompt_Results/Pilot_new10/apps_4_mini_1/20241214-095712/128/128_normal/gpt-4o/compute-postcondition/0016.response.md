The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `f`, and `days`. 

- `n` is a positive integer that denotes the number of days (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000). 
- `f` is a non-negative integer that represents the number of days to choose for sell-out (0 ≤ f ≤ n). 
- `days` is a list containing `n` tuples, where each tuple consists of two non-negative integers: `k_i`, the number of products on the shelves (0 ≤ k_i ≤ 10^9), and `l_i`, the number of clients on the i-th day (0 ≤ l_i ≤ 10^9).

After executing the function body, it returns `total_sales`, which is the sum of `regular_sales` plus the sum of the first `f` elements of `potential_sales_increase`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept the number of days, the number of days for sell-out, and a list of tuples representing the products and clients, and return the total sales calculated based on the inputs. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a non-negative integer `f`, and a list of tuples `days`, and returns the total sales as the sum of regular sales and the first `f` elements of potential sales increase.**
