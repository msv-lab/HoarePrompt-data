According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer ranging from 1 to 100,000, the loop will definitely execute because `n` is greater than 0. 

Additionally, inside the loop, the variable `_` is typically used as a placeholder when the loop variable is not needed in the loop body. This means that the loop can iterate without any additional dependence on `f` or `days`. The state `days` being an empty list does not affect the loop execution either, but if the loop modifies `days`, the state should be noted accordingly. 

At the start of the loop, `_` will be initialized to 0 for the first iteration. Therefore, there are no adjustments needed to ensure the loop executes, but we will reflect on the initial state of `_`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer, `days` is an empty list, `_` is 0**
