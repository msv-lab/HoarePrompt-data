The variable `sold` is updated by adding the minimum of `days[i][0]` and `days[i][1]` to its current value. The initial state indicates that `i` is equal to 1, which means we are examining the second item in the `days` list. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `f` is a non-negative integer, `days` is sorted in descending order, `_` is `n - 1`, `sold` is updated to `0 + min(days[0][0] * 2, days[0][1]) + min(days[1][0], days[1][1])`, and `i` is 1**
