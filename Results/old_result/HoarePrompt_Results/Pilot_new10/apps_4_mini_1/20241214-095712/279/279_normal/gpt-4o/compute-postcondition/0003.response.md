The code assigns `p` the list of integers derived from `data` using `map(int, data[1:n + 1])`. This implies that it takes a subset of the `data` list starting from index 1 up to and including index `n`. Since `n` is a specific positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, the list `p` will be populated with integers from this range selected from `data`.

After executing the code, the list `p` will hold the values parsed from `data`, while the values of `n`, `b`, and `data` will remain unchanged. Since `data` is derived from input, the exact contents of `data` will affect the final structure of `p`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a specific positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `p` is a list of integers consisting of the first `n` elements from `data`, starting from index 1; `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones, where the length of `b` is equal to `n`; `data` is a list of strings from input split by whitespace.

Output State: **`n` is a specific positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `p` is a list of integers from `data[1:n + 1]`; `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones, where the length of `b` is equal to `n`; `data` is a list of strings from input split by whitespace.**
