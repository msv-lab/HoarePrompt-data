The variable `x` is assigned the value of `p[2] - 1`, and it is appended to the `cycle` list. Since `visited[x]` is already `True`, it does not affect that variable. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a specific positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 2; `visited[2] is True`; `cycle` now contains the elements 2 and `x`; `x` is `p[2] - 1`; `visited[x] is True`; `cycles` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a specific positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 2; `visited[2] is True; `cycle` contains 2 and `x`; `x` is `p[2] - 1`; `visited[x] is True`; `cycles` remains unchanged.**
