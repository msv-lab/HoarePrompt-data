The code initializes `cycle` as an empty list. The values of `n`, `i`, and `visited[i]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state maintains the previous values while reflecting the new state of `cycle`.

Output State: **`n` is a specific positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 0, `visited[i]` is False, and `cycle` is an empty list `[]`.**
