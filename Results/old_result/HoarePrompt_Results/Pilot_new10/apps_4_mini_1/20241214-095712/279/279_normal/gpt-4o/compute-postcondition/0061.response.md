Postcondition: ***`n` is a specific positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 2. If `visited[i]` is False, `visited` is updated such that `visited[x]` is set to True for each `x` visited during the iterations, and `cycle` contains all values of `x` encountered until a previously visited index is hit; `x` is the final value computed from `p[previous_x] - 1`, and `cycles` contains `cycle` appended to it.***
