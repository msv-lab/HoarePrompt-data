The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `ans` is 2, so after the operation, `ans` becomes 3. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of integers representing a new permutation from the input, `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones based on user input, `ans` is 3, `i` is equal to `n - 1`.**
