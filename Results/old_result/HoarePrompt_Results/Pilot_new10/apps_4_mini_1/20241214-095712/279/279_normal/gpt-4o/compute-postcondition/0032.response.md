The value of `x` is assigned the value of `p[x]` minus 1. We need to observe the previous states of the affected variables. Since `x` is initially 1, this means we will subtract 1 from the value of `p[1]`. The outcome will depend on the specific value that is stored in `p[1]`. 

For the output state, we maintain the precondition details, particularly mentioning that `x` has been updated. 

Output State: **`n` is a specific positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 1, `visited[1]` is True, `cycle` is a list containing the value 1, `x` is equal to `p[1] - 1`, `cycles` remains unchanged.**
