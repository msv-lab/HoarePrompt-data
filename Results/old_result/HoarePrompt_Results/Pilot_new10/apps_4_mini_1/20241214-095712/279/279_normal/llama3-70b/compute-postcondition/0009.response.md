The variable `ans` is incremented by 1. Since `ans` was initially set to 1 based on the condition where `p[i]` is not equal to `i + 1` and `b[i]` is 0, this means that the new value of `ans` will be 2 after the increment. The values of `n`, `p`, and `b` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of integers representing a new permutation from the input, `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones based on user input, `ans` is 2.**
