Output State: **`n` is a specific positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 1; `visited` is a list where the indices corresponding to the values added to `cycle` are True, indicating those indices have been visited; `cycle` is a list containing the values traversed starting from 1 until a repeated visit occurs; `x` is now equal to the last value assigned from `p[x] - 1` that leads to the repeated index in `visited`, `cycles` remains unchanged.**
