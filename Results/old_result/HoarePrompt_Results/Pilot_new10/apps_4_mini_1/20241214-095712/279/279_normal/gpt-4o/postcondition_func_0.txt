The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a list `p` which is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, and a list `b` consisting of zeros and ones with a length equal to `n`. It identifies cycles in the permutation `p` and evaluates how many of these cycles are purely composed of indices where the corresponding value in `b` is `0`. If there is only one cycle, it prints `0`. If there are multiple cycles, it prints the count of those cycles with only `0` values in `b`, unless this count is less than or equal to `0`, in which case it prints `1`.
