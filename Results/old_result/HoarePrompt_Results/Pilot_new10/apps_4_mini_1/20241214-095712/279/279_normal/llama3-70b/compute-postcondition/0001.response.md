The code assigns `p` the value obtained from `input().split()`, which is processed by `map(int, ...)` to convert the input values from strings to integers. This means that `p` is updated with a new list of integers, which can be any permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer inputted from the user; `p` is a list of integers representing a new permutation from the input; `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones with the same length as p.**
