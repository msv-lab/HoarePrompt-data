The code `cycle.append(x)` adds the current value of `x` to the `cycle` list. Since `x` is currently 0, the `cycle` list will be updated to include this value. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is a specific positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 0; `visited[0]` is True; `cycle` is [0]; `x` is 0**
