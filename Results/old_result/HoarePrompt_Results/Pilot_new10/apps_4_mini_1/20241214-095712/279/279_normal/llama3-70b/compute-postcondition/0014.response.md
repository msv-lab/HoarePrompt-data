The `ans` variable is incremented by 1. Given that prior to this line, `ans` was already set to 3 due to the condition involving `p[i]`, the new value of `ans` is 4. The variable `i` remains equal to `n - 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected by this line.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of integers representing a new permutation from the input, `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones based on user input, `ans` is now 4, `i` remains equal to `n - 1**.
