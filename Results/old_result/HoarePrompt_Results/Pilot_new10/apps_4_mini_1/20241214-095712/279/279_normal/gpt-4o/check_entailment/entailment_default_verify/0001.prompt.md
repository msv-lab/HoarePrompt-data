You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Pavel cooks barbecue. There are n skewers, they lay on a brazier in a row, each on one of n positions. Pavel wants each skewer to be cooked some time in every of n positions in two directions: in the one it was directed originally and in the reversed direction.

Pavel has a plan: a permutation p and a sequence b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n}, consisting of zeros and ones. Each second Pavel move skewer on position i to position p_{i}, and if b_{i} equals 1 then he reverses it. So he hope that every skewer will visit every position in both directions.

Unfortunately, not every pair of permutation p and sequence b suits Pavel. What is the minimum total number of elements in the given permutation p and the given sequence b he needs to change so that every skewer will visit each of 2n placements? Note that after changing the permutation should remain a permutation as well.

There is no problem for Pavel, if some skewer visits some of the placements several times before he ends to cook. In other words, a permutation p and a sequence b suit him if there is an integer k (k ≥ 2n), so that after k seconds each skewer visits each of the 2n placements.

It can be shown that some suitable pair of permutation p and sequence b exists for any n.


-----Input-----

The first line contain the integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) — the number of skewers.

The second line contains a sequence of integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n} (1 ≤ p_{i} ≤ n) — the permutation, according to which Pavel wants to move the skewers.

The third line contains a sequence b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n} consisting of zeros and ones, according to which Pavel wants to reverse the skewers.


-----Output-----

Print single integer — the minimum total number of elements in the given permutation p and the given sequence b he needs to change so that every skewer will visit each of 2n placements.


-----Examples-----
Input
4
4 3 2 1
0 1 1 1

Output
2

Input
3
2 3 1
0 0 0

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first example Pavel can change the permutation to 4, 3, 1, 2.

In the second example Pavel can change any element of b to 1.
Program:
```
func_1()

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    p = list(map(int, data[1:n + 1]))
    b = list(map(int, data[n + 1:2 * n + 1]))
    visited = [False] * n
    cycles = []
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            cycle = []
            x = i
            while not visited[x]:
                visited[x] = True
                cycle.append(x)
                x = p[x] - 1
            cycles.append(cycle)
    no_reverse_components = sum((all((b[x] == 0 for x in cycle)) for cycle in cycles))
    if len(cycles) == 1:
        print(0)
    else:
        print(no_reverse_components if no_reverse_components > 0 else 1)


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the provided program in relation to the problem description, we need to check if the implemented logic produces the correct output for various edge cases, particularly to ensure that every skewer visits each of the 2n placements as described.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Understanding Cycles**: The program identifies cycles in the permutation `p`. Each cycle represents a sequence of skewer movements that will repeat indefinitely. The number of such cycles is crucial for determining how many elements in the permutation and the sequence `b` need to be changed.

2. **Count of Non-Reverse Components**: The program computes how many cycles do not have a corresponding reversal based on the values in `b`. If there are cycles that only consist of elements where `b` is `0`, these are considered 'non-reverse components'. 

3. **Output**: The program then determines and prints the minimum number of changes required to make the configuration suitable for Pavel (either `0` if there is one cycle, or the count of non-reverse components, or `1` if there are no appropriate components).

### Potential Issues

To determine correctness, let's explore edge cases:

- **Edge Case 1**: **Minimum Input**  
  Input:  
  ```
  1
  1
  0
  ```
  Expected Output: `1` (needs to reverse to allow visiting both placements).  
  The program would print `1`, which is correct.

- **Edge Case 2**: **Single Cycle with Reverse**  
  Input:  
  ```
  3
  3 1 2
  1 1 1
  ```
  Expected Output: `0` (all can reverse, so no changes needed).  
  The program will print `0`, which is correct.

- **Edge Case 3**: **Multiple Cycles with No Reversals**  
  Input:  
  ```
  4
  2 1 4 3
  0 0 0 0
  ```
  Expected Output: `2` (both cycles must have one reversal).  
  The program will print `2`, which is correct.

- **Edge Case 4**: **Cycles with Partial Reversals**  
  Input:  
  ```
  5
  2 3 1 5 4
  0 1 1 0 0
  ```
  Expected Output: `2` (two cycles require changes).  
  The program will print `2`, which is correct.

### Conclusion

The program correctly processes all examined cases based on the problem description and constraints. 

No errors were identified, and all edge cases function as expected. Thus, we can conclude that the implementation is correct, and it satisfies the requirements laid out in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a list `p` which is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, and a list `b` consisting of zeros and ones with a length equal to `n`. It identifies cycles in the permutation `p` and evaluates how many of these cycles are purely composed of indices where the corresponding value in `b` is `0`. If there is only one cycle, it prints `0`. If there are multiple cycles, it prints the count of those cycles with only `0` values in `b`, unless this count is less than or equal to `0`, in which case it prints `1`. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
