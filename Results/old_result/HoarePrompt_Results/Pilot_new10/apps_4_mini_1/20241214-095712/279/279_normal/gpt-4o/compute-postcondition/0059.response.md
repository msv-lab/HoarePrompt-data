Output State: **`visited` is a list where `visited[x]` is True for each x visited during the iterations, `cycle` contains all the values of x encountered in the loop until it hits a previously visited index, `x` is the final value computed from `p[previous_x] - 1`, `n` is a specific positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, and `i` is 2, `cycles` remains unchanged.**
