The `data` variable is assigned the value of `input().split()`, which splits the input string into a list of substrings using whitespace as the delimiter. The other variables `n`, `p`, and `b` remain unchanged by this operation. Since `data` now holds the elements of the standard input, there is no specific indication of its exact contents without further input. 

Therefore, the Output State reflects that `data` is now a list of strings resulting from splitting the input, while `n`, `p`, and `b` retain their original valid states.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of integers from 1 to n; `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones, where the length of `b` is equal to n; `data` is a list of strings from input split by whitespace.**
