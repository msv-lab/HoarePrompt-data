The `cycle` list is updated to include the current value of `x`, which is 1. Therefore, after executing the code, `cycle` will now contain the value 1 while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a specific positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 1, `visited[1]` is True, `cycle` is a list containing the value 1, `x` is 1, `cycles` remains unchanged.**
