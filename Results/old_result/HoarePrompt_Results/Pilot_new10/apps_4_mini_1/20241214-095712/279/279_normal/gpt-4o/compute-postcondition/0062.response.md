Output State: **`n` is a specific positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `visited` is a list of `n` boolean values indicating whether each index has been visited; `cycles` is a list containing all cycles found in the permutation represented by `p`, where each cycle is a list of indices visited in that cycle. If an index has not been visited, it indicates the presence of a cycle involving that index.**
