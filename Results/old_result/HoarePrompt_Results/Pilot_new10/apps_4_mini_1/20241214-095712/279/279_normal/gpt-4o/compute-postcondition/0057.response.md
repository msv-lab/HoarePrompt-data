The `cycle` list is updated by appending the value of `x`. The initial conditions state that `cycle` contains the number 2 and the value of `x`, and `visited[x]` is True. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a specific positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 2; `visited[2] is True; `cycle` contains 2 and `x` and now also contains `x`; `x` is now `p[previous_x] - 1`; `visited[x] is True; `cycles` remain unchanged.**
