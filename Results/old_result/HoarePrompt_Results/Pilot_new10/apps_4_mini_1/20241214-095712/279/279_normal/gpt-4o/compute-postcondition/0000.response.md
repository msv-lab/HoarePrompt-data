The code snippet `input = sys.stdin.read` reassigns the variable `input` to refer to the `read` method of `sys.stdin`, allowing for bulk reading of input data from standard input instead of the typical line-by-line reading. The existing variables `n`, `p`, and `b` are unaffected, but the behavior of `input` changes as it now captures all input at once instead of processing it as the standard `input()` function would.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of integers from 1 to n; `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones, where the length of `b` is equal to n; `input` is now a reference to `sys.stdin.read`.**
