Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 255; `s` is a string of length `n` containing characters from the set {'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', '?'}, `data` is a list obtained from splitting the full input string into separate elements based on whitespace; `s` is now equal to `data[1]`, and `n` is a multiple of 4.***
