Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255; `s` is a string of length `n-1`; `res` is a string containing characters from 'ACGT' based on the values in `count`, where each character from 'ACGT' is added to `res` if `count[nc]` is greater than 0 and is appended in the order they appear; `count[nc]` is non-negative, reflecting the number of remaining characters of each type not yet added to `res`.**
