Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 255, `s` is a string of length `n`, `data` is a list obtained from splitting the full input string, `s` is equal to `data[1]`, `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`, and `counts` is initialized to {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}. If `char` is a character present in `counts`, the count of `char` in `counts` will be updated accordingly.***
