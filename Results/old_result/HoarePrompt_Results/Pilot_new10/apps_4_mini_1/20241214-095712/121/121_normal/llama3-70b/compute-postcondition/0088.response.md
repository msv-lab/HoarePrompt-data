Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'; `res` is a string containing all non-'?' characters from `s` along with characters from 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' added in the order based on their presence in `count` where `count` maintains non-negative values for 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', reflecting the remaining occurrences after processing all '?' characters in `s`. At this point, there is at least one non-zero value in `count`, which means at least one of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T' can still be included in `res`.***
