The function accepts an integer `n` (where 4 ≤ n ≤ 255) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting solely of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'. It counts the occurrences of each character and calculates the average number of 'A's, 'C's, 'G's, and 'T's that should ideally be present for balance. The function then replaces the '?' characters in `s` with the required characters ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') to achieve this balance, in the order they are needed. If it is not possible to replace all '?' characters while satisfying the required counts, the function prints '===', otherwise, it prints the modified string `res`. Edge cases include handling scenarios where all characters in `s` are '?' or when the input string already has a balanced number of 'A's, 'C's, 'G's, and 'T's.
