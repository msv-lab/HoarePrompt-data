After executing the provided code snippet, the effect on the state is as follows:

`count[nc]` is decremented by 1. The value of `nc` is 'G', so `count['G']` is reduced by 1. Other variables are unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255; `s` is a string of length `n`; `c` is 'A'; `nc` is 'G'; `count[nc]` is decremented by 1; `res` is incremented by 'G'.**
