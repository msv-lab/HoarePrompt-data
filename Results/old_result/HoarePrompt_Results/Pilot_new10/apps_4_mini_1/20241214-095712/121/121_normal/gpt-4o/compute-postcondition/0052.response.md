The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. The other variables' relationships remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 255; `s` is a string of length `n`; `data` is a list obtained from splitting the full input string; `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`; `count for char (which is 'C')` is now greater than or equal to its previous value; `result[0]` is 'C'; `result[1]` is 'C'; `result[2]` is `char`; `i` is 2; `counts[char]` (which is `counts['C']`) is incremented by 1 and is now greater than or equal to its previous value, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
