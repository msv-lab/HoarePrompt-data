Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', `count` is updated as `count['A']` = `avg - count['A']`, `count['C']` = `avg - count['C']`, `count['G']` = `avg - count['G']`, `count['T']` = `avg - count['T']`, where `avg` is `n // 4`, `res` is an empty string, and the first character of `s` (denoted as `c`) is not '?'***
