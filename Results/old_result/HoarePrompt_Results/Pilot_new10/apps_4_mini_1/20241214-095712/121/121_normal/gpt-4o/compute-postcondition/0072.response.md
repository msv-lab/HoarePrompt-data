Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 255, `s` is a string of length `n`, `data` is a list obtained from splitting the full input string, `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`, and if `counts[char]` is less than `target_count`, then `result[i]` is assigned the value of `char`, `counts[char]` is incremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or conditional block.***
