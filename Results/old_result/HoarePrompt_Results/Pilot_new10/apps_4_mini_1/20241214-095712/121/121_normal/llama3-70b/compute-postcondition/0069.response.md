The value of `res` is appended with `nc`. The variable `nc` can take on the values 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T' with a count greater than 0, indicating that it is not empty. The state of other variables remains unchanged after this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255, `s` is a string of length `n`, `c` is 'A', `nc` is 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T' and `res` is updated to include `nc`.**
