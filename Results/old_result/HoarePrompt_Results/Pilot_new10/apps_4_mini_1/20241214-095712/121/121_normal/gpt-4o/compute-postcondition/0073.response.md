Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 255; `s` is a string of length `n`; `data` is a list obtained from splitting the full input string; `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`; `counts` contains keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' with each count equal to `target_count + 1` (if at least one character was assigned) to indicate they exceed the target; `result[i]` contains either the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T', depending on which were used to meet the target during the loop execution. If no characters needed to be assigned, all counts remain `target_count`, and `result[i]` would remain '?'.**
