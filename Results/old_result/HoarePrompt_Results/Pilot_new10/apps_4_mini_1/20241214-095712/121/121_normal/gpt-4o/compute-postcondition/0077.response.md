Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 255, `s` is a string of length `n`, `data` is a list obtained from splitting the full input string, `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`, `counts` must have keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' with at least one count greater than `target_count`, `result[i]` is assigned based on the loop's previous execution, `i` is initialized to 0. The count of `char` in `counts` is less than `target_count`.***
