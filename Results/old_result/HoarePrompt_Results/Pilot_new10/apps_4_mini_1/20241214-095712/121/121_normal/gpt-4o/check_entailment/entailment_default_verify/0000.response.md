Final: **False**

The original assessment correctly identifies that while the program adheres to certain foundational requirements, it fails to sufficiently handle edge cases where the counts of nucleotides can lead to impossibilities in achieving an equal distribution, even when `n` is a multiple of 4. Specifically, the program does not account for situations when the existing counts of nucleotides make it impossible for the '?' characters to be replaced in a manner that balances the counts. Therefore, it is logical to conclude the program is not entirely correct, supported by the provided output hints which corroborate the assessment of potential failings in edge cases.
