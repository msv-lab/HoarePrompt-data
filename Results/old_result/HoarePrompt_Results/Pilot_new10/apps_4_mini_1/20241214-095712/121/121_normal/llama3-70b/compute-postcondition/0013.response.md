Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', `count` is {'A': the number of 'A's in `s`, 'C': the number of 'C's in `s`, 'G': the number of 'G's in `s`, 'T': the number of 'T's in `s'}. If `s` consists only of '?', then `count` remains {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}.**
