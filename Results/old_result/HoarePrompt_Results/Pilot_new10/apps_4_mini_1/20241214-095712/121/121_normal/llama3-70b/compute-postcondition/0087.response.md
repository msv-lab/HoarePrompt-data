Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'; `res` is a string containing all non-'?' characters from `s` along with characters from 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' added in the order based on their presence in `count` where `count` maintains non-negative values for 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', reflecting the remaining occurrences after processing all '?' characters in `s`. If no '?' exists in `s`, `res` will be exactly `s`, while if `count` for 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' is exhausted, those characters will not appear in `res`.**
