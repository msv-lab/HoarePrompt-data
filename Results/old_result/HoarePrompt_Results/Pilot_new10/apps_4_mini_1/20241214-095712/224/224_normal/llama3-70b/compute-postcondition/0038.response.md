The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `n` and `f_max_n`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\), and the parameter `f_max_n` is a non-negative integer such that \(f_max_n \leq n\). After executing the function, it returns the cumulative sum at index `f_max_n` in the `dp` array, which is computed using a dynamic programming relation with initial values `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[1] = n`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a non-negative integer `f_max_n`, then return the cumulative sum at the index `f_max_n` in the `dp` array based on the dynamic programming calculations. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and a non-negative integer f_max_n, and returns the cumulative sum at index f_max_n in the dp array, which is computed using a dynamic programming relation.**
