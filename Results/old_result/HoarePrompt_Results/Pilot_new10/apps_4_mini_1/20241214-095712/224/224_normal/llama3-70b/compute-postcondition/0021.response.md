According to the code, the loop condition is based on the variable `f_max_n` which dictates how many times the loop will iterate. The loop decrements `j` starting from `f_max_n` down to 1. At the end of the last iteration, `j` would be 1 (the last value it can take), and on the next iteration, `j` will be decremented to 0, causing the loop to terminate.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must decrement to at least 1 once more. So, to adjust the state, we will set `j` to 0 (it has been decremented already) and `f_max_n` remains unchanged.

Therefore, to allow for one more execution of the loop, we need to state the conditions before the loop could potentially use the maximum value provided. 

If we want to describe the future state based on the current parameters, it can be stated that `j` will become 0, and for the loop to execute again, we need to ensure `f_max_n` is at least 1 to validate its original context.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `MOD` is 1000000007, `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[0]` remains 1, `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] % 1000000007, j is 0`**
