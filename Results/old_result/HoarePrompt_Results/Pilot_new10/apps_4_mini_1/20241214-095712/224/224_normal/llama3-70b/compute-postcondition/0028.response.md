The code updates `dp[j]` to be the result of `dp[j] + dp[j - 1]`, but then it takes the modulo of this updated value with `MOD`. Since `dp[j]` is initially equal to `dp[f_max_n]`, it will become `dp[f_max_n] + dp[f_max_n - 1]`, and taking modulo `MOD` ensures `dp[j]` (now `dp[f_max_n]`) remains within the bounds defined by `MOD`. The other variables remain unchanged, thus the output state tracks the updated value of `dp[j]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^6, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `MOD` is 1000000007, `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[1]` retains its initial value, `dp[f_max_n]` is updated to `dp[f_max_n] + dp[f_max_n - 1] % MOD`, `i` is `n + 1`, and `j` is `f_max_n`.**
