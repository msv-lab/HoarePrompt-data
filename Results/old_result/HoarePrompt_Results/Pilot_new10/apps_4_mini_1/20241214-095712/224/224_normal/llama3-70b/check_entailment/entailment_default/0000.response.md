The functions provided in the code are intended to solve the problem related to permutations and GCDs as described. Let's analyze the program piece by piece and understand if it adheres to the problem requirements:

### Function Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**:
   - This function is meant to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two non-negative integers `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - **Output Hint**: It correctly describes the function's behavior regarding expected inputs and infinite loop issues if both numbers are zero.
   - This function seems correct and appropriately computes the GCD.

2. **Function `func_2(n)`**:
   - This function computes the maximum GCD value across the prefixes of permutations of integers from 1 to `n`.
   - It uses `func_1` to calculate the GCD and keeps track of the maximum GCD value found in the loop.
   - **Output Hint**: It correctly explains how the function works, but it does not clearly state if it correctly finds the maximum distinct values for all permutations, which is what the problem requires.
   - A key concern here is whether the maximum GCD can be accurately derived just from the GCD of the incremental integers. The logic may not sufficiently address the nature of permutations, which might lead to a situation where it fails to count distinct GCDs properly for varying permutations. 

3. **Function `func_3(n, f_max_n)`**:
   - This function uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate permutations based on the maximum GCD obtained.
   - **Output Hint**: It gives a general overview of how the dynamic programming counts aspects of permutations, but it lacks clarity on whether it actually evaluates distinct permutations based on their GCDs correctly.
   - The initialization seems appropriate, and it does correctly reference the dynamic programming logic needed to count valid arrangements.

### Issues Identified:
The biggest potential issue appears to be with **func_2**, which attempts to compute the maximum GCD value. It iterates through the numbers but does not guarantee this value reflects the maximum distinct GCDs achievable among all permutations. 

Specifically:
- The permutations can affect the prefix GCD values significantly, and not all permutations will lead to the maximum GCD value derived from merely iterating through integers 1 to n.
- For example:
  - For `n = 4`, permutations involving the elements [1, 2, 3, 4] yield a variety of GCD outcomes. The maximum distinct count wonâ€™t necessarily align with the generated integers directly since there are configurations of these permutations that generate different GCDs.

Thus, the program fails to reflect the complexities of the problem as it does not yield correct results for all possible cases of input, especially when the GCDs depend on permutation arrangements.

### Conclusion:
Given the flawed handling of GCD computation across all permutations in `func_2`, the program does not correctly follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
