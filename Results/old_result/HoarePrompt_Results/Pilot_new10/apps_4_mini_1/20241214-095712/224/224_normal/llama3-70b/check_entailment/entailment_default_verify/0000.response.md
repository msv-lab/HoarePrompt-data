Final: **False** 

The original assessment is accurate as the implementation of `func_2` does not correctly compute `f_max(n)`, leading to incorrect outputs for permutations. It fails to consider the distinct values of GCDs obtained from all permutations adequately. The hints provided about the functions further support this conclusion by indicating that the logic in `func_2` fails to produce valid maximum values, which directly affects the output of `func_3`. Hence, the program does not meet the problem description as required, confirming its incorrectness.
