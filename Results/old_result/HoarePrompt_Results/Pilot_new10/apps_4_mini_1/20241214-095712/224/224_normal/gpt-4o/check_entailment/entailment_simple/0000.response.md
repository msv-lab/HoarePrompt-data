To determine the correctness of the annotated program based on the provided problem description, we need to analyze both the requirements of the problem and the logic implemented in the program.

### Problem Analysis:
1. We need to count the number of permutations \( p \) of integers \( 1, 2, \ldots, n \) such that \( f(p) \) is equal to \( f_{max}(n) \).
2. The maximum value \( f_{max}(n) \) is equal to the number of distinct GCD values among the prefixes of all permutations \( p \).
3. The output must be returned modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

### Program Analysis:
1. The program starts by reading an integer \( n \) which is guaranteed to be between 2 and \( 10^6 \).
2. If \( n \) is 2, the result is directly assigned a value of 1. This is correct because for \( n=2 \):
   - There are only two permutations: [1, 2] and [2, 1].
   - The GCDs are {1} for both permutations, thus \( f(p) = 1 \) and \( f_{max}(2) = 1 \), so there's exactly one permutation where \( f(p) = f_{max}(2) \).
3. For \( n > 2 \), the program calls `func_1(n - 1, MOD)`. In `func_1`, it calculates \( (n-1)! \).
4. There is a logical disconnect here. The problem requires counting permutations based on \( f(p) = f_{max}(n) \), but the program is calculating \( (n-1)! \). 

### Evaluating the Logic:
- The function `func_1` computes \( (n-1)! \) which does not represent the count of permutations \( p \) for which \( f(p) = f_{max}(n) \). 
- The mapping from permutations to counting only involves a factorial calculation based purely on \( n \), as opposed to evaluating the actual permutations and their respective GCDs.

### Conclusion:
Due to the fact that the program computes \( (n-1)! \) which does not correspond to the task of counting the specific permutations leading to \( f(p) = f_{max}(n) \), the provided implementation does not adhere to the requirements specified in the problem description.

Therefore, the correctness of the program can be summarized as:

Correctness: **False**
