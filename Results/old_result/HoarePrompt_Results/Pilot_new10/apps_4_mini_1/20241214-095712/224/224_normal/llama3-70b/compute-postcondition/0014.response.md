According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n`. The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2. As `n` is at least 2, the loop can continue executing. 

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` must be 2, and `n` can remain as it is, ensuring it stays greater than or equal to 2 for further iterations if needed.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `MOD` is 1000000007, `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` to `dp[f_max_n]` will contain the cumulative sums based on the dynamic programming relation, `i` is 2, `j` is 0**
