The variable `result` is assigned the value of `result * i % mod`. Given the initial values, `result` is 6, `i` is 4, and `mod` is 10^9 + 7. 

Calculating `result * i` gives us:

```
result * i = 6 * 4 = 24
```

Now, applying the modulo operation:

```
24 % (10^9 + 7) = 24
```

This means that `result` will be updated to 24, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^6; `mod` is equal to 10^9 + 7; `result` is 24; `i` is 4**
