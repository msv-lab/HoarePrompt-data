In the given code snippet, the operation on `dp[j]` which is initially 0, is being modified with the line `dp[j] %= MOD`. Since `dp[j]` is 0, the operation effectively does not change its value (0 % 1000000007 = 0).

From the initial state, the following key observations can be made:
- `n` remains a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6.
- `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `MOD` is 1000000007.
- `dp[0]` is 1, and `dp[1]` to `dp[f_max_n - 1]` are all 0.
- Specifically, `dp[j]` remains 0 after executing the code.

There are no other variables affected since `dp[j]` being 0 undergoes a modulus operation which does not change its value.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `MOD` is 1000000007, `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[1]` to `dp[f_max_n - 1]` are all 0, `i` is 1, `j` is `f_max_n`, and `dp[j]` remains 0 after `dp[j] %= MOD`.**
