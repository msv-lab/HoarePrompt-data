The code line `dp[j] += dp[j - 1]` impacts the variable `dp`. The updated value of `dp[j]` is calculated by adding the current value of `dp[j - 1]` to it. 

Given that:
- `dp[0]` is initialized as 1.
- `dp[1]` retains its initial value.
- `j` is defined as `f_max_n - 2`, which must be at least 1 since `f_max_n` is at least 1.

If we denote the previous value of `dp[j]` as `dp[j]_prev` and the value of `dp[j - 1]` as `dp[j - 1]`, the state of `dp[j]` will now be:
- `dp[j]` becomes `dp[j]_prev + dp[j - 1]`.

This means `dp[j]` has been updated, while other variables remain unchanged, and `i` retains the value of `n + 1`, and `j` retains the value of `f_max_n - 2`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^6; `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `MOD` is 1000000007; `dp[0]` is 1; `dp[1]` retains its initial value; `dp[j]` is now `dp[j]_prev + dp[j - 1]`; `i` is `n + 1`; `j` is `f_max_n - 2`.**
