The code updates the value of `dp[j]` by taking the current value of `dp[j]` and adding to it `dp[j - 1]`. Then it applies the modulo operation with `MOD` to ensure that `dp[j]` remains within the specified limits. 

Since `dp[j]` is being updated based on its previous value and the value of `dp[j - 1]`, the overall characteristics of the `dp` array remain valid, but `dp[j]` is modified.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6; `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `MOD` is 1000000007; `dp[0]` is 1; `dp[1]` is 1; `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] + dp[j - 1]`, and after modulo, `dp[j]` is now equal to `(dp[j] + dp[j - 1]) % MOD`.**
