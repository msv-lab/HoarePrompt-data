Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` (where 2 <= n <= 10^6) and a non-negative integer `f_max_n` (where f_max_n >= 1). It computes cumulative sums based on a dynamic programming approach and returns the cumulative sum at index `f_max_n` in the `dp` array. The initial condition guarantees that `dp[0]` is 1 and `dp[1]` is initialized to `n`. This allows the function to compute values of `dp[j]` based on previous calculations, providing the result for various values of `f_max_n` as required. The code does not handle cases where `f_max_n` is 0, as it should yield 1 based on the initialization of `dp`.
