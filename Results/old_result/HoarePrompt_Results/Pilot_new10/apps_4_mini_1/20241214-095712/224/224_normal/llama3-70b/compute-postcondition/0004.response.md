According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `f_max_n`. The loop will execute if `f_max_n` is at least 1, as it iterates from `f_max_n` to 1 (inclusive). Given that `f_max_n` is a non-negative integer and satisfies `f_max_n <= n`, it is crucial that `f_max_n` be greater than or equal to 1 in order for the loop to run.

At the beginning of the loop, `j` will take the value of `f_max_n` during the first iteration. Since the current state specifies that `f_max_n` can be zero, for the loop to execute correctly, `f_max_n` must be adjusted to be at least 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `MOD` is 1000000007, `dp` is a list where `dp[0]` is 1 and `dp[1]` to `dp[f_max_n]` are all 0, `i` is 1, `j` is `f_max_n`**
