The statement `dp[j] %= MOD` modifies the value of `dp[j]`. The variable `dp` at index `j` is updated by taking the remainder when `dp[j]` is divided by `MOD`. Given that `dp[j]` is previously stated to be 0, the operation `0 % 1000000007` will still result in 0. Therefore, the value of `dp[j]` remains unchanged at 0. The other variables and conditions remain valid as they were defined initially.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `MOD` is 1000000007, `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[1]` to `dp[f_max_n]` are all 0, `i` is 1, `j` is `f_max_n - 1`, `dp[j]` remains 0.**
