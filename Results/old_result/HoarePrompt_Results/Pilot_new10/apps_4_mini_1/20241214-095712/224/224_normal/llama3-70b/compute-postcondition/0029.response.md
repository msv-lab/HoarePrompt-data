According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` in relation to the range defined by `f_max_n`. The loop is set to run as long as `j` is greater than 0, decrementing by 1 in each iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `f_max_n`, which must be at least 1 for the loop to proceed.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to decrement to `f_max_n - 1`. Since `j` decreases by 1 each iteration, to execute again, the new value for `j` should be `f_max_n - 1`. Consequently, the loop can execute as long as `f_max_n` is greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^6, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `MOD` is 1000000007, `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[1]` retains its initial value, `dp[f_max_n]` is updated to `dp[f_max_n] + dp[f_max_n - 1] % MOD`, `i` is `n + 1`, and `j` is `f_max_n - 1`**
