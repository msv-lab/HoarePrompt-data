The variable `dp[j]` is updated to be the sum of its current value and `dp[j - 1]`. Given that `dp[0]` is initialized to 1 and `dp[1]` to `dp[f_max_n]` are all 0, we can determine that `dp[j]` is incremented by the value of `dp[j - 1]`, which is currently 0 (since `j` is `f_max_n` and `dp[f_max_n]` starts as 0). Therefore, `dp[j]` remains unchanged.

After executing the code snippet, the states of the other variables remain valid, but `dp[j]` still holds a value of 0, as `dp[j - 1]` was 0 before the statement was executed.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `MOD` is 1000000007, `dp` is a list where `dp[0]` is 1 and `dp[1]` to `dp[f_max_n]` are all 0, `i` is 1, `j` is `f_max_n`, and `dp[j]` remains 0 after the update.**
