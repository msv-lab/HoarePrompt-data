The value of `dp[j]` is incremented by the value of `dp[j - 1]`. Given that `j` is equal to `f_max_n`, we can say `dp[f_max_n]` is still 0 before this operation because it was previously initialized to 0. Therefore, the operation results in `dp[f_max_n]` still being 0 since `dp[j - 1]` (or `dp[f_max_n - 1]`) was 0 (all `dp` values from `dp[1]` to `dp[f_max_n]` are initialized to 0).

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `MOD` is 1000000007, `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[1]` to `dp[f_max_n]` are all 0, `i` is 1, `j` is `f_max_n`, and `dp[j]` remains 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `MOD` is 1000000007, `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[1]` to `dp[f_max_n - 1]` are all 0, `i` is 1, `j` is `f_max_n`, and `dp[j]` remains 0.**
