To verify the correctness of the given program for the problem description, we need to analyze if the method used in the program accurately counts the number of permutations `p` such that `f(p)` equals `f_max(n)`.

1. The program starts by checking if `n` equals 2. If it does, it directly assigns the result as 1. This is correct, as for `n=2`, there is indeed 1 permutation `[1, 2]` that has `f(p) = f_max(2) = 1`.

2. For `n > 2`, the program calls `func_1(n - 1, MOD)`, where `func_1` calculates the factorial of `n - 1` modulo `10^9 + 7`. This is problematic due to the need for deeper understanding of how permutations relate to `f(p)` and `f_max(n)`.

3. The maximum value `f_max(n)` actually has specific values based on the divisors and their distributions in permutations. A crucial aspect that the program overlooks is properly calculating the permutations that yield the maximum distinct GCDs. The factorial calculation alone does not encapsulate how permutations are formed based on GCD properties.

4. The output specifically states that `f(p) = f_max(n)` needs to be counted; however, the program doesn’t factor in how many of those permutations yield the maximum distinct values effectively—it simply uses the factorial of `n - 1` instead.

Now let’s analyze specific examples where this logic may fail:

- For `n = 3`: The program computes `func_1(2, MOD)` which returns `2! = 2`. However, the actual `f_max(3)` is 2, and the valid permutations that yield `f(p) = 2` are `[2,1,3]`, `[2,3,1]`, `[3,1,2]`, `[3,2,1]`. Thus, there are 4 permutations yielding the correct `f(p)`, but the program output is incorrect.

Thus, the program fails to consider all possibilities and counts relevant permutations properly; hence it does not adhere to the requirements in all cases and has proven incorrect for certain inputs.

Correctness: **False**.
