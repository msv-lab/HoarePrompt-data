To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we first need to analyze the logic behind each function.

1. **Understanding `func_1(a, b)`**: This function computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. It uses the Euclidean algorithm which is correct.

2. **Understanding `func_2(n)`**: This function attempts to find `f_max(n)`, which we define as the maximum value of `f(p)` for permutations of integers `1` through `n`. The logic checks the GCD of the maximum seen so far with each integer `i` from `1` to `n`. However, this logic will not provide the maximum `f(p)` directly; it only returns the GCD of all numbers from `1` to `n`, which is `1` for any `n > 1`. Thus, `func_2(n)` will always return `1` for `n >= 2`, which is incorrect as we need to track distinct GCDs formed while processing the permutations.

3. **Understanding `func_3(n, f_max_n)`**: This function initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` to count permutations yielding `f(p) = f_max_n`. The logic in this function is very much dependent on the value returned by `func_2(n)`, which is flawed as described earlier.

Now, let's consider some cases to see where the program could fail:

- For `n = 2`, the permutations are `[1, 2]` and `[2, 1]`. There is only one distinct GCD for both, `gcd(1, 2) = 1` for the first permutation and `gcd(2, 1) = 1` for the second. Thus, `f(p) = 1` and `f_max(2) = 1`. There is indeed `1` permutation with `f(p) = f_max(2)` which outputs correctly.

- For `n = 3`, however, `f_max(3)` is analyzed and returns `2`, but the `func_2` incorrectly returns `1`, causing the program to potentially return an invalid count of permutations `p` such that `f(p)` equals the incorrect `f_max(n)`.

Since we can derive that the program fails to compute `f_max(n)` correctly, it leads us to the conclusion that it does not fulfill the requirements of the described problem for all cases.

Correctness: **False**.

### Example of Failure:
For `n = 3`, the program will incorrectly compute `f_max(3)` as `1`, but the actual maximum should be `2`. This directly contradicts the requirement for correct counting of valid permutations where `f(p) = f_max(3)`.

Thus, the program cannot handle this case appropriately and fails to meet the problem description requirements, validating our assessment that it is indeed incorrect.
