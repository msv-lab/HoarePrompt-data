The value of `x` is assigned as `int(input())`, where `input` will accept an input from the user and `int` converts that input into an integer. The variable `x`, which was previously an integer representing the camera rotation angle in degrees, will now hold the integer value provided as input. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `x` has changed to the new integer value, while other states remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`x` is the input integer representing the camera rotation angle in degrees, where -10^18 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18.**
