The value of `x` is updated to `x % 360`, which will yield a value between 0 and 359 regardless of the initial input value. Since `x` is an integer representing the camera rotation angle in degrees, this operation effectively normalizes the angle within a full circular rotation.

Output State: **`x` is the input integer normalized to `x % 360` resulting in a value between 0 and 359.**
