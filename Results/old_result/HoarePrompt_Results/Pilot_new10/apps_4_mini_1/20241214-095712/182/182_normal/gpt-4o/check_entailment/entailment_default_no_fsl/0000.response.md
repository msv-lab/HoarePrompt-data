Correctness: **False**

The program fails to handle all potential scenarios correctly. Specifically, it does not account for negative angles properly. For example:

- If the input is `-60`, the expected output is `3`, as per the problem description. The input `-60` corresponds to a counter-clockwise rotation of 60 degrees, which translates to a clockwise rotation offset of `300 degrees`. The closest angle to vertical is obtained after 3 clockwise turns since:
  - 1 turn: `300 degrees` (deviation = 60)
  - 2 turns: `30 degrees` (deviation = 330)
  - 3 turns: `150 degrees` (deviation = 30)

However, the current implementation does not correctly consider how to derive the minimum deviation. The calculation of `turns` does not reflect the counter-clockwise rotations and calculates incorrectly since it doesn't also measure how close to vertical the resulting image is rotated after considering the total angle appropriately. 

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential inputs and can yield incorrect outputs, leading to an overall determination of incorrectness.
