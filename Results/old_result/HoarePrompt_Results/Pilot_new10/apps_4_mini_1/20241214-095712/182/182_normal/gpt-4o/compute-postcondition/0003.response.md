The code contains a `print(turns)` statement, which outputs the value of `turns`. The value of `turns` has previously been calculated as `(360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4`, where `normalized_angle` is equal to `x % 360`. 

Since the `print` statement does not change the values of any variables, the output state will reflect the unchanged variables and their relationships. 

After executing the code, `turns` is printed, which evaluates based on the previously defined variables:

1. `normalized_angle = x % 360` 
2. `turns = (360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4`

Given that no specific values are provided for `x`, our output will describe how `turns` relates to `x`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer representing the camera rotation angle, `normalized_angle` is equal to `x % 360`, and `turns` is equal to `(360 - (x % 360)) // 90 % 4`, and `turns` is printed.**
