`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The other variables `x` and `y` remain unchanged at this point, and the assigned value of `n` must still satisfy the condition `1 <= n <= 50`. Therefore, the Output State must reflect the new value of `n` while keeping the constraints of `x` and `y`.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `x` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `x[i]` satisfies 0 <= `x[i]` <= 1000; `y` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `y[i]` satisfies 0 <= `y[i]` <= 1000.**
