The variable `x` is assigned a new list created from the input, which is a space-separated string of integers converted to integers. The values of `n` remain unchanged, but the list `x` will now hold the integers provided by the input, each constrained within the range of 0 to 1000.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `x` is a list of `n` integers derived from the input where each integer satisfies 0 <= `x[i]` <= 1000; `y` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `y[i]` satisfies 0 <= `y[i]` <= 1000.**
