Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `x` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `x_i` is in the range 0 <= `x_i` <= 1000; `y` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `y_i` is in the range 0 <= `y_i` <= 1000; `total_x` is the sum of the integers in `x`; `total_y` is the sum of the integers in `y`. If `total_y` is greater than `total_x`, the output is 'No'. Otherwise, if `total_y` is less than or equal to `total_x`, 'Yes' has been printed.***
