The `print('No')` statement outputs the string 'No' but does not change any of the variables `n`, `x`, or `y`. Therefore, the state of the variables remains unchanged as per the initial conditions. 

Output State: **`n` is the input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `x` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, where each integer satisfies 0 <= `x[i]` <= 1000; `y` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, where each integer satisfies 0 <= `y[i]` <= 1000; the sum of the elements in `x` is equal to the sum of the elements in `y`, and `x` is not equal to `y`; the output is 'No'.**
