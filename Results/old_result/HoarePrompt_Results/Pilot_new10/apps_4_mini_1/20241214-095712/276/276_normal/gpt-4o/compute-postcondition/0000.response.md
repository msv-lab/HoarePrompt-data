The variable `q` is assigned the value of the expression (5 ** 0.5 + 1) / 2. This computes a specific numerical value based on the mathematical expression, independent of the values in the tuple `s`. Therefore, the output state reflecting this change is the same as prior, except for the newly calculated value of `q`. The variable `q` is now equal to approximately 1.618033988749895.

Output State: **`s` is a tuple containing two non-empty strings made up of '0' and '1' characters, each not exceeding length 100,000; `q` is approximately 1.618033988749895**.
