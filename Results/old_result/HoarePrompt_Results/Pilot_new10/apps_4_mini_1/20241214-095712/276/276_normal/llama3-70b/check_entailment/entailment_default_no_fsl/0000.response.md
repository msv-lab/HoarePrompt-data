Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements in the problem description because the function `func_1` processes only one of the two strings for conversion (the first one), while it should be converting both strings provided as input. This directly contradicts the problem, which states that we need to determine which of the two given numbers is larger, based on their decimal values in the golden system. 

For example, if the inputs are:
```
1000
111
```
The program will only convert `1000` correctly and compare its value against a decimal representation for `111`, which it does not process at all. As a result, the program fails to handle cases where both inputs need to be assessed to produce the correct comparison result. 

Thus, the program is incorrect as it does not evaluate both binary strings, leading to wrong outcomes for many scenarios, making the output unreliable.
