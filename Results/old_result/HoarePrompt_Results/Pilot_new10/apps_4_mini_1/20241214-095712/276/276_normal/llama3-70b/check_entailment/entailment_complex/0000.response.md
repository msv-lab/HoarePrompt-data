Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The main issue lies in the `func_1` function, which is supposed to convert both binary strings into their decimal values using the golden ratio \( q \). However, the function is defined to only accept a parameter `s`, which is expected to be a tuple containing two strings. In reality, the program passes a single string to `func_1` which leads to the following problems:

1. The program's comment suggests that `s` is a tuple of two strings, but the actual input to `func_1` is just a single string (the first line of input), thus ignoring the second string.
2. Consequently, the second string (which is never actually processed) contributes nothing to the comparison, violating the fundamental requirement to compare both numbers.
3. Since the program only computes the decimal value for the first string input and ignores the second, it cannot potentially fulfill the requirement of determining which of the two golden system numbers is larger.

In summary, the program fails to compare both inputs by processing only the first one, leading to incorrect functionality in situations where both strings represent non-equal values. This leads to incorrect comparisons and outputs, demonstrating that the program does not implement the specified behavior as described in the problem statement.
