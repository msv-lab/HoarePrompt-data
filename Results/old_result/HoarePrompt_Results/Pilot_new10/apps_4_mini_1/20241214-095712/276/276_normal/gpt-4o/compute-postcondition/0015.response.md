The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is a tuple containing two non-empty strings made up of '0' and '1' characters, each with a length not exceeding 100,000. After executing the function body, if both strings in the tuple are '0', the function returns 0. If the values of the strings are different, the function returns approximately 1.618033988749895; if the values are the same but not '0', the function returns approximately 2.618033988749895. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple `s` of two binary strings and return specific values based on the combination of those strings. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter s, which is a tuple of two non-empty strings of '0' and '1'. It returns 0 if both strings are '0', approximately 1.618033988749895 if the strings are different, and approximately 2.618033988749895 if the strings are the same but not '0'.**
