The expression `L -= 1 << i` means that we are subtracting `2` raised to the power of `i` from the variable `L`. Since `i` is 28, this means we are subtracting `2 ** 28` from `L`.

Here are the implications:

1. `L` will decrease by `2 ** 28`, but the value of `L` is not provided in the initial state.
2. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
3. The values currently defined in the initial state continue to hold true.

The output state reflects the updated value of `L`.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 30 inclusive; `dp[28]` is the minimum of its original value and `2 * dp[27]`; `i` is 28; `current_cost` has been incremented by `dp[28]`; L is decreased by `2 ** 28`.**
