According to the code, the loop iterates over a range from 30 down to 0 inclusive. This means that the variable `i` will take the values from 30 down to 0 during the iterations. Since the loop does not depend on conditions regarding the values of `n`, `dp`, `answer`, or `current_cost`, we only need to ensure the correct initialization for the loop variable `i`.

Before the loop starts, `i` is uninitialized, but once the loop begins, `i` will be initialized to 30. Therefore, to represent the state adequately, we need to specify the initialization of `i`. 

State: **`n` is between 1 and 30 inclusive, `dp[i]` for `i` in range `1` to `n` is the minimum of its original value and the corresponding value of `2 * dp[i - 1]`, `dp[i]` for `i` in range `n + 1` to `31` is 10, `answer` is equal to `max_cost`, `current_cost` is 0, `i` is 30**
