The operation `L -= 1 << i` involves a bitwise left shift which effectively multiplies `1` by `2` to the power of `i`, where `i` is currently `29`. Therefore, `1 << 29` equals `2^29`. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` is between 1 and 30 inclusive.
- `dp[i]` for `i` in range `1` to `30` is the minimum of its original value and the corresponding value of `2 * dp[i - 1]`.
- `dp[i]` for `i` in range `31` is 10.
- `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + dp[29]`.
- `i` is 29.
- `L` is modified based on the condition that `L >= 1 << 29`.

The operation modifies `L` to be `L - 2^29`. 

If `L` was greater than or equal to `2^29`, its new value would be `L - 2^29`. If `L` was less than `2^29`, it would remain unchanged. 

The precondition about other variables remains unaffected, and we do not have specific values for `L` or `current_cost` to compute numeric results.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 30 inclusive; `dp[i]` for `i` in range `1` to `30` is the minimum of its original value and the corresponding value of `2 * dp[i - 1]`; `dp[i]` for `i` in range `31` is 10; `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + dp[29]`; `i` is 29; `L` is updated to `L - 2^29` if `L >= 2^29, else L remains unchanged.**
