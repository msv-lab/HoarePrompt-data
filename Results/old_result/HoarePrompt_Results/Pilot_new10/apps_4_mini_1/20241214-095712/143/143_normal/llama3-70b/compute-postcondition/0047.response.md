Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 30, `L` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, `c` is a list of `n` integers each between 1 and 10^9, `costs` is a list of `n` integers each between 1 and 10^9, `j` is equal to `n`, and `vol` is equal to 2. If `vol` is less than or equal to `i`, the state of the program will depend on the action taken when the condition is met. If `vol` is greater than `i`, no action is specified (implying no change). Thus, the program state remains as described for all variables.***
