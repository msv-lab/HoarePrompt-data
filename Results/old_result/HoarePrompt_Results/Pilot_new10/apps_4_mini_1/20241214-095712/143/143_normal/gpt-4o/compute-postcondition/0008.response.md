The expression `dp[i] = min(dp[i], c[i])` updates the value of `dp[i]` to be the minimum of its previous value and `c[i]`. The value of `i` is 2, so we are specifically looking at `dp[2]` and `c[2]`. The variable `n` is within the range of 2 to 30 inclusive and is not changed by this operation. The previous value of `dp[i]` is relevant, and since it is noted to be the minimum of its previous value and `c[i]`, we acknowledge that.

The Output State reflects the possible updates to `dp[i]` based on the condition stated.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 30 inclusive; `i` is 2; `dp[i]` is the minimum of its previous value and `c[2]`.**
