The code initializes a list `dp` with 31 elements, each set to the value of `max_cost`. The other variables (`n`, `L`, `costs`) remain unaffected in their values. 

Since `max_cost` is given as 10, the list `dp` will be populated with 31 elements, all equal to 10.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 inclusive, `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each cost is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `max_cost` is 10, and `dp` is a list of 31 integers equal to 10.**
