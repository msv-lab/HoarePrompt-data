Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `L` ≤ 10^9, `c` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `c[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `c[i]` ≤ 10^9, `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each `costs[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `costs[i]` ≤ 10^9, `dp[0]` is 0, `dp[1]` is equal to the minimum of all `costs[j]` where `j` ranges from `0` to some valid index based on `vol`, `dp` values for indices that cannot be filled remain float('inf'), `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is 0, and the current value of `vol` is less than or equal to `i`.***
