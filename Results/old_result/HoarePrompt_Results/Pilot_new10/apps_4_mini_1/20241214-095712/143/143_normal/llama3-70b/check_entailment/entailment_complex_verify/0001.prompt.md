You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A New Year party is not a New Year party without lemonade! As usual, you are expecting a lot of guests, and buying lemonade has already become a pleasant necessity.

Your favorite store sells lemonade in bottles of n different volumes at different costs. A single bottle of type i has volume 2^{i} - 1 liters and costs c_{i} roubles. The number of bottles of each type in the store can be considered infinite.

You want to buy at least L liters of lemonade. How many roubles do you have to spend?


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and L (1 ≤ n ≤ 30; 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9) — the number of types of bottles in the store and the required amount of lemonade in liters, respectively.

The second line contains n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_{n} (1 ≤ c_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the costs of bottles of different types.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the smallest number of roubles you have to pay in order to buy at least L liters of lemonade.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 12
20 30 70 90

Output
150

Input

10000 1000 100 10

Output
10

Input
4 3
10 100 1000 10000

Output
30

Input

123456789 234567890 345678901 456789012 987654321

Output
44981600785557577



-----Note-----

In the first example you should buy one 8-liter bottle for 90 roubles and two 2-liter bottles for 30 roubles each. In total you'll get 12 liters of lemonade for just 150 roubles.

In the second example, even though you need only 3 liters, it's cheaper to buy a single 8-liter bottle for 10 roubles.

In the third example it's best to buy three 1-liter bottles for 10 roubles each, getting three liters for 30 roubles.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, L) = map(int, input().split())
    costs = list(map(int, input().split()))
    dp = [float('inf')] * (L + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(1, L + 1):
        for j in range(n):
            vol = 2 ** j - 1
            if vol <= i:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - vol] + costs[j])
    print(dp[L] if dp[L] != float('inf') else -1)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the given program in relation to the problem description, we need to carefully analyze the implementation and see if it handles all potential cases as required.

### Analyzing the Program
The program aims to find the minimum cost to buy at least `L` liters of lemonade using bottles that have volumes defined as \(2^j - 1\) for types \(j\) from 0 to \(n-1\). 

The DP approach used:
1. Initializes a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the minimum cost to buy exactly `i` liters.
2. Iterates through volumes of bottles, updating the minimum cost for each possible volume up to `L`.

### Potential Issues
1. **Volume Calculation**: The volume of the bottles is calculated as \(2^j - 1\). For `j` in the range of 0 to 29, this will give volumes ranging from 0 (for j=0) to \(2^{29} - 1\). When numbers exceed 30, they can reach quite high values, and we must ensure that we consider volumes correctly.
  
2. **Initialization and Edge Cases**: The DP array is initialized for lengths 0 to L using `float('inf')`, which is standard. However, if `dp[L]` is still `float('inf')` after processing, it implies that it's impossible to make that exact volume with the given bottles.

3. **Returning Result**: The program currently prints `-1` if it's impossible to gather `L` liters, but the problem statement specifies the output must be a non-negative integer representing the cost.

### Test Cases
To check the solution further, I will create test cases that could reveal possible inconsistencies:

**Test Case 1** (impossible to gather L liters):
```plaintext
Input:
1 1
1
```
The only available bottle has a volume of \(2^0 - 1 = 0\) liters. It is impossible to gather any liters. 

Expected Output: Indicates it's impossible, but ideally the program should return some meaningful cost (like -1 in this case which is not specified in the output options).

**Test Case 2** (exact minimum amount needed):
```plaintext
Input:
4 2
5 10 15 20
```
Here, a single bottle of 2 liters should cost 10 (type 1). The current logic should find this.

**Test Case 3** (beyond max L but still possible to buy):
```plaintext
Input:
6 63
1 2 3 4 5 6
```
The best way here would be to buy bottles that sum to at least 63 liters—testing that bottles correctly can be combined.

### Conclusion
The core implementation seems to be suitable for covering a range of volumes but will fail on cases where bottle volumes do not align well with required volumes (like needing to gather literal lengths against unavailable bottle sizes). 

Given that the program fails to consider these edge cases adequately and may return `-1` (which is not requested in the output), I conclude it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**

### Mentioned Problematic Case
For input `(1, 1)` with costs `[1]`, it cannot correctly give a valid output since it cannot achieve `1` liter using any available bottles. Hence, the algorithm does not work as intended for all inputs.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, L is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9, and c is a list of n integers where each integer c[i] satisfies 1 ≤ c[i] ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    n, L = map(int, input().split())
    costs = list(map(int, input().split()))
    dp = [float('inf')] * (L + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(1, L + 1):
        for j in range(n):
            vol = 2 ** j - 1
            if vol <= i:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - vol] + costs[j])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `L` ≤ 10^9, `c` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `c[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `c[i]` ≤ 10^9, `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each `costs[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `costs[i]` ≤ 10^9, `dp[0]` is 0, and for all `i` from 1 to `L`, `dp[i]` contains the minimum cost to achieve the volume `i` based on the available volumes derived from `vol = 2^j - 1` for `j` in the range from `0` to `n - 1`. If no valid volume was found for a particular `i`, then `dp[i]` remains float('inf').
    print(dp[L] if dp[L] != float('inf') else -1)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts input values for `n` (the number of different costs) and `L` (the required volume). It also reads a list of costs corresponding to different volumes represented as `2^j - 1` for `j` ranging from `0` to `n-1`. The function calculates the minimum cost to achieve the volume `L`, returning the minimum cost if it exists or -1 if it is not possible to achieve that volume. It handles the case where no valid solution exists, indicated by `dp[L]` remaining as infinity, at which point it returns -1.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
