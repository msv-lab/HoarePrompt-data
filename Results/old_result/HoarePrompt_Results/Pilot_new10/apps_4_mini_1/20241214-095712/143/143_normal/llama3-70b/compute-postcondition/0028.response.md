Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30; `dp[0]` is 0; `dp[1]` is equal to the minimum of all `costs[j]`. If `vol` is less than or equal to `i`, then updates to `dp` will be determined by the operations involving `dp[i]`, `costs[j]`, and `vol`, ensuring that the values of `dp` are appropriately adjusted based on the conditions and relationships defined in the program.***
