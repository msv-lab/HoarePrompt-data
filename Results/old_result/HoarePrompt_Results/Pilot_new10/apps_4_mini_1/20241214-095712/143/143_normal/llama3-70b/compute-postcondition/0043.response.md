Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30; `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `L` ≤ 10^9; `c` is a list of `n` integers such that each integer `c[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `c[i]` ≤ 10^9; `costs` is a list of `n` integers such that each `costs[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `costs[i]` ≤ 10^9; `j` is equal to `n`; `vol` is equal to `2^n - 1`. If `vol` is less than or equal to `i`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `dp[i - vol] + costs[n]`.***
