Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `L` ≤ 10^9, `c` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `c[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `c[i]` ≤ 10^9, and `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each `costs[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `costs[i]` ≤ 10^9. If `vol` is less than or equal to `i`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the cost to fill the volume considering the previous volume `i - vol` plus the corresponding cost from `costs[j]`, where `j` is 0 and `vol` is 0.***
