Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 30 inclusive; `dp[i]` for `i` in range `1` to `n` is the minimum of its original value and the corresponding value of `2 * dp[i - 1]`; `dp[i]` for `i` in range `n + 1` to `31` is 10; `answer` is equal to `max_cost`; `current_cost` is equal to `dp[30]`; `i` is 30; and `L` is equal to its previous value minus `2^30` if `L >= 1 << i`.***
