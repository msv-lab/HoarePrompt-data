The code iterates through `i` and updates `dp[i]` by taking the minimum of its current value and `dp[i - 1] * 2`. This means that the value of `dp[i]` will always be the lesser of its current value and twice the previous value `dp[i - 1]`. 

Since there are no specific values given for `dp` or `c`, the values of `dp[i]` can potentially vary depending on the initial setup for `dp` and `c`. However, given that `n` is between 1 and 30, we know that the loop will execute for every `i` from 1 to `n`. 

The updated state of the variable `dp[i]` will reflect this minimum calculation dependent on the values in the `dp` array prior to the execution of this code.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 30 inclusive, `i` is incremented from 1 to `n`, `dp[i]` is the minimum of its previous value and `2 * dp[i - 1]` for `i` in range `1` to `n`.**
