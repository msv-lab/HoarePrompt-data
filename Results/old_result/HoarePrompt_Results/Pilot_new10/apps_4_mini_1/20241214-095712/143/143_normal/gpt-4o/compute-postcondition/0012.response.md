According to the code, the loop iterates over a range from 1 to 30. The iteration variable `i` starts at 1 and increments until it reaches 30. Since `n` is between 1 and 30 inclusive, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has been incremented from 1 to `n`, so the current value of `i` is `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n` and incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to be able to run again, `i` must be set to `n + 1`, and `n` must be at least `n + 1` must be greater than or equal to 1 and must not exceed 30.

Thus, if `i` is set to `n + 1`, the maximum possible value for `n` must be 30 for the loop to be valid.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 30 inclusive, `i` is `n + 1`, which must be greater than n, and dp[i] must be defined.**
