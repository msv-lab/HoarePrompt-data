According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` has not been explicitly stated, but since it is initialized at 0 for the range, it is likely that `j` has been incremented by 1 in the previous iteration (assuming a standard loop behavior). 

Thus, if the loop is to execute again, `j` must be less than `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, and if `j` is now equal to 1 after the last iteration, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to run again. Therefore:

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30; `dp[0]` is 0; `dp[1]` is equal to the minimum of all `costs[j]`; `j` is 2**
