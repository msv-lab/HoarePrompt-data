Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `L` ≤ 10^9, `c` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `c[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `c[i]` ≤ 10^9, `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each `costs[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `costs[i]` ≤ 10^9, `dp[0]` is 0, and `dp[i]` contains the minimum cost to fill the volume `i` after all iterations of the loop have completed. If no valid `vol` was found for `i`, `dp[i]` remains float('inf'). The value of `i` after the loop will be incremented by the number of iterations executed.**
