The variable `cnt1` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts user input and `int` converts it to an integer. The precondition states that `cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4` are non-negative integers, but `cnt_1` is specifically being reassigned a new value, which could be any non-negative integer resulting from the user's input. Other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`cnt_1` is an input non-negative integer; `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= cnt_i <= 10^9 for i in {2, 3, 4}.**
