The function `func` accepts four parameters: `cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4`. All four parameters are non-negative integers, and they adhere to the constraint that \(0 \leq cnt_i \leq 10^9\) for \(i = 1, 2, 3, 4\). However, there is no specific output provided in the details. Therefore, the functionality of the function might not be clearly defined based on the provided information regarding the output.

Nevertheless, based on the parameter constraints alone:

Functionality: **The function accepts four non-negative integer parameters: cnt_1, cnt_2, cnt_3, and cnt_4, each ranging from 0 to 10^9.**
