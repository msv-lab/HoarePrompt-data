The variable `cnt_2` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input()` accepts a value from the user and converts it into an integer. The variable `cnt_1` remains unchanged, as it is affected only by the input process. The conditions of `cnt_1`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4` being non-negative integers and the conditions on `cnt_2` are still valid.

Output State: **`cnt_1` is an input non-negative integer; `cnt_2` is an input integer; `cnt_3` is a non-negative integer; `cnt_4` is a non-negative integer; 0 <= cnt_i <= 10^9 for i in {2, 3, 4}.**
