The given code simply prints `0` to the console. There are no variable assignments or modifications occurring within this code snippet. Therefore, none of the variables (`cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, `cnt_4`) will be affected by this operation. Their initial states remain valid.

Output State: **`cnt_1` is a non-negative integer, `cnt_2` is an integer, `cnt_3` is an integer within the range 0 to 10^9, `cnt_4` is a non-negative integer. The sum of `cnt_1` and `cnt_2` is not equal to the sum of `cnt_3` and `cnt_4`, or `cnt_2` is less than `cnt_3`.**
