The variable `cnt_4` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts a non-negative integer input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, and `cnt_3` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `cnt_1` is an input non-negative integer, `cnt_2` is an input integer, `cnt_3` is an input integer within the range 0 to 10^9, `cnt_4` is an input non-negative integer.

Output State: **`cnt_1` is an input non-negative integer, `cnt_2` is an input integer, `cnt_3` is an input integer within the range 0 to 10^9, `cnt_4` is an input non-negative integer.**
