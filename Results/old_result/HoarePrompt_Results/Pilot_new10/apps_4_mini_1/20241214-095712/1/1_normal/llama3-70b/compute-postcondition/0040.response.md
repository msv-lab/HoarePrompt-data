Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length between 1 and 500,000; `n` is at least 1; `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of ':' or -1; if `f` is True, then `f` remains True, `i` is at least 1, `bind` is set to `i`, and the character at index `i` in `s` is not ']' and is ':', leading to a break from the most internal loop or if statement. If `f` is False, there are no changes to the state of the variables.***
