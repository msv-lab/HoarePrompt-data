The statement `ind = i` assigns the value of `i` to `ind`. Given that `i` is currently `0`, `ind` will also be set to `0`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ind` is 0; `f` is True; `i` is 0; the character at index `i` of `s` is not '['; and the character at index `i` of `s` is ':'**
