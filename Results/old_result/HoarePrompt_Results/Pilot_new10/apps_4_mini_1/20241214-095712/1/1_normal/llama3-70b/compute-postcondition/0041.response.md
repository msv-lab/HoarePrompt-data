Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length between 1 and 500,000, `n` is at least 1, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of ':' or -1, `i` is at least 1, `bind` is -1, and `s[i]` is any character other than ']'. If `s[i]` is ':', then if `f` is True, `f` remains True, `bind` is set to `i`, and control is broken from the most internal loop or if statement; if `f` is False, there are no changes to the state of the variables.***
