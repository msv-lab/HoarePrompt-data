According to the code, the loop can execute based on the value of `n`. The loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than `0`, as it will not enter the loop if `n` is `0` (in which case `range(n - 1, -1, -1)` would not yield any values).

At the beginning of the loop:
- If `n > 0`, then `i` would start at `n - 1` (which is valid).
- If `n` is `0`, the loop does not execute at all.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than `0`, and we also note the initial value of `i` should be set to `n - 1`.

State: **`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and specific characters, `n` must be greater than 0, `ind` is the index of first occurrence of '[' in `s`, `bind` is -1, `i` is `n - 1`**
