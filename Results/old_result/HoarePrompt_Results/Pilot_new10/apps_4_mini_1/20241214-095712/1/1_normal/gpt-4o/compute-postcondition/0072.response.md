Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and specific characters, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of '[', `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of ']' which is greater than `ind + 1`, `end_colon` is the index of the first occurrence of ':' after `ind` and before `bind`, `start_colon` is the index of the first occurrence of ':' before `end_colon`, and `start_colon` is less than `end_colon`. If the character at index `i` of `s` (where `i` is `start_colon + 1`) is '|', then `pipe_count` is set to 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
