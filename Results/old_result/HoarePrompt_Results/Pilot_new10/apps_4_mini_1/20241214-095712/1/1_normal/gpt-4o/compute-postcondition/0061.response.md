The value of `end_colon` is assigned the value of `i`, which is `ind - 1`. The previous conditions state that `bind` is greater than or equal to `ind`, and `i` is `ind - 1`. The states of the other variables (`s`, `bind`, and `ind`) are not affected. 

Output State: **`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and specific characters, `bind` is greater than or equal to `ind`, `i` is `ind - 1`, and `end_colon` is `ind - 1`.**
