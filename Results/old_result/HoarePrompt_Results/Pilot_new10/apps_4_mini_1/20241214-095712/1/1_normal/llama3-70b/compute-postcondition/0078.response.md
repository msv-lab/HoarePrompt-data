Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length between 1 and 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; if either `ind` is -1 or `bind` is -1, it indicates that no ':' was found after the first '[' or no ':' was found after the last ']', and thus the relevant conditions for `f` and `bind` hold. If `ind` is not -1, and `bind` is not -1, it indicates that both ':' occurrences exist, and if `ind` is greater than or equal to `bind`, the printed value is -1; otherwise, `ans` is calculated as 4 plus the number of '|' characters found in the substring `s[ind + 1:bind]`, or remains 4 if the loop does not execute, with the final value of `ans` printed.***
