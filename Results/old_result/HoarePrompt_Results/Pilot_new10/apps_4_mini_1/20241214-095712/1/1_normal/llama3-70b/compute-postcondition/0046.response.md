The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of length between 1 and 500,000; `n` is at least 1; `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of ':' or -1; `f` is either True or False; `i` is at least 1; `bind` is equal to `i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
