The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state remains consistent with the preconditions as there are no changes in the variable values from the break statement.

Output State: **`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and specific characters, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of '[' in `s`, `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of ']' in `s'` which is greater than `ind + 1`, `i` is `bind - 2`, `end_colon` is equal to `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
