Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length between 1 and 500,000, `n` is the length of `s`, and if `s[1]` is '[', then `ind` remains -1, `f` is True, and `i` is 1. If `s[1]` is not '[', but is ':', then `ind` is updated to 1, `f` remains True, and `i` is still 1, causing the program to break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
