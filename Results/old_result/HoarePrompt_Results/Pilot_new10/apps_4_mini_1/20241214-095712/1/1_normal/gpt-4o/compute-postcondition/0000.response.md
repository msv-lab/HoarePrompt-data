The variable `s` is assigned the value `input()`, where `input` accepts a string input consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], : and |. The length of this string can range from 1 to 500,000 characters. Other variables are not affected, so the output state reflects only the change to `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], : and |, with a length between 1 and 500,000, updated to the value of the input string.**
