According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the indices defined. The loop starts at `start_colon + 1` and goes until `end_colon`, exclusive. 

At the end of the last iteration, `start_colon` is the index of the first occurrence of ':' before `end_colon`. Therefore, if the loop is to execute again, the index `i` needs to be increased by 1. Thus, if we are currently at `i`, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `end_colon`. Therefore, we must ensure that `i + 1` (which will be the new value of `i`) is still less than `end_colon`.

Given that there are no changes made to other variables, we only need to adjust `i`.

State: **`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and specific characters, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of '[', `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of ']' which is greater than `ind + 1`, `end_colon` is the index of the first occurrence of ':' after `ind` and before `bind`, `start_colon` is the index of the first occurrence of ':' before `end_colon`, and `start_colon` is less than `end_colon`, `i` is `start_colon + 1 + 1` (to account for the next iteration).**
