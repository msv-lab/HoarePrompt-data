Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length between 1 and 500,000; `n` is at least 1; `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of ':' or -1; `f` is either True or False; `i` is 0. If the character at index `i` of `s` is ']', no changes occur in the variables. Otherwise, if the character is ':', and if `f` is True, `bind` is set to 0 and the code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[i]` is not ':', no changes occur in the variables.***
