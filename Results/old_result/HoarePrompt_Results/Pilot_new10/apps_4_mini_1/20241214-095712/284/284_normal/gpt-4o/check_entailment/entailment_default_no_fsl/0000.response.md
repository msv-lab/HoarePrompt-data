Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains a significant issue: the placement of the `func_1` definition. In the code, the `func_1` function is defined after it is called within a loop. In Python, this means that when the code first tries to call `func_1`, it will not be recognized because it has not yet been defined. This will result in a `NameError` when `func_1` is invoked at the beginning of the loop.

Furthermore, the logic itself is flawed because it attempts to determine if `n * m + 1` is a prime number for values of `m` ranging from 1 to 1000, but due to the misplaced function definition, it will not execute correctly and thus will not find an appropriate `m` for any `n`.

To illustrate:
1. For any `n`, such as `n = 3`, the expected output according to the problem is `m = 1`, since `3 * 1 + 1 = 4`, which is not a prime number. However, due to the error, the function will not work as intended.
2. The same holds true for any other integer input within the constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000).

In conclusion, the program does not execute correctly and cannot provide a valid output for every potential case, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
