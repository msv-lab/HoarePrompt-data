According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the condition defined by the range. The range for `i` is from 2 to `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`. If the loop is to execute again, `i` must be less than or equal to `int(num ** 0.5)`, and next `i` should be incremented by 1. At the end of the last iteration, we must determine what `i` was.

Since `num` is a positive integer between 9 and 1000 that is not divisible by 2, we need to identify the upper bound for `i`. The loop will continue as long as `i` does not exceed `int(num ** 0.5)`. Therefore, if `i` is the value at the end of the last iteration, for the next iteration, it would be incremented by 1.

To summarize this:

- `num` remains unchanged and still must be a positive integer such that 9 ≤ `num` ≤ 1000 and not divisible by 2 (it can still be any odd integer in that range).
- The value of `i` in the next execution will be incremented by 1 at each iteration.

So, if `i` was `k` at the end of the last iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` should be `k + 1`, and `k + 1` must still be less than or equal to `int(num ** 0.5)`.

Thus, we have:

State: **`num` is a positive integer such that 9 ≤ `num` ≤ 1000 and not divisible by 2, `i` is `k + 1` where `k + 1` must be ≤ `int(num ** 0.5)`**
