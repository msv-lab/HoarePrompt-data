The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `num`. `num` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 1000\). The function evaluates several conditions based on the value of `num` and returns results as follows: 

- If `num` is less than 2, the function returns `False`. 
- Under various other unspecified conditions, the function may return `False`. 
- Lastly, if `num` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2 and all conditions are satisfied, the function returns `True`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `num` and return `False` if `num` is less than 2 or if specific conditions are not met; otherwise, it returns `True` if `num` is 2 or more and satisfies the final conditions. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer num and returns False if num is less than 2 or if specific conditions are not met; otherwise, it returns True if num is greater than or equal to 2.**
