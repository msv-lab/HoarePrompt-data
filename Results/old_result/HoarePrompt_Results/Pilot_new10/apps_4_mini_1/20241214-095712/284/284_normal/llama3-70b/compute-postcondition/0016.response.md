Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `num` and returns `False` if `num` is less than 2 or if it is divisible by any integer from 2 up to the square root of `num`. If neither of these conditions are met, the function returns `True`, indicating that `num` is a prime number. However, the function does not handle the case where `num` is exactly 1, which is not prime but would return `True` due to the current implementation. Thus, the function does not accurately differentiate between prime and non-prime numbers for all valid inputs. **
