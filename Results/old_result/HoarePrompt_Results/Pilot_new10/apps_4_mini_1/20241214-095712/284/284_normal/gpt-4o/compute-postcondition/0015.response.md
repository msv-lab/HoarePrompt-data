According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the product `i * i` compared to `x`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i * i` needs to be less than or equal to `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 11. Thus, `i * i` is 121. Since `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `x` must be greater than or equal to 121 for the loop to execute again. 

From the provided information, `x` is not stated explicitly, but it is currently ensured that `x` is not divisible by either 11 or 13; however, this information does not change the requirement for allowing another iteration of the loop.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time after the last iteration, the state needs to reflect that `x` must be at least 121.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `x` must be greater than or equal to 121, `i` is 11, `x` is greater than or equal to 25, and `x` is not divisible by 11 and `x` is not divisible by 13**
