To determine the correctness of the provided Python program in relation to the problem description, we need to analyze both the requirement and the implementation.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to find an integer \( m \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number for a given positive integer \( n \) (where \( 1 \leq n \leq 1000 \)). It guarantees that such an \( m \) exists within the range \( 1 \leq m \leq 1000 \).

### Program Analysis

1. The program takes an input \( n \) and iterates through integers \( m \) from 1 to 1000.
2. For each \( m \), it computes \( n \cdot m + 1 \) and checks if this value is prime using the function `func_1`.
3. The function `func_1(num)` checks for primality:
   - It returns `False` if `num < 2`, which is correct because prime numbers are greater than 1.
   - It uses trial division up to the square root of `num` to check for factors. If `num` is divisible by any integer in that range, it returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True`.

### Evaluation of Correctness

Now, we need to assess whether the program reliably finds an \( m \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number:

- The loop will check each \( m \) from 1 to 1000 sequentially.
- The function `func_1` correctly identifies whether \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is prime or not.
- It stops as soon as a non-prime number is found, which satisfies the problem requirement.

Given the problem guarantees that at least one \( m \) will exist for which \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not prime, and the program correctly implements the logic to find this \( m \), the program meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Conclusion

Since the logic of the program correctly implements the requirements stated in the problem description and can find a valid counterexample for any provided \( n \), we can conclude:

Correctness: **True**
