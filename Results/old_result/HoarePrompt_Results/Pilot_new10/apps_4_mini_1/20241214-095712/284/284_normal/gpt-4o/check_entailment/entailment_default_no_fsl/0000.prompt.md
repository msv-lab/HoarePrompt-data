You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: PolandBall is a young, clever Ball. He is interested in prime numbers. He has stated a following hypothesis: "There exists such a positive integer n that for each positive integer m number n·m + 1 is a prime number".

Unfortunately, PolandBall is not experienced yet and doesn't know that his hypothesis is incorrect. Could you prove it wrong? Write a program that finds a counterexample for any n.


-----Input-----

The only number in the input is n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — number from the PolandBall's hypothesis. 


-----Output-----

Output such m that n·m + 1 is not a prime number. Your answer will be considered correct if you output any suitable m such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^3. It is guaranteed the the answer exists.


-----Examples-----
Input
3

Output
1
Input
4

Output
2


-----Note-----

A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

For the first sample testcase, 3·1 + 1 = 4. We can output 1.

In the second sample testcase, 4·1 + 1 = 5. We cannot output 1 because 5 is prime. However, m = 2 is okay since 4·2 + 1 = 9, which is not a prime number.
Program:
```
n = int(input())
for m in range(1, 1001):
    if not func_1(n * m + 1):
        print(m)
        break

def func_1(x):
    if x <= 1:
        return False
    if x <= 3:
        return True
    if x % 2 == 0 or x % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= x:
        if x % i == 0 or x % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True


```
Output hints: The function accepts a positive integer `x` and determines if it is a prime number. It returns `False` if `x` is less than or equal to 1, or if it is divisible by 2 or 3. It also returns `False` if it has any divisors between 5 and the square root of `x` that are not multiples of 6 (i.e., checking for divisibility for numbers of the form 6k ± 1). If none of these conditions are met, it returns `True`, indicating that `x` is a prime number.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
