According to the code, the loop executes based on the value of `num`. The loop will iterate starting from `i = 2` up to `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`. 

For the loop to be executable:
1. The value of `num` should be at least 2 to ensure `int(num ** 0.5) + 1` is at least 3, making the loop potentially execute.
2. The variable `i` will start at 2, which is acceptable since `num` is at least 2.

Since the range function will increment `i` until it reaches `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`, and if this value is greater than or equal to 3, the loop will run for at least one iteration.

Thus, for the loop to execute:
- `num` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `num` ≤ 1000 and `num` is greater than or equal to 2.
- `i` will start at 2, and since `num` is at least 2, `int(num ** 0.5) + 1` will be at least 3.

State: **`num` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `num` ≤ 1000 and `num` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2**
