Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not work as expected for all cases. The main issue lies in the way it checks for prime numbers. Specifically, the function `func_1` returns `False` for numbers less than 2, which is correct. However, it only returns `True` for prime numbers and `False` for composite numbers. 

Here is a potential case where the program would fail:

1. If `n` is 1, the first iteration of the loop will calculate `1 * 1 + 1 = 2`, which is prime. The program will then continue to check for `m = 2`, where it calculates `1 * 2 + 1 = 3` (also prime), and so on. All results will yield prime numbers until it reaches `m = 4`, where it would calculate `n * m + 1 = 5` (which is prime) and miss the counterexample: `1 * 6 + 1 = 7`, `1 * 10 + 1 = 11`, etc. 

In fact, for `n = 1`, all values will yield prime numbers until `m = 4`, which could take a long time to discover an `m` that yields a non-prime output, if even within the required range. Furthermore, the program design does not guarantee that it will find a counterexample for all values of `n`, specifically for edge cases, where `n = 1` could lead to a lack of valid output.

Thus, the program does not satisfy the requirements laid out in the problem description. Therefore, I determine that the correctness is **False**.
