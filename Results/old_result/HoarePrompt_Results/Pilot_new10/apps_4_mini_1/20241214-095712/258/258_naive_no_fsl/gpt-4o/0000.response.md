Correctness: **False**

The provided program tries to find the optimal position for the heat source by checking multiple pairs of meat coordinates and their respective hardness to determine where K pieces can be ready to eat within time T. However, there are potential issues with its logic, especially with how it calculates the positions and conditions for when the meat is ready. 

One potential case where the program does not work correctly is when pieces of meat have significantly different hardness values or are widely spaced apart. For instance, if we have:

```
Input:
3 2
0 0 1
100 100 1
200 200 100
```

In this case:
- The first two pieces of meat are far apart but have the same hardness.
- The third piece has a much greater hardness but is also distant from the others.

Given the way the function `func_1` calculates maximum reach based on pairs but does not account for the time it takes for the third piece to become ready (due to its much higher hardness), it may erroneously conclude that K (2) pieces can be ready at the same time when actually they cannot. 

Thus, the function may return True when it should return False, indicating that the program does not handle cases where hardiness disparity leads to incorrect conclusions. This potential edge case shows that the logic does not comprehensively cover all possible configurations and can give incorrect results.
