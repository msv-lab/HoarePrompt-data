Postcondition: ***`meats` remains unchanged; `N` is greater than `i + 3`; `i` is less than `N - 1`; `j` is equal to `i + 3`. If `c1 * T` is less than `c2 * T`, then the values of `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` are updated to the previous values of `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` respectively, while `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` take on the previous values of `x1`, `y1`, and `c1`. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
