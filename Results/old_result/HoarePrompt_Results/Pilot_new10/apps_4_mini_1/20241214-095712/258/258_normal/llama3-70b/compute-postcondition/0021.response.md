The code snippet updates the variable `times` by calling the function `func_2` with the parameters `(x, y, x, y)`. The values of `x` and `y` are both -999 prior to this call. Therefore, `times` will be calculated based on the output of the function `func_2(-999, -999, -999, -999)`.

The initial state indicates that `K` is a positive integer within the range `[1, N]`, and the variable `ans` is updated based on the minimum value between its previous value and `times[K - 1]`. However, we do not have specific details of what `func_2` returns, as it is not provided. Since `times` is an array or collection that will receive the output of `func_2`, we cannot determine its specific values without further context regarding `func_2`.

Thus, we must conclude that while `times` is updated, we do not know its exact content after execution. 

Output State: **`K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `x` is -999, `y` is -999, `times` is updated to the output of `func_2(-999, -999, -999, -999)`, and `ans` is updated to be the minimum between its previous value and `times[K - 1]`.**
