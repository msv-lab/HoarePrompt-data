Postcondition: ***`meats`, `K`, `T`, `N`, `i` remain unchanged; if `c1 * T` is less than `c2 * T`, then `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` are assigned the values of `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` respectively, and `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` are updated to the values of `x1`, `y1`, and `c1`; `count` remains less than `K`, `j` is equal to `i + 1`, and `N` is greater than `i + 1.`***
