In the given code snippet, `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` are assigned values from `meats[j]`. The variable `j` is defined as `i + 2`, which means `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` will take their values based on the elements of the `meats` collection at the index `j`. Since `j` is determined by the value of `i`, we can say that `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` are assigned values from `meats[i + 2]`.

Since `my`, `meats`, `K`, and `N` remain unchanged, and we only need to reflect the effect of the assignment on `x2`, `y2`, and `c2`, we can summarize the output state by showing which new values they are assigned.

Output State: **`my` is equal to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `meats`, `K`, and `N` remain unchanged, `j` is `i + 2`, `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` are assigned values from `meats[i + 2]`.**
