The variable `d2` is assigned the value of `dx * dx + dy * dy`. The variable `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2` and `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`. Therefore, `d2` will be calculated based on those two expressions.

The previous states of the affected variables are:
- `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`
- `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`

The output state reflects the newly calculated value of `d2` while maintaining the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`meats`, `K`, `T`, `N`, `i` remain unchanged; `count` remains less than `K`; `j` is equal to `i + 1`; `N` is greater than `i + 1`; `d` is equal to `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`; `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`; `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`; `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`; `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`; `d2` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2 * (x1 - x2) / 2 + (y1 - y2) / 2 * (y1 - y2) / 2**
