Final: **False**

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not adequately minimize the grilling time as required by the problem description. The program only evaluates discrete integer coordinates for placing the heat source, which may not yield the optimal solution that could exist at fractional coordinates. This limitation was emphasized by the input example provided in the original assessment, where the optimal position could very well be at non-integer locations.

Additionally, while the output hints suggest that the functions utilize the distance calculations as intended, they highlight potential issues with the undefined context of the `meats` variable within `func_2`, which could lead to runtime errors. The hints also indicate that the program does not appropriately handle the case where `K` exceeds the number of pieces calculated by `func_2`, further complicating its correctness.

Overall, the assessment that the program does not meet the requirement to minimize grilling time correctly captures the fundamental flaw in its approach, confirming its incorrectness in accordance with the problem description.
