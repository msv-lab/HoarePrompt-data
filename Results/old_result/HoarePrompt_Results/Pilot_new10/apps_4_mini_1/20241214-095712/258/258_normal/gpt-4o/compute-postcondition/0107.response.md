The variable `dx` is assigned the value of `(x1 - x2) / 2`. The values of `x1` and `x2` are not defined in the initial state, but the expression will calculate `dx` as half the difference between `x1` and `x2`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`meats`, `K`, and `N` remain unchanged; `i` is less than `N`; `j` is equal to `i + 1`; `count` is still less than `K`; `d` is updated to `d / (c1 * c2)`; `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`; `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`; `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`.**
