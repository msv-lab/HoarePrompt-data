The variable `times` is sorted in place. The initial state indicates that `times` is an array that has been assigned the result of the function `func_2(-999, y, -999, y)` for values of `y` iterating from -1000 to 1000. However, the specific values of `times` are not defined in the initial state, and as such, we cannot ascertain the exact order of elements before sorting. The sorting operation will not affect any other variables. 

Output State: **`K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `x` is -999, `y` will be iterated from -1000 to 1000 during the loop, `times` is sorted, and `ans` is the minimum value of `times[K - 1]` across all iterations.**
