To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we must analyze whether it fulfills all requirements outlined in the description.

1. **Understanding the Task**: 
   - The function needs to determine the shortest time required to have K pieces of meat ready for consumption when placing a heat source optimally within specified coordinate bounds.
   - The time for each piece of meat is calculated based on its hardness and the distance from the heat source.

2. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads input for the number of meat pieces (N), the number of pieces Takahashi wants to eat (K), and the coordinates and hardness of each meat piece. It uses a list of tuples to store the meat data.

3. **Core Functionality**:
   - The program uses three functions:
     - `func_1`: calculates the Euclidean distance between the heat source and each piece of meat.
     - `func_2`: computes and returns the time required for each piece of meat to be ready based on the heat source position.
     - `func_3`: iterates through possible heat source coordinates (from -1000 to 1000 for both x and y) and calculates the time for each piece of meat, sorting the times to find the time required for the K-th piece of meat.

4. **Key Observations**:
   - In `func_3`, the times are sorted, and the program finds the K-th minimum time which corresponds to the time taken for the K-th piece of meat to be ready. This is the expected behavior as per the problem, where Takahashi wants K pieces of meat ready in the shortest time.

5. **Identification of Potential Issues**:
   - One potential issue comes from how the coordinates are handled in `func_2`. The function is named inaccurately in the context: it uses `(x, y, X, Y)` but computes time using `X` and `Y` that are mistakenly reused as input coordinates instead of a distinct heat source coordinate.
   - While the input for each heat source position is accepted, the way the list generation in `func_2` utilizes `(x,y)` from the heat source position for calculations, seems incorrect because it's not differentiated clearly from the meat coordinates.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Although the general approach to solving the task is appropriate and follows the logic required to compute minimum grilling time, the misleading parameter usage and potential erroneous assumptions about coordinate handling create confusion and potential inaccuracies in function implementation.
   - Therefore, there can be cases where the sorting and selection of K-th time values do not align with the optimal solution due to the coordinate conflicts as described.

Thus, the program does not strictly meet the problem requirements due to the potential confusion in how input parameters for coordinates are managed and used in computations.

Correctness: **False**
