The function `func_3` accepts no parameters. It computes and returns the minimum value of `times[K - 1]` across all combinations of coordinates `(x, y)` where both `x` and `y` range from -1000 to 1000, provided that `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= K <= N, with `N` being the total number of pieces of meat. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to return the minimum value of `times[K - 1]` based on the specified conditions regarding `K` and coordinate ranges. 

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns the minimum value of `times[K - 1]` across coordinate combinations (x, y) ranging from -1000 to 1000, given that K is a positive integer where 1 <= K <= N.**
