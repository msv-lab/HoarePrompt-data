The `continue` statement does not modify any variables directly; instead, it affects the control flow of the loop by skipping the remaining statements in the current iteration and proceeding to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`meats`, `K`, `N` remain unchanged; `i` is less than `N`; `j` is greater than `i`; `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` maintain their previous values; `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` are set to the previous values of `x2`, `y2`, and `c2`; `c1 * T` still does not hold as greater than or equal to its previous value; `d` is equal to `d / (c1 * c2)` where `d` remains a negative value; the loop continues to the next iteration; `cx` is equal to the previous value of `x2`; `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`; `dx` is 0; `dy` is now equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`; `d2` is equal to `dy * dy`; it holds that `d * d2` is greater than `d2`.**
