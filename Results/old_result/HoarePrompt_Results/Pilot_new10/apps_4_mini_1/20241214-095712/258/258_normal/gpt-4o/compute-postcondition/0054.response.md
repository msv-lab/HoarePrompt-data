The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables; it simply skips the rest of the current iteration of a loop and goes to the next iteration if there is one. The conditions and values of the variables `meats`, `K`, `T`, `N`, `count`, `j`, `c1`, `c2`, and `d` remain unchanged as well.

Output State: **`meats`, `K`, `T`, `N` remain unchanged; `count` is greater than or equal to `K`; `j` is equal to `i + 2`; `N` is greater than or equal to `j`; `c1 * T < c2 * T`; `d` is equal to `c1 * T - c2 * T`, which is a negative value.**
