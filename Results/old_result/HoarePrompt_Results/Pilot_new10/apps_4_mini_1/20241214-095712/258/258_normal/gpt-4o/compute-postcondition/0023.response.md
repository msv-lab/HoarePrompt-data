To analyze the final output state of the loop, consider the following:

- The loop iterates `N` times, where `N` is an integer ranging from 1 to 60. Therefore, the loop will always execute a number of times equal to `N`.
- In each iteration, three values are extracted from the `data` list using the current `index`, specifically `data[index]`, `data[index + 1]`, and `data[index + 2]`, which correspond to `x`, `y`, and `c`.
- After each iteration, the `index` is incremented by 3, leading to updated values for `index` after all iterations.
- As `N` is a known count of iterations, the final values for `meats`, `index`, `x`, `y`, and `c` can be determined through a simple calculation.

Let's summarize the final output state of the loop after all iterations:

- `meats` will contain `N` tuples, each tuple consisting of the extracted values `(x, y, c)` from the `data` list. Thus, it will have the form `[(int(data[2]), int(data[3]), int(data[4])), ..., (int(data[3N-1]), int(data[3N]), int(data[3N+1]))]`.
- The final value of `index` after `N` iterations will be `2 + 3 * N` (beginning at 2 and accounting for three additional indices used in each iteration).
- The values of `x`, `y`, and `c` correspond to the last tuple added to `meats`, which will be `int(data[3N-3])`, `int(data[3N-2])`, and `int(data[3N-1])` respectively.

With that in mind, the overall output state after the loop finishes executing will be:

Output State: **`N` is between 1 and 60; `K` is between 1 and `N`; `meats` contains `N` tuples of the form `(int(data[2]), int(data[3]), int(data[4])), ..., (int(data[3N-3]), int(data[3N-2]), int(data[3N-1]))`; `data` is a list of strings from the input; `index` is `2 + 3 * N`; `x` is equal to `int(data[3N-3])`; `y` is equal to `int(data[3N-2])`; `c` is equal to `int(data[3N-1])`.**
