The variable `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`, where `data` is a list of strings and `index` is 2. The specific value of `data[index]` depends on the contents of the list of strings at that position, but `data` remains unaffected. Since `N` and `K` are variables specifying range constraints and are unchanged by this code, the output should reflect that `x` is now an integer parsed from the string at `data[2]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 1 and 60, `K` is between 1 and `N`, `meats` is an empty list, `data` is a list of strings from the input, `index` is 2, and `x` is an integer derived from `data[2]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 1 and 60, `K` is between 1 and `N`, `meats` is an empty list, `data` is a list of strings from the input, `index` is 2, and `x` is equal to `int(data[2])`.**
