The variable `ans` is assigned the value `float('inf')`, which represents positive infinity in Python. This assignment does not affect the other existing variables, such as `K`, `N`, `x`, or `y`. Therefore, all conditions about `K`, `N`, `x`, and `y` remain valid.

Output State: **`K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, where `N` is the total number of pieces of meat; `x` and `y` are integers ranging from -1000 to 1000; `ans` is positive infinity.**
