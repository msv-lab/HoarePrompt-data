The value of `index` is incremented by 3, updating its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated value will depend on the previous value of `index`, which was 10 before execution.

Output State: **`N` is between 10 and 60; `K` is between 1 and `N`; `meats` contains additional tuple `(x, int(data[11]), c)` which now includes `(int(data[10]), int(data[11]), int(data[12]))`; `data` is a list of strings from the input; `index` is 13; `x` is equal to `int(data[10])`; `y` is equal to `int(data[11])`; `c` is equal to `int(data[12])`.**
