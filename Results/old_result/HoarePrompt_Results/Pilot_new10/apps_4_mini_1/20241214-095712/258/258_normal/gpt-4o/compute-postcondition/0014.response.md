The variable `c` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 2])`, where `index` is currently `6`. This means `c` will have the value of `int(data[8])`. The value of `N`, `K`, `meats`, `data`, and `index` remain unchanged after this assignment.

Output State: **`N` is between 6 and 60; `K` is between 1 and `N`; `meats` now contains one tuple `(x, y, c)`; `data` is a list of strings from the input; `index` is 6; `x` is equal to `int(data[6])`; `y` is equal to `int(data[7])`; `c` is equal to `int(data[8])**.
