The `continue` statement does not change any variable values or create any new assignments; instead, it skips the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop (which is not visible from the provided code snippet) and continues with the next iteration of that loop.

Since `meats`, `K`, `T`, `N`, and the other variables remain unchanged in this context, we can conclude that the output state is focused on the unchanged variables while noting that the execution flow has moved to the next iteration in the loop structure.

Output State: **`meats`, `K`, `T`, `N` remain unchanged; `count` is greater than or equal to `K`; `j` is equal to `i + 2`; `N` is greater than or equal to `j`; `c1 * T < c2 * T`; `d` is updated to a smaller negative value; `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`; `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`; `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`; `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`; `d2` is equal to `(dx * dx + dy * dy)` and we proceed to the next iteration of the loop.**
