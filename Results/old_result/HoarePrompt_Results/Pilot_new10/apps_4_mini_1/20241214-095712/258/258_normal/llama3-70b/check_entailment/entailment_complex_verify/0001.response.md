The original assessment concluded that the program's correctness is **False** primarily due to the program's reliance on a brute-force approach that only evaluates integer values for the coordinates of the heat source. This is indeed a significant concern because the optimal placement of the heat source could require it to be in between the integer coordinates, which is not being considered in this approach. The sample input provided also highlights a situation where the optimal position could very well be a fractional coordinate, which the program could miss entirely.

The annotations indicate that while there are logical operations performed correctly for distance calculations and contributions based on the available data, the fundamental issue of not evaluating potential optimal solutions that lie between integers remains unaddressed. Moreover, `func_2` relies on a global variable `meats`, which is discouraged in terms of code structure and might lead to issues in larger contexts or changes in code structure.

Considering all the evidence from the problem description, the original assessment stands validated because:

1. The assumption that the optimal heat source position could be at non-integer coordinates is explicitly demonstrated by the provided sample input and output.
2. The method taken in `func_3` inherently ignores the infinite possibilities in real-valued placements for optimum time minimization.
3. The assessment correctly identifies flaws in handling the requirements of the problem and acknowledges the risk of `NameError` in `func_2`.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description effectively.

Final: **False**
