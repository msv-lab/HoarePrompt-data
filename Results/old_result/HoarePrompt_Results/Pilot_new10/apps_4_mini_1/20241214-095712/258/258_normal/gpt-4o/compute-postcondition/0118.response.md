The variable `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` are assigned the values from the `meats` list at index `i`. The variables `my`, `meats`, `K`, and `N` are unchanged. The variable `j` has the value `i + 2`, and it is specified that `N` must be greater than `i + 2`, which confirms that the assignment can be safely performed. 

Output State: **`my` is equal to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2, `meats`, `K`, and `N` remain unchanged, `j` is `i + 2`, `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` are assigned values from `meats[i]`.**
