According to the code, the loop iterates over a range defined by the variable `y`, which starts at -1000 and goes up to 1000. The current value of `y` at the end of the last iteration is -999. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `y` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, the next value of `y` will be -998.

The loop will continue to execute until `y` reaches 1000. Since the loop has not yet reached this upper limit, it can execute again.

State: **`K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `x` is -998, `y` is -998, `times` is sorted, and `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]**
