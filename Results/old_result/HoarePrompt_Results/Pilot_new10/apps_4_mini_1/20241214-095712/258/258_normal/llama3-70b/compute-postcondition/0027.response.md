The code assigns `ans` the minimum value between its current value and the value at the index `K - 1` of the sorted list `times`. Since `K` is a positive integer such that `1 <= K <= N`, `times[K - 1]` is valid and falls within the bounds of the sorted list. The value of `ans` is updated if `times[K - 1]` is smaller than the current value of `ans`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `x` is -999, `y` is -998, `times` has been sorted in ascending order, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `times[K - 1]`.**
