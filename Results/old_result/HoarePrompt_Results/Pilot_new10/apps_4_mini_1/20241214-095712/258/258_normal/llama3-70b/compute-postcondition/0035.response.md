The value of `times` is assigned the result of the function `func_2(x, y, x, y)`, where `x` is -998, and `y` is -999. The output of this function is not known without additional information about its implementation, but it will replace the previous value of `times`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged; `K` still satisfies the condition of being a positive integer between 1 and `N`, and `ans` is still the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`.

Output State: **`K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `x` is -998, `y` is -999, `times` is the result of `func_2(-998, -999, -998, -999)`, and `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]**
