The code `continue` is a control flow statement that does not change any variable directly but rather skips the current iteration of a loop, proceeding to the next iteration. However, since there is no specific loop context provided in the initial state, the impact of this command remains abstract.

Given this, the values of the other variables remain unchanged as `continue` merely causes a transition to the next pass through an iteration without any change in variable states. 

Output State: **`meats` remains unchanged; `N` is greater than `i + 3; `i` is less than `N - 1; `j` is equal to `i + 3; `d` is now `d` divided by (c1 * c2); `cx` is equal to (x1 + x2) / 2; `cy` is equal to (y1 + y2) / 2; `dx` is equal to (x1 - x2) / 2; `dy` is equal to (y1 - y2) / 2; `d2` is equal to ((x1 - x2)² + (y1 - y2)²) / 4.**
