The variable `c` is assigned the value `int(data[index + 2])`. The current value of `index` is `2`, so `index + 2` equals `4`, which means `c` will take the integer value of `data[4]`. The initial state remains valid for other variables, including `N`, `K`, `meats`, `data`, `x`, and `y`. 

Output State: **`N` is between 1 and 60; `K` is between 1 and `N`; `meats` is an empty list; `data` is a list of strings from the input; `index` is 2; `x` is equal to `int(data[2])`; `y` is equal to `int(data[3])`; `c` is equal to `int(data[4])`.**
