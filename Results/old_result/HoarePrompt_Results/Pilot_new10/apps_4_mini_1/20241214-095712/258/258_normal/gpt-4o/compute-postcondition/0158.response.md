Postcondition: ***`meats` and `K` remain unchanged, `N` is greater than 1, `i` is less than `N - 1`, and `j` is equal to `i + 1`. If `d * d2` is greater than `d2`, then `d` is updated to the previous value of `d` divided by `(c1 * c2)`, with `d` remaining negative; `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`, and `d2` is equal to `dx * dx + dy * dy`.***
