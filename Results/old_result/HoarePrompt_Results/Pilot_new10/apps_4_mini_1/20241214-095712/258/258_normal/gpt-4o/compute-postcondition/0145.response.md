Postcondition: ***`meats` and `K` remain unchanged, `N` is greater than `1`, `i` is less than `N - 1`, `j` is `i + 1`. If `c1 * T < c2 * T`, then `x1` is assigned the value of `x2`, `y1` is assigned the value of `y2`, `c1` is assigned the value of `c2`, and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are assigned the previous values of `x1`, `y1`, `c1` respectively, ensuring that the condition `c1 < c2` remains satisfied.***
