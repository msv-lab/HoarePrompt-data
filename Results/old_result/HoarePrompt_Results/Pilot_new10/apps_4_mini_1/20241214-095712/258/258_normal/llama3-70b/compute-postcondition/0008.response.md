The `times.sort()` function sorts the list `times` in ascending order. The previous values of `times` have not been specified, but since it is called by `func_2(x, y, x, y)`, it will be an array that contains values resulting from that function call. `ans` is then assigned the value of the `K-1` index of the sorted `times`.

The action of sorting does not change the values of `K`, `x`, `y`, or `ans`, except that `times` is reordered. Therefore, the output state remains focused on the sorting action:

Output State: **`K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`; `x` is -1000; `y` is -999; `times` is sorted; `ans` is equal to `times[K - 1]` after sorting.**
