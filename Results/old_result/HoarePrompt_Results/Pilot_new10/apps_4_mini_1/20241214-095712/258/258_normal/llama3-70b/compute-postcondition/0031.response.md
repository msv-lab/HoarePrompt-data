The variable `times` is assigned the result of the function `func_2`, which takes the arguments `x`, `y`, `x`, and `y`. The values of `x` and `y` are -998 and -1000, respectively. The impact is that `times` becomes a list containing at least `K` sorted elements based on the implementation of the `func_2` function. Since we do not have information on what `func_2` returns, we can only note that `times` will now contain elements derived from `x` and `y`.

The previous requirements about `K`, `x`, `y`, `times`, and `ans` remain valid, while `times` is now updated.

Output State: **`K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `x` is -998, `y` is -1000, `times` is updated to the result of func_2(x, y, x, y), `ans` is the minimum value of `times[K - 1]` over iterations of `y`.**
