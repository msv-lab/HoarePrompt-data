To analyze the impact of the code:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `N` is between 1 and 60.
   - `K` is between 1 and `N`.
   - `meats` is an empty list.
   - `data` is a list of strings obtained from input.
   - `index` is 2.
   - `x` is equal to `int(data[2])`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - `y = int(data[index + 1])`: 
     - Here, `index + 1` evaluates to `3`.
     - Thus, `y` is assigned the value of `int(data[3])`.

3. **Potential Implications**:
   - The value of `y` will depend on the contents of the list `data` and specifically `data[3]`.
   - The other variables (`N`, `K`, `meats`, `data`, `index`, `x`) remain unchanged.

Assuming the input and lists are structured correctly, the code will assign an integer value to `y`, which corresponds to the fourth element in the `data` list after converting it to an integer.

Output State: **`N` is between 1 and 60; `K` is between 1 and `N`; `meats` is an empty list; `data` is a list of strings from the input; `index` is 2; `x` is equal to `int(data[2])`; `y` is equal to `int(data[3])`.**
