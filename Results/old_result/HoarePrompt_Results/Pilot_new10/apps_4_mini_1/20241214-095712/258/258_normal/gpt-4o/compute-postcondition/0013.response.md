The variable `y` is assigned a new value `int(data[index + 1])`. The previous value of `y` was taken from `int(data[3])`, but now it will be updated to `int(data[7])` (since `index` is 6). The other variables remain unchanged, but we note that `y` is now equal to `int(data[7])`. 

Output State: **`N` is between 6 and 60; `K` is between 1 and `N`; `meats` now contains one tuple `(x, y, c)`; `data` is a list of strings from the input; `index` is 6; `x` is equal to `int(data[6])`; `y` is equal to `int(data[7])`; `c` is equal to `int(data[4])**
