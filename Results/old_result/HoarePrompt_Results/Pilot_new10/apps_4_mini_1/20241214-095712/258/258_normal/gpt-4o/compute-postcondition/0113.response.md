To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code that updates the value of `my`.

Given the expression:
```
my = cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2
```

1. The value of `my` is assigned a new value based on the expressions involving `cy`, `dx`, `d2`, and `d`.
2. The values of `cy`, `dx`, `d2`, and `d` are used in the calculation to update `my`.
3. Since the other specified variables (such as `meats`, `K`, and `N`) are mentioned to remain unchanged, their precondition values will still be valid after execution.

Therefore, the output state reflects the new computed value of `my`, while retaining the unchanged state of other variables as specified.

Output State: **`my` is equal to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`; `meats`, `K`, and `N` remain unchanged.**
