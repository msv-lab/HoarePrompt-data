Postcondition: ***`meats` remains unchanged; `K` remains unchanged; `N` remains unchanged; `i` is less than `N`; `j` is greater than `i`; `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` are set to previous values of `x2`, `y2`, and `c2`; `c1 * T` still does not hold as greater than or equal to its previous value; `d` remains a negative value after calculation; the loop continues to the next iteration; `cx` is equal to the previous value of `x2`; `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`; `dx` is 0; `dy` is now equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`; `d2` is equal to `dy * dy`; `d * d2` is greater than `d2`; `mx` is equal to `previous value of x2 + (dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2)`; `my` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`; `count` is less than `K`, indicating the condition for `count` is not met.***
