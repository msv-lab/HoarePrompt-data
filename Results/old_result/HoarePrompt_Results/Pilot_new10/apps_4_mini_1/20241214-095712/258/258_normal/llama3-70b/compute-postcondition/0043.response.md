Output State: **`K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `x` is 1000, `y` is 1000, `ans` is the minimum value of `times[K - 1]` across all combinations of `x` and `y` ranging from -1000 to 1000, and `times` is a list containing sorted values generated from the function calls for all values of `x` and `y` from -1000 to 1000.**
