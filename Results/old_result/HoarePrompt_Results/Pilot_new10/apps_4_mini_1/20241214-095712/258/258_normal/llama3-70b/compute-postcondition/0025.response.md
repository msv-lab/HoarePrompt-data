To evaluate the impact of the code snippet provided, let's analyze the components step by step. 

- The variable `times` is assigned the value returned from the function `func_2(x, y, x, y)`, where `x` is -999 and `y` is -998. The behavior of `func_2` is unknown, but the output will assign an entirely new value to `times`.
  
- The variable `ans` is updated in a prior context to be the minimum between its previous value and `times[K - 1]`. However, we do not know what `ans` was previously, nor do we know whether `K` properly indexes into the array returned by `func_2` given that 1 <= `K` <= `N` and `times` is assumed to be sorted.

Since only `times` is reassigned in the code, and since it is uncertain what the output or behavior of `func_2` is, we will indicate the adjustment of the state for `times` but retain the ambiguity around `ans` and assume that it is potentially updated but its new value can't be determined without knowing the specifics of `func_2`.

Thus, the output state reflects only the change to `times`.

Output State: **`K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `x` is -999, `y` is -998, `times` is the output of `func_2(x, y, x, y)`.**
