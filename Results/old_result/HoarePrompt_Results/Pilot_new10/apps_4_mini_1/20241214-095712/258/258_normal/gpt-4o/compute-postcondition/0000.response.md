The `data` variable is assigned the value of `input().split()`, which means it will contain a list of strings. This action does not modify the values of the existing variables `N`, `K`, or `meats`, which remain unchanged, but now `data` will hold the input values split into a list.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 60, `K` is an integer between 1 and N, `meats` is a list of tuples each containing three integers (x_i, y_i, c_i), and `data` is a list of strings from the input.**
