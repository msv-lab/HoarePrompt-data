In the provided code, `cx` is assigned the value of the average of `x1` and `x2`. Since there is no condition affecting `x1` or `x2`, and there are no changes to the other variables, we keep the existing state of the variables that remain unchanged or unaffected. 

Output State: **`meats`, `K`, `T`, `N`, `i` remain unchanged; `count` remains less than `K`; `j` is equal to `i + 1`; `N` is greater than `i + 1`; `d` is equal to `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`; `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`**.
