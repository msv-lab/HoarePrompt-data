To determine the correctness of the given Python program, I'll analyze both the problem description and the provided code annotations.

### Problem Description Summary:
The program aims to find the optimal placement of a heat source on a 2D plane to grill K or more pieces of meat, minimizing the time required for them to be ready. The grilling time for a piece of meat is determined by both its hardness and the distance to the heat source.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(x, y, X, Y)`**:
   - This function correctly calculates the Euclidean distance between a piece of meat's coordinates (x, y) and the heat source coordinates (X, Y). It directly aligns with the problem description.

2. **Function `func_2(x, y, X, Y)`**:
   - This function intends to compute the grilling times for all pieces of meat from a specific heat source's position `(x, y)`. However, the annotation indicates a potential issue. The `meats` list is referenced but is not passed as a parameter or properly scoped, which could lead to a `NameError` if the `meats` variable wasn't defined globally.

3. **Function `func_3()`**:
   - The function iterates over possible integer coordinates from -1000 to 1000 for the heat source, calling `func_2()` to get the grilling times for each position. It sorts these times and finds the minimum time required for the K-th piece, which matches the problem requirement of needing K pieces ready to eat.
   - However, the annotations highlight that there is an assumption that `times[K - 1]` will always be valid. If fewer than K pieces of meat can be grilled for some heat source positions, this may lead to an `IndexError` due to insufficient elements in `times`. 

### Edge Cases:
- If the only way to grill K pieces is at a certain heat source position that doesnâ€™t exist or where fewer than K pieces can be ready, the program may not handle this situation effectively. This indicates potential failure to satisfy the problem constraints in all scenarios.

### Conclusion:
Since there's a clear indication from the annotations and code structure that the program may run into issues (specifically with a `NameError` in `func_2` and the potential for an `IndexError` when accessing `times[K-1]`), the program does not meet the requirements set forth in the problem description for every potential case.

Therefore, the conclusion is:

Correctness: **False**

The program fails to handle all edge cases, particularly where the grilling times array might not contain enough elements to return the K-th ready time. Additionally, there is incorrect scoping for the variable `meats`, which can lead to exceptions.
