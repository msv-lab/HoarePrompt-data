The value of `cy` is assigned the value of `(y1 + y2) / 2`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `meats`, `K`, `T`, `N`, `i` remain unchanged; `count` remains less than `K`; `j` is equal to `i + 1`; `N` is greater than `i + 1`; `d` is equal to `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`; `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`; `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`.

Output State: **`meats`, `K`, `T`, `N`, `i` remain unchanged; `count` remains less than `K`; `j` is equal to `i + 1`; `N` is greater than `i + 1`; `d` is equal to `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`; `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`; `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`.**
