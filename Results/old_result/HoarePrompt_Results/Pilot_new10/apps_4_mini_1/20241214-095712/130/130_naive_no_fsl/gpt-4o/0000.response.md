To assess the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to evaluate if it correctly calculates the minimum number of coins each friend must gift, while adhering to the stipulations laid out.

### Conditions from the problem description:
1. All gifts must consist of different coins.
2. Each of Ivan's friends must give the same number of coins.
3. At least \( L \) coins gifted must be new to Ivan's collection.

### Analysis of the program:
1. It first calculates `min_x` as the minimum number of coins each friend should give, which is determined by the formula:
   \[
   \text{min_x} = \left\lceil \frac{L}{M} \right\rceil = \frac{L + M - 1}{M}
   \]
   This ensures that at least \( L \) new coins are given overall (because \( M \times \text{min_x} \geq L \)).
   
2. The next condition checks if the total number of coins given \( M \times \text{min_x} \) is less than or equal to the total number of new coins available \( N - K \):
   \[
   M \times \text{min_x} \leq N - K
   \]
   If this condition is satisfied, it outputs `min_x`, otherwise `-1`.

### Edge cases to consider:

1. **When Ivan already has all coins**: If \( K = N \), then there are no new coins to give. In this case, even if \( M \) and \( L \) are greater than 0, \( \text{min_x} \) would still have to be calculated, and the output should be `-1` as no new coins exist.
   
   Example: \( N = 10, M = 5, K = 10, L = 1 \)
   Expected Output: `-1` (but the program might not handle this correctly)

2. **When the number of friends exceeds the total types of coins**: For instance, if \( N < M \), it is impossible to meet the gifting conditions as friends cannot provide unique coins.
   
   Example: \( N = 5, M = 6, K = 0, L = 1 \)
   Expected Output: `-1` (should fail but might output some number incorrectly)

Analyzing cases where the friends cannot fulfill the gifting conditions should yield `-1` based on the rules. In both cases above, according to the program's logic, it may not produce the expected result.

### Conclusion:
- Given the provided code does not correctly handle cases like when Ivan already possesses all types of coins or when the number of friends exceeds unique coin types, there are valid inputs where the code would fail to meet the problem's conditions.
  
Correctness: **False**
