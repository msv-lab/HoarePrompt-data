To determine the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description and the provided output hints, we need to analyze the requirements and how the code addresses them.

### Problem Requirements:

1. **N**: Total number of different coins.
2. **M**: Number of Ivan's friends.
3. **K**: Number of coins Ivan currently has.
4. **L**: Minimum number of new coins that must be added to Ivan's collection through gifts.

The program must find the minimum number of coins (let's call it `x`) that each of Ivan's friends needs to gift, such that:

- All friends gift the same number of coins.
- All gifted coins must be unique.
- At least `L` of the gifted coins must be new to Ivanâ€™s collection.

### Analyzing the Code:

```python
def func():
    (N, M, K, L) = map(int, input().split())
    if M >= N - K + 1 and M >= L:
        print(1)
    else:
        print(-1)
```

1. **Condition 1 Check**: `M >= N - K + 1`
   - This condition checks if the number of friends `M` is at least enough to cover the total number of unique coins that can be presented minus the coins Ivan already has. 
   - If Ivan has `K` coins, the maximum unique coins he can receive is `N - K`. So, they need at least `M` friends to give `N - K + 1` unique coins.

2. **Condition 2 Check**: `M >= L`
   - This confirms that the number of friends `M` should be at least `L` to meet the goal of new coins.

### Evaluation of the given examples:

1. **Example 1**: Input: `20 15 2 3`
   - M = 15, N - K + 1 = 20 - 2 + 1 = 19
   - The first condition does not hold (`15 < 19`), so the output would be `-1`, which is incorrect as it does not partially satisfy the constraints.
   
2. **Example 2**: Input: `10 11 2 4`
   - M = 11, N - K + 1 = 10 - 2 + 1 = 9
   - The first condition does not hold (`11 < 9`), so the output would be `-1`, which is correct.

### Edge Cases:

- If `L` is greater than `M`, it is impossible to meet the minimum requirement as not enough friends are there.

### Conclusion:

The logic in the provided code does not comprehensively cover all cases that can exist. For instance:

- It may print `1` when `M` is enough only to reach the condition for new coins but violates uniqueness when not enough unique coins can be gifted. 

After this analysis, for some combinations of `N`, `M`, `K`, `L`, the program will not function correctly.

### Final Verdict:
Correctness: **False** 

The program fails to meet the requirements in all scenarios, specifically when it misjudges the quantity of unique coins based on the existing collection.
