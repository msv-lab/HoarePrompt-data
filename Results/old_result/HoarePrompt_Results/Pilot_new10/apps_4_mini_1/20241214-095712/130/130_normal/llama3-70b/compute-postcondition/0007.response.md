Functionality: ** The function accepts input of four positive integers N, M, K, and L from standard input. It checks if M is greater than or equal to N - K + 1 and M is also greater than or equal to L. If both conditions are satisfied, it prints 1; otherwise, it prints -1. There are no return values. **
