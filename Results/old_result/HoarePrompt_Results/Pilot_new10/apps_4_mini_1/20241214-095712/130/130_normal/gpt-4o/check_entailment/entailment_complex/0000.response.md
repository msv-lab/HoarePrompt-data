To determine the correctness of the program against the problem description, let's analyze both closely.

### Problem Description
The problem specifies that:
1. Ivan has `K` coins and wants to receive new coins as gifts from `M` friends.
2. Each friend must give the same number of coins.
3. All coins given must be different.
4. At least `L` of the gifted coins must be new to Ivan.

The constraints are:
- There are `N` different collectible coins.
- The total coins Ivan's friends give must not exceed the coins that could be potentially new, calculated as `N - K`.
  
The solution involves calculating:
1. The minimum number of coins each friend must gift (`min_x`) so that the total number of new coins is at least `L`.
2. It must also ensure that the total coins given by all friends (`M * min_x`) does not exceed the number of distinct coins available (`N - K`).

### Annotated Program Analysis
The program reads the values of `N`, `M`, `K`, and `L`. Then it performs the following operations:
1. It calculates `min_x` using the formula `(L + M - 1) // M`. This calculation effectively finds the smallest integer `min_x` such that `M * min_x >= L`, ensuring that the total number of new coins is satisfied.
2. It checks if the total coins that can be gifted (`M * min_x`) does not exceed the distinct coins available (`N - K`).
3. It prints `min_x` if the conditions are satisfied; otherwise, it prints `-1` if it is not possible to get enough new coins.

### Evaluation of Cases
Now we evaluate the correctness based on possible cases described in the problem statement:
- If `M * min_x` exceeds `N - K`, it correctly returns `-1`, which meets the condition that not all friends can give different coins.
- If `M` is too large and there are not enough coins (i.e., the number of distinct coins `N` is less than `M`), the program would handle this correctly, as it will fall into the case of returning `-1`.

### Conclusion
The program effectively calculates both requirements outlined in the problem statement. It correctly determines whether it is possible to satisfy all terms and calculates the minimum number of coins each friend has to contribute if possible. Additionally, it can handle the constraints of large numbers (up to `10^18`) appropriately.

Thus, the program will always meet the requirements for all potential inputs, as each part of the algorithm addresses the constraints and needs specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
