Final: **True** 

The original assessment accurately outlined the correctness of the program based on the problem description and the logical flow of the code. The annotations reinforce the evaluation by confirming that the derived calculations align with the requirements stipulated in the problem statement. Both the derived minimum gifts per friend and the checks against the overall constraints are correctly implemented, ensuring that all conditions regarding gifts are met. The program successfully handles potential edge cases, validating its strength against the outlined scenarios. Thus, the conclusion that the implementation is correct holds true.
