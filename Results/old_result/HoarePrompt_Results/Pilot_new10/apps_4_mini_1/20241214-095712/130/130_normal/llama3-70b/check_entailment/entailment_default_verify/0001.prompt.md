You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Ivan is collecting coins. There are only $N$ different collectible coins, Ivan has $K$ of them. He will be celebrating his birthday soon, so all his $M$ freinds decided to gift him coins. They all agreed to three terms:  Everyone must gift as many coins as others. All coins given to Ivan must be different. Not less than $L$ coins from gifts altogether, must be new in Ivan's collection.

But his friends don't know which coins have Ivan already got in his collection. They don't want to spend money so they want to buy minimum quantity of coins, that satisfy all terms, irrespective of the Ivan's collection. Help them to find this minimum number of coins or define it's not possible to meet all the terms.


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains 4 integers $N$, $M$, $K$, $L$ ($1 \le K \le N \le 10^{18}$; $1 \le M, \,\, L \le 10^{18}$) — quantity of different coins, number of Ivan's friends, size of Ivan's collection and quantity of coins, that must be new in Ivan's collection.


-----Output-----

Print one number — minimal number of coins one friend can gift to satisfy all the conditions. If it is impossible to satisfy all three conditions print "-1" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
20 15 2 3

Output
1
Input
10 11 2 4

Output
-1


-----Note-----

In the first test, one coin from each friend is enough, as he will be presented with 15 different coins and 13 of them will definitely be new.

In the second test, Ivan has 11 friends, but there are only 10 different coins. So all friends can't present him different coins.
Program:
```
def func():
    (N, M, K, L) = map(int, input().split())
    if M >= N - K + 1 and M >= L:
        print(1)
    else:
        print(-1)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the logic against the problem description and various edge cases.

The conditions to determine if the friends can gift coins correctly are:

1. Each friend must gift the same number of coins.
2. All coins gifted must be different.
3. At least `L` coins must be new to Ivan's collection.

The provided program checks:

1. If the number of friends `M` is greater than or equal to the total number of different coins minus those Ivan already has plus one (`N - K + 1`). This checks not only if all friends can give different coins but also ensures that the number of friends is not less than the new required coins.
2. It also checks if the number of friends `M` is greater than or equal to `L`, which ensures the gifts contain at least `L` new coins.

### Analysis of the Conditions

Let's consider a few cases:

- **Case when K = N**: If Ivan has all possible coins (e.g., K = 20, N = 20, regardless of M and L), then he can't receive any new coins, making it impossible for any friends to satisfy the requirement of L new coins. The output should be `-1`, but this is not covered by the combined condition that checks `M >= N - K + 1`.

- **Case when M > N - K**: If there are more friends than unique coins available excluding Ivan's collection, then the program should output `-1`, indicating that it's impossible for each friend to gift different coins. However, the check `if M >= N - K + 1` doesn't fully cover situations where M exceeds the distinct coins available.

- **Minimum quantity check**: The program outputs `1` if the conditions are satisfied, which means it assumes that giving one coin from each friend might suffice. However, if there's a scenario where M friends can't give at least L new coins, the program fails to check adequately.

### Examples That Break the Program
- Input: `20 15 20 3` (Here `K = N`, so Ivan has all coins, thus no new coins can be given, output should be `-1`, but with this code, it evaluates to `1`, which is incorrect.)
  
- Input: `10 11 2 4` (Even if it returns `-1`, it fails the two checks mentioned where it would otherwise return `1` for cases that shouldn't be possible.)

### Conclusion
The program both doesn't handle the case where Ivan has all coins and makes incorrect assumptions about the ability of M friends to gift different types of coins. Thus, for one or more potential cases identified above, the program can deliver incorrect results regarding the problem’s requirements.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts input of four positive integers N, M, K, and L from standard input. It checks if M is greater than or equal to N - K + 1 and M is also greater than or equal to L. If both conditions are satisfied, it prints 1; otherwise, it prints -1. There are no return values. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
