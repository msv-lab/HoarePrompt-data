The code executes a print statement that outputs `-1`. This does not change the values of any of the variables, since they are merely positive integers and the print statement does not modify any variable. Therefore, all the prior conditions remain valid. 

Output State: **`N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` are positive integers. Either `M` is less than `N - K + 1`, or `M` is less than `L`. Value `-1` has been printed.**
