To determine the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, we will analyze the program step by step.

### Problem Description Recap
Ivan has `N` different collectible coins and `K` coins in his collection. His `M` friends must gift him coins that are distinct and must meet the condition that at least `L` of those coins are new to his collection. 

### Key Conditions
1. Each friend must gift the same number of coins.
2. All coins gifted must be distinct.
3. At least `L` of the gifted coins must be new to Ivan's collection.

### Program Analysis
The program calculates `min_x`, which is the minimum number of coins that each friend must gift to ensure at least `L` new coins are provided:
```python
min_x = (L + M - 1) // M
```
This formula essentially rounds up when `L` is not evenly divisible by `M`, ensuring that there's enough total coins gifted collectively to meet the minimum.

Next, it checks if the total number of coins the friends will gift (`M * min_x`) is less than or equal to the total number of coins available that can be given as gifts (`N - K`). If it is, it prints `min_x`, otherwise, it prints `-1`.

### Edge Cases Considered
1. When `N = K` (All collectible coins are already in Ivan's collection) and `L > 0`. In this case, we cannot satisfy the condition of giving at least `L` new coins since there are no available new coins (`N - K = 0`).
2. When `M` is greater than `N - K` or `M` is such that even the maximum distinct coins available can't satisfy the gifting condition.
3. The situation where `M` is 1, and we check if a sufficient number of coins can still be chosen.

### Example Considerations
1. **Input:** `20 15 2 3`
   - `min_x` computes to `1` since `3/15` rounds up to `1`. Therefore `M * min_x = 15` which is less than `N - K = 18`. Correct output is `1`. Works correctly.
   
2. **Input:** `10 11 2 4`
   - `min_x` computes to `1` since `4/11` rounds up to `1`. Thus `M * min_x = 11`, which exceeds `N - K = 8` (because 10 - 2 = 8). Correct output is `-1`. Works correctly.

### Tests for Other Cases
- If we take the case `N = K = 1`, `M = 1`, `L = 1`: 
  - The friends canâ€™t gift any new coins because all collectible coins are already in the collection. Here the program should return `-1`, which it does correctly.
  
- If we take the case `N = 5, K = 3, M = 1, L = 3`: 
  - Similar reasoning applies: `min_x` would compute to `3`, but since only `2` coins can be new (`5 - 3`), the output should be `-1`. The program checks this correctly.

### Conclusion
The program seems to handle all edge cases and conditions mentioned in the problem description properly. After analyzing examples and potential edge cases, we can conclude that the program behaves correctly for all discussed scenarios.

Correctness: **True**. 

The program correctly calculates the minimum number of coins each of Ivan's friends must gift while satisfying all the conditions outlined in the problem statement.
