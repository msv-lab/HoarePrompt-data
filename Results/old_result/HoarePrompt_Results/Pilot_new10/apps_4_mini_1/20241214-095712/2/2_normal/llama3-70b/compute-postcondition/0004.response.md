The variable `i` is initially set to 1. The code calculates the digit sum of `i`, which is the sum of its digits converted to an integer. Since `i` is 1, the string representation of `i` is "1", and the digit sum will be `1`. The value of `digit_sum` will now be `1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, `max_sum` is 0, `max_num` is 0, `i` is 1, `digit_sum` is 1**
