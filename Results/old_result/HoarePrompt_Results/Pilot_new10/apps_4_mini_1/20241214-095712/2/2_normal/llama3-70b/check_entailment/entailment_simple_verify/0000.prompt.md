You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Anton has the integer x. He is interested what positive integer, which doesn't exceed x, has the maximum sum of digits.

Your task is to help Anton and to find the integer that interests him. If there are several such integers, determine the biggest of them. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains the positive integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^18) — the integer which Anton has. 


-----Output-----

Print the positive integer which doesn't exceed x and has the maximum sum of digits. If there are several such integers, print the biggest of them. Printed integer must not contain leading zeros.


-----Examples-----
Input
100

Output
99

Input
48

Output
48

Input
521

Output
499
Program:
```
def func():
    x = int(input())
    max_sum = 0
    max_num = 0
    for i in range(1, x + 1):
        digit_sum = sum((int(digit) for digit in str(i)))
        if digit_sum > max_sum:
            max_sum = digit_sum
            max_num = i
    print(max_num)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not account for cases where the maximum sum of digits occurs for numbers that are not directly the integers in the range from \(1\) to \(x\). For example, if \(x = 521\), the program correctly checks each number, but it fails to recognize that \(499\) has a digit sum of \(22\), while \(500\) or \(521\) with digit sums of \(5\) and \(8\) respectively, are not optimal. 

Here's a simpler example to illustrate the flaw: for \(x = 100\), the program evaluates each number individually but does not recognize that skipping to \(99\) is optimal since the sum of digits is maximized. The logic to examine numbers like \(499\), which can be achieved by effectively manipulating the digits of \(x\), is missing.

Thus, the function does not work correctly for inputs where lower numbers formed by manipulating the digits yield a maximum digit sum compared to higher numbers.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^18.
def func():
    x = int(input())
    max_sum = 0
    max_num = 0
    for i in range(1, x + 1):
        digit_sum = sum(int(digit) for digit in str(i))
        
        if digit_sum > max_sum:
            max_sum = digit_sum
            max_num = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `max_sum` is the maximum digit sum obtained from any number between 1 and `x`, `max_num` is the corresponding number for that maximum digit sum, `x` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18.
    print(max_num)


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
