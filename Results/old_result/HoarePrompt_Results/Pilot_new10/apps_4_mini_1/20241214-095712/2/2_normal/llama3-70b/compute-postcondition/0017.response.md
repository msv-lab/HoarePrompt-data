The value of `max_num` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 3. Thus, `max_num` changes from 2 to 3 as a result of this assignment. The other variables remain unchanged. The initial conditions that are still valid after the execution are also included. 

Output State: **`digit_sum` is 3, `max_sum` is 3, `max_num` is 3, `i` is 3, `x` must be greater than or equal to 3**
