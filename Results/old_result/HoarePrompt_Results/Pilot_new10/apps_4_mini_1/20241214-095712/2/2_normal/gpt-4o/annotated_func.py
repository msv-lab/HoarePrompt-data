#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18.
def func_1(n):
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))
    #The program returns the sum of the digits of the positive integer n, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) and returns the sum of its digits. It does not handle cases where `n` is outside the specified range, but for the valid input range, it correctly computes the digit sum.
