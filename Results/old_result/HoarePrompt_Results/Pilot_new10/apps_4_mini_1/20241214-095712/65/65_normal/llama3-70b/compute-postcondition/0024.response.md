The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `s`. The parameter `n` is an integer representing the number of balloons, constrained to be between 1 and 100. The parameter `k` is an integer representing the number of friends, also constrained to be between 1 and 100. The parameter `s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, which represents the colors of the balloons and has a length equal to `n`. 

After executing the function body, the return value is the number of balloons each friend receives, based on the distribution of color representations in the string `s` and the number of friends `k`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` (the number of balloons), `k` (the number of friends), and `s` (the colors of the balloons as a string). It returns the number of balloons each friend receives based on the given parameters.**
