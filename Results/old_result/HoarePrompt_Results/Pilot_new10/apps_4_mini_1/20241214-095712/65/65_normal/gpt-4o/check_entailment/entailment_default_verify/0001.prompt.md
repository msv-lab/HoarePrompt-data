You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One day Kefa found n baloons. For convenience, we denote color of i-th baloon as s_{i} — lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet. Also Kefa has k friends. Friend will be upset, If he get two baloons of the same color. Kefa want to give out all baloons to his friends. Help Kefa to find out, can he give out all his baloons, such that no one of his friens will be upset — print «YES», if he can, and «NO», otherwise. Note, that Kefa's friend will not upset, if he doesn't get baloons at all.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 100) — the number of baloons and friends.

Next line contains string s — colors of baloons.


-----Output-----

Answer to the task — «YES» or «NO» in a single line.

You can choose the case (lower or upper) for each letter arbitrary.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 2
aabb

Output
YES

Input
6 3
aacaab

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first sample Kefa can give 1-st and 3-rd baloon to the first friend, and 2-nd and 4-th to the second.

In the second sample Kefa needs to give to all his friends baloons of color a, but one baloon will stay, thats why answer is «NO».
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    color_count = {}
    for color in s:
        if color in color_count:
            color_count[color] += 1
        else:
            color_count[color] = 1
    can_distribute = True
    for count in color_count.values():
        if count > k:
            can_distribute = False
            break
    if can_distribute:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to evaluate if it correctly handles all potential cases for distributing balloons to Kefa's friends without upsetting them.

1. **Understanding the Logic:**
   - The program takes input for the number of balloons (`n`) and the number of friends (`k`).
   - It then counts the occurrences of each color of balloons.
   - The program checks if any color appears more times than the number of friends (`k`).
   - If a color appears more than `k` times, he cannot give them out without upsetting at least one friend, and it prints "NO".
   - If all colors appear `k` times or less, it prints "YES".

2. **Edge Case Analysis:**
   - Consider `n = 1` and `k = 1`. If we have one balloon of color 'a', the output "YES" is expected since one balloon can go to one friend.
   - Consider `n = 2` and `k = 1`. If we have two balloons of color 'a', the output should be "NO", as both balloons cannot go to the one friend without upsetting them.
   - If `n > k` but all colors are unique, say `n = 100`, `k = 10` with the input string "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz... (repeated)", the output correctly should be "NO" as some colors would exceed the distribution capacity per friend.

3. **Critical Missing Logic:**
   - The program does not check if the total number of unique colors exceeds the number of friends. For example:
     - If there are 10 unique colors and 9 friends, the output should be "YES" because each friend can get one balloon of different color.
     - If there are 10 unique colors and only 1 friend, the program will incorrectly output "NO" even though the distribution is possible (allcolors to one friend).

**Test Cases:**
- Input `n = 10, k = 5, s = "abcdefghij"`. 
- Correct output should be "YES" since each friend can take two different ones.

Thus, since the program fails to account for situations with unique colors surpassing the number of friends and can lead to incorrect conclusions about the possibility of distribution, it demonstrates that the program is indeed flawed.

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts two integers `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), and a string `s` of lowercase letters representing the colors of `n` balloons. It counts the occurrences of each color in `s` and checks whether it is possible to evenly distribute the balloons among `k` friends, given that no friend should receive more balloons of the same color than available. The function prints 'YES' if distribution is possible and 'NO' otherwise. It assumes that no input validation is performed on the values of `n` and `k`. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
