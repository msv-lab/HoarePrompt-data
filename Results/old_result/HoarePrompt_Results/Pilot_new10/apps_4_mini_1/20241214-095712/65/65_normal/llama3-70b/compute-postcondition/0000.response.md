The values of `n` and `k` are assigned from the input. The function `map(int, input().split())` takes two values from the input, splits them, and converts them to integers. However, the specific values of `n` and `k` are not provided in the initial state and depend on user input, so they remain unspecified in the output state.

The output state will maintain the initial conditions while reflecting that `n` and `k` have been updated based on user input.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer representing the number of baloons, `k` is the input integer representing the number of friends, `s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length n representing the colors of the baloons.**
