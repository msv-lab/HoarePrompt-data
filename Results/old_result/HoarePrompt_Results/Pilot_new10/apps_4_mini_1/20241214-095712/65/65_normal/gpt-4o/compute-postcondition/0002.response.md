`color_count` is initialized as an empty dictionary, which means it will hold key-value pairs related to the count of different colors of balloons based on the inputs processed later in the program. The values of `n`, `k`, and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of balloons (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100), `k` is an integer representing the number of friends (1 ≤ `k` ≤ 100), `s` is an input string, `color_count` is an empty dictionary `{}`.**
