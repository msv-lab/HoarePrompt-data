Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer representing the number of balloons, `k` is an integer representing the number of friends, `s` is a string with at least 1 character, `color` is the first character of `s`, and `color_count` is a dictionary. If `color` is already in `color_count`, its count is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `color` is added to `color_count` with a value of 1.***
