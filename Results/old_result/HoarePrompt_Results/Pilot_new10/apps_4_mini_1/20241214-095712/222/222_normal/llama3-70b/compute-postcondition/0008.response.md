The value of `i` is 2, and `k` is an integer between 0 and 1000. The value of `res` contains 1 and the expression `(k * 2 + 2)`. The code appends the value of `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1` to `res`. 

Calculating the expression:
- The current value of `k` gives the value of `k * 2 + 1` as `2k + 1`.
- Thus, the expression for the appended value becomes: `i * (2k + 1) + 1` which simplifies to `2 * (2k + 1) + 1` equal to `4k + 2 + 1`, which is `4k + 3`.

Therefore, `res` is updated to include this new value.

Since the initial state of `res` already included 1 and `(k * 2 + 2)`, now it will also include `4k + 3`.

Output State: **`n` must be at least `k + 2`, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= `k` <= 1000, `l` must be at least 3, `i` is 2, `res` now contains 1, (k * 2 + 2), and (4k + 3)**.
