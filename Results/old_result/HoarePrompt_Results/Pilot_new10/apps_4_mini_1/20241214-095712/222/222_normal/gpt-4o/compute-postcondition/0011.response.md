To analyze the output state after the while loop completes all its iterations, we start with the given initial state and derive the values step by step based on the loop's logic.

### Initial State:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000)
- `k` is a non-negative integer (0 <= k <= min(n-1, 1000))
- `positions` is an empty list
- `i` is 1

### Loop Code:
```
while i <= n:
    positions.append(i)
    i += 2 * k + 1
```

The loop continues executing as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. With each iteration, `i` is incremented by `2 * k + 1`, and the current value of `i` is appended to the `positions` list.

### Analysis of Output States:

After executing the loop, we determine the end state based on how many times the loop has executed. Let's denote the number of iterations by `m`.

1. **Output State after the loop executes `m` times:**  
   - The value of `i` after `m` iterations will be `1 + m * (2 * k + 1)` based on the update in each iteration.
   - The `positions` list will contain all the values of `i` during the iterations: `positions` will have the elements `[1, 1 + (2 * k + 1), 1 + 2 * (2 * k + 1), ..., 1 + (m - 1) * (2 * k + 1)]`.
   - The loop will continue to execute until `i` no longer satisfies the condition `i <= n`, thus after `m` executions, it must be true that `1 + m * (2 * k + 1) > n`.

From the breakdown, we also conclude:
- The final value of `i` must have surpassed `n` for the loop to stop, which gives us the first condition for `n` regarding `m`. Hence:

2. **Final Values:**
   - The positions list will consist of the first `m` terms.
   - If `n` is less than the smallest odd number that can be achieved through this looping, the positions list will be empty and `i` will have incremented and surpassed `n`.
  
### Conclusion:
Therefore, based on the above evaluations and the preparatory statements, we can state the overall output state after all iterations of the loop have executed.

Output State: **`positions` contains m values which are `1, 1 + (2 * k + 1), 1 + 2 * (2 * k + 1), ..., 1 + (m - 1) * (2 * k + 1)` where `1 + m * (2 * k + 1) > n`, `i` is `1 + m * (2 * k + 1)`, and there are `m` iterations where `m` is the largest integer such that `1 + m * (2 * k + 1) <= n`.**
