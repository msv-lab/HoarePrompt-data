The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters as defined in the signature. However, based on the constraints and relationships, we can infer that it operates with two integer values, `n` and `k`, where `n` is constrained to be between 1 and 1000, and `k` is constrained to be between 0 and 1000. Depending on the implementation details not provided, the behavior of the function may vary. However, since there's no output specified, we cannot describe the return values.

Thus, the form of functionality may be represented as such:

Functionality: **The function operates with integer values `n` and `k`, where `1 <= n <= 1000` and `0 <= k <= 1000`. The function does not accept parameters in its signature.**
