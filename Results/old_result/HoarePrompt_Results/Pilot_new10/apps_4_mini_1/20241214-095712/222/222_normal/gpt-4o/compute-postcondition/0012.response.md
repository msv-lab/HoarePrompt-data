The length of `positions` is printed. Since `positions` contains `m` values based on the given formula, and `m` is defined as the largest integer such that \( 1 + m \cdot (2 \cdot k + 1) \leq n \), the output will be equal to `m`. The states of `n`, `i`, `k`, and `positions` are not changed by the code.

Output State: **`positions` contains `m` values, `i` is `1 + m * (2 * k + 1)`, and the length printed is `m`.**
