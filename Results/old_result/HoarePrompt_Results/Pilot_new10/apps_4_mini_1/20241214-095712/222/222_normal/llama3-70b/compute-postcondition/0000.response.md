The values of `n` and `k` are assigned new values based on the input received from the user. The code map function is used to convert the input values to integers. However, we do not have the specific input values, so we can only state that `n` and `k` will now hold the integers that the user provides, as long as they satisfy 1 <= n <= 1000 and 0 <= k <= 1000.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers as per user input such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000 and 0 <= `k` <= 1000.**
