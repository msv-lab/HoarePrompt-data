The variable `i` is incremented by `2 * k + 1`. Given that `k` is a non-negative integer (ranging from `0` to `min(n-1, 1000)`), the expression `2 * k + 1` will also range from `1` (when `k = 0`) to a maximum of `2001` (when `k` is at its upper limit considering `n`). Therefore, the new value of `i` will be the previous value of `i` (which is `1`) plus `2 * k + 1`. 

The other variables `n`, `k`, and `positions` remain unchanged in this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `k` is a non-negative integer (0 <= k <= min(n-1, 1000)), `positions` is [1], `i` is equal to `1 + (2 * k + 1)`.**
