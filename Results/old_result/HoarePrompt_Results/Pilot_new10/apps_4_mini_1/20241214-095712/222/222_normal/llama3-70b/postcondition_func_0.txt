The function accepts two integers, `n` and `k`, input via standard input, where `1 <= n <= 1000` and `0 <= k <= 1000`. It calculates the integer `l` as the ceiling of `(n + k) / (k * 2 + 1)` and generates a list of length `l`, where each element is calculated based on the formula `(i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1)`. It then prints the value of `l` and the elements of the list `res` as space-separated values. This function does not handle cases where the inputs might violate the specified bounds or provide any type of error feedback for invalid inputs.
