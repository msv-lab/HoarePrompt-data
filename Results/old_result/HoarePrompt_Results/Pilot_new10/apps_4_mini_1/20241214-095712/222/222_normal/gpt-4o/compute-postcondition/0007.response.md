The value of `i` is incremented by `2 * k + 1`. The initial value of `i` is given as `2 * k + 2`. Therefore, after the operation, the value of `i` will be:

i = (2 * k + 2) + (2 * k + 1)
i = 4 * k + 3

The states of the other variables remain unchanged, and their constraints are still valid.

Output State: **`n` must be at least `2 * k + 2`, `k` is a non-negative integer (0 <= k <= min(n-1, 1000)), `positions` is [1, 2 * k + 2], `i` is equal to `4 * k + 3`**
