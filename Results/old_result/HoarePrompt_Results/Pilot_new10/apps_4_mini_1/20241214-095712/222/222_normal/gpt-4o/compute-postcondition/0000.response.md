The variable `positions` is assigned an empty list, which means it now holds no elements. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `k` is a non-negative integer (0 <= k <= min(n-1, 1000)), and `positions` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `k` is a non-negative integer (0 <= k <= min(n-1, 1000)), `positions` is an empty list.**
