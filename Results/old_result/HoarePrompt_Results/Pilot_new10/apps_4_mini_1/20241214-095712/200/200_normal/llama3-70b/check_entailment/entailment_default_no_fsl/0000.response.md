Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for determining when to stop the binary search and check if exactly `s` liters can be poured is flawed.

Here is the reason:

1. The program uses binary search to find the maximum possible volume `low` that can be uniformly distributed among the kegs. However, the condition to check if the total poured equals `s` after determining `low` is not correctly implemented. The program calculates the total capacity drained for `low` but checks the wrong criterion:
    - In the current check: `if sum((min(low, x) for x in v)) != s:`, the code checks if it is equal to `s`, which may lead to returning `-1` incorrectly. 

2. Additionally, the logic for determining if it's impossible to pour `s` liters is misplaced. There is no preceding check to see whether the total liters available in the kegs (`sum(v)`) is less than `s`. If this is the case, the program should immediately return `-1`.

3. For example, consider the input:
   ```
   3 10
   1 2 3
   ```
   Here, the output should be `-1` since it is impossible to pour 10 liters from kegs that only contain 1, 2, and 3 liters. However, the current program would go through the binary search incorrectly.

Thus, since the program does not satisfy the requirements for every potential input case, including the edge cases where it's impossible to pour `s` liters, the correctness cannot be considered true.
