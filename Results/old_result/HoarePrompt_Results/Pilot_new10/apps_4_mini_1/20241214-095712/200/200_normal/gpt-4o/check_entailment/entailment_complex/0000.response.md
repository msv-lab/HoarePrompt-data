Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description in certain scenarios. 

### Explanation of Issues:

1. **Calculation of Available Kvass:** 
   The program first checks if the total volume of kvass in all kegs is less than `s`, and if so, it correctly returns `-1`. However, after fulfilling the required volume `s`, the logic for computing `min_keg_volume` can lead to incorrect results.

2. **Adjustment for Remaining Kvass:**
   The important piece of logic that adjusts `min_keg_volume` based on `remaining_kvass` could result in a minimum keg volume that is less than the lowest initial keg volume if a large enough `remaining_kvass` still exists. Specifically, the line:
   ```python
   min_keg_volume -= (remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n
   ```
   modifies `min_keg_volume` without considering that `min_keg_volume` is initially determined by the lowest keg's volume. It can result in a final volume that is not a feasible solution because it does not ensure the minimum keg volume remains unchanged if it's large enough (w.r.t how much kvass is pulled from the other kegs).

3. **Verification Against Problem Constraints:**
   In cases where `remaining_kvass` is enough to distribute evenly among kegs while still maintaining at least some kvass in all kegs, there is no guarantee that the adjusted `min_keg_volume` will truly represent the minimum volume of kvass left in the least full keg. 

For example, given kegs with volumes `[5, 5, 5]` and needing to pour `s = 6`, according to the logic:

1. The program detects that all kegs are equal.
2. It calculates `min_keg_volume` directly as `5`.
3. The three kegs could allow for the pouring of `5` from any keg and still leave `1` in each.

However, if the adjustment for a remaining `1` is made, it will erroneously compute `min_keg_volume` as `4`, suggesting a minimum would have been reduced, although it is not feasible since no keg could ever fall below the amount initially present.

Thus, the program fails to reliably provide a correct response in all cases, rendering it incorrect. It does not account for how volume reduction affects the least filled keg properly when it overstretches pouring requirements.
