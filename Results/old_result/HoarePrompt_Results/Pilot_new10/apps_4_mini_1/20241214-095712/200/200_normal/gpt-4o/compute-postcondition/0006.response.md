Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer that is set to the input value (1 <= n <= 1000), `s` is a non-negative integer that is set to the input value (1 <= s <= 10^12), `volumes` is a sorted list of integers, `total_volume` is the sum of the elements in the `volumes` list, and the total_volume is greater than or equal to `s`.***
