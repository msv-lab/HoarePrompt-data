Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 1000), a non-negative integer `s` (1 <= s <= 10^12), and a list of `n` integer volumes (1 <= volume_i <= 10^9). It calculates the total volume of the kegs and checks if it is less than `s`. If the total volume is less than `s`, it outputs -1, indicating insufficient kvass. If the total volume is sufficient, it determines the minimum volume of kvass that can be retained from the kegs after taking enough to satisfy `s` and prints this adjusted minimum volume. If too much kvass was required, it adjusts the minimum by subtracting an average amount based on the remaining kvass divided by `n`. The function does not return any values but prints relevant outputs based on the calculations.**
