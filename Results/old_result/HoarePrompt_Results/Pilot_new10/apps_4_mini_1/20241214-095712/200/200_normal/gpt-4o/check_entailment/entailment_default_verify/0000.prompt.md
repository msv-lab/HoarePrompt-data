You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The Fair Nut likes kvass very much. On his birthday parents presented him $n$ kegs of kvass. There are $v_i$ liters of kvass in the $i$-th keg. Each keg has a lever. You can pour your glass by exactly $1$ liter pulling this lever. The Fair Nut likes this drink very much, so he wants to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass. But he wants to do it, so kvass level in the least keg is as much as possible.

Help him find out how much kvass can be in the least keg or define it's not possible to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $s$ ($1 \le n \le 10^3$, $1 \le s \le 10^{12}$) — the number of kegs and glass volume.

The second line contains $n$ integers $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n$ ($1 \le v_i \le 10^9$) — the volume of $i$-th keg.


-----Output-----

If the Fair Nut cannot pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass, print $-1$. Otherwise, print a single integer — how much kvass in the least keg can be.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3
4 3 5

Output
3

Input
3 4
5 3 4

Output
2

Input
3 7
1 2 3

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example, the answer is $3$, the Fair Nut can take $1$ liter from the first keg and $2$ liters from the third keg. There are $3$ liters of kvass in each keg.

In the second example, the answer is $2$, the Fair Nut can take $3$ liters from the first keg and $1$ liter from the second keg.

In the third example, the Fair Nut can't pour his cup by $7$ liters, so the answer is $-1$.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, s) = map(int, input().split())
    volumes = list(map(int, input().split()))
    volumes.sort()
    total_volume = sum(volumes)
    if total_volume < s:
        print(-1)
    else:
        min_keg_volume = volumes[0]
        remaining_kvass = s
        for i in range(n):
            if volumes[i] <= min_keg_volume:
                continue
            else:
                possible_to_take = min(volumes[i] - min_keg_volume, remaining_kvass)
                remaining_kvass -= possible_to_take
            if remaining_kvass == 0:
                break
        if remaining_kvass > 0:
            min_keg_volume -= (remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n
        print(min_keg_volume)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, let’s analyze it step by step and consider potential inputs that could expose flaws in the logic.

### Analysis of the Program
1. The program receives two integers `n` (the number of kegs) and `s` (the total liters of kvass to be poured). 
2. It reads the keg volumes into a list, `volumes`, and sorts them.
3. The program first checks if the total volume of kvass across all kegs is less than `s`. If true, it prints `-1`, which is correct as he cannot pour more kvass than available.
4. It initializes the minimum keg volume with the smallest element from the sorted list.
5. The core logic involves trying to pour from the kegs, accounting for the fact that he wants to maintain the minimum keg volume. For each keg higher than the current minimum, it tries to take kvass until either it runs out or it has taken the required `s` liters.
6. After attempting to pour, if there is remaining kvass needed, the logic decreases the `min_keg_volume` to reflect how much kvass is left after evenly distributing the remaining liters across all kegs.

### Potential Edge Cases
1. **Exact Pour:** What happens if `s` equals the total volume of kvass available? The correct output should be the original minimum of the kegs, but how the remaining logic manages that should be checked.
  
   Example:
   ```
   Input:
   3 12
   4 4 4
   Expected Output: 4
   ```

2. **Too Much Request with Exact Minimums:** If `s` is just 1 liter more than the total volume, it should return `-1`.
   
   Example:
   ```
   Input:
   3 13
   4 4 4
   Expected Output: -1
   ```
   
3. **Insufficient Volumes in High Kegs:** If `s` is feasible, but the kegs do not have enough kvass to maintain the minimum required, this needs testing.

   Example:
   ```
   Input:
   3 5
   1 2 2
   Expected Output: 0 (not -1, as he can still take from kegs)
   ```

After further analysis and testing, I identified that while the program does handle many cases correctly, it can give incorrect outputs on certain scenarios, particularly when cleaning up remaining kvass after exceeding the min keg. The main mistake is how `min_keg_volume` is adjusted after all feasible withdrawals, which may not reflect the correct remaining kvass levels.

### Conclusion
Based on the logic analysis and the proposed edge cases where the program may return the incorrect answer, I conclude:

Correctness: **False**. 

Specific issues include managing the scenario where total kvass equals `s` and incorrectly adjusting the min volume leading to incorrect outputs in edge cases.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 1000), a non-negative integer `s` (1 <= s <= 10^12), and a list of `n` integer volumes (1 <= volume_i <= 10^9). It calculates the total volume of the kegs and checks if it is less than `s`. If the total volume is less than `s`, it outputs -1, indicating insufficient kvass. If the total volume is sufficient, it determines the minimum volume of kvass that can be retained from the kegs after taking enough to satisfy `s` and prints this adjusted minimum volume. If too much kvass was required, it adjusts the minimum by subtracting an average amount based on the remaining kvass divided by `n`. The function does not return any values but prints relevant outputs based on the calculations. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
