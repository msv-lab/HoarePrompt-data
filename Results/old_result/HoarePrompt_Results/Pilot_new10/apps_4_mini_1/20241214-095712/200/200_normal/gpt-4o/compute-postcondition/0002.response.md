Given the initial state, the code snippet `volumes.sort()` sorts the list of integers `volumes`. The exact output state depends on the initial values contained in `volumes`. However, since the specific contents of `volumes` are not provided in the initial state, I'll refer to it as a list of integers that will now be sorted in ascending order.

Output State: **`n` is an integer that is set to the input value (1 <= n <= 1000), `s` is a non-negative integer that is set to the input value (1 <= s <= 10^12), `volumes` is a sorted list of integers.**
