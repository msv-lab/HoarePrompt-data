`total_volume` is assigned the value of the sum of all elements in the `volumes` list. The initial states of `n` and `s` are not affected by this operation. Thus, the output state reflects that `total_volume` is now equal to the sum of the elements in the `volumes` list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer that is set to the input value (1 <= n <= 1000), `s` is a non-negative integer that is set to the input value (1 <= s <= 10^12), `volumes` is a sorted list of integers, `total_volume` is the sum of the elements in the `volumes` list.**
