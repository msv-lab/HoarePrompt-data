In the given code snippet `n, s = map(int, input().split())`, the values of `n` and `s` are assigned from input in the form of two integers. The details of the input are not specified in the problem, meaning that `n` and `s` will be updated based on user input while maintaining the constraints of their respective ranges.

1. The variable `n`, which was originally a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), will be assigned a new positive integer value based on the input received.
2. Similarly, the variable `s`, which was a positive integer (1 <= s <= 10^12), will also be assigned a new positive integer value from the input.

The list `v` remains unchanged, as the code snippet does not affect it. 

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `s` is an input positive integer (1 <= s <= 10^12), and `v` is a list of n positive integers (1 <= v[i] <= 10^9).**
