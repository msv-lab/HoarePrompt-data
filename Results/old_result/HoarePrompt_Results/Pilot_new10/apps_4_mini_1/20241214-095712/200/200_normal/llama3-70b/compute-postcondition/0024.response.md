Initial State: `n` is an input positive integer, `s` is an input positive integer, `v` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `low` is 0, `high` is `min(v)`.

Output State after loop execution: `low` is equal to `high`, which indicates that the binary search has narrowed down to a single value. If `total` was less than `s` during the last loop iteration, the final value of `low` (or `high`) will be the largest value for which the sum of `min(mid, x)` for each `x` in `v` is still less than `s`. If `total` was greater than or equal to `s`, the last value of `high` will be the largest number such that it does not exceed the threshold set by `s`. Therefore, `high` is now equal to `min(v) - 1` or `low` holds the maximum value that, when summed with the elements of `v`, does not meet or exceed `s`. 

In all cases, `low` will be less than or equal to `min(v)` and `high` will be less than or equal to `low`. 

Output State: **`low` is equal to `high`, and both are less than the initial value of `min(v)`, while the final `total` value is the sum of `min(mid, x)` for each `x` in `v`, which does not exceed `s`.**
