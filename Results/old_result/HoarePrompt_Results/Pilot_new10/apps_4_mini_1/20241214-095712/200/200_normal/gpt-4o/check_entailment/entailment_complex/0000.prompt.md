You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The Fair Nut likes kvass very much. On his birthday parents presented him $n$ kegs of kvass. There are $v_i$ liters of kvass in the $i$-th keg. Each keg has a lever. You can pour your glass by exactly $1$ liter pulling this lever. The Fair Nut likes this drink very much, so he wants to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass. But he wants to do it, so kvass level in the least keg is as much as possible.

Help him find out how much kvass can be in the least keg or define it's not possible to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $s$ ($1 \le n \le 10^3$, $1 \le s \le 10^{12}$) — the number of kegs and glass volume.

The second line contains $n$ integers $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n$ ($1 \le v_i \le 10^9$) — the volume of $i$-th keg.


-----Output-----

If the Fair Nut cannot pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass, print $-1$. Otherwise, print a single integer — how much kvass in the least keg can be.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3
4 3 5

Output
3

Input
3 4
5 3 4

Output
2

Input
3 7
1 2 3

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example, the answer is $3$, the Fair Nut can take $1$ liter from the first keg and $2$ liters from the third keg. There are $3$ liters of kvass in each keg.

In the second example, the answer is $2$, the Fair Nut can take $3$ liters from the first keg and $1$ liter from the second keg.

In the third example, the Fair Nut can't pour his cup by $7$ liters, so the answer is $-1$.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, s is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= s <= 10^12, and v is a list of n integers where each integer v_i (1 <= v_i <= 10^9) represents the volume of the i-th keg.
def func():
    n, s = map(int, input().split())
    volumes = list(map(int, input().split()))
    volumes.sort()
    total_volume = sum(volumes)
    if (total_volume < s) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        min_keg_volume = volumes[0]
        remaining_kvass = s
        for i in range(n):
            if volumes[i] <= min_keg_volume:
                continue
            else:
                possible_to_take = min(volumes[i] - min_keg_volume, remaining_kvass)
                remaining_kvass -= possible_to_take
            
            if remaining_kvass == 0:
                break
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer in the range 1 to 1000, `remaining_kvass` is either 0 (if sufficient kvass was taken) or is reduced from the original value of `s` by the minimum of the effective volumes taken, `i` is equal to the count of valid `volumes` processed before remaining_kvass becomes 0 or all iterations complete, and all unprocessed kegs were less than or equal to `min_keg_volume`.
        if (remaining_kvass > 0) :
            min_keg_volume -= (remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n
        #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer in the range 1 to 1000. If `remaining_kvass` is greater than 0, `min_keg_volume` is updated by subtracting `(remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n` from its previous value, and `i` is equal to the count of valid `volumes` processed before `remaining_kvass` becomes 0 or all iterations complete.
        print(min_keg_volume)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `s` is a non-negative integer (1 <= s <= 10^12), `volumes` is a sorted list of integers, and `total_volume` is the sum of the elements in the `volumes` list. If the `total_volume` is less than `s`, the function outputs -1. Otherwise, `min_keg_volume` is updated based on `remaining_kvass`, and `i` equals the count of valid `volumes` processed before `remaining_kvass` becomes 0 or all iterations complete, followed by printing the value of `min_keg_volume`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 1000), a non-negative integer `s` (1 <= s <= 10^12), and a list of `n` integer volumes (1 <= volume_i <= 10^9). It calculates the total volume of the kegs and checks if it is less than `s`. If the total volume is less than `s`, it outputs -1, indicating insufficient kvass. If the total volume is sufficient, it determines the minimum volume of kvass that can be retained from the kegs after taking enough to satisfy `s` and prints this adjusted minimum volume. If too much kvass was required, it adjusts the minimum by subtracting an average amount based on the remaining kvass divided by `n`. The function does not return any values but prints relevant outputs based on the calculations.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
