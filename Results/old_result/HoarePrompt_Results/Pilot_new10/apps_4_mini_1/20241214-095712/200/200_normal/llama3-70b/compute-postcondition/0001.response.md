The `v` variable is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the input values, which will be split into integers. The input will create a list of positive integers. The previously defined variables `n` and `s` remain unchanged, but `v` will now be a list of integers derived from the input.

Since `n` is still an input positive integer (indicating the length of the list), and `s` is also unchanged, the only variable that has changed is `v`, which now contains a list of `n` positive integers. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input positive integer, `s` is an input positive integer, `v` is a list of `n` positive integers from input.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer, `s` is an input positive integer, `v` is a list of `n` positive integers from input.**
