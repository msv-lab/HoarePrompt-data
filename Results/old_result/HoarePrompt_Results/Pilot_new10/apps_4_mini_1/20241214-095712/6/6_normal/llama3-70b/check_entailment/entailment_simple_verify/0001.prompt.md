You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Luba is surfing the Internet. She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.

Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.

What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.


-----Output-----

Print one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].


-----Examples-----
Input
6 3 2 4

Output
5

Input
6 3 1 3

Output
1

Input
5 2 1 5

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.

In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.

In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, pos, l, r) = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    if pos < l:
        ans += l - pos
    if pos > r:
        ans += pos - r
    ans += min(pos - 1, n - r) + max(0, l - 1)
    print(ans)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's break down the requirements systematically.

Luba needs to:

1. Move to an unclosed tab (to the left or right) if necessary.
2. Close all tabs outside the segment [l, r].

The program logic can be analyzed as follows:

- If the cursor is to the left of the segment (pos < l), she has to move to tab l, which takes (l - pos) seconds.
- If the cursor is to the right of the segment (pos > r), she has to move to tab r, which takes (pos - r) seconds.
- Regardless of the cursor's initial position, she will need to close tabs:
  - To the left of l, which takes time proportional to l - 1 (the number of tabs from index 1 to l-1).
  - To the right of r, which takes time proportional to n - r (the number of tabs from index r+1 to n).

However, the way the program calculates the answer appears to be incorrect. The addition of times to close the left and right segments does not seem to appropriately account for the movement to the proper tabs.

Now let's test specific cases:

- **Input:** `6 3 2 4`
  - Correct output: `5`
  - Let's break it down:
    1. Move to tab 2 (1 second).
    2. Close tabs to the left (1 second).
    3. Move to tab 3 (1 second).
    4. Move to tab 4 (1 second).
    5. Close tabs to the right (1 second).

- **Input:** `6 3 1 3`
  - Correct output: `1`
  - Action:
    1. Close tabs to the right of tab 3 (1 second).

- **Input:** `5 2 1 5`
  - Correct output: `0`
  - No moves needed, as all tabs are already in the desired segment.

Now let's evaluate a problematic case:

- **Input:** `6 1 3 5`
  - Expected output: `4`
  - Breakdown of steps:
    1. Move to tab 3 (2 seconds).
    2. Close tabs to the left (1 second).
    3. Move to tab 4 (1 second).
    4. Close tabs to the right (1 second).
    
When inputting this into the program:
- The program will miscalculate movements and adjustments and might result in a wrong count because of how it sums movements and closures improperly.

Thus, we can conclude:

Correctness: **False** 

This is because the logic does not handle certain edge cases correctly. Specifically, the program does not accurately calculate the total minimum time required when the cursor starts outside the bounds of the desired segment, and it incorrectly combines the tab movements and closures.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer between 1 and 100, pos is an integer such that 1 <= pos <= n, l and r are integers such that 1 <= l <= r <= n.
def func():
    n, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    if (pos < l) :
        ans += l - pos
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 100. If `pos` is less than `l`, then `ans` is equal to `l - pos`. If `pos` is greater than or equal to `l`, `ans` remains 0.
    if (pos > r) :
        ans += pos - r
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 100. If `pos` is greater than `r` and less than `l`, then `ans` is equal to `l - pos + (pos - r)`; if `pos` is greater than or equal to `l`, then `ans` remains 0.
    ans += min(pos - 1, n - r) + max(0, l - 1)
    print(ans)


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
