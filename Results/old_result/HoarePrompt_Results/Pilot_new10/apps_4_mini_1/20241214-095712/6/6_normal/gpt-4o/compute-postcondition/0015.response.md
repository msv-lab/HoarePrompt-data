Postcondition: ***`n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` are integers. If `l` is equal to 1, the output is `abs(pos - r) + 1`. Otherwise, if `r` is equal to `n`, the output is `abs(pos - l) + 1`. If neither condition is true, `move_to_l` is calculated as `abs(pos - l)`, `move_to_r` is calculated as `abs(pos - r)`, and the value of `close_both_sides`, which is `min(move_to_l + (r - l + 2), move_to_r + (r - l + 2))`, is printed.***
