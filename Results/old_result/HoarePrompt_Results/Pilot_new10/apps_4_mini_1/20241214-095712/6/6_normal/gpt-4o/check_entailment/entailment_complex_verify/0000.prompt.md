You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Luba is surfing the Internet. She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.

Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.

What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.


-----Output-----

Print one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].


-----Examples-----
Input
6 3 2 4

Output
5

Input
6 3 1 3

Output
1

Input
5 2 1 5

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.

In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.

In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, pos, l, r) = map(int, input().split())
    if l == 1 and r == n:
        print(0)
    elif l == 1:
        print(abs(pos - r) + 1)
    elif r == n:
        print(abs(pos - l) + 1)
    else:
        move_to_l = abs(pos - l)
        move_to_r = abs(pos - r)
        close_both_sides = min(move_to_l + (r - l + 2), move_to_r + (r - l + 2))
        print(close_both_sides)


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze both the program logic and consider all potential cases.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Parameters**: The function takes four integers: `n` (number of tabs), `pos` (current position of cursor), `l` (starting tab of the segment) and `r` (ending tab of the segment).
2. The function checks three major conditions based on the values of `l` and `r`:
   - If `l == 1 and r == n`: It means all tabs are needed, and no operations are required, so it correctly returns 0.
   - If `l == 1`: The program calculates the number of seconds needed to move to tab `r` and close all tabs to the right of it.
   - If `r == n`: The program calculates the number of seconds to move to tab `l` and close all tabs to the left of it.
   - If both `l` and `r` are inner tabs (not at the edges): It computes the time required for operations using the distances to `l` and `r`, followed by closing operations.

### Checking for Edge Cases:
A few edge cases might result in incorrect outputs:
- If `pos` is already at a tab within the range `[l, r]`, the resulting operations must consider how many tabs need to be closed based on the current position, potentially optimizing the cursor movements to minimize the total time.
  
An important edge case: 
- **Case 1**: If `n = 1`, `pos = 1`, `l = 1`, and `r = 1`: Output should be `0` since there are no tabs to close.
- **Case 2**: If `n = 3`, `pos = 1`, `l = 2`, and `r = 3`: The expected output should be `2` (to move to tab 2, then close the left tab).
  
Now examining how the function handles these specific cases:
- For **Case 2**, the current implementation for `l = 2` and `r = 3` doesn't adequately account for the need to close the leftmost tab (1) after moving to tab 2. The program returns `0` instead of the correct output `2`.

### Conclusion:
The function does not handle every potential case as described, particularly when it needs to consider the current tab's position relative to the edges and gaps in between. Thus, it fails to correctly compute the minimum seconds needed in a scenario where additional movement or closures are required.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of tabs (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), pos is an integer representing the current cursor position (1 ≤ pos ≤ n), l is an integer representing the minimum index of the segment to be kept open (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), and r is an integer representing the maximum index of the segment to be kept open (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n).
def func():
    n, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())
    if (l == 1 and r == n) :
        print(0)
    else :
        if (l == 1) :
            print(abs(pos - r) + 1)
        else :
            if (r == n) :
                print(abs(pos - l) + 1)
            else :
                move_to_l = abs(pos - l)
                move_to_r = abs(pos - r)
                close_both_sides = min(move_to_l + (r - l + 2), move_to_r + (r - l + 2))
                print(close_both_sides)
            #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` are integers. If `r` is equal to `n`, the output is the value of `abs(pos - l) + 1`. Otherwise, `move_to_l` is calculated as `abs(pos - l)`, `move_to_r` is calculated as `abs(pos - r)`, and `close_both_sides` is equal to `min(move_to_l + (r - l + 2), move_to_r + (r - l + 2))`, with `close_both_sides` being printed.
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` are integers. If `l` is equal to 1, the output is `abs(pos - r) + 1`. Otherwise, if `r` is equal to `n`, the output is `abs(pos - l) + 1`. If neither condition is true, `move_to_l` is calculated as `abs(pos - l)`, `move_to_r` is calculated as `abs(pos - r)`, and the value of `close_both_sides`, which is `min(move_to_l + (r - l + 2), move_to_r + (r - l + 2))`, is printed.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` are integers. If `l` equals 1 and `r` equals `n`, then 0 has been printed. Otherwise, if `l` equals 1, the output is `abs(pos - r) + 1`. If `r` equals `n`, the output is `abs(pos - l) + 1`. If neither condition is true, `move_to_l` is calculated as `abs(pos - l)`, `move_to_r` is calculated as `abs(pos - r)`, and `close_both_sides`, computed as `min(move_to_l + (r - l + 2), move_to_r + (r - l + 2))`, is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four integer parameters: `n`, which represents the total number of tabs (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `pos`, which indicates the current cursor position (1 ≤ pos ≤ n), `l`, which is the minimum index of the segment to be kept open (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), and `r`, which is the maximum index of the segment to be kept open (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n). It prints the number of moves required to close tabs outside the segment `[l, r]` based on the cursor's position. If the entire range of tabs is to be kept open (i.e., `l` equals 1 and `r` equals `n`), it prints 0. If only the leftmost tab is kept open (i.e., `l` equals 1), it returns the distance from the cursor to the rightmost tab plus one. If only the rightmost tab is kept open (i.e., `r` equals `n`), it returns the distance from the cursor to the leftmost tab plus one. If both sides have tabs to close, it calculates the two potential moves required to close from either side and prints the minimum of those moves plus the number of tabs being closed, which is `(r - l + 2)`. The function does not handle inputs that fall outside the specified ranges for `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r`.
