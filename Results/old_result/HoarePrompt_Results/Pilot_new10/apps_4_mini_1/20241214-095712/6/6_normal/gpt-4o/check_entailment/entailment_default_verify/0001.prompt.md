You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Luba is surfing the Internet. She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.

Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.

What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.


-----Output-----

Print one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].


-----Examples-----
Input
6 3 2 4

Output
5

Input
6 3 1 3

Output
1

Input
5 2 1 5

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.

In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.

In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, pos, l, r) = map(int, input().split())
    if l == 1 and r == n:
        print(0)
    elif l == 1:
        print(abs(pos - r) + 1)
    elif r == n:
        print(abs(pos - l) + 1)
    else:
        move_to_l = abs(pos - l)
        move_to_r = abs(pos - r)
        close_both_sides = min(move_to_l + (r - l + 2), move_to_r + (r - l + 2))
        print(close_both_sides)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the given program, we analyze the problem description and the provided code. The program is supposed to calculate the minimum time required for Luba to close all tabs outside the segment [l, r] given her current position at pos.

Let's go through the logic in the program:

1. If `l == 1` and `r == n`, it means that all tabs are needed to remain open, and no action is required, so it outputs `0`. This is correct.
2. If `l == 1`, it means Luba only needs to close tabs to the right. The time taken is calculated as the distance from her current position to `r`, plus 1 second to close the tabs on the right. This is correct.
3. If `r == n`, it means Luba only needs to close the tabs on the left. The time taken is calculated as the distance from her current position to `l`, plus 1 second to close the tabs on the left. This is accurate.
4. The final case handles when `l` and `r` are both somewhere in the middle. It calculates the moves necessary to reach `l` or `r` and then adds the time to close tabs on both sides. However, the implementation of this logic can lead to inaccuracies.

### Potential Edge Case:

Consider the example when:
- `n = 6`, `pos = 5`, `l = 2`, and `r = 4`.

Analyzing expected behavior:
- Luba needs to close tabs at indices 1, 6 (i.e., to the left of 2 and to the right of 4).
- She first moves to tab 4 (which takes 1 second).
- Then, she can close tabs to the right (which takes 1 second), so that would mean she would need to move to 4, close to the right, and then move to 2 to close the left.

Expected minimum seconds:
- Move to tab 4: 1 second.
- Close to the right: 1 second.
- Move to tab 2: 2 seconds.
- Close to the left: 1 second.

Total expected seconds = 1 (to tab 4) + 1 (close right) + 2 (to tab 2) + 1 (close left) = 5 seconds.

The program, however, might not account for moving through `pos` correctly in all scenarios to minimize timings comprehensively.

### Conclusion:

The program fails to handle some edge cases accurately, leading it to output an incorrect minimum second calculation in these scenarios. Thus, the solution does not account for accurate navigation and closure on all scenarios.

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts four integer parameters: `n`, which represents the total number of tabs (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `pos`, which indicates the current cursor position (1 ≤ pos ≤ n), `l`, which is the minimum index of the segment to be kept open (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), and `r`, which is the maximum index of the segment to be kept open (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n). It prints the number of moves required to close tabs outside the segment `[l, r]` based on the cursor's position. If the entire range of tabs is to be kept open (i.e., `l` equals 1 and `r` equals `n`), it prints 0. If only the leftmost tab is kept open (i.e., `l` equals 1), it returns the distance from the cursor to the rightmost tab plus one. If only the rightmost tab is kept open (i.e., `r` equals `n`), it returns the distance from the cursor to the leftmost tab plus one. If both sides have tabs to close, it calculates the two potential moves required to close from either side and prints the minimum of those moves plus the number of tabs being closed, which is `(r - l + 2)`. The function does not handle inputs that fall outside the specified ranges for `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r`. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
