To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, letâ€™s analyze both the description and the code.

### Problem Description Summary:
1. There are three inputs: `x` (upvotes), `y` (downvotes), and `z` (unknown votes).
2. The output can be:
   - "+" if upvotes are definitely more than downvotes.
   - "-" if downvotes are definitely more than upvotes.
   - "0" if upvotes equal downvotes (and there are no unknown votes).
   - "?" if the result is uncertain due to the presence of potential differing outcomes from the unknown votes.

### Program Analysis:
The program is structured as follows:

```python
def func():
    (x, y, z) = map(int, input().split())
    if x > y + z:
        print('+')
    elif x < y:
        print('-')
    elif x == y:
        if z == 0:
            print('0')
        else:
            print('?')
    else:
        print('?')
```

### Detailed Logic:
1. **First Condition**: `if x > y + z:` 
   - This checks if even with all unknown votes being downvotes, the upvotes are still greater. This is correct.
   
2. **Second Condition**: `elif x < y:`
   - This checks if the upvotes are less than the downvotes ignoring unknowns. This too is correct.
   
3. **Same Votes**: `elif x == y:`
   - If votes are equal, it checks if `z` is 0. If no unknown votes exist, then the result is definitely "0", which is also correct.
   - If `z > 0`, it can lead to uncertain outcomes, hence outputs "?".
   
4. **Last Condition**: `else:`
   - This case, which theoretically should not be reached due to exhaustive checks above, defaults to "?" for any remaining conditions.

### Testing for Edge Cases:
Let's examine various possible edge cases to validate if the code covers all scenarios.

1. **Case**: `x = 0, y = 0, z = 0`
   - Expected outcome: "0"
   - Code will result in "0" because x == y and z == 0.

2. **Case**: `x = 5, y = 5, z = 0`
   - Expected outcome: "0"
   - Code will correctly output "0".

3. **Case**: `x = 5, y = 5, z = 1`
   - Expected outcome: "?"
   - Code behaves correctly, producing "?" as it can either result in a + or a - depending on the unknown vote.

4. **Case**: `x = 10, y = 2, z = 5`
   - Expected outcome: "+"
   - The code will return "+" correctly since even if all unknown votes go to downvotes (total 2 + 5 = 7), upvotes still exceed downvotes.

5. **Case**: `x = 1, y = 2, z = 1`
   - Expected outcome: "?"
   - The code will also produce "?" correctly since the votes can swing from "-" to "+" with one unknown vote.

### Conclusion:
After evaluating the program against specified problem conditions and potential edge cases, I did not find any scenario where the program would fail to meet the expected outcome described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**.
