Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, `z` are integers input by the user such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100 and `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`. If `x` is less than `y`, then the value of `x` remains unchanged. If `x` is equal to `y`, then if `z` is 0, `x` remains equal to `y` and `z` is 0; otherwise, `z` is greater than 0 while `x` and `y` remain equal. If `x` is not equal to `y`, then `x` satisfies the conditions that it is less than or equal to `y + z`, is greater than or equal to `y`, and is not equal to `y`.***
