To assess the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to evaluate the logic implemented in the algorithm and ensure it matches all specified requirements.

### Program Logic Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads three integers \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\), which represent the number of upvotes, downvotes, and uncertain voters, respectively.

2. **Range Calculation:**
   - It computes:
     - `min_upvotes` = \(x\) (since the minimum upvotes are the definite upvotes).
     - `max_upvotes` = \(x + z\) (the maximum upvotes assuming all uncertain voters upvote).
     - `min_downvotes` = \(y\) (the minimum downvotes are the definite downvotes).
     - `max_downvotes` = \(y + z\) (the maximum downvotes assuming all uncertain voters downvote).

3. **Conditional Logic:**
   - The program then checks:
     - If `max_upvotes < min_downvotes`: If true, this implies all potential votes lead to downvotes, and the program prints `'-'`.
     - If `max_downvotes < min_upvotes`: If true, this implies all potential votes lead to upvotes, and the program prints `'+'`.
     - Otherwise, it prints `'?'`, indicating uncertainty in the voting outcome due to the presence of uncertain voters, as both outcomes could be possible depending on how the uncertain votes split.

### Verification Against Problem Requirements:
- The program correctly identifies the three possible outcomes based on the ranges derived from known votes and uncertain votes.
- The handling of edge cases (like when \(x\), \(y\), or \(z\) are zero) aligns with the expected outcomes defined in the problem description.

### Key Observations:
- It handles the case where uncertain votes contribute to both possible outcomes appropriately.
- It checks if maximum possible upvotes or downvotes exceed the respective minimums accurately, thereby ensuring correct classification of the results.

### Conclusion:
Every possible voting scenario outlined in the problem description is covered by the program's logic, producing correct outputs for all specified cases as described. 

Therefore, the program meets the requirements stated in the problem description.

**Correctness: True**
