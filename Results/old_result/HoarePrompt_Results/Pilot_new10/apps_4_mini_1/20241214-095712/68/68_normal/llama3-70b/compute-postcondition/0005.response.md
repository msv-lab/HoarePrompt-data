The execution of `print('-')` does not modify any variable or change the state of the integer inputs `x`, `y`, or `z`. It simply outputs a string to the console. Therefore, the conditions and values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, `z` are integers input by the user such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100, `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`, and the current value of `x` is less than `y`.**
