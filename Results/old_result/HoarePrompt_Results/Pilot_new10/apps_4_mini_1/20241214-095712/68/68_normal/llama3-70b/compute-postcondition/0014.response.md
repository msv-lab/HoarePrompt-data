The given code simply prints a question mark and does not modify any variables, nor does it return any values. Therefore, the output will reflect the unaltered values of the variables.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, `z` are integers input by the user such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100, `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`, `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, and `x` is not equal to `y`.**
