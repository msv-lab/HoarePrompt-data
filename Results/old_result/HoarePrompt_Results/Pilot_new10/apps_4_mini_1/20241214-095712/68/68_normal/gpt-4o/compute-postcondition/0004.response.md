The variable `max_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y + z`. The values of `y` and `z` are both integers in the range from 0 to 100. The other variables (`x`, `max_upvotes`, and `min_downvotes`) are not directly affected by this assignment. The value of `max_downvotes` will range from 0 (when both `y` and `z` are 0) to 200 (when both `y` and `z` are 100). 

Therefore, the output state maintains the information about the other variables while updating `max_downvotes`.

Output State: **`x` is equal to `min_upvotes`, `y` is an integer from the range 0 to 100, `z` is an integer from the range 0 to 100, `max_upvotes` is equal to `min_upvotes + z`, `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`, `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`.**
