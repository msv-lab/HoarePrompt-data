The code assigns the value 0 to `curr_sum`. The previous value of `curr_sum` was equal to `target_sum`. Since `target_sum` is derived from `total_sum`, we do not change the conditions of the other variables. Thus, `curr_sum` is now 0, while `ticket`, `total_sum`, `target_sum`, and `segments` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ticket` is a string of digits with length between 2 and 100, `total_sum` is an even number formed by the sum of the digits in `ticket`, `target_sum` is `total_sum // 2`, `curr_sum` is 0, `segments` is 1**.
