The variable `current_sum` is assigned the value of `0`. The initial state indicates that `current_sum` was previously equal to `target_sum`, which was equal to `current_sum + int(ticket[0])`. However, now `current_sum` is reset to `0`. 

The values of `n`, `segment_length`, `target_sum`, `i`, and `segment_count` remain unchanged. However, `current_sum` now is `0`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_length` is 2, `target_sum` is equal to the previous value of `current_sum`, `i` is 0, `segment_count` is 0. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_length` is 2, `target_sum` is equal to the previous value of `current_sum`, `i` is 0, `segment_count` is 0.**
