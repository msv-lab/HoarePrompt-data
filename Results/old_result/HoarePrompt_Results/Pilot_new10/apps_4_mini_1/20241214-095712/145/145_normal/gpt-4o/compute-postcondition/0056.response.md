The code increments `segment_count` by 1. The initial value of `segment_count` is 0, so after the increment, it will become 1. The values of the other variables are unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive; `current_sum` is 0; `segment_length` is 3; `target_sum` is equal to `segment_sum(0, 2)`; `i` is 0; `segment_count` is 1, and the current value of `current_sum` has been reset to 0.**
