Correctness: **True**

The provided program accurately meets the requirements set forth in the problem description regarding Vasya's golden ticket. Hereâ€™s why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n`, which corresponds to the number of digits in the ticket, and then reads a sequence of `n` digits. This is aligned with the problem description.

2. **Function Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the total sum of the digits in the ticket. This is necessary to determine if it's possible to split the ticket into segments with equal sums.
   - If the total sum is odd, the function correctly returns `False`. This is because an odd sum cannot be evenly split into two or more equal integer parts, which is required by the problem description.
   - If the sum is even, the function computes the `target_sum` (which is half of the total sum) and looks to find segments in the ticket that equal this target sum.
   - It iterates through the digits of the ticket, maintaining a `curr_sum` which accumulates the values of the digits until it either matches the `target_sum` or exceeds it. If it matches, it resets the `curr_sum` and increments the segment count.
   - It finally checks if at least two segments have been formed with the required sum, returning `True` if they have and `False` otherwise.

3. **Output Handling**: The program prints "YES" if `func_1` returns `True` (meaning the ticket is lucky), and "NO" otherwise. This matches the requirement of the problem description for the output.

4. **Correctness Proof**:
   - The function effectively captures the essence of forming non-overlapping segments that sum to the same value. The use of `curr_sum` to track current segment totals and the comparison with `target_sum` ensures that all segments are validated properly.
   - The input constraints (length between 2 and 100 digits, each digit being between 0 and 9) are respected, and the logic does not run into invalid scenarios, as sums and segments are managed clearly and logically.

Hence, since the program executes the intended logic as outlined in the problem description with all edge cases considered, we can conclude that the program is correct.
