According to the code, the for loop iterates over each digit in the `ticket` string. The loop will execute as long as `ticket` is a non-empty string. Given that it is specified that `ticket` has a length between 2 and 100, we can conclude that the loop will definitely execute.

At the start of the loop, the variables `curr_sum` and `segments` are initialized to 0. The `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket`, and since it is an even number, it does not affect the loop execution.

To summarize, the states that need to be adjusted are the positions of `digit`, `curr_sum`, and `segments` at the beginning of the loop. Specifically, `digit` should be the first character in the `ticket` string.

State: **`ticket` is a string of digits with length between 2 and 100, `total_sum` is an even number formed by the sum of the digits in `ticket`, `target_sum` is `total_sum // 2`, `curr_sum` is 0, `segments` is 0, `digit` is the first character in `ticket`.**
