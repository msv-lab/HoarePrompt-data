The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `ticket`. `ticket` is a string of digits that has a length between 2 and 100, where each digit is between 0 and 9. After executing the function body:

- If the sum of the digits in the `ticket` string (referred to as `total_sum`) is odd, the function returns `False`.
- If `total_sum` is even, the function checks the number of complete segments formed that equal `target_sum`. The function returns whether this number is greater than or equal to 2.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string of digits `ticket` and return `False` if the sum of its digits is odd; otherwise, it returns whether the number of complete segments that equal `target_sum` is greater than or equal to 2. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter ticket, returns False if the sum of the digits in ticket is odd; otherwise, it returns whether the number of complete segments formed that equal target_sum is greater than or equal to 2.**
