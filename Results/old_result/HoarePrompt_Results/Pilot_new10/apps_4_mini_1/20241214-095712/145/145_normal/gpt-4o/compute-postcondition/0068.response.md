Output State: **`current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is the number of times `current_sum` equaled `target_sum`, and `i` is equal to `n`. If the loop did not execute, `current_sum` remains 0, `segment_count` remains 0, and `i` would be 0. If there were segments found, `target_sum` would have been equal to `segment_sum(0, 2)`.**
