The statement `current_sum += int(ticket[i])` indicates that the value of `current_sum` will be increased by the integer value of `ticket[i]`. The variable `i` is 1, so we will be adding the integer value of the element at index 1 of `ticket` to the current value of `current_sum`. 

The preconditions state:
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive.
- `i` is 1.
- `segment_length` is 1.
- `target_sum` is the result of `segment_sum(0, 0)`.
- `current_sum` is 0.
- `segment_count` is 1 if `current_sum` equals `target_sum`.

Since `current_sum` is initialized to 0, it will change. Moreover, the values of `target_sum`, `segment_length`, and `segment_count` are not altered by this operation.

Thus, after executing the code line, the updated state would reflect the new value of `current_sum`, which will now be the sum of 0 and the integer value of `ticket[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 1, `segment_length` is 1, `target_sum` is the result of `segment_sum(0, 0)`, `current_sum` is the integer value of `ticket[1]`, and `segment_count` is 1 if `current_sum` equals `target_sum`.**
