The value of `segment_count` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_length` is 2, `target_sum` is 0, `i` is 2, and `segment_count` is now 3.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_length` is 2, `target_sum` is 0, `i` is 2, `segment_count` is 3**
