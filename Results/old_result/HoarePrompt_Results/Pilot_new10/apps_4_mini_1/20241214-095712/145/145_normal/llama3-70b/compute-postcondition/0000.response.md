The variable `total_sum` is assigned the value of the sum of the digits in the `ticket` string. The initial state indicates that `ticket` consists of digits only, and summing those digits will yield an integer value equal to the total of those digits. The state of `ticket` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ticket` is a string of digits with a length between 2 and 100, where each digit is between 0 and 9; `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket`.

Output State: **`ticket` is a string of digits with a length between 2 and 100, where each digit is between 0 and 9; `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket`.**
