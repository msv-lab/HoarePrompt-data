The `segment_count` is assigned the value of `0`. Before this assignment, `segment_count` could have been any integer reflecting the count of segments where their sums equaled `target_sum`. However, after executing the code, `segment_count` is now specifically `0`. The states of the other variables, `n`, `current_sum`, `segment_length`, `target_sum`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_length` is 2, `target_sum` is equal to `segment_sum(0, 1)`, `i` is 100 if the loop executed fully, and `segment_count` is 0.**
