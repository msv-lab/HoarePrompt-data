`current_sum` is explicitly assigned the value of `0`. The previous value of `current_sum` is not specified, but it is being updated from a previous value plus `int(ticket[2])`. Therefore, the updated value of `current_sum` will now be `0`. Other variables remain unaffected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 2, `segment_length` is 1, `target_sum` is the result of `segment_sum(0, 0)`, `current_sum` is 0**
