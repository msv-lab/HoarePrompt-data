The code snippet assigns the value `0` to `current_sum`. The prior state indicates that `current_sum` is initially `0`, so its value remains unchanged. Since this line does not affect any other variables, the output state reflects that the values of the other variables remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_length` is 3, `target_sum` is equal to `segment_sum(0, 2)`, `i` is n-1 if `segment_count` is greater than 0; otherwise `i` is n-1, and `segment_count` is the number of segments whose sum equals `target_sum`, where `current_sum` is 0, and `segment_count` is less than or equal to 1.**
