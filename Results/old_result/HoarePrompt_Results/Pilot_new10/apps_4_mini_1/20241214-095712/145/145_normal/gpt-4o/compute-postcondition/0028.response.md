According to the code, the for loop will execute a number of times equal to the value of `n`. The variables that are crucial for the loop execution are `n` and `i`. Since `n` is given as an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, the loop will execute at least twice. The state of `i` at the end of a full execution is already described as 100, which indicates the upper bound of the starting condition. 

However, since this is the state before the first execution, the value of `i` should be set to the initial value of the loop counter, which is 0. The variable `segment_count` does not affect the loop execution directly, but it is worth noting to maintain consistency.

Thus, to execute the loop, the states must be adjusted to the starting value of `i`, which is 0. 

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_length` is 2, `target_sum` is equal to `segment_sum(0, 1)`, `i` is 0, `segment_count` is 0**
