The code `segment_count += 1` increments the value of `segment_count` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `segment_count` starts from 0, it will now be 1 after the increment.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 0, `segment_length` is 1, `target_sum` is the result of `segment_sum(0, 0)`, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 1**
