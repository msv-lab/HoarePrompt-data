The code assigns `0` to `segment_count`. The variable `segment_count` was already `0`, so its value remains unchanged. The other variables in the initial state remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_length` is 3, `target_sum` is equal to `segment_sum(0, 2)`, `i` is n-1 if `segment_count` is greater than 0; otherwise `i` is n-1, and `segment_count` is 0.**
