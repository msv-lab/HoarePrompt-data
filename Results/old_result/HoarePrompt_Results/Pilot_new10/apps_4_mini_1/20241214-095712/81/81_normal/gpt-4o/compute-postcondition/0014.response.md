Postcondition: ***`l` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `l`, `r` is an integer such that `l` ≤ `r`, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x`, `y` is an integer such that `x` ≤ `y`, `z` is equal to `y // x`, `count` is either 1 or 2, `i` is now 1, `a` is equal to `x`, `b` is equal to `z * x`, the value of `a` is within the range [l, r], the value of `b` is within the range [l, r], the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b` is equal to `x`, the product of `a` and `b` divided by their greatest common divisor is equal to `y`, and if `a` is equal to `b`, `count` is 1 and the current value of `a` is equal to the current value of `b`; otherwise, if `a` is not equal to `b`, `count` is 2.***
