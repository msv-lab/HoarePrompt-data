The function accepts two integer parameters, `a` and `b`, both greater than 0, and computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. It correctly handles the case where `b` is initially greater than 0, ensuring that at least one iteration of the loop is executed. The function will always return the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b` after the loop terminates when `b` becomes 0.
