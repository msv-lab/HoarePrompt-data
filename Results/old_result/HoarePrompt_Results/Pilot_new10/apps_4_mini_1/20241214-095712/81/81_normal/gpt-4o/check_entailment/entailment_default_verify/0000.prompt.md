You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Today on Informatics class Nastya learned about GCD and LCM (see links below). Nastya is very intelligent, so she solved all the tasks momentarily and now suggests you to solve one of them as well.

We define a pair of integers (a, b) good, if GCD(a, b) = x and LCM(a, b) = y, where GCD(a, b) denotes the greatest common divisor of a and b, and LCM(a, b) denotes the least common multiple of a and b.

You are given two integers x and y. You are to find the number of good pairs of integers (a, b) such that l ≤ a, b ≤ r. Note that pairs (a, b) and (b, a) are considered different if a ≠ b.


-----Input-----

The only line contains four integers l, r, x, y (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 10^9).


-----Output-----

In the only line print the only integer — the answer for the problem.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 2 1 2

Output
2

Input
1 12 1 12

Output
4

Input
50 100 3 30

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example there are two suitable good pairs of integers (a, b): (1, 2) and (2, 1).

In the second example there are four suitable good pairs of integers (a, b): (1, 12), (12, 1), (3, 4) and (4, 3).

In the third example there are good pairs of integers, for example, (3, 30), but none of them fits the condition l ≤ a, b ≤ r.
Program:
```
import math

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    (l, r, x, y) = map(int, input().strip().split())
    print(func_1(l, r, x, y))

def func_1(l, r, x, y):
    if y % x != 0:
        return 0
    z = y // x
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(z)) + 1):
        if z % i == 0:
            a = i * x
            b = z // i * x
            if l <= a <= r and l <= b <= r and (math.gcd(a, b) == x) and (a * b // math.gcd(a, b) == y):
                if a == b:
                    count += 1
                else:
                    count += 2
    return count


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the given program against the problem description, let's analyze the code.

The problem requires counting the "good" pairs (a, b) where:

1. GCD(a, b) = x
2. LCM(a, b) = y
3. l ≤ a, b ≤ r

The key points to note from the provided code include:

- The program first checks if y is divisible by x, which is essential since GCD cannot exceed LCM.
- Then, it calculates z as y / x (y must be multiple of x to create good pairs).
- It iterates through the divisors of z and accordingly computes potential values of a and b.
- Lastly, it checks if these values respect the bounds (l to r) and the GCD/LCM conditions.

Despite the appearance of following the logic of the problem, let's inspect a potential edge case:

### Potential Case:

- Consider the input: `l = 1`, `r = 10`, `x = 1`, `y = 10`.
  - The good pairs must satisfy GCD(a, b) = 1 and LCM(a, b) = 10.
  - The pairs that satisfy LCM = 10 are (1, 10) and (2, 5), (5, 2), (10, 1). However, LCM(2, 5) = 10 does not satisfy GCD(2, 5) = 1.

### Evaluating the Code:

In this case, the code will register pairs. The valid pairs satisfying GCD(a, b) = 1 and LCM(a, b) = 10 would actually be (1, 10) and (10, 1). 

Now checking the code, it would not find all good pairs for certain conditions where some calculations overlook combinations where the GCD and LCM don't match up.

### Conclusion:

The program logic fails to account for all cases accurately where multiple pairs of (a, b) can exist. There could be additional pairs that are skipped or mistakenly counted given the current divisor checks.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts four integer parameters `l`, `r`, `x`, and `y`, and returns 0 if `y` is not divisible by `x`. If `y` is divisible by `x`, it computes the variable `z` as `y // x`, then counts the valid pairs `(a, b)` where both `a` and `b` are multiples of `x`, fall within the range `[l, r]`, satisfy the condition that their GCD is equal to `x`, and their product equals `y`. The function returns the total count of such valid pairs, including cases where `a` equals `b`. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
