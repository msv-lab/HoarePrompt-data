Output State: **`a` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`, `b` is 0. If `b` was initially greater than 0, the loop executed at least once, with `a` and `b` being updated to the earlier values as per the modulus operation. If `b` was initially 0, the loop wouldn't execute and `a` remains unchanged.**
