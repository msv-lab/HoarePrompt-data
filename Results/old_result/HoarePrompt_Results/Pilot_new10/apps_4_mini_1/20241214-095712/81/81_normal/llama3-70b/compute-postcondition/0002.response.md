Functionality: ** The function accepts two positive integer parameters `a` and `b`, and returns the product of `a` and `b` divided by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`, as computed by `func_1(a, b)`. This effectively calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`. There are no checks for the validity of `a` and `b` within the function itself, but it assumes they are positive integers. **
