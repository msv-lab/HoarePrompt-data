The code `marks = list(map(int, input().split()))` processes input to create a list `marks` of integers, which is formed by splitting a string input into separate pieces and converting each piece into an integer. The initial state of `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` is maintained and is still valid after the execution, as these variables are not changed by this code. However, `marks` is assigned a new value.

As the input provides multiple integers, the exact content of `marks` will depend on the specific integers entered by the user, but it will always be a list of integers.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100000; `l` is a positive integer where 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9; `x` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l; `y` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l; `marks` is a list of integers derived from input.**
