Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `need_x` is True if there exists at least one `j` such that `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `x`, `need_y` is True if there exists at least one `j` such that `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `y`, `j` is `n - 1`. If the loop does not execute, `need_x` and `need_y` retain their initial values which are both True.**
