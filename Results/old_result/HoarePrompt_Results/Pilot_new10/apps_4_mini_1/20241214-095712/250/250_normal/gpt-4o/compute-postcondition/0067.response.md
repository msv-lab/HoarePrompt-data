Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `l` is a positive integer where 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9; `x` and `y` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`; `marks` has at least one more element; if `mark - x + y` or `mark - x - y` exists in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` now includes the element `mark - x`.***
