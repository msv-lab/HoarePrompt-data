To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we can analyze the given information:

1. **Preconditions**: `n` is a positive integer, `additional_marks` contains `y`, `i` is the first element in `marks`, and `marks` must be a non-empty iterable. 

2. **Loop structure**: The loop iterates over `additional_marks`. For the loop to execute, `additional_marks` must have at least one element.

Given that `additional_marks` contains `y`, as stated, it suggests that it is not empty if `y` is also a valid item. Therefore, we need to make sure that the loop has appropriate states before it runs.

3. **States for execution**:
   - `additional_marks` must contain at least one element (which it does, since it contains `y`).
   - `j` will receive the first value from `additional_marks` during the first iteration.

Considering that `marks` is also provided, its integrity (being non-empty) indirectly implies potential relevance to the loop, though it does not influence the immediate execution of `for j in additional_marks`.

Thus, the adjustments and clarifications are:
- `j` will be the first element in `additional_marks`.
- `additional_marks` must not be empty, which is guaranteed if it contains `y`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is the first element in marks, `additional_marks` must contain at least one element (specifically `y`), `j` is the first element in additional_marks**.
