Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100000, `l` is a positive integer where 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, `x` and `y` are positive integers where 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, `marks` is a non-empty list of integers with at least 3 elements, `marks_set` contains unique integers from `marks`, and `mark` is the third element of `marks`. If both `x_found` and `y_found` are True, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. There is no else part in the code to modify the state of the program.***
