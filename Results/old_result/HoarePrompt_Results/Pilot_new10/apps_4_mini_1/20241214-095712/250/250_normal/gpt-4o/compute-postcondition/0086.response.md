Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, `l` is a positive integer where 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` and `y` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, `marks` is a non-empty list of integers, `marks_set` contains unique integers from `marks`, `new_marks` is empty, `x_found` is False, and `y_found` is False. After the execution, `result` will contain both `x` and `y`.***
