You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Valery is a PE teacher at a school in Berland. Soon the students are going to take a test in long jumps, and Valery has lost his favorite ruler! 

However, there is no reason for disappointment, as Valery has found another ruler, its length is l centimeters. The ruler already has n marks, with which he can make measurements. We assume that the marks are numbered from 1 to n in the order they appear from the beginning of the ruler to its end. The first point coincides with the beginning of the ruler and represents the origin. The last mark coincides with the end of the ruler, at distance l from the origin. This ruler can be repesented by an increasing sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}, where a_{i} denotes the distance of the i-th mark from the origin (a_1 = 0, a_{n} = l).

Valery believes that with a ruler he can measure the distance of d centimeters, if there is a pair of integers i and j (1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n), such that the distance between the i-th and the j-th mark is exactly equal to d (in other words, a_{j} - a_{i} = d). 

Under the rules, the girls should be able to jump at least x centimeters, and the boys should be able to jump at least y (x < y) centimeters. To test the children's abilities, Valery needs a ruler to measure each of the distances x and y. 

Your task is to determine what is the minimum number of additional marks you need to add on the ruler so that they can be used to measure the distances x and y. Valery can add the marks at any integer non-negative distance from the origin not exceeding the length of the ruler.


-----Input-----

The first line contains four positive space-separated integers n, l, x, y (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l) — the number of marks, the length of the ruler and the jump norms for girls and boys, correspondingly.

The second line contains a sequence of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (0 = a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_{n} = l), where a_{i} shows the distance from the i-th mark to the origin.


-----Output-----

In the first line print a single non-negative integer v — the minimum number of marks that you need to add on the ruler.

In the second line print v space-separated integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{v} (0 ≤ p_{i} ≤ l). Number p_{i} means that the i-th mark should be at the distance of p_{i} centimeters from the origin. Print the marks in any order. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 250 185 230
0 185 250

Output
1
230

Input
4 250 185 230
0 20 185 250

Output
0

Input
2 300 185 230
0 300

Output
2
185 230



-----Note-----

In the first sample it is impossible to initially measure the distance of 230 centimeters. For that it is enough to add a 20 centimeter mark or a 230 centimeter mark.

In the second sample you already can use the ruler to measure the distances of 185 and 230 centimeters, so you don't have to add new marks.

In the third sample the ruler only contains the initial and the final marks. We will need to add two marks to be able to test the children's skills.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly handle all edge cases as specified in the problem description. For instance, it does not ensure that the marks needed to measure both distances `x` and `y` can be added in such a way as to guarantee measurement.

**Issue 1: Inadequate Checking of Required Marks**
The program checks if the distances to be measured (`x` and `y`) can already be formed with the existing marks. However, if neither `x` nor `y` can be achieved directly, it tries to suggest adding only one new mark that enables measuring one or both of the distances which may not satisfy the requirement if the mark to be added is not correct.

**Example where it fails:**
Consider the input:
```
2 100 10 20
0 100
```
In this case, `x` (10) and `y` (20) cannot be measured from the existing marks. The program might only suggest to add one new mark, which doesn't guarantee both distances can be achieved. The expected output here should indicate both marks `10` and `20` need to be added for the students to be appropriately tested.

Thus, since the code does not ensure that necessary conditions are being met to measure both distances `x` and `y` accurately due to not adding both necessary marks, it is incorrect, hence the conclusion is **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four integers: `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y`, along with a list `marks` of `n` integers. It checks if there are any marks such that either `mark + x` or `mark - x` exists in the marks. It also checks similarly for `y`. If both `x` and `y` are found based on these conditions, it prints `0`. If not, it computes new potential marks based on the same conditions and if any are found, prints `1` followed by one of the new marks. If no new marks can be generated, it returns the two missing values `x` and `y` by printing their count followed by the values. The function handles cases where `new_marks` may be empty or checks for matches may not be found. If `n` is at least `2` and both `x` and `y` are less than `l`, this function effectively generates conditions based on distances and checks overlap within the provided marks.
