Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, `l` is a positive integer where 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` and `y` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, and `marks` has at least one more element. If either `mark - y + x` or `mark - y - x` exists in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` includes `mark - y`. Otherwise, if `x_found` is true, no changes are made to `new_marks`.***
