The code `additional_marks.append(i + j)` appends the value `i + j` to the list `additional_marks`. The initial state indicates that `i` is the next element in `marks`, and `j` is the next valid element in `additional_marks`. Since `additional_marks` contains original elements plus the next element, we can assume that `j` is defined and corresponds to the existing values in `additional_marks`. 

Thus, after executing the code:
- `additional_marks` now includes a new value, which is the sum of `i` and `j`.

The overall state of the variables remains largely unchanged, except for the alteration in `additional_marks` where a new value has been added. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is the next element in `marks`, `additional_marks` contains the original elements plus the new element `i + j`**.
