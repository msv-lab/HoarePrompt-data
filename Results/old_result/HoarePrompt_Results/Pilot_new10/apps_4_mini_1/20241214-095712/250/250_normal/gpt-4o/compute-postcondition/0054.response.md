The operation `new_marks.add(mark + x)` adds the value of `mark + x` to the set `new_marks`. The value of `mark` is already known as the next mark in `marks`, and `x` is a positive integer, ensuring that `mark + x` yields a valid positive integer.

No other variables are affected or changed by this operation. Therefore, the state of the other variables remains the same. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100000, `l` is a positive integer where 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, `x` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, `y` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, `marks` has at least one more element, `mark` is the next mark in `marks`, `new_marks` now includes `mark + x`**.
