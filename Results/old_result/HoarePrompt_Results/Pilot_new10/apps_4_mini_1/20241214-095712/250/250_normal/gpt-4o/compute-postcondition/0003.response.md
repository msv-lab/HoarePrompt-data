`x_found` is assigned the value `False`. This assignment does not change the values of the other variables, and their previous states remain valid. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100000; `l` is a positive integer where 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9; `x` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l; `y` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l; `marks` is a list of integers derived from input; `marks_set` is a set containing unique integers from `marks`; `x_found` is False.**
