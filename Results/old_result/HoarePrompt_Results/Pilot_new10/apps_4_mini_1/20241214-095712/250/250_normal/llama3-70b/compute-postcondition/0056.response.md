Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 4, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `need_x` is True, and `need_y` is True. If the difference between `marks[j]` and `marks[i]` is equal to `x`, the function will acknowledge this condition based on the provided states of the variables. There is no else part to consider in this case.***
