The operation `new_marks.add(mark - x)` adds the result of the expression `mark - x` to the collection `new_marks`. The values of `mark` and `x` are used directly in this calculation. The initial state informs us that `x` and `mark` are positive integers, and the range of `x` is such that it is less than `y` and both are less than or equal to `l`.

Since `mark` and `x` are positive integers, the value of `mark - x` will also be a positive integer provided that `mark > x`, which is plausible given the conditions. The other variables in the initial state remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `l` is a positive integer where 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9; `x` and `y` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`; `marks` has at least one more element; `new_marks` now includes the element `mark - x`.**
