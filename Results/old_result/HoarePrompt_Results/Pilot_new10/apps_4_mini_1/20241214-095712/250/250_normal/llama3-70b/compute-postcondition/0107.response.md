The function `func` accepts the following parameters: `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, and `a`. 

- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of marks on the ruler, constrained between 2 and 100,000. 
- `l` is a positive integer representing the length of the ruler, constrained between 2 and 1,000,000,000.
- `x` and `y` are positive integers that represent specific positions on the ruler, with the constraint that `1 ≤ x < y ≤ l`.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where the values represent the positions of the marks on the ruler, constrained such that `0 = a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] = l`.

After executing the function body, the function returns a result based on the parameters and their values, which are not detailed in the operations.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, l, x, y (positive integers) and a (a list of n integers) and is expected to perform computations based on these inputs, returning a result relevant to the marks on the ruler defined by the list a.**
