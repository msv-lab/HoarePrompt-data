According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the `marks` list. Since `marks` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `marks` is not empty. 

Given the constraints specified:
- `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100000.
- `l` is a positive integer where 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9.
- `x` and `y` are positive integers where 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l.
- `marks` is a list of integers derived from input.
- `marks_set` is a set containing unique integers from `marks`.
- `x_found` is False.
- `y_found` is False.

If `marks` is an empty list, the loop cannot be executed. Therefore, we need to ensure that `marks` contains at least one integer.

The state must reflect that `marks` is a non-empty list and can contain any integers. The loop will start with the first mark in the list during the first iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100000, `l` is a positive integer where 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, `x` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, `y` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, `marks` is a non-empty list of integers, `marks_set` contains unique integers from `marks`, `x_found` is False, `y_found` is False, `mark` is the first element of `marks`**
