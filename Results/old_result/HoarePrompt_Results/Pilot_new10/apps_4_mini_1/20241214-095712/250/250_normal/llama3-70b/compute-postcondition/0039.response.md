Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `i` is 1, `need_x` is True, `need_y` is True, `j` is 3. If the difference between `marks[j]` and `marks[i]` equals `y`, the condition is satisfied and the state may be modified accordingly; otherwise, there is no effect on the state, as there is no else part.***
