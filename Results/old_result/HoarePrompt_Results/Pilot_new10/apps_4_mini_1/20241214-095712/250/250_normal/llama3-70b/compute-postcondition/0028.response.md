The code sets `need_y` to `True`, but this variable is already `True` in the initial state. Therefore, there is no change to the variable's value or any other variable's value. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `need_x` is True, `need_y` is True, `j` is `n - 1`, and the current value of `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `y`.**
