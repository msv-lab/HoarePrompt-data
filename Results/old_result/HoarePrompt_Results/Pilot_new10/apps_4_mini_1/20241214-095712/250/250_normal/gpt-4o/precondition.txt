n is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, l is a positive integer representing the length of the ruler (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), x and y are positive integers representing the jump norms for girls and boys respectively (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), and a is a strictly increasing sequence of n integers (0 = a[1] < a[2] < ... < a[n] = l) representing the distances of the marks from the origin.
