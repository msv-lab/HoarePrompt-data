Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `need_x` is True if there exists at least one pair of marks such that the difference equals `x`, `need_y` is True if there exists at least one pair of marks such that the difference equals `y`, `i` must be `n - 1` and `j` is also `n - 1` if the loop executed at least `n` times. If `n` is less than 2, the loop does not execute, and `need_x` and `need_y` retain their initial values, which are both False.**
