According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the range for `j` is valid. The loop iterates from `i` to `n - 1`, and `j` will take values starting from `i`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, so `j` was set to `n - 1` before this iteration. In the current iteration, `j` would be 1 (when it first starts) and will increase until it reaches `n - 1`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to take on the next value, which will be 2, as the loop starts with `j` equal to `i`. In order for the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n`. Since `j` was `n - 1` at the end of the last iteration, the loop can execute again as long as `n` is greater than 2.

Therefore, the necessary states for the next iteration of the loop are `j` being incremented and ensuring that `n` remains greater than `j` (which will now be 2).

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 1, `need_x` is True, `need_y` is True, `j` is 2**
