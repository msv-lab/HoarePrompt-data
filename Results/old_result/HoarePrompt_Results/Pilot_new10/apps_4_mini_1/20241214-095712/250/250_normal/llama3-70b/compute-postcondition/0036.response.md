The code snippet assigns the value `True` to the variable `need_x`. The previous value of `need_x` is already `True`, so there is no change in its value. The states of the other variables `n`, `i`, `need_y`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the valid current values of the variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `i` is 1, `need_x` is True, `need_y` is True, `j` is 3**
