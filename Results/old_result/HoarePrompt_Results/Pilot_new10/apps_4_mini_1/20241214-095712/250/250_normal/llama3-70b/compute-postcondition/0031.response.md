The code snippet sets `need_x` to `True`, but `need_x` is already `True` in the initial state. Therefore, there are no changes to the value of `need_x`. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 1, `need_x` is True, `need_y` is True, `j` is 2**
