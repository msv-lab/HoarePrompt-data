According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `additional_marks` iterable. For the loop to execute, `additional_marks` must contain at least one element. The states that need to be adjusted are as follows: 

The value of `n` is a positive integer, which doesn't directly affect the execution of the loop itself in this case. The variable `i` being the next element in `marks` is irrelevant to whether the loop can execute. The key factor is that `additional_marks` needs to have elements that are less than or equal to `l`, not already present in `marks`, and should be non-empty before the loop starts.

Thus, for the loop to execute, `additional_marks` must contain at least one valid element. Furthermore, since the loop iterates through `j` in `additional_marks`, we can establish that `j` will be the first valid element upon the start of the loop.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is the next element in `marks`, `additional_marks` must be a non-empty iterable containing elements that meet the condition of `i + j` for each valid `j`, `j` is now the first valid element in `additional_marks`**
