You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Valery is a PE teacher at a school in Berland. Soon the students are going to take a test in long jumps, and Valery has lost his favorite ruler! 

However, there is no reason for disappointment, as Valery has found another ruler, its length is l centimeters. The ruler already has n marks, with which he can make measurements. We assume that the marks are numbered from 1 to n in the order they appear from the beginning of the ruler to its end. The first point coincides with the beginning of the ruler and represents the origin. The last mark coincides with the end of the ruler, at distance l from the origin. This ruler can be repesented by an increasing sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}, where a_{i} denotes the distance of the i-th mark from the origin (a_1 = 0, a_{n} = l).

Valery believes that with a ruler he can measure the distance of d centimeters, if there is a pair of integers i and j (1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n), such that the distance between the i-th and the j-th mark is exactly equal to d (in other words, a_{j} - a_{i} = d). 

Under the rules, the girls should be able to jump at least x centimeters, and the boys should be able to jump at least y (x < y) centimeters. To test the children's abilities, Valery needs a ruler to measure each of the distances x and y. 

Your task is to determine what is the minimum number of additional marks you need to add on the ruler so that they can be used to measure the distances x and y. Valery can add the marks at any integer non-negative distance from the origin not exceeding the length of the ruler.


-----Input-----

The first line contains four positive space-separated integers n, l, x, y (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l) — the number of marks, the length of the ruler and the jump norms for girls and boys, correspondingly.

The second line contains a sequence of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (0 = a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_{n} = l), where a_{i} shows the distance from the i-th mark to the origin.


-----Output-----

In the first line print a single non-negative integer v — the minimum number of marks that you need to add on the ruler.

In the second line print v space-separated integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{v} (0 ≤ p_{i} ≤ l). Number p_{i} means that the i-th mark should be at the distance of p_{i} centimeters from the origin. Print the marks in any order. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 250 185 230
0 185 250

Output
1
230

Input
4 250 185 230
0 20 185 250

Output
0

Input
2 300 185 230
0 300

Output
2
185 230



-----Note-----

In the first sample it is impossible to initially measure the distance of 230 centimeters. For that it is enough to add a 20 centimeter mark or a 230 centimeter mark.

In the second sample you already can use the ruler to measure the distances of 185 and 230 centimeters, so you don't have to add new marks.

In the third sample the ruler only contains the initial and the final marks. We will need to add two marks to be able to test the children's skills.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, l, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    marks = set(map(int, input().split()))
    (need_x, need_y) = (False, False)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i, n):
            if marks[j] - marks[i] == x:
                need_x = True
            if marks[j] - marks[i] == y:
                need_y = True
    additional_marks = []
    if not need_x:
        additional_marks.append(x)
    if not need_y:
        additional_marks.append(y)
    for i in marks:
        for j in additional_marks:
            if i + j <= l and i + j not in marks:
                additional_marks.append(i + j)
    print(len(additional_marks))
    print(' '.join(map(str, additional_marks)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program is intended to determine how many additional marks need to be added to a ruler so that two specific distances (x and y) can be measured. However, there are several issues in the program that can lead to incorrect results:

1. **Incorrect handling of additional marks**: The logic for adding additional marks assumes that if `x` or `y` is not already measurable, they can directly be added without checking if such additions can satisfy the measurement conditions. For example, let's say `n = 2`, `l = 5`, `x = 2`, and `y = 3` with existing marks `0` and `5`. The program will add `2` and `3` to the list. However, it doesn't ensure that it checks if these new marks can then be used to measure distances as combinations.

2. **Duplicate marks in output**: The program may add duplicates to the `additional_marks` list. This could happen if the generated marks (like `x + i` where `i` is an existing mark) result in numbers that are already in `marks`. This has been acknowledged in the control flow, but it could lead to more than the minimum number of marks being printed.

3. **Checking combinations of marks is flawed**: The program effectively checks combinations of existing marks for `x` and `y`, but it could miss measuring larger gaps that require more than two marks to find possible measurements. For instance, if a ruler can only measure up to `l` with existing marks but needs additional marks to complete measurements, the current logic for determining `need_x` and `need_y` might indicate that further marks are not required when they actually are.

4. **No consideration for the edge case when additional marks are required**: If `n = 2` and the only existing marks are `0` and `l`, it will always require both `x` and `y` to be added without checking if those gaps can be bridged by combining existing marks properly.

As a concrete example:
Input:
```
2 10 3 7
0 10
```
The output should indicate that both `3` and `7` are required. However, due to the internal logic flaws, the wrong result or outputs may be produced since it doesn't adequately ensure combinations can be checked post-addition.

Given these deficiencies, the program does not fulfill the requirements specified in the problem description in every potential case.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), l is a positive integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), x and y are positive integers (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), and a is a list of n integers (0 = a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] = l) representing the positions of the marks on the ruler.
def func():
    n, l, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    marks = set(map(int, input().split()))
    need_x, need_y = False, False
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i, n):
            if marks[j] - marks[i] == x:
                need_x = True
            if marks[j] - marks[i] == y:
                need_y = True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `need_x` is True if there exists at least one pair of marks such that the difference equals `x`, `need_y` is True if there exists at least one pair of marks such that the difference equals `y`, `i` must be `n - 1` and `j` is also `n - 1` if the loop executed at least `n` times. If `n` is less than 2, the loop does not execute, and `need_x` and `need_y` retain their initial values, which are both False.
    additional_marks = []
    if (not need_x) :
        additional_marks.append(x)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer. If `need_x` is False, `need_y` is True if there exists at least one pair of marks such that the difference equals `y`, and `additional_marks` will contain `x`. The values of `i` and `j` remain as `n - 1` if the loop executed at least `n` times.
    if (not need_y) :
        additional_marks.append(y)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer. If `need_x` is False and `need_y` is also False, then `additional_marks` now contains the value of `y` appended to it, and the values of `i` and `j` remain as `n - 1`. If `need_y` is True, the program does not execute the if block, and the state is as described in the precondition.
    for i in marks:
        for j in additional_marks:
            if i + j <= l and i + j not in marks:
                additional_marks.append(i + j)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is the last element in `marks`, `additional_marks` contains elements that are the sums of every element in `marks` added to every element in the original `additional_marks` where each sum is less than or equal to `l` and not already present in `marks`. If the loop does not execute, `additional_marks` remains unchanged from its initial state containing at least `y`, and `marks` is a non-empty iterable.
    print(len(additional_marks))
    print(' '.join(map(str, additional_marks)))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of marks and identifies if additional marks are needed to satisfy certain differences. It adds missing differences to an additional marks list, computes possible new marks by summing existing marks with the additional marks, and outputs the count and values of any new marks that can be formed without exceeding the bounds set by `l` or duplicating existing marks.
