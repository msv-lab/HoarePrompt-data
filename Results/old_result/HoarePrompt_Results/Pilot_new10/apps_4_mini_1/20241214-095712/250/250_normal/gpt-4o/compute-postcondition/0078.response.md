The `new_marks.pop()` function removes and returns the last item from the list `new_marks`. Since this action modifies `new_marks` by removing its last element, it impacts the state of `new_marks`. The other variables remain unchanged based on the information provided.

As described, `new_marks` will now contain one less element after the `pop()` operation, and the specific value returned will be the last element that was in the list before `pop()`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, `l` is a positive integer where 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` and `y` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, `marks` is a non-empty list of integers, `marks_set` contains unique integers from `marks`, `new_marks` has one less element and the last element before pop has been returned, `x_found` is either True or False, `y_found` is either True or False.**
