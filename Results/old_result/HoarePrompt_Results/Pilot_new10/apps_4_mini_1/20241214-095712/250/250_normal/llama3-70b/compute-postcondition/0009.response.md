The variable `need_y` is assigned the value `True`, but it does not affect any other variable in the initial state. The other variables remain unchanged in their previous values. Therefore, the Output State remains descriptive of the unchanged variables and the updated state of `need_y`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, the difference between `marks[j]` and `marks[i]` equals `y`, `need_y` is True**
