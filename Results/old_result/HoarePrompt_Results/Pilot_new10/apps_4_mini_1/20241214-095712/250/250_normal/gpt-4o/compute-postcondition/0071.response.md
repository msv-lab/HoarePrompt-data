The code snippet `new_marks.add(mark - y)` adds the value of `mark - y` to the `new_marks` collection. The impact on the state of the program is as follows:

1. **`new_marks`**: An element is added to the collection, specifically `mark - y`.
2. Other variables remain unchanged as this line only affects `new_marks`.

The precondition informs us that `marks_set` contains elements related to previously provided marks, but since we're not writing any logic about checking if the addition is valid or not prior to adding, we assume `mark - y` is simply added.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, `l` is a positive integer where 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` and `y` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, `marks` has at least one more element, `mark` is the next element in the `marks` collection, and `new_marks` now includes `mark - y`.**
