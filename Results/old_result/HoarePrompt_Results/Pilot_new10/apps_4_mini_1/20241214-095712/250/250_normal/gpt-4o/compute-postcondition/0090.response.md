Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100000, `l` is a positive integer where 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, `x` and `y` are positive integers where 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, `marks` is a non-empty list of integers, `marks_set` contains unique integers from `marks`. If both `x_found` and `y_found` are True, 0 has been printed. Otherwise, if `new_marks` is not empty, `new_marks` has one less element with the last element removed and returned, while `x_found` and `y_found` can be either True or False. If `new_marks` is empty, then `x_found` is False, `y_found` is False, `result` contains both `x` and `y`, and the printed output is the string representation of `x` and `y` joined by a space.***
