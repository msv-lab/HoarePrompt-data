The variable `y_found` is set to `True`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. The states of the other variables remain unchanged, maintaining the original conditions. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100000, `l` is a positive integer where 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, `x` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, `y` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, `marks` is a non-empty list of integers, `marks_set` contains unique integers from `marks`, the current value of `mark` is the first element of `marks`, `y_found` is True, and either `mark + y` or `mark - y` is present in `marks_set`.**
