Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is the next element in `marks`, `additional_marks` contains at least 4 elements, and `j` is the third element in `additional_marks`. If `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and `i + j` is not already in `marks`, then `additional_marks` includes the sum of `i` and `j`.***
