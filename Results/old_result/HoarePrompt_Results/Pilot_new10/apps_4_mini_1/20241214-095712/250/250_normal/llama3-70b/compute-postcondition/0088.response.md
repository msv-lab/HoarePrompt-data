According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `additional_marks` list. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another element in `additional_marks` that has not been iterated over yet. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer. Since `additional_marks` contains the original elements plus the new element `i + j`, it indicates that `additional_marks` must have at least one more element for the loop to continue. Assuming that the loop executed once, it would have iterated over the first element of `additional_marks`.

Thus, if the first element was processed, `j` would have taken that first value. In order for the loop to execute again, `j` should now be set to the next element in `additional_marks` (i.e., the second element).

Therefore, the state must reflect that `j` is incremented by 1 for the loop to potentially execute again.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, additional_marks must have at least 2 elements, j is set to the second element in additional_marks**
