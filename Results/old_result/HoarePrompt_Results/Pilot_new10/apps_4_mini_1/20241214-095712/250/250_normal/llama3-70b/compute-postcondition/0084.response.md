Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is the next element in `marks`, and `additional_marks` is a non-empty iterable. If `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and `i + j` is not in `marks`, then `additional_marks` contains the original elements with one more element which is `i + j`, where `j` is the first valid element in `additional_marks`.***
