The function accepts four parameters: `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y`, which are positive integers, and `a`, a list of `n` integers representing the positions of marks on a ruler. The function checks if there exist pairs of marks in the list `a` such that their differences equal `x` or `y`. If such differences do not exist, it adds `x` and/or `y` to a list of additional marks. Furthermore, it computes new potential marks by summing existing marks with the additional marks while ensuring these new sums do not exceed `l` and are not already in `marks`. Finally, the function prints the total count of unique additional marks generated and their respective values. 

Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of marks and identifies if additional marks are needed to satisfy certain differences. It adds missing differences to an additional marks list, computes possible new marks by summing existing marks with the additional marks, and outputs the count and values of any new marks that can be formed without exceeding the bounds set by `l` or duplicating existing marks. **
