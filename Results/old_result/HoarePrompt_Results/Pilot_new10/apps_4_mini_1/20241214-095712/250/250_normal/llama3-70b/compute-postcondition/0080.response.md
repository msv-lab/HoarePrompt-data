According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the iterable `marks`. If `marks` is a non-empty iterable, the loop can execute for its next element. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first element in `marks`. For the loop to execute one more time, `marks` must still be non-empty, and `i` will take on the next element in `marks`. 

Therefore, to adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we will increment `i` to the next element in `marks`. However, since the specifics of the next element in `marks` are not provided, we will denote it generically.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is the next element in `marks`, `additional_marks` contains elements such that each element is equal to the new `i + j` for each `j` in `additional_marks` that meets the condition of being less than or equal to `l` and not already present in `marks`, and `marks` must remain a non-empty iterable**.
