According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `marks` list. If there are more elements in `marks`, the loop executes again for the next element. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the next element in `marks`. For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` must be the next element available in the `marks` list. Since we have already fulfilled an iteration with the current `i`, after this iteration, `i` will point to the following element in `marks`, and the loop will continue as long as there are remaining elements.

Thus, we need to adjust the state to indicate that `i` is now the next element from the `marks` list. 

Assuming `n` remains a positive integer and the `additional_marks` remain unchanged unless the condition dictates otherwise, the necessary adjustments for the next iteration would reflect this.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is the next element in `marks`, `additional_marks` is updated to contain elements such that each element is equal to `i + j` for each `j` in the original `additional_marks` that meets the condition of being less than or equal to `l` and not already present in `marks`.**
