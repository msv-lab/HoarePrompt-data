Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The code does not correctly handle the case where the array can be split into new subarrays such that their sums are not zero. In particular, there are scenarios where even if the total sum of the array is not zero, it may still be impossible to split the array in a way that meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. 

For example, consider the input:

```
5
1 2 -3 3 -3
```

In this case, the total sum of the array is 0, thus the program would return "NO", which is correct according to the description. However, consider another input where the total sum is non-zero:

```
5
1 -1 1 -1 1
```

The total sum for this case is 1, which is non-zero. But if we try to split it, we cannot create subarrays whose individual sums are non-zero because any combination will lead to a zero-sum subarray. However, the program would output "YES" before not providing valid splits for the subarrays. 

The condition in the program that checks if the total sum is zero and directly returns "NO" is not enough to guarantee that there exists a valid splitting for non-zero sums. The output hints provided state that the function identifies indices where prefix sums are non-zero, but it does not guarantee that these splits meet the constraints. This leads to a misunderstanding of the problem requirements by not exhausting all splitting possibilities to ensure all subarray sums are non-zero. 

As such, the program fails to handle all edge cases appropriately, resulting in a conclusion of incorrectness.
