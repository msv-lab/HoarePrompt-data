`total_sum` is assigned the value of the sum of the list `A`, which contains `n` integers. Since `n` is an input positive integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the integers in `A` can range from -1000 to 1000, `total_sum` will be the aggregation of these integers. The value of `total_sum` will depend on the specific integers present in the list `A` but will not affect the values of `n` or `A` themselves.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `A` is a list of `n` integers satisfying -1000 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000; `total_sum` is the sum of elements in list `A`.**
