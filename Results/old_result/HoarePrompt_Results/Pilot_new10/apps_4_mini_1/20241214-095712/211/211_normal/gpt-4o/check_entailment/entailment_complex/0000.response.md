The provided program does not correctly implement the solution as described in the problem statement.

### Issues with the Program:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Zero Sum**:
    - The original problem states that if the total sum of the array is zero, it is necessary to check if it can be split into subarrays such that none of them have a sum of zero. The program, however, immediately indicates "NO" if the total sum is zero, which is incorrect. For example, an input like `[1, -1]` has a total sum of `0` but can be split into two subarrays: `[1]` and `[-1]`, each of which is non-zero.

2. **Inability to Handle All Non-Zero Cases**:
    - If all elements of the array are `0`, the program correctly returns "NO". However, the case where the total sum is zero does not consider potentially valid splits as explained above.

3. **Correct Split Logic**:
    - The solution assumes that if there's any non-zero element, the array can be split into two parts, but this is not sufficient. Not every arrangement of non-zero elements can be guaranteed to create valid splits with non-zero sums, especially if there are multiple values of both positive and negative integers.

4. **Outputs for cases with valid splits**:
    - The program outputs "1" indicating one big subarray when the total sum is non-zero, which could be misleading. The output format should consistently follow what is described (number of valid subarrays along with their indices).

### Conclusion:
Given these points, the program fails to fulfill the task outlined in the problem description correctly for all possible input cases. Therefore, it does not meet the necessary conditions for correctness.

Correctness: **False**
