According to the code, the loop will execute a number of times equal to `n`. Since `n` is provided as an input positive integer within the range of 1 to 100, for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1. The variable `i` will start at 0 and will be incremented up to `n-1` during the loop iterations.

In the given state, the total_sum is 0, but this does not affect the execution of the loop itself; it is just a condition of the list A. Hence, the relevant states that need to be stated are that `n` must be a valid positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and that `i` is initialized to 0 before entering the loop. 

State: **`n` is an input positive integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 0**
