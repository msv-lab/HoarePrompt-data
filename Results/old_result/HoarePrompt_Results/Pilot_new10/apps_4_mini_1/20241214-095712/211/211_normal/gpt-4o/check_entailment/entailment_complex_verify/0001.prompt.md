You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One spring day on his way to university Lesha found an array A. Lesha likes to split arrays into several parts. This time Lesha decided to split the array A into several, possibly one, new arrays so that the sum of elements in each of the new arrays is not zero. One more condition is that if we place the new arrays one after another they will form the old array A.

Lesha is tired now so he asked you to split the array. Help Lesha!


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of elements in the array A.

The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ( - 10^3 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^3) — the elements of the array A.


-----Output-----

If it is not possible to split the array A and satisfy all the constraints, print single line containing "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise in the first line print "YES" (without quotes). In the next line print single integer k — the number of new arrays. In each of the next k lines print two integers l_{i} and r_{i} which denote the subarray A[l_{i}... r_{i}] of the initial array A being the i-th new array. Integers l_{i}, r_{i} should satisfy the following conditions:  l_1 = 1  r_{k} = n  r_{i} + 1 = l_{i} + 1 for each 1 ≤ i < k. 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

def func():

    A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    total_sum = sum(A)
    if total_sum != 0:
        print('YES')
        print('1')
        print('1', n)
    else:
        for i in range(n):
            if A[i] != 0:
                print('YES')
                print('2')
                print('1', i + 1)
                print(i + 2, n)
                break
        else:
            print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program fails to handle the case where there are multiple parts of the array needed to satisfy the condition of non-zero sums. Specifically, it assumes that if the total sum is not zero, it can simply return the whole array as one part. However, this does not account for the fact that parts can have individual sums of zero, which would not satisfy the requirement.

For example, consider the input where the array contains multiple elements that sum to zero in subsets:

Input:
```
5
1 1 -2 0 0
```

The total sum is `0`, but if we analyze the array, it can indeed be split into parts that do not sum to zero, for instance:

- The first part `1 1` sums to `2` (non-zero),
- The second part `-2` sums to `-2` (non-zero),
- The last part `0 0` sums to `0`, which is not allowed.

However, the program would print "NO" for this input due to the total being zero, which makes it incorrect. 

Thus, there are cases where the program's logic is insufficient to determine valid partitions correctly, leading to an overall conclusion of incorrectness.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and A is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies -1000 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    total_sum = sum(A)
    if (total_sum != 0) :
        print('YES')
        print('1')
        print('1', n)
    else :
        for i in range(n):
            if A[i] != 0:
                print('YES')
                print('2')
                print('1', i + 1)
                print(i + 2, n)
                break
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `total_sum` is 0, and `i` is `n-1`. The printed output is 'NO' indicating all elements in A are zero.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `A` is a list of `n` integers satisfying -1000 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000; if `total_sum` is not equal to 0, 'YES' and '1' are printed, followed by the values of `1` and `n`. If `total_sum` is equal to 0, 'NO' is printed, indicating that all elements in `A` are zero.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` (where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100`) and a list `A` of `n` integers (each between -1000 and 1000). It calculates the sum of the elements in `A`. If the sum is not zero, it prints 'YES', followed by '1' and the values '1' and `n`. If the sum is zero, it checks each element in `A`; if it finds a non-zero element at index `i`, it prints 'YES', followed by '2', then prints '1' and `i + 1`, and finally prints `i + 2` and `n`. If all elements in `A` are zero, it prints 'NO'.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
