The code executes a print statement displaying the current values of `k`, `l`, and `r`. Since `k` is set to 3, `l` is set to 2, and `r` is set to 3, the output will be "3 2 3".

The initial state remains unchanged for the variables `n`, `k`, `l`, and `r`, except for the fact that the values are used to generate the specific output.

Output State: **`n` is between 3 and 100, `k` is 3, `l` is 2, `r` is 3; output printed is "3 2 3".**
