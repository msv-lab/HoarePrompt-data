The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The original constraint of `n` being an integer between 1 and 100 still holds. The list `A` is unaffected by this code. Therefore, the Output State captures the updated value of `n`, which will now refer to the specific integer input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `A` is a list of length `n` integers where each integer a_i is in the range of -1000 to 1000, and `n` is the input integer.**
