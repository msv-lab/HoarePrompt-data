`l` is assigned the value of `r`. The initial value of `r` is 3, so now `l` will also be 3. The initial values of `n`, `k`, and `r` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: 

`n` is between 3 and 100, `k` is 4, `l` is 3, `r` is 3; output printed is "3 2 3". 

Output State: **`n` is between 3 and 100, `k` is 4, `l` is 3, `r` is 3; output printed is "3 2 3".**
