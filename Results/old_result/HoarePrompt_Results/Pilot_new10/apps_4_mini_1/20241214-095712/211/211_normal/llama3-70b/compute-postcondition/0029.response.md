The value of `k` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `k` was 3, so after the operation, `k` will be 4. The other variables (`n`, `l`, `r`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 3 and 100, `k` is 4, `l` is 2, `r` is 3; output printed is "3 2 3".

Output State: **`n` is between 3 and 100, `k` is 4, `l` is 2, `r` is 3; output printed is "3 2 3".**
