The code simply prints the string 'YES' to the output. No variables are modified or assigned new values as a result of this operation. Therefore, the initial states of the variables remain valid, and no changes have occurred.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 2 and 'YES' has been printed.**
