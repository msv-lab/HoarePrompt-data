To determine the loop’s output state after all the iterations have finished, we will analyze the behavior of the loop carefully based on the provided information and code logic.

The loop will iterate through the list `A`, checking each element until it finds the first non-zero element. If a non-zero element is found, it will print specific values and break out of the loop. If all elements are zero, it will output 'NO'.

Let's analyze the possible outcomes:

1. If there exists at least one non-zero element in the list `A`, the loop will terminate early upon finding that element. The last value of `i` when the loop breaks would correspond to the index of the first non-zero element found.

2. If all elements in the list `A` are zero, the loop will complete all iterations until `i` reaches `n-1` and will print 'NO' at the end.

Considering that `total_sum` starts at 0, it remains 0 regardless of the values in `A`, since it is used only for checking against zero in this context, and isn't calculated during the iterations.

Let’s summarize the output based on whether a non-zero element is found in `A`:

- If a non-zero value exists:
  - The output will be based on the index of the first non-zero element.
  
- If no non-zero value exists:
  - The output will be 'NO', and the loop will iterate through all `n` indices.

Final output states:

If `A` contains at least one non-zero:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `total_sum` is 0, and `i` is the index of the first non-zero element in A (with value >= 0). The printed output reflects that a non-zero element at position i+1 was found, and it breaks out of the loop.**

If all values in `A` are zero:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `total_sum` is 0, and `i` is `n-1`. The printed output is 'NO' indicating all elements in A are zero.**
