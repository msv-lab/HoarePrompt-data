The code `print('2')` outputs the string '2' but does not change any variables or their values. The initial state of the variables remains valid after the code execution, with no variables modified by the code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 0, and the current value of `A[0]` is not 0.**
