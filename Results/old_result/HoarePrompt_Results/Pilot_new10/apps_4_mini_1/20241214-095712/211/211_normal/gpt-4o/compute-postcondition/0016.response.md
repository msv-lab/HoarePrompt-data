According to the code, the loop iterates based on the value of `n` and the variable `i`. The loop can only execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and since `n` is a positive integer, `n` can be anything from 1 to 100. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to increase by 1, which makes `i` equal to 1. Given that `n` is unchanged, the loop will execute again as long as `n` remains greater than 1.

State: **`n` is an input positive integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 1**
