The execution of the `break` statement does not change the values of `n`, `total_sum`, or `i`. It simply breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement that we were inside. Therefore, the output state reflects that the variables remain unchanged apart from acknowledging the break condition.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
