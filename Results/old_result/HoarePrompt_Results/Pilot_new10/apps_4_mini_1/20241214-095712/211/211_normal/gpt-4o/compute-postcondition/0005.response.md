The code executes a print statement, which outputs '1'. The variables themselves remain unchanged. The previous states of the relevant variables are still valid.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `A` is a list of `n` integers satisfying -1000 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000; `total_sum` is the sum of elements in list `A`; the string 'YES' has been printed; '1' has been printed.**
