The code `print('1', i + 1)` prints '1' followed by the value of `i + 1`. The value of `i` is currently 2, so `i + 1` becomes 3. This operation does not change any of the variable values in the state.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged:
- `n` is a positive integer where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,
- `total_sum` is 0,
- `i` is 2,
- 'YES' has been printed, and 
- 2 has been printed.

Therefore, the Output State is as follows:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 2, 'YES' has been printed, 2 has been printed, and '1' and 3 have been printed.**
