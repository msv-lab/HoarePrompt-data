Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 100, `prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[i]` is equal to the sum of the first `i` elements of `a` for `i` from `0` to `n`, `a` is equal to `A`, with `A` being a list of length `n` containing integers, and the value of `prefix_sum[n]` is not equal to 0. If `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to 0 and `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, then `k` is updated to 2, `l` remains 1, `r` remains 1, and (k, l, r) is printed.***
