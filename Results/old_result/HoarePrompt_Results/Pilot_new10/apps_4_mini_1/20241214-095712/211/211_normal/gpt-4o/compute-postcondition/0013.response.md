The value of `i` is initially 0. The operation `i + 2` computes to 2. The value of `n` remains the same as it is an input positive integer between 1 and 100. The print statement outputs the results.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input positive integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 0, and the output printed is `2` and `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 0, and printed is `2` and `n`.**
