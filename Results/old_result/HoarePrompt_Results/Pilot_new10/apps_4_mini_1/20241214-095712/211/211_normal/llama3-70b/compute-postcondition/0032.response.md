Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[i]` is equal to the sum of the first `i` elements of `a` for `i` from `0` to `n`, `a` is equal to `A`, with `A` being a list of length `n` containing integers, and the value of `prefix_sum[n]` is not equal to 0. If there are values of `r` from 1 to `n` such that `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to 0 and `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, then `k` is equal to the count of such valid `r` values plus 1, `l` is equal to the last valid `r` where the condition held true, and `r` takes its final value after the last iteration of the loop where `r` is equal to `n`. If there are no such `r` values, then `k` remains 1, `l` remains 1, and `r` equals `n`.**
