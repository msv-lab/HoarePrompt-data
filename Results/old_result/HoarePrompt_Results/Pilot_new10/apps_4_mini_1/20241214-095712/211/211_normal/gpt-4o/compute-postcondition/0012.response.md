The code prints the value `1` and the result of `i + 1`. The previous value of `i` is `0`, so `i + 1` evaluates to `1`. The state of the other variables (`n`, `total_sum`, and the current value of `A[0]`) remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 0, and the current value of `A[0]` is not 0. Additionally, `1` and `1` (for `i + 1`) are printed.**
