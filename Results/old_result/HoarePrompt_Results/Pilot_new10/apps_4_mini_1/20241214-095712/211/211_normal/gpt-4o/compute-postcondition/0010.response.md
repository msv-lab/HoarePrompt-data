The code simply prints the string 'YES'. It does not change any of the variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains as is, reflecting the unchanged values of the variables.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 0, and the current value of `A[0]` is not 0.**
