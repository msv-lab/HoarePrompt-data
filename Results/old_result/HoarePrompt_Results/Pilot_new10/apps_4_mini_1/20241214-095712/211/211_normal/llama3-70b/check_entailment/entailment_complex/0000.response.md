Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the logic outlined in the problem description. Here are the reasons why the program is incorrect:

1. **Handling of Zero-Sum Subarrays**: The program only checks if the total sum of the array (prefix_sum[n]) is zero and prints "NO" if it is. However, it does not appropriately check or handle all cases where splitting the array into non-zero sum subarrays is necessary. The program should not just look for a single prefix sum that is not zero but rather it needs to ensure that each created subarray must not have a sum of zero.

2. **Subarray Validity on Output**: According to the problem description, it is mandated that every subarray formed should not equal zero. The current code logic allows for the potential of printing a series of splits which could result in subarrays that add up to zero, as it focuses just on prefix sums.

3. **Incorrect Printing of Subarrays**: The program attempts to print indices of the valid splits but does not guarantee that these splits represent valid subarrays whose sum is non-zero. Specifically, the way it decides on splitting could allow for immediate zero sums if the array has a specific distribution of negative and positive values.

For example, in an input like `3 -1 1 -5`, the correct output should ensure that any chosen subarrays do not sum to zero when split, thereby violating the problem criteria.

4. **Edge Case Handling**: The function could fail for edge cases where a mix of positive and negative numbers results in a zero cumulative but can have valid non-zero subarrays, which the code does not accurately capture.

Given these issues, the annotated program does not fully align with the requirements of the problem description and as a result, cannot be deemed correct.
