The variables `n`, `k`, and `t` are assigned new values based on user input, where each of them is an integer within the specified ranges. As a result, the previous conditions that these variables were in do not change, while their specific values are now determined by the input.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `t` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k; and `n`, `k`, `t` are updated based on user input.**
