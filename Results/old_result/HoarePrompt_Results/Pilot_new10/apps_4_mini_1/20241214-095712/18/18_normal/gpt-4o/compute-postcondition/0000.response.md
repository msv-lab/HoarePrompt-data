The initial values of `n`, `k`, and `t` are integers such that:

- `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`
- `1 ≤ k ≤ n`
- `1 ≤ t < n + k`

The code takes input values and assigns them to `n`, `k`, and `t`. The specific values of these variables will change based on the input provided, but other conditions remain valid.

Let's denote the input values as `n'`, `k'`, and `t'`. After executing the code, the values will be updated as follows:

- `n` becomes `n'`
- `k` becomes `k'`
- `t` becomes `t'`

However, since the values `n'`, `k'`, and `t'` are not specified, the only thing we can say definitively is that they will take any input values that satisfy the above conditions.

Output State: **`n` is assigned a value `n'`, `k` is assigned a value `k'`, `t` is assigned a value `t'`, with 1 ≤ n' ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k' ≤ n', and 1 ≤ t' < n' + k'**
