Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `t` are assigned values `n'`, `k'`, `t'` respectively, where 1 ≤ n' ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k' ≤ n', and 1 ≤ t' < n' + k'. If `t'` is less than or equal to `k'`, then `t` is printed. Otherwise, if `t'` is less than or equal to `n'`, `k'` is printed. If `t'` is greater than `n'`, the printed value will be `n' + k' - t'`, which is a negative value.*
