You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Arpa is researching the Mexican wave.

There are n spectators in the stadium, labeled from 1 to n. They start the Mexican wave at time 0. 

  At time 1, the first spectator stands.  At time 2, the second spectator stands.  ...  At time k, the k-th spectator stands.  At time k + 1, the (k + 1)-th spectator stands and the first spectator sits.  At time k + 2, the (k + 2)-th spectator stands and the second spectator sits.  ...  At time n, the n-th spectator stands and the (n - k)-th spectator sits.  At time n + 1, the (n + 1 - k)-th spectator sits.  ...  At time n + k, the n-th spectator sits. 

Arpa wants to know how many spectators are standing at time t.


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers n, k, t (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, 1 ≤ t < n + k).


-----Output-----

Print single integer: how many spectators are standing at time t.


-----Examples-----
Input
10 5 3

Output
3

Input
10 5 7

Output
5

Input
10 5 12

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the following a sitting spectator is represented as -, a standing spectator is represented as ^.

  At t = 0  ---------- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 0.  At t = 1  ^--------- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 1.  At t = 2  ^^-------- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 2.  At t = 3  ^^^------- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 3.  At t = 4  ^^^^------ $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 4.  At t = 5  ^^^^^----- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 5.  At t = 6  -^^^^^---- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 5.  At t = 7  --^^^^^--- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 5.  At t = 8  ---^^^^^-- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 5.  At t = 9  ----^^^^^- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 5.  At t = 10 -----^^^^^ $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 5.  At t = 11 ------^^^^ $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 4.  At t = 12 -------^^^ $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 3.  At t = 13 --------^^ $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 2.  At t = 14 ---------^ $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 1.  At t = 15 ---------- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 0.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k, t) = map(int, input().split())
    if t <= k:
        print(t)
    elif t <= n:
        print(k)
    else:
        print(n + k - t)


```
Original Assessment: To verify the Python program against the problem description, let's break down what the requirements of the Mexican wave are and see if the provided code meets them.

### Problem Analysis
We know that:
- At time `t <= k`, the number of standing spectators increases from `1` to `k` (represented simply as `t`).
- At time `t` from `k+1` to `n`, the number of standing spectators remains constant at `k` (there are `k` spectators standing).
- At time `t` from `n+1` to `n+k`, the number of standing spectators decreases from `k` down to `0` as the last few start to sit (represented as `n + k - t`).

Now, we'll analyze the provided code to confirm if it matches this logic correctly.

### Program Analysis
Here is the provided code:
```python
def func():
    (n, k, t) = map(int, input().split())
    if t <= k:
        print(t)
    elif t <= n:
        print(k)
    else:
        print(n + k - t)
```

The logic of the code:
1. If `t <= k`: The output is `t` (correct).
2. If `k < t <= n`: The output is `k` (correct).
3. If `n < t < n + k`: The output is `n + k - t` (this is correct based on the analysis from the description).

### Edge Cases
Now let's consider an edge case to ensure the program handles all conditions correctly:

- **Case Example**: Let's consider `n=10`, `k=5`, and `t=8`.
  - According to the wave description, at time `t=8`, the number of standing spectators should still be `5` (since `8` falls within the bounds `k < t <= n`).
  - The program returns `k`, which equals `5`, which is expected.

- **Another Case Example**: Testing `t=12` with `n=10` and `k=5`.
  - At `t=12`, as noted, the expected number of standing spectators should be `3` (using the formula `n + k - t` we get `10 + 5 - 12 = 3`).
  - The program again correctly implements this via `print(n + k - t)`.

### Conclusion
After checking against multiple edge cases, including those at the boundaries (`t = k`, `t = n`, and `t = n + k`), the program appears to produce the correct results based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**.
The program correctly calculates the number of spectators standing for all valid inputs defined by the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, k, and t are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k.
def func():
    n, k, t = map(int, input().split())
    if (t <= k) :
        print(t)
    else :
        if (t <= n) :
            print(k)
        else :
            print(n + k - t)
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `k`, `t` are assigned values `n'`, `k'`, `t'` respectively, where 1 ≤ n' ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k' ≤ n', and 1 ≤ t' < n' + k'. If `t'` is less than or equal to `n'`, then `k'` has been printed. If `t'` is greater than `n'`, the printed value will be `n' + k' - t'` (which is a negative value).
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `t` are assigned values `n'`, `k'`, `t'` respectively, where 1 ≤ n' ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k' ≤ n', and 1 ≤ t' < n' + k'. If `t'` is less than or equal to `k'`, then `t` is printed. Otherwise, if `t'` is less than or equal to `n'`, `k'` is printed. If `t'` is greater than `n'`, the printed value will be `n' + k' - t'`, which is a negative value.*


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
