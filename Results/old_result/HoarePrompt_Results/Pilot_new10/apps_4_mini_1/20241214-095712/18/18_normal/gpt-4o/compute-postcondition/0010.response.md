The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `t`. All three are integers with the constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k. Based on the output conditions (which are not provided in detail), the function may return different values based on the comparisons or calculations involving these parameters, but specific return values are not stated. Therefore, the functionality of the function can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, k, and t, which are integers constrained by 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k. It performs logic based on these parameters to return specific output values according to internal conditions related to n, k, and t.**
