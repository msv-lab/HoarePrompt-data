The variables `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` are initialized with extreme values, where `min_x` and `min_y` are set to positive infinity and `max_x` and `max_y` are set to negative infinity. These values indicate that no positions have been evaluated yet. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is assigned the input integer representing the number of lines, `m` is assigned the input integer representing the number of characters in each line, `pixels` is a list of `n` strings with `m` characters, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (i, j) for each position where `pixels[i][j]` is 'w'; `min_x` is `float('inf')`, `min_y` is `float('inf')`, `max_x` is `float('-inf')`, `max_y` is `float('-inf')`.**
