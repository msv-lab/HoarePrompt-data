Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer ≥ 1, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `top` is 0, and `bottom` is 0. If `j` is greater than `right`, which is 2, the values of `n`, `m`, `screen`, `i`, `j`, `top`, and `bottom` remain unchanged. If `j` is not greater than `right`, the values of `n`, `m`, `screen`, `i`, `j`, `top`, and `bottom` also remain unchanged, as both `j` and `right` equal 2.***
