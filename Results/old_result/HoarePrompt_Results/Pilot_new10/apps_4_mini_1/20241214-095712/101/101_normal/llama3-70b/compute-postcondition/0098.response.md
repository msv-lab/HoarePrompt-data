Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are assigned values, `pixels` is a list of `n` strings with `m` characters, and `white_pixels` contains all tuples `(x, y)` for each position where `pixels[i][j]` is 'w'. If the `frame_size` is greater than the maximum of `n` and `m`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, `pixels` remains a list of `n` non-empty rows, where each row is a string formed by concatenating its elements, with `n` greater than 0 and `m` greater than 0, reflecting the dimensional properties, or may be an empty list if `n` is 0, or consist of empty strings for each row if `m` is 0.***
