Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer â‰¥ 2, `m` is an integer > 2, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 1, `bottom` is 1, `top` is 1, `left` is 2, `right` is 2, and `j` is 2. If `j` is greater than `right` (which is 2), then the state remains unchanged. If `j` is less than or equal to `right`, the program remains unchanged, and `screen[1][0]` remains 'w'.***
