The code assigns `result` a new list where each element is a list of characters from each corresponding string in `screen`. Since `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `result` will now be a list containing `n` lists of characters. Other variables such as `n`, `m`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `frame_height`, and `frame_width` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer ≥ 1, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right` are all integers, `frame_height` is equal to `bottom - top + 1`, and `frame_width` is equal to `right - left + 1`, `result` is a list of lists of characters from `screen`.**
