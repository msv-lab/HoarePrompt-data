Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer ≥ 1, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `top` is an integer, `bottom` is an integer where `bottom ≥ top`, `left` is an integer, `right` is an integer where `right ≥ left`, `frame_height` is equal to `bottom - top + 1`, `frame_width` is equal to `right - left + 1`, and `result` is a list of lists of characters from `screen`. If `i` is at the boundary (either `top`, `bottom`, `left`, or `right`), and if `result[i][j]` is equal to '.', then `result[i][j]` is set to '+', otherwise, `result[i][j]` remains unchanged.***
