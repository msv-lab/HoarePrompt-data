The variable `right` is assigned the value of `j`, which is currently 2. The values of the other variables do not change since `j` is not less than `left`. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer ≥ 1, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, `right` is 2.**
