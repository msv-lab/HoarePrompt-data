The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly as arguments. Instead, it processes input that consists of two integers, `n` and `m`, representing the resolution of a monitor, followed by `n` lines each containing `m` characters. Each character in these lines is either a '.' (representing a black pixel) or 'w' (representing a white pixel). The function produces an output based on this input, but specifics regarding the output are not provided. 

Since the output specifics are not detailed, it can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: **The function reads the resolution (n, m) of a monitor and a grid of pixels represented by '.' and 'w' characters, where at least one pixel is a white pixel. The exact output based on this input is not specified.**
