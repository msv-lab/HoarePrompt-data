Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer ≥ 1, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `top` is an integer, `bottom` is an integer where `bottom ≥ top + 1`, `left` is an integer, `right` is an integer where `right ≥ left`, `frame_height` is equal to `bottom - top + 1`, `frame_width` is equal to `right - left + 1`. If `i` is equal to `top`, `bottom`, `j` is equal to `left`, or `j` is equal to `right`, and `result[i][j]` is '.', then `result[i][j]` is updated to '+' while `j` remains equal to `left + 1`. Otherwise, the state of `result` remains unchanged.***
