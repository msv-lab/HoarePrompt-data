Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers â‰¥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 0, `j` is 2. If `top` is None, then `top` is set to 0, `bottom` is set to 0, `left` is 2, and `right` is 2. If `top` is not None and `j` is greater than `right`, the values of `n`, `m`, `screen`, `i`, `j`, `top`, and `bottom` remain unchanged. If `top` is not None and `j` is not greater than `right`, the values of `n`, `m`, `screen`, `i`, `j`, `top`, and `bottom` remain unchanged, as both `j` and `right` equal 2.***
