The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables, but it indicates that the current iteration of the loop will end, and control will go to the next iteration of that loop. Therefore, while `i`, `m`, `j`, and `n` maintain their previous conditions, the loop continues, and any end-of-loop operations will not be executed.

Output State: **If `n` is greater than `max_x`, `i` is `max_x + 1`, `m` is greater than 1, and `j` is 2; control moves to the next iteration of the loop.**
