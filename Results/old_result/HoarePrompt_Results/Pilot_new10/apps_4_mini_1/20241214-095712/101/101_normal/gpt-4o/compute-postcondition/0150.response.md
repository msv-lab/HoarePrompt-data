The value of `frame_width` is assigned the value of `right - left + 1`. Since `right` and `left` are both integers that correspond to the indices of 'w' encountered, the value of `frame_width` will depend on those specific indices. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer ≥ 1, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right` are all integers, and `frame_height` is equal to `bottom - top + 1`, and `frame_width` is equal to `right - left + 1`.
