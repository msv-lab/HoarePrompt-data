The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `screen`. `n` and `m` are integers representing the dimensions of the monitor resolution, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000. `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, where each string has length `m`, containing characters either '.' (representing a black pixel) or 'w' (representing a white pixel). 

After executing the function body, there are three possible return cases: 

Case 1: If 'w' was not found in at least one of the specified row or column indices, the function returns -1, indicating an issue with the specified indices.

Case 2: If the frame height is less than 2 or frame width is less than 2, the function returns -1, indicating an invalid or insufficient frame size.

Case 3: The function returns a list of lists of characters from `screen`, where all positions on the boundaries defined by the specified indices that originally contained '.' are set to '+', and all other positions remain unchanged.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept the parameters `n`, `m`, and `screen`, and return an error code when conditions are not met or return a modified representation of `screen` based on the specified indices. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n and m (integers) and screen (a list of strings). It returns -1 if 'w' was not found in the specified row or column indices, or returns -1 if the frame height or width is invalid. Otherwise, it returns a modified list of lists of characters from screen with specified pixels altered.**
