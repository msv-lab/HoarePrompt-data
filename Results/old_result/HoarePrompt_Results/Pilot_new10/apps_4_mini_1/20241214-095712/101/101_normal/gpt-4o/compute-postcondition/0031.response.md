In this case, the code snippet assigns the value of `j` to `right`. The variable `j` has a value of 1, which will be assigned to `right`. The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged, as there are no operations affecting their values. 

So, the Output State will reflect that `right` now has the value of `j`, which is 1. The values of the variables `n`, `m`, `screen`, `i`, `top`, `bottom`, and `left` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer ≥ 1, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `top` is 0, `bottom` is None, `left` is 1, `right` is 1**
