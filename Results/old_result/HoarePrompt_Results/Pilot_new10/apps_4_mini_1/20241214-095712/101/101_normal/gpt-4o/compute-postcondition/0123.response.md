The variable `bottom` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 2. Since `i` is equal to `top`, the value of `bottom` will now also be 2. Other variables remain unchanged as there is no impact on them from this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer ≥ 2, `m` is an integer ≥ 2, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 2, `top` is 2, `bottom` is 2, `left` is 0, `right` is the maximum column index of 'w' encountered, `j` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer ≥ 2, `m` is an integer ≥ 2, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 2, `top` is 2, `bottom` is 2, `left` is 0, `right` is the maximum column index of 'w' encountered, `j` is 1**.
