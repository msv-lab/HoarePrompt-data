According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `white_pixels` list. Since `white_pixels` contains at least 1 tuple `(x, y)`, we need to consider the iteration over this list. At the end of the last iteration, `white_pixels` contains at least 1 tuple, which means it was iterated over once.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next tuple `(x, y)` must be from `white_pixels`. If there were `k` tuples in `white_pixels`, and given the loop executes once for each tuple, after one iteration, the loop has processed the first tuple. Thus, for the loop to continue executing, `white_pixels` must still have more tuples to process. 

If we denote the current index of processing as `i`, it denotes that the first tuple `(x, y)` has been processed (i.e., current state after one iteration corresponds to the processing of index 0). Therefore, to execute for one more time, `white_pixels` must have at least 2 tuples (k must be greater than 1), and we must be at index 1 in the next iteration.

Thus, we adjust the state as follows:
State: **`n` is assigned, `m` is assigned, `pixels` is a list of `n` strings with `m` characters, `white_pixels` must have at least 2 tuples, `min_x` is updated to min(min_x, x), `min_y` is updated to min(min_y, y), `max_x` is updated to max(previous max_x, x), `max_y` is updated to max(previous max_y, y)**
