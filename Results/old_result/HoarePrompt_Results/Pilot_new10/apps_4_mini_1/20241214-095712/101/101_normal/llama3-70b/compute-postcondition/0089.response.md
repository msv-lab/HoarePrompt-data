To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished executing, we need to consider how the loop operates and the relationships between the variables involved.

Given the loop structure:

```python
for j in range(m):
    if (i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y) and pixels[i][j] == '.':
        pixels[i][j] = '+'
    elif pixels[i][j] == 'w':
        continue
    else:
        pixels[i][j] = '.'
```

We know the following from the initial state and subsequent outputs:
- `n` is greater than `max_x + 2`, which constrains its value but doesn't directly influence the loop's execution.
- `i` is fixed at `max_x + 2`, meaning the first dimension of the `pixels` array is constant.
- `m` is greater than or equal to 0, dictating how many iterations the loop will run. If `m` is 0, the loop does not execute.
- The variable `j` iterates over the range defined by `m`.

As the loop iterates:
1. **For each value of `j` from 0 to m - 1, the values at `pixels[i][j]` will be evaluated:**
   - If the current position is on the boundary defined by `min_x`, `max_x`, `min_y`, or `max_y` and contains a '.', it will be updated to '+'.
   - If it contains 'w', the loop will skip that iteration.
   - Otherwise, it will be updated to '.' for any other character (including cases where it might already be '.').

**Final Output State:**
The loop will complete its iterations for all values of `j` from 0 to `m - 1`, thus evaluating every relevant `pixels[i][j]`. 

At the end of the loop:
- If `m` is greater than 0, `j` will have iterated through all values in that range, resulting in values at `pixels[max_x + 2][j]` being updated to either '+' or '.' based on the conditions above.
- If `m` is 0, no changes occur, and `pixels[max_x + 2][j]` for all `j` in the range would retain their original values.

Considering that conditions related to `n`, `i`, and how `pixels` array is populated are primarily consistent:
- The final state of `pixels[max_x + 2][j]` will contain either '+' or '.', contingent upon their initial content and the boundaries specified by min/max values.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop:
Output State: **`n` is greater than `max_x + 2`, `i` is `max_x + 2`, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, for every `j` in range of `m`, `pixels[max_x + 2][j]` holds either '+' or '.' based on the original state of 'pixels[max_x + 2][j]' and the boundaries defined by `min_x`, `max_x`, `min_y`, `max_y`.**
