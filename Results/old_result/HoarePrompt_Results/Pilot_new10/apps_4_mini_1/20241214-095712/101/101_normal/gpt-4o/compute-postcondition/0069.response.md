Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer ≥ 2, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 1, `top` is either None or 1, `bottom` is 1, `left` is either 0 or updated to the value of `j` if `j` is less than `left`, and `right` is updated to the value of `j` if `j` is greater than `right`. The current value of `screen[1][0]` remains 'w', and the state of the other variables remains unchanged.***
