Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` and `m`, representing the dimensions of a monitor grid, and a grid of pixels where each pixel is either a black ('.') or white ('w') pixel. It identifies the bounding box of the white pixels in the grid. If the size of this bounding box exceeds the dimensions of the grid (either `n` or `m`), the function prints -1. Otherwise, it modifies the border of the bounding box of white pixels by replacing black pixels on the border with '+' and prints the modified grid. If there are no changes to be made due to the size constraint, it simply prints the original grid. The function does not handle the case where the dimensions `n` or `m` are 0, as this would lead to invalid input based on the provided constraints (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000).**
