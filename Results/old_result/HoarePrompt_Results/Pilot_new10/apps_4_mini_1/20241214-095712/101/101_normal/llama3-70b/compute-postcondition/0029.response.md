According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the range of `m`. The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is either `min_y` or `max_y`, and depending on the conditions provided, if the loop is executed one more time, `j` should be incremented by 1. 

Given that the last iteration updated `pixels[i][j]` and satisfied the conditions for `n` and `m`, we then consider the values: if `j` is `max_y`, then for the loop to execute again, `m` must be greater than `max_y`, which implies that `j` should be `max_y + 1`. If `j` is `min_y`, we can set `j` to `min_y + 1` under the same condition on `m`.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, we need the state to reflect the incremented value of `j`. The value of `m` must also be defined to accommodate this increment.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is either `min_x` or `max_x`, `m` is greater than `max_y`, and `j` is either `min_y + 1` or `max_y + 1`**
