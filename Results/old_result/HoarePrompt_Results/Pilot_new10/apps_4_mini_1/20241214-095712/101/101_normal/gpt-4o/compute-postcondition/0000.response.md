The code assigns `None` to the variables `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`. These variables are initialized but do not affect other variables or values in the state as they were empty before. Therefore, the only change is that `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are all set to `None`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers representing the dimensions of the monitor resolution where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000; `screen` is a list of strings with length n, where each string has a length of m containing characters either '.' (representing a black pixel) or 'w' (representing a white pixel); `top` is None, `bottom` is None, `left` is None, `right` is None.**
