Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers â‰¥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 0, and `j` is 2. If `screen[i][j]` is 'w', and if `top` is None, then `top` is set to 0, `bottom` is set to 0, `left` is set to 2, and `right` is set to 2. If `top` is not None and `j` is greater than `right`, the values of `n`, `m`, `screen`, `i`, `j`, `top`, and `bottom` remain unchanged. If `top` is not None and `j` is not greater than `right`, the values of `n`, `m`, `screen`, `i`, `j`, `top`, and `bottom` remain unchanged, as both `j` and `right` equal 2. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
