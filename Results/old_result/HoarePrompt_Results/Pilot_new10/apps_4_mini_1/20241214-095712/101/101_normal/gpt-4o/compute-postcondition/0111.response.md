The value of `left` is assigned the value of `j`. Given that `j` is 0 and is less than `left`, which is a previously defined value (not specified in the state but assumed to be greater than 0), the value of `left` will change to 0. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer ≥ 2, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 2, `top` is 2, `bottom` is 2, `left` is 0, `right` is the maximum column index of 'w' encountered, `j` is 0, and `screen[2][0]` is 'w'.**
