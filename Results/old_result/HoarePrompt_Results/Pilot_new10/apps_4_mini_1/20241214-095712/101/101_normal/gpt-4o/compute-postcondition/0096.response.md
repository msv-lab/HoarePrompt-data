Output State: **`n` is an integer ≥ 2, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 1, `top` is the minimum row index of 'w' encountered, `bottom` is the maximum row index of 'w' encountered, `left` is the minimum column index of 'w' encountered, `right` is the maximum column index of 'w' encountered. If 'w' is not encountered in row `i`, then `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged (i.e., `top` remains None if it was initially None, and `left`, `right`, `bottom` will not be updated). If multiple 'w's are found in row `i`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` will reflect the furthest indices encountered in the loop.**
