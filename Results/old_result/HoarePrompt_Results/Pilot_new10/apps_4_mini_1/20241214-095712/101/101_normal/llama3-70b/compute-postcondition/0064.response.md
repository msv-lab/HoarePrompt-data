Postcondition: ***If `n` is greater than `max_x`, then for `i` equal to `max_x + 1`, `m` is greater than 1, and `j` equal to 2, if `pixels[i][j]` is either '+', 'w', or '.', then `pixels[i][j]` will be assigned the value of '.'; if `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', control will move to the next iteration of the loop.***
