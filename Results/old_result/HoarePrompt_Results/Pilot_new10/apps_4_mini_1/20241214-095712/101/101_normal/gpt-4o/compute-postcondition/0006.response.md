The code assigns the value of `j` (which is 0) to both `left` and `right`. This means that `left` will now be 0 and `right` will also be 0. The other variables are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is an integer ≥ 1, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w', `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, `left` is 0, `right` is 0**
