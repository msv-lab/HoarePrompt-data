Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description due to the following reasons:

1. **Frame Size and Dimensions**: According to the problem, Innocentius needs to paint a single-pixel wide square frame around the white pixels ('w'). The code checks the height and width of the frame derived from the outermost 'w' characters. However, it incorrectly returns -1 if either of these dimensions is less than 2. The requirement states that a frame can and should exist even for the smallest configuration of:
   - A single white pixel, which would create a 1x1 frame (just the pixel itself).
   - Two white pixels aligned vertically or horizontally, which would produce a minimal frame but should still be displayed correctly.

2. **Return of -1**: The program returns -1 too soon (before even attempting to draw the frame). This effectively means the function will fail for cases where the smallest possible frame is indeed a valid frame size, which contradicts the problem requirements.

3. **Frame Drawing Logic**: The part of the code responsible for constructing the frame sets the outer boundary pixels to '+' only if they are '.', which is correct; however, if the height or width is less than 2, it skips the frame entirely. Based on the problem statement, this does not adhere to the requirement of constructing the smallest possible frame containing all the white pixels.

As a result, the program fails to handle edge cases and does not guarantee that a valid frame can be created as explicitly stated in the problem description. Thus, it does not fulfill the criteria given by the task.
