According to the code, the loop will iterate over the `white_pixels` list, which must contain at least 2 tuples for the loop to run. At the end of the last iteration, `white_pixels` must have at least 2 tuples. As the loop processes each tuple in `white_pixels`, it will update `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` based on each tuple's `x` and `y` values.

In order for the loop to execute one more time, the `white_pixels` list must still contain at least 3 tuples, as one tuple would have been processed in the most recent iteration. Therefore, if the previous tuple was processed, the next tuple will be the third one in `white_pixels`.

Thus, the relevant variables should be adjusted as follows: 
- The count of tuples in `white_pixels` should reflect at least 3 tuples.
- The current (x, y) pair should represent the third tuple in the list.

State: **`n` is assigned, `m` is assigned, `pixels` is a list of `n` strings with `m` characters, `white_pixels` must have at least 3 tuples, (x, y) is the third tuple in the list, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` must be the updated values after processing the first two tuples.**
