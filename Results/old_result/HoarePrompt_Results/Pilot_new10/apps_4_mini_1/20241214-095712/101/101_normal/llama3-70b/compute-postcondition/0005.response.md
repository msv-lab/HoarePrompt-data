The variables `min_x` and `min_y` are updated to the minimum of their current values and the values of `x` and `y`, respectively. Given that `white_pixels` contains at least one tuple `(x, y)`, these variables will take on new values based on that tuple. 

After evaluating:
- `min_x` is updated to be the smaller value between its current value and `x`.
- `min_y` is updated to be the smaller value between its current value and `y`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is assigned, `m` is assigned, `pixels` is a list of `n` strings with `m` characters, `white_pixels` must contain at least 1 tuple, `(x, y)` is the first tuple in `white_pixels`; `min_x` is updated to min(min_x, x); `min_y` is updated to min(min_y, y).**
