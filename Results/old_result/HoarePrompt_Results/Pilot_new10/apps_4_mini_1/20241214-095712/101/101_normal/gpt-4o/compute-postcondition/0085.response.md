The code `left = right = j` assigns the value of `j` to both `left` and `right`. The prior value of `j` is 2, hence both `left` and `right` will now be 2. The values of other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer ≥ 2, `m` is an integer > 2, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 1, `bottom` is 1, `top` is 1, `left` is 2, `right` is 2, `j` is 2, `screen[1][0]` remains 'w'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer ≥ 2, `m` is an integer > 2, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 1, `bottom` is 1, `top` is 1, `left` is 2, `right` is 2, `j` is 2, `screen[1][0]` remains 'w'**.
