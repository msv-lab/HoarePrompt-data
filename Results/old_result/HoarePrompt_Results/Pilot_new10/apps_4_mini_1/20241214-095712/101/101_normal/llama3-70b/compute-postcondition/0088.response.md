Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `max_x + 2`, `i` is `max_x + 2`, `m` is greater than 2, and `j` is 2. If `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or (j == max_y))` and `pixels[i][j]` is a '.', then `pixels[i][j]` is updated to '+'. Otherwise, if `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', the variables `n`, `i`, `m`, and `j` remain unchanged. If `pixels[i][j]` is not 'w', it is updated to '.' while `n`, `i`, `m`, and `j` remain unchanged.***
