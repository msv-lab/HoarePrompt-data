The values of `left` and `right` are both set to the value of `j`, which is 1. The previous value of `left` could either have been 0 or a value updated to `j` if `j` was less than `left`, and the previous value of `right` would have been updated to `j` if `j` was greater than `right`. However, after the code execution, both `left` and `right` are now equal to `j`, which is 1. 

Therefore, the output state should reflect that:

Output State: **`n` is an integer ≥ 2, `m` is an integer ≥ 2, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 1, `top` is 1, `bottom` is 1, `left` is 1, `right` is 1, `j` is 1, and the current value of `screen[1][0]` remains 'w'.**
