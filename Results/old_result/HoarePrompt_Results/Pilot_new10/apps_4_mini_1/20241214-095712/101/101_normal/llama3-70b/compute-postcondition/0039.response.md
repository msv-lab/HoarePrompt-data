Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 0; `i` is either `min_x` or `max_x`; `m` is greater than `max_y + 1`; and `j` is either `min_y + 2` or `max_y + 2`. If `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', then certain operations related to a 'w' pixel are performed (not specified here). Otherwise, `pixels[i][j]` is '.', indicating a different state or operation is executed.***
