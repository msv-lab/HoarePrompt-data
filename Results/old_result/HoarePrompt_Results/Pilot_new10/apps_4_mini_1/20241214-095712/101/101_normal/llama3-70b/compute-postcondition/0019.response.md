According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `m`. For the loop to execute at least once, `m` must be greater than 0. Since the initial state indicates that `n` must be greater than or equal to 0 and `i` is 0, we need to ensure that `m` is defined and greater than 0 for the loop to run. As such, the state must adjust to reflect this requirement, and the variable `j` must be initialized to 0, which is the starting value for the range.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0**
