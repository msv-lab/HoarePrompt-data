The variable `bottom` is assigned the value of `i`. The initial value of `i` is 2, so `bottom` will also become 2. The previous state of `bottom` is the maximum row index of 'w' encountered, but now it will be updated to 2. The other variables remain unaffected by this assignment. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer ≥ 2, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 2, `top` is 2, `bottom` is 2, `left` is the minimum column index of 'w' encountered, `right` is the maximum column index of 'w' encountered, `j` is 0, the value of `screen[2][0]` is 'w', and the current value of `i` is greater than `bottom`.**
