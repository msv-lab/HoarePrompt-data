The value of `bottom` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 0. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `screen`, `j`, and `top`) remain unchanged as the code only affects `bottom`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer ≥ 1, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `top` is 0, and `bottom` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer ≥ 1, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0.**
