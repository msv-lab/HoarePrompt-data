Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer â‰¥ 2, `m` is an integer > 2, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 1, `bottom` remains 1, `top` is 1, `left` is 1, `right` is 1, `j` is 2, and `screen[1][0]` remains 'w'. Since `i` is not less than `top`, the condition is false and the program will not execute the contents inside the if block, remaining in its current state.***
