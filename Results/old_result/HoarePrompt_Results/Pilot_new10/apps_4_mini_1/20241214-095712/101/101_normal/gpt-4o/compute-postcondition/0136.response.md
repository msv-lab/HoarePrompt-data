The code assigns the value of `i` to `bottom`. Given that `i` is 2, the value of `bottom` will be updated to 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged since they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State will reflect the unchanged variables and the updated value of `bottom`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer â‰¥ 2, `m` is an integer > 2, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 2, `top` is 2, `bottom` is 2, `left` is undefined, `right` is undefined, `j` is 2**
