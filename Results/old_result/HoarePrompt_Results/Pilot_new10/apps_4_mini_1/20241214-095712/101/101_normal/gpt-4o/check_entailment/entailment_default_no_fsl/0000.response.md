Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle situations where the frame is supposed to be of minimum size while still enclosing all the 'w' pixels. The description states that the frame should have a width of 1 pixel and contain all 'w' pixels. The logic currently checks for the outermost 'w' pixels and returns a frame only if the height and width are at least 2, which doesn't adhere to the requirement of having a valid frame (even a single pixel frame). 

For instance, consider the input:

```
2 4
....
.w..
```

The expected output is:

```
....
.w..
```

But the program checks for the frame height and width being at least 2 before returning -1. This will incorrectly return -1 even though a valid frame that meets the requirements exists, which is just the 'w' itself without a frame. 

Moreover, if there's a case where multiple 'w' pixels exist but they still form a valid frame of non-zero size less than the 2 pixels in height or width, the program would return -1, which contradicts the requirements outlined in the problem. 

Hence, the program fails to correctly print all valid outputs for all potential edge cases as described in the problem statement.
