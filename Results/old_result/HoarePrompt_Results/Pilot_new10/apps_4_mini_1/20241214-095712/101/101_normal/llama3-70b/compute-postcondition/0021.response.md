The assignment `pixels[i][j] = '+'` updates the specific position in the `pixels` array at the indices `i` and `j` to the character `'+'`. The variable `i` is either `min_x` or `max_x`, and the variable `j` is either `min_y` or `max_y`, but the values of `n`, `m`, or any other variable remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is either `min_x` or `max_x`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is either `min_y` or `max_y`, and `pixels[i][j]` is now '+'**.
