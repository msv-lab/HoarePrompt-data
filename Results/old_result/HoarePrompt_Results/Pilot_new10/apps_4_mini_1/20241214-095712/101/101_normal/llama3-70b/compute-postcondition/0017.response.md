Postcondition: ***`n` is assigned, `m` is assigned, `pixels` is a list of `n` strings with `m` characters, `white_pixels` contains all tuples `(x, y)` for each position where `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', `min_x` is the minimum x-coordinate of all white pixels, `min_y` is the minimum y-coordinate of all white pixels, `max_x` is the maximum x-coordinate of all white pixels, `max_y` is the maximum y-coordinate of all white pixels, and `frame_size` is less than or equal to `max(n, m)`***
