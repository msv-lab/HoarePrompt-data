The code assigns the value of `i` to `bottom`. The value of `i` is 0, which means that `bottom` will also now be set to 0. The other variables remain unchanged since none of them are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is an integer ≥ 1, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, `left` is 0, and `right` remains unchanged.**
