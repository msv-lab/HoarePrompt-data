The code assigns the value of `j` (which is 2) to both `left` and `right`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer ≥ 1, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, `left` is 2, `right` is 2**
