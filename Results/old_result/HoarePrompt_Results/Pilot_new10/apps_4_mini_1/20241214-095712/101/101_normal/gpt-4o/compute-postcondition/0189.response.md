Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer ≥ 1, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `top` is an integer, `bottom` is an integer where `bottom ≥ top + 1`, `left` is an integer, `right` is an integer where `right ≥ left`, `frame_height` is equal to `bottom - top + 1`, `frame_width` is equal to `right - left + 1`, `result` is a list of lists of characters from `screen`, where positions `(i, j)` such that `i == top` or `i == bottom` or `j == left` or `j == right` have been updated to '+', maintaining unchanged positions for other elements in `result`. The current values of `i` and `j` satisfy the conditions that either `i` is equal to `top`, or `i` is equal to `bottom`, or `j` is equal to `left`, or `j` is equal to `right`.***
