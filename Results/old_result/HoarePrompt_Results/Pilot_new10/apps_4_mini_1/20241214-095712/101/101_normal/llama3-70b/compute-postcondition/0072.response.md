The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration of that loop. In this scenario, since we have a `continue` statement, it doesn't change the values of `n`, `i`, `m`, `j`, or `pixels[i][j]`. The values and conditions provided in the initial state remain valid as is. 

Therefore, the output state will retain all the initial conditions since no variables are modified, but it indicates that the loop iteration will continue, potentially skipping to the next element according to the loop's logic.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `max_x + 2`, `i` is `max_x + 2`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `pixels[i][j]` has been updated accordingly, the value of `i` is neither `min_x` nor `max_x`, `j` is not `min_y`, and `j` is not `max_y`, or `pixels[i][j]` is not equal to '.', the current value of `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
