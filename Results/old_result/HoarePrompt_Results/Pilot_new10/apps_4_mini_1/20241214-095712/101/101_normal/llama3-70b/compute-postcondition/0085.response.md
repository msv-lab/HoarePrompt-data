The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration without changing the values of any variables. Therefore, the states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `max_x + 2`, `i` is `max_x + 2`, `m` is greater than 2, and `j` is 2 (no variables have changed)**.
