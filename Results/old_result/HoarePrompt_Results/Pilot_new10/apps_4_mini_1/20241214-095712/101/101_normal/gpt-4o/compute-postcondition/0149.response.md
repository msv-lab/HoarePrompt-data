The variable `frame_height` is assigned the value `bottom - top + 1`. The values of `top` and `bottom` are previously defined and must both be integers corresponding to the row indices of 'w' encountered. The other states of the variables such as `n`, `m`, `screen`, `left`, and `right` remain unaffected. 

Therefore, `frame_height` will be calculated as the difference between the maximum row index (`bottom`) and minimum row index (`top`), plus one. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer ≥ 1, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are all integers corresponding to the indices of 'w' encountered, and `frame_height` is equal to `bottom - top + 1`.**
