According to the code, the for loop will execute if the list `white_pixels` contains at least one tuple representing a position where `pixels[i][j]` is 'w'. The variables `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` are initialized for possible tracking of coordinates, but they don't affect the execution of the loop itself. 

Before the loop starts, `n`, `m`, and `pixels` are set up, but the key condition for the loop to execute pertains to the `white_pixels` list. Therefore, the list must contain at least one entry, which would imply that there is at least one 'w' in the `pixels`.

To ensure the loop can execute, the following adjustments are necessary:
- Ensure `white_pixels` is not empty. 
- The first tuple in `white_pixels` can be accessed with `(x, y)` during the first loop iteration.

State: **`n` is assigned, `m` is assigned, `pixels` is a list of `n` strings with `m` characters, `white_pixels` must contain at least 1 tuple, `(x, y)` is the first tuple in `white_pixels`**.
