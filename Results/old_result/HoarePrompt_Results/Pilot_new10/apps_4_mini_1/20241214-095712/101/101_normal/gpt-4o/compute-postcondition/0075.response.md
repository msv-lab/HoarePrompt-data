The value of `bottom` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 1. Since the other variables remain unchanged, the output state reflects only the updated value of `bottom`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer ≥ 2, `m` is an integer ≥ 2, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 1, `top` is 1, `left` is either 0 or updated to the value of `j` if `j` is less than `left`, and `right` is updated to the value of `j` if `j` is greater than `right`, `j` is 1, `bottom` is 1.**
