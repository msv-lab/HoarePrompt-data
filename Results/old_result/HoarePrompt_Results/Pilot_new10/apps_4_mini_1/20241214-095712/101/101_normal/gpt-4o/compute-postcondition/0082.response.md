Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer ≥ 2, `m` is an integer ≥ 2, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 1, `bottom` remains 1. If `screen[1][1]` is 'w', and `top` is None, then `top`, `left`, and `right` are each set to 1, with `j` being 1 and `screen[1][0]` remaining 'w'. If `top` is not None, then `top` is set to 1, `bottom` remains 1, and if `j` is greater than `right`, then `right` is updated to `j`; if `j` is less than or equal to `right`, the states of the other variables remain unchanged.***
