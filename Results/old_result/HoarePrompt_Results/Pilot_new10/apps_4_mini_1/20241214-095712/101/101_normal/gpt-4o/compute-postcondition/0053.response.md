The value of `top` is assigned the value of `i`, and the value of `bottom` is also assigned the value of `i`. The current value of `i` is 1. Therefore, both `top` and `bottom` will have the value of 1 after execution. The values of other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer ≥ 2, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 1, `top` is 1, `bottom` is 1, `left` is the minimum column index of 'w', `right` is the maximum column index of 'w', `j` is 0, and the current value of `screen[1][0]` is 'w'.**
