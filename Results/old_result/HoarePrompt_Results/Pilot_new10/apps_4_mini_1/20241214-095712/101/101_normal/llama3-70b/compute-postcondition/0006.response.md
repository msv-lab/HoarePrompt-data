The values of `max_x` and `max_y` are updated to be the maximum of their current values and the values of `x` and `y`, respectively. The values of `max_x` and `max_y` can be updated depending on their previous values but are influenced by the assigned values of `x` and `y`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is assigned, `m` is assigned, `pixels` is a list of `n` strings with `m` characters, `white_pixels` contains at least 1 tuple `(x, y)`, `min_x` is updated to min(min_x, x), `min_y` is updated to min(min_y, y), and `max_x` is updated to max(previous max_x, x), `max_y` is updated to max(previous max_y, y).

Output State: **`n` is assigned, `m` is assigned, `pixels` is a list of `n` strings with `m` characters, `white_pixels` contains at least 1 tuple `(x, y)`, `min_x` is updated to min(min_x, x), `min_y` is updated to min(min_y, y), `max_x` is updated to max(previous max_x, x), `max_y` is updated to max(previous max_y, y)**.
