Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `max_x + 2`, `i` is `max_x + 2`, `m` is greater than 0, and `j` is 0. If `pixels[i][j]` equals 'w', the program will continue to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, `pixels[i][j]` is '.', and it was not equal to 'w', indicating that it represents a different state, while other conditions regarding the values of `i` and `j` being within specified bounds are maintained.***
