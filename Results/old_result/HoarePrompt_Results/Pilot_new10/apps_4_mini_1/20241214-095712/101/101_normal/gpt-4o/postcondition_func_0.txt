The function accepts two integer parameters `n` and `m`, and a list of strings `screen`, which represents a monitor resolution containing characters either '.' or 'w'. It returns -1 if 'w' is not found in the screen or if the resulting frame's height or width is less than 2. If 'w' is found, it returns a modified list, where all boundary positions composed of '.' within the identified rectangle defined by the outermost 'w' characters are replaced with '+', while all other positions remain unchanged.
