Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer ≥ 2, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 1 which is not greater than `bottom` (1), if `j` is greater than `right`, `right` is updated to the value of `j`, and `left` is set to the value of `j` if `j` is less than `left`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.***
