The values of `top` and `bottom` are both assigned the value of `i`, which is 0. Therefore, after execution, `top` and `bottom` will both be 0. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer ≥ 1, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, `left` is set to 0, and `right` remains unchanged.**
