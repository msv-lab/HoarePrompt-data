Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer â‰¥ 2, `m` is an integer > 2, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 2, `top` is 2, `bottom` is 2, `left` is 2, `right` is 2, `j` is 2. If `top` is None, then `left` and `right` are set to 2, while all other variables remain unchanged. If `top` is not None and `j` is greater than `right`, no state changes occur and all variables retain their values.***
