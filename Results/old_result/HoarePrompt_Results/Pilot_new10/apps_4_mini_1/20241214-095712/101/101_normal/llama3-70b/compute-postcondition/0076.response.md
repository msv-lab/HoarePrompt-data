Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `max_x + 2`, `i` is `max_x + 2`, `m` is greater than 0, and `j` is 0. If either `i` equals `min_x`, `max_x`, or `j` equals `min_y`, or `j` equals `max_y`, and `pixels[i][j]` was previously equal to '.', then `pixels[i][j]` is updated to '+'. If `pixels[i][j]` equals 'w', the program will continue to the next iteration of the loop; otherwise, `pixels[i][j]` remains '.', and it will hold a different state, while the structure and bounds for `i` and `j` remain intact.***
