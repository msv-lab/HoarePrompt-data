Output State: **`pixels` contains symbols where:
- Each pixel boundary defined by `min_x`, `max_x`, `min_y`, and `max_y` has been updated to '+' if they were originally '.'.
- Pixels corresponding to 'w' remain unchanged.
- All other pixels have been converted to '.'.
- If `n` is 0, `pixels` is an empty list.
- If `m` is 0, `pixels` would consist of empty strings for each row, reflecting dimensions, while no changes occur to content since there are no iterations possible.**
