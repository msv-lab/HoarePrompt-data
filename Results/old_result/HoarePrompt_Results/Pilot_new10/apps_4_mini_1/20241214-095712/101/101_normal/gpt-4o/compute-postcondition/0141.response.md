Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer â‰¥ 2, `m` is an integer > 2, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 2, `top` is 2, `bottom` is 2, `left` is 2, `right` is 2, `j` is 2. If `j` is greater than `right`, the condition is satisfied, and no state changes occur, since `j` is equal to `right`.***
