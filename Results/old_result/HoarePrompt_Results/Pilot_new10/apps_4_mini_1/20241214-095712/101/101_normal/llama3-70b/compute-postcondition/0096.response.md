The code provided executes a print statement that takes each row from the `pixels` list and joins them into a single string without any separators before printing. Since we are not modifying any variables or their values in this code, the state of the existing variables remains the same. However, a string composed of the joined rows will be printed to the console.

Output State: **`pixels` is a list of at least one non-empty row, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 0, and there must be at least one non-empty row left to process; a string composed of the joined rows of `pixels` has been printed.**
