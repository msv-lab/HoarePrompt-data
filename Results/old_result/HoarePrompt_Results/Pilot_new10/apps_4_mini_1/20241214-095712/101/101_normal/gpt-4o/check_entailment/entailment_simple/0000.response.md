To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, I will analyze the function and its implementation step by step.

### Problem Summary:
The goal is to find the smallest square frame around the white pixels ('w') on a monitor grid (represented by characters) and replace the boundary pixels of that frame with '+' characters. If the frame cannot be created (i.e., there are not enough white pixels to form a frame), it should return -1.

### Key Criteria from Problem Description:
1. The frame must be exactly 1 pixel wide.
2. All white pixels ('w') on the monitor must be located on the frame.
3. The frame cannot extend beyond the borders of the screen.
4. Among all valid frames, the one with the smallest size must be chosen.

### Program Analysis:
- **Finding Boundaries:** The program correctly identifies the boundaries of the white pixels by iterating through the `screen` and determining the minimum and maximum coordinates for white pixels (`top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`).
- **Frame Size Validation:** After identifying boundaries, the program checks if the frame dimensions (height and width) are both at least 2. This check is necessary since a valid frame requires at least one row and one column of black pixels. However, the original problem statement does not specify that the frame dimensions must be greater than or equal to 2; it only implies the presence of a frame.
- **Setting the Frame:** The program sets the frame on the areas in the `result` grid where there are black pixels ('.') along the determined boundaries. This aligns with the requirement to display the frame properly.

### Issues:
1. **Minimum Frame Size Check:** The condition that the frame_height and frame_width need to be at least 2 is incorrect. A frame surrounding only one pixel (frame size of 1) is valid but is incorrectly evaluated and would lead the program to incorrectly return -1. For example, if there's only one white pixel, it should still return a correct frame with a size of 1, but the code currently returns -1.
  
2. **Boundary Case Handling:** If all white pixels are in such a manner that they require just a single pixel boundary (like `w` surrounded by `.`), the program should be able to handle that but instead prematurely exits.

### Conclusion:
Due to the invalid requirement that the frame's height and width must be at least 2, the provided program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description in all potential cases, particularly when there is only a need for a 1-pixel frame. Hence, the solution may not give correct outputs for valid cases.

Correctness: **False**
