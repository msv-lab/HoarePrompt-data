The command `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. Since there are no variables being modified or assigned new values as a result of this command, the original values of all affected variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the same initial values as before.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is either `min_x` or `max_x`, `m` is greater than `max_y`, and `j` is either `min_y + 1` or `max_y + 1` and we skip the current iteration of the loop.**
