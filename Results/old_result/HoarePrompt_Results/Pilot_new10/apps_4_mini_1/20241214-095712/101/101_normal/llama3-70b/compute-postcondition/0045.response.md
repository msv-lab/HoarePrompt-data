The code assigns the value `'+'` to the specified position in the `pixels` array at indices `[i][j]`. Given that `i` is `max_x + 1`, and `j` is `0`, this indicates that we are working within a valid state where the prior condition on `pixels[i][j]` having the value `'.'` is met. 

No other variables are changed. The state of the other variables remains valid. Therefore, we state the updated conditions accordingly.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `max_x`, `i` is `max_x + 1`, `m` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0, and `pixels[max_x + 1][0]` is now '+'**
