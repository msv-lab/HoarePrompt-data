The value of `left` is assigned the value of `j`, which is 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged as the code only modifies `left`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer ≥ 2, `m` is an integer > 2, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 1, `bottom` is 1, `top` is 1, `left` is 2, `right` is 1, `j` is 2, and `screen[1][0]` remains 'w'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer ≥ 2, `m` is an integer > 2, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 1, `bottom` is 1, `top` is 1, `left` is 2, `right` is 1, `j` is 2, and `screen[1][0]` remains 'w'.**
