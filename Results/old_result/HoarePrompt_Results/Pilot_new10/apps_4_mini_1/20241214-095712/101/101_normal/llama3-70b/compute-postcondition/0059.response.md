According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `m`. If `j` is currently less than `m`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and for the loop to continue iterating, `m` must be greater than 1, leading to the next value of `j` being 2.

State: **If `n` is greater than `max_x`, `i` is `max_x + 1`, `m` is greater than 1, and `j` is 2.**
