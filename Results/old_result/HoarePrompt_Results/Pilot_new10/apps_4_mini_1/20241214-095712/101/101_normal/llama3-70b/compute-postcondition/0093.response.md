According to the code, the loop iterates over each row in the `pixels` list. Since `pixels` is stated to have at least one non-empty row, the loop can execute at least once. At the end of the last iteration, the loop has processed a row, which means it will move on to the next row in the next iteration. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `pixels` must still contain at least one more non-empty row after the current row has been processed. As the loop processes each row sequentially, we need to determine the index of the next row.

Since the current state indicates that a row has just been printed, and the next iteration would involve the next row, we can conclude that the number of rows processed would increase by one.

State: **`pixels` is a list of at least one non-empty row, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 0, and there must be at least one non-empty row left to process.**
