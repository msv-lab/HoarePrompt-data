According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the values of `top` and `bottom`. Since `n` is an integer ≥ 1, the possible values of `top` and `bottom` must ensure that the range from `top` to `bottom + 1` includes at least one valid integer. 

Given that `top` and `bottom` must be integers and `bottom` should be greater than or equal to `top` for the loop to execute correctly, for the loop to be executed, we need to verify that:

1. `top` and `bottom` are within valid bounds. Specifically, if `top` is less than or equal to `bottom`, the loop will execute.
2. The value of `i` should be initialized with the value of `top` before the first iteration.

Since it is already stated that `n` is ≥ 1, and as `top` ≤ `bottom`, it indicates that `bottom` is at least `top`. Therefore, there is no further specific adjustment required as long as the bounds are satisfied.

State: **`n` is an integer ≥ 1, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `top` is an integer, `bottom` is an integer where `bottom ≥ top`, `left` is an integer, `right` is an integer, `frame_height` is equal to `bottom - top + 1`, and `frame_width` is equal to `right - left + 1`, `result` is a list of lists of characters from `screen`, `i` is initialized to `top`**
