In the provided code, `pixels[i][j]` is assigned the value `'+'`. The state of the variables `n`, `i`, `m`, and `j` does not change during this operation. Since `i` is either `min_x` or `max_x`, and `j` is either `min_y + 2` or `max_y + 2`, `pixels` will be modified at the specified indices as per `i` and `j`, but this does not change the values of `n`, `i`, `m`, or `j`. Therefore, the only change in the output state pertains to the array `pixels`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0; `i` is either `min_x` or `max_x`; `m` is greater than `max_y + 1`; and `j` is either `min_y + 2` or `max_y + 2; pixels[i][j] is now '+'**
