Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer ≥ 1, `m` is an integer ≥ 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `n`, `i` is 0, and `j` is 1. If `screen[i][j]` is 'w' and `top` is None, then `top` and `bottom` are both set to 0, `left` is updated to 1, with `right` also updated to 1. If `top` is not None, then `top` remains unchanged, `bottom` remains None, `left` remains 1, and if `j` is not greater than `right`, the state remains unchanged. If `screen[i][j]` is not 'w', the state of all variables remains unchanged.***
