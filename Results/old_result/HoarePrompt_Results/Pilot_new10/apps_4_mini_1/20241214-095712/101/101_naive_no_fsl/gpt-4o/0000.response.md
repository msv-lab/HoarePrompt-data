To verify the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze its logic and check various cases against the problem description.

1. **Understanding the Code**:
   - The program reads the resolution of the monitor and the display state.
   - It then seeks to identify the bounding box of the white pixels ('w').
   - The algorithm calculates the top, bottom, left, and right boundaries of the white pixels.
   - If there are fewer than 2 pixels between the top and bottom or the left and right boundaries (i.e., frame height < 2 or frame width < 2), it returns -1, which indicates that a valid frame can't be constructed.
   - It attempts to draw a frame by replacing '.' with '+' along the borders of the rectangle defined by the identified boundaries.

2. **Identifying Potential Issues**:
   - The main logic flaw is in the condition to determine whether the frame can be drawn. If there's a single white pixel or if the identified rectangle is too small, the program quickly returns -1. However, note that any frame with a single pixel width (which contains another pixel within it) would still be considered valid; it does not always require a full rectangle.
   - The logic also does not consider edge cases where a single row or column has 'w' but is placed in such a way that a frame is technically possible. For example, it doesn't handle cases where 'w's might be present but spaced far to the edges, leaving a gap that still could allow for a frame.

3. **Example Test Case**:
   - Consider the following grid:
     ```
     3 5
     .....
     .w...
     .w...
     ```
   - According to the description, a frame around these 'w's should be possible:
     ```
     ..+..
     +w+..
     +w+..
     ```
   - However, running the provided code would give -1, falsely claiming no valid frame exists since the top to bottom height is only 2.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The program incorrectly handles cases where narrow frames could still be valid because it's overly restrictive in validating frame bounds.
   - Therefore, the correctness of the program is as follows:

Correctness: **False**
