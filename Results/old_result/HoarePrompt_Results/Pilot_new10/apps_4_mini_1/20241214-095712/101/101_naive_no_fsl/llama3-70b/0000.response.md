Correctness: **False**

The program attempts to find the smallest square frame around white pixels on a monitor, but it has several issues. Here's a notable case where it may not work correctly:

Consider the following input:

```
3 3
w..
...
..w
```

In this case, the maximal bounding box around the white pixels would be from `(0, 0)` to `(2, 2)`. The program would incorrectly calculate a frame since it looks for the maximum frame size within the bounds of the monitor's dimensions `n` and `m`. However, there are no pixels at `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, or `(2, 1)`, thus creating a situation where not all white pixels can be encompassed in a frame, leading potentially to no valid frame. The code would still output a frame. 

The output frame from the program would be:

```
w+.
+..
..w
```

This output is invalid since the frame does not encapsulate all white pixels. Specifically, white pixels at `(0, 0)` and `(2, 2)` are not correctly framed, and the program fails to return `-1` when appropriate. 

Thus, the correct conclusion is that the code does not handle the constraints properly in certain scenarios, leading to incorrect behavior.
