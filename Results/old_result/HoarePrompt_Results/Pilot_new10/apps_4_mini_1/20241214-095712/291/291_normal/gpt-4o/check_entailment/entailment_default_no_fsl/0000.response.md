Correctness: **False**

The code does not correctly calculate the minimum number of segments needed for all cases. Specifically, it includes a logical flaw in how it determines the number of segments. The number of segments to draw is expected to be based on how Sofia can draw squares efficiently using segments that are already drawn. 

The input given, such as `n = 4`, should yield an output of `4`. However, the code uses the formula `segments_needed = 2 * (a + b)` without correctly considering the overlapping segments that can occur when arranging squares optimally. Furthermore, the logic doesn't account for multiple squares effectively using the drawn segments.

For `n = 6`, for instance, according to the description, Sofia needs to draw only 6 segments if she maximizes shared segments efficiently. However, according to the logic employed in the code, the outputs might not yield this correctly due to the flawed iteration and calculation.

Thus, we can conclude that the code does not fulfill the problem description for every potential case and does not guarantee correctness.
