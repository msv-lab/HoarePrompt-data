You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Little Sofia is in fourth grade. Today in the geometry lesson she learned about segments and squares. On the way home, she decided to draw $n$ squares in the snow with a side length of $1$. For simplicity, we assume that Sofia lives on a plane and can draw only segments of length $1$, parallel to the coordinate axes, with vertices at integer points.

In order to draw a segment, Sofia proceeds as follows. If she wants to draw a vertical segment with the coordinates of the ends $(x, y)$ and $(x, y+1)$. Then Sofia looks if there is already a drawn segment with the coordinates of the ends $(x', y)$ and $(x', y+1)$ for some $x'$. If such a segment exists, then Sofia quickly draws a new segment, using the old one as a guideline. If there is no such segment, then Sofia has to take a ruler and measure a new segment for a long time. Same thing happens when Sofia wants to draw a horizontal segment, but only now she checks for the existence of a segment with the same coordinates $x$, $x+1$ and the differing coordinate $y$.

For example, if Sofia needs to draw one square, she will have to draw two segments using a ruler:  [Image] 

After that, she can draw the remaining two segments, using the first two as a guide:  [Image] 

If Sofia needs to draw two squares, she will have to draw three segments using a ruler:  [Image] 

After that, she can draw the remaining four segments, using the first three as a guide:  [Image] 

Sofia is in a hurry, so she wants to minimize the number of segments that she will have to draw with a ruler without a guide. Help her find this minimum number.


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^{9}$), the number of squares that Sofia wants to draw.


-----Output-----

Print single integer, the minimum number of segments that Sofia will have to draw with a ruler without a guide in order to draw $n$ squares in the manner described above.

def func_1(n):
    min_segments_needed = float('inf')
    for a in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        b = (n + a - 1) // a
        segments_needed = 2 * (a + b)
        min_segments_needed = min(min_segments_needed, segments_needed)
    return min_segments_needed


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The provided program aims to calculate the minimum number of segments that Sofia will have to draw with a ruler without a guide, given `n` squares. The approach uses a mathematical method to find the suitable dimensions of the rectangle formed by `n` squares through the `for` loop iterating over possible widths.

However, there is a crucial flaw in the code when it comes to calculating the needed segments. Specifically, this logic fails to account for the fact that if `n` squares can perfectly fill a rectangle with dimensions `a` by `b`, there will be a corresponding number of segments that can be reused. The code does not ensure it returns the correct minimal number for all cases, particularly when `n` is a perfect square or gets close to forming one.

For example:
- If `n = 4`, the calculation should ideally yield `4` segments needed, as Sofia can arrange the squares into a `2 x 2` formation that allows maximal reuse of segments. The program may yield `6` segments (which is calculated for a rectangle of size `2 x 3`, just as an example derived from mismanagement of `a` and `b`).

Another case:
- For `n = 5`, the program may incorrectly suggest the number of segments without correctly accounting for how Sofia can utilize existing rows and columns.

Thus, the oversight in ensuring the right configuration of segments based on Sofia's drawing strategy leads to incorrect results, confirming that the program does not satisfy all scenarios required by the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
n = int(input().strip())
print(func_1(n))

import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9.
def func_1(n):
    min_segments_needed = float('inf')
    for a in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        b = (n + a - 1) // a
        
        segments_needed = 2 * (a + b)
        
        min_segments_needed = min(min_segments_needed, segments_needed)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `min_segments_needed` is the minimum segments needed for all `a` from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(n))`, `b` is the corresponding maximum integer value calculated for the last executed `a`, and `segments_needed` is equal to the minimum segments calculated from the last iteration; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9.
    return min_segments_needed
    #The program returns the minimum segments needed for all `a` from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(n))`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` (where 1 <= n <= 10^9) and calculates the minimum number of segments needed based on possible values of `a` from 1 to the integer square root of `n`. For each value of `a`, it computes the corresponding value of `b`, determining the number of segments required, and returns the minimum segments needed across all iterations.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
