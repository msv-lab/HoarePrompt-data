Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if there are non-negative integers \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(x \cdot a + y \cdot b = n\). 

- It iterates over all possible counts of Ber-Cola bottles \(x\) that can be bought within the budget (i.e., from 0 to \(n // a\)).
- For each \(x\), it checks if there exists a valid count \(y\) of Bars bars by ensuring the remaining budget after purchasing \(x\) bottles of Ber-Cola is divisible by the cost of one Bars bar \(b\).
- If a valid combination is found, it prints "YES" along with the quantities \(x\) and \(y\). If no combination is valid after checking all possible values of \(x\), it appropriately prints "NO".

The program correctly handles all specified cases, including situations where either \(x\) or \(y\) can be zero, and satisfies all input constraints without any errors. Therefore, I don't see any examples where this program fails based on the problem description.
