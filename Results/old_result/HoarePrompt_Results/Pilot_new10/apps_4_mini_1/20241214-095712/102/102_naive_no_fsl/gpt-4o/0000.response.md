Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description. It searches for two non-negative integers \( x \) (the number of Ber-Cola bottles) and \( y \) (the number of Bars bars) such that \( x \cdot a + y \cdot b = n \).

Here's how the program works:
1. It iterates through all possible values of \( x \) from 0 up to \( n // a \) (the maximum number of bottles that can be afforded).
2. For each \( x \), it calculates the remaining money after purchasing \( x \) bottles of Ber-Cola.
3. It checks whether this remaining money can be evenly divided by the cost of a Bars bar \( b \). If it can, then a corresponding \( y \) can be calculated.
4. If it finds suitable values of \( x \) and \( y \), it prints "YES" followed by the values. If the loop completes without finding any valid \( x \) and \( y \), it prints "NO".

To verify correctness, we can consider edge cases:
- For small values of \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \), the code will correctly derive all possible combinations (including zero values).
- It also handles cases where one of the items is significantly more expensive than the other.
- The range for \( x \) is correctly bounded to ensure all reasonable purchases are considered.

Overall, the function systematically checks all necessary combinations to find a valid purchase plan. Since I cannot find any scenario where the program fails to meet the requirements, it is deemed correct.
