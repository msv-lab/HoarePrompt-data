The `print('YES')` statement outputs the string 'YES' to the console, but it does not modify any of the variables. Therefore, the output state remains reflective of the initial state, as it directly affects only the console output.

Output State: **`a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 10,000,000; `b` is an input integer; `n` is a valid integer (can be negative); `x` is 1; `y` is (n - a) // b; the value of `n - x * a` is not divisible by `b`.**
