Final: **True**

The original assessment made a correct determination about the program's correctness. The program adheres to the problem description by correctly implementing the logic to determine whether Vasya can buy non-negative integers \(x\) (bottles of Ber-Cola) and \(y\) (Bars bars) such that the total cost equals \(n\).

The annotations provided confirm that:
- The program correctly reads inputs \(n\), \(a\), and \(b\) which are within defined bounds.
- It iterates through valid values of \(x\) from 0 up to \(n // a\).
- The condition `(n - x * a) % b == 0` checks whether the remaining budget after buying \(x\) bottles of Ber-Cola can be exactly spent on purchasing Bars bars, which correctly identifies valid combinations.
- If at least one valid combination is found, it correctly outputs "YES" along with the values of \(x\) and \(y\). If no valid combination exists, it outputs "NO".

The program's logic handles all edge cases mentioned in the problem description, supports the required outputs, and remains within the constraints provided. The annotations reinforce that it performs as expected without any errors. Thus, the original assessment remains accurate about the program's correctness.
