Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the integer inputs `n`, `a`, and `b`, which represent the total amount of money Vasya has, the cost of one bottle of Ber-Cola, and the cost of one Bars bar, respectively.

2. **Iteration through Possible Combinations**: The program iterates through all possible amounts of Ber-Cola bottles (`x`), ranging from 0 to the maximum number of bottles Vasya can buy (`n // a`). For each value of `x`, it calculates the corresponding number of Bars bars (`y`) that can be purchased with the remaining money after buying `x` bottles of Ber-Cola.

3. **Condition Checking**: Inside the loop, the program checks if the total spent on Ber-Cola and Bars bars equals `n` using the equation `x * a + y * b == n`. If such a pair `(x, y)` is found, it prints "YES" and the values of `x` and `y`, confirming that it is possible to purchase the items for exactly `n` burles.

4. **No Valid Combos**: If the loop completes without finding a valid combination, the program correctly prints "NO", indicating that it is impossible to buy the items while spending exactly `n` burles.

5. **Non-negative Integer Constraints**: The program inherently ensures both `x` and `y` are non-negative integers due to the way the loop and calculations are structured: `x` starts from 0 and can only increase, and `y` is calculated as an integer from valid mathematical operations.

Overall, the logic accurately adheres to the problem requirements, ensuring that for every valid input of `n`, `a`, and `b`, the program correctly determines the possibility of spending exactly `n` burles on the specified items. Hence, the program is correctly implemented following the problem description.
