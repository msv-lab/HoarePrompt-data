The variable `y` is already updated to `(n - a) // b`, and `x` retains its value of 1. The `print` function outputs the current values of `x` and `y`, but the values of `a`, `b`, and `n` remain unchanged. The output consists of the results of `x` and `y`.

Output State: **`a` is an integer within 1 to 10,000,000; `b` is an input integer; `n` is an integer within 1 to 10,000,000; `x` is 1; `y` is (n - a) // b; and the result printed is (1, (n - a) // b)**.
