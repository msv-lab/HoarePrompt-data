According to the code, the loop iterates based on the range defined by `n // a + 1`. The loop will execute as long as the value of `x` is less than or equal to `n // a`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `x` is currently 0. Due to the nature of `range()`, the next value of `x` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `x` must be updated to the next integer value.

Also, since `n` is an integer (which can be negative) and `a` is a positive integer (ranging from 1 to 10,000,000), we need to ensure that `n // a` produces a non-negative index for `x`. Given that the previous state specified that `n - x * a` is not divisible by `b`, this condition will still hold after incrementing `x` by 1.

Since `x` is currently 0, we will update `x` to 1 for the next iteration.

State: **`a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 10,000,000; `b` is an input integer; `n` is a valid integer (can be negative); `x` is 1; the value of `n - x * a` is not divisible by `b`.**
