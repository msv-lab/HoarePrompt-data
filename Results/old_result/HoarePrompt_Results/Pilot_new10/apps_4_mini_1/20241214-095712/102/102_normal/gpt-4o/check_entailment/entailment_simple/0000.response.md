Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic needed to determine whether Vasya can buy some combination of bottles of Ber-Cola and Bars bars with exactly `n` burles. Here's why it meets the requirements set forth in the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three integers from the input: `n` (the total amount of money), `a` (the cost of one bottle of Ber-Cola), and `b` (the cost of one Bars bar). These inputs conform to the ranges specified in the problem description (1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10,000,000).

2. **Logic for Finding Combinations**: The program uses a loop to iterate over possible amounts of `x`, the number of bottles of Ber-Cola that Vasya can buy. The loop runs from `0` to `n // a`, which ensures that `x` will take all possible values within the limits of `n` using the cost of Ber-Cola (`a`).

3. **Checking Feasibility**: For each value of `x`, the program checks if the remaining amount after buying `x` bottles of Ber-Cola (i.e., `n - x * a`) can be evenly divided by the cost of a Bars bar (`b`). This is done using the modulus operator: `(n - x * a) % b == 0`. If this condition is satisfied, it means Vasya can afford exactly `y` bars, which is calculated as `(n - x * a) // b`.

4. **Output**: If a valid combination of `x` and `y` is found, the program prints "YES" followed by the values of `x` and `y`. If the loop completes without finding a valid combination, it outputs "NO".

5. **Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles the case when it's impossible to buy any items, as it only prints "NO" if no feasible combination is found after all iterations.

Overall, the program correctly adheres to the problem requirements and efficiently checks all possible combinations of purchases to find a viable solution. Thus, it is considered appropriate and does what the problem description asks for every potential case.
