The variable `b` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which accepts an input and converts it to an integer. The initial state of `a` and `n` remains unchanged since they are not affected by this code. Thus, the values of `a` and `n` stay as they are, while `b` takes on the new integer value entered by the user. 

Output State: **`a` is an input integer within 1 to 10,000,000; `b` is an input integer; `n` is an input integer within 1 to 10,000,000.**
