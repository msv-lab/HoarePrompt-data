The `exit()` function terminates the program immediately without modifying any of the existing variables. Therefore, the values of `a`, `b`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is an integer within 1 to 10,000,000; `b` is an input integer; `n` is an integer within 1 to 10,000,000; `x` is 1; `y` is (n - a) // b; and the result printed is (1, (n - a) // b).**
