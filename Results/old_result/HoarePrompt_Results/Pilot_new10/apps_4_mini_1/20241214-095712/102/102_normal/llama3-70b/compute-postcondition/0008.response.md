The code `exit()` terminates the execution of the program. The values of the variables remain unchanged because there is no operation that modifies them before the program halts. Therefore, the output state is preserved with the existing values of all variables.

Output State: **`a` is an integer within 1 to 10,000,000; `b` is an input integer; `n` is an integer within 1 to 10,000,000; `x` is 0; `y` is equal to `n // b`; 'YES' has been printed; and the printed output is `0, y`.**
