The code snippet simply prints the current values of `x` and `y`. Since `x` is initialized to 0 and `y` is equal to `n // b`, the output will reflect these values.

The value of `x` remains 0, and `y` retains the calculation of `n // b`, which depends on the current value of `n` and `b`. Therefore, the output state will indicate that `x` is 0, and `y` equals the result of the integer division of `n` by `b`. 

Output State: **`a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 10,000,000; `b` is an input integer; `n` is a valid integer; `x` is 0; `y` is equal to `n // b; print output x and y which are 0 and `n // b` respectively**
