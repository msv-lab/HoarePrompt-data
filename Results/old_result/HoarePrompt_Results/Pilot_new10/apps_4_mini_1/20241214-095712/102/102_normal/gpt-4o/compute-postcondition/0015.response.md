Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 10,000,000; `b` is an input integer; `n` is a valid integer (can be negative); `x` is 1; the value of `n - x * a` is not divisible by `b`. If `(n - x * a) % b == 0`, the program returns no value, and the values of `a`, `b`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged while `y` is calculated as (n - a) // b.***
