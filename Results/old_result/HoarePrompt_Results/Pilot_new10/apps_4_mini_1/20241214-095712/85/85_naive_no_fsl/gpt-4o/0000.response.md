To assess the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we should analyze the logic and determine if it captures all necessary edge cases as described.

1. **Understanding the problem**: We need to find pairs of shovels (with costs from 1 to n) such that their sum ends with the maximum possible number of 9s. 

2. **Identifying the maximum number of 9s**: The sum of two numbers ends with a certain number of 9s depending on their last digits. Specifically, to achieve a sum that ends in 9, the combinations of last digits can be analyzed:
   - (0, 9)
   - (1, 8)
   - (2, 7)
   - (3, 6)
   - (4, 5)
   - (5, 4)
   - (6, 3)
   - (7, 2)
   - (8, 1)
   - (9, 0)

   For each of these combinations, only valid indices (shovel costs that are â‰¤ n) can be utilized.

3. **Logic of the provided code**: The code aims to calculate the maximum number of trailing 9s in the sum of shovels.

   - It checks how many complete sets of `10` can be formed from `n + 1`.
   - It then multiplies this "max_9s" by `(n + 1)` to find pairs.

4. **Potential issues with the code**:
   - The while loop `(n + 1) % 10` checks for multiples of 10 to determine "max_9s", but this approach might not accurately represent all pairs leading to sums that end with a maximum number of trailing 9s.
   - For example, when `n` is such that `n = 1`, it will still compute as pairs. However, `n` can only start from `2`, thus it's required to handle this requirement correctly.

5. **Finding a specific case**:
   - Consider `n = 1`. The function does not account for `n` being less than `2`.
   - Consider `n = 50`: Based on manual calculations, we have identified pairs leading to maximum pairs leading to 99 being `49+50`, yielding just `1` pair, yet the logic in the code asserts a multiplication based on the trailing 9s might not align with that understanding for larger values biasing to count across a range of pairs inadequately handled through direct multiplicative approach. 

In conclusion, the program does not successfully handle and calculate the maximum pairs as described in every scenario.

Correctness: **False**
