According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` in relation to `n`. The loop runs as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n // 2`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and it is stated that `ans` is set to 1 if `n` is at least 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 4 because `n // 2` needs to be greater than or equal to 2 when `i` increments by 1 to 2.

Thus, `i` will increase to 2 for the next iteration. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, we require that `n` is at least 4 and `i` should be 2.

State: **If `n` is at least 4, `ans` is 1, `i` is 2**
