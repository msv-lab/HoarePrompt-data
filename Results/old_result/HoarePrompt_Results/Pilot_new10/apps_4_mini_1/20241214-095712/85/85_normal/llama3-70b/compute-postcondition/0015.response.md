Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and prompts the user to input an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9). It then calculates and prints the count of integers `i` (from 1 to n//2) such that the sum of `i` and `n-i` is divisible by the largest power of 10 less than or equal to that sum. The function does not return any value. **
