You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are n shovels in Polycarp's shop. The i-th shovel costs i burles, that is, the first shovel costs 1 burle, the second shovel costs 2 burles, the third shovel costs 3 burles, and so on. Polycarps wants to sell shovels in pairs.

Visitors are more likely to buy a pair of shovels if their total cost ends with several 9s. Because of this, Polycarp wants to choose a pair of shovels to sell in such a way that the sum of their costs ends with maximum possible number of nines. For example, if he chooses shovels with costs 12345 and 37454, their total cost is 49799, it ends with two nines.

You are to compute the number of pairs of shovels such that their total cost ends with maximum possible number of nines. Two pairs are considered different if there is a shovel presented in one pair, but not in the other.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) — the number of shovels in Polycarp's shop.


-----Output-----

Print the number of pairs of shovels such that their total cost ends with maximum possible number of nines. 

Note that it is possible that the largest number of 9s at the end is 0, then you should count all such ways.

It is guaranteed that for every n ≤ 10^9 the answer doesn't exceed 2·10^9.


-----Examples-----
Input
7

Output
3

Input
14

Output
9

Input
50

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first example the maximum possible number of nines at the end is one. Polycarp cah choose the following pairs of shovels for that purpose:  2 and 7;  3 and 6;  4 and 5. 

In the second example the maximum number of nines at the end of total cost of two shovels is one. The following pairs of shovels suit Polycarp:  1 and 8;  2 and 7;  3 and 6;  4 and 5;  5 and 14;  6 and 13;  7 and 12;  8 and 11;  9 and 10. 

In the third example it is necessary to choose shovels 49 and 50, because the sum of their cost is 99, that means that the total number of nines is equal to two, which is maximum possible for n = 50.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    max_9s = 0
    while (n + 1) % 10 == 0:
        max_9s += 1
        n //= 10
    pairs = (n + 1) * max_9s
    print(pairs)


```
Original Assessment: To assess the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we should analyze the logic and determine if it captures all necessary edge cases as described.

1. **Understanding the problem**: We need to find pairs of shovels (with costs from 1 to n) such that their sum ends with the maximum possible number of 9s. 

2. **Identifying the maximum number of 9s**: The sum of two numbers ends with a certain number of 9s depending on their last digits. Specifically, to achieve a sum that ends in 9, the combinations of last digits can be analyzed:
   - (0, 9)
   - (1, 8)
   - (2, 7)
   - (3, 6)
   - (4, 5)
   - (5, 4)
   - (6, 3)
   - (7, 2)
   - (8, 1)
   - (9, 0)

   For each of these combinations, only valid indices (shovel costs that are ≤ n) can be utilized.

3. **Logic of the provided code**: The code aims to calculate the maximum number of trailing 9s in the sum of shovels.

   - It checks how many complete sets of `10` can be formed from `n + 1`.
   - It then multiplies this "max_9s" by `(n + 1)` to find pairs.

4. **Potential issues with the code**:
   - The while loop `(n + 1) % 10` checks for multiples of 10 to determine "max_9s", but this approach might not accurately represent all pairs leading to sums that end with a maximum number of trailing 9s.
   - For example, when `n` is such that `n = 1`, it will still compute as pairs. However, `n` can only start from `2`, thus it's required to handle this requirement correctly.

5. **Finding a specific case**:
   - Consider `n = 1`. The function does not account for `n` being less than `2`.
   - Consider `n = 50`: Based on manual calculations, we have identified pairs leading to maximum pairs leading to 99 being `49+50`, yielding just `1` pair, yet the logic in the code asserts a multiplication based on the trailing 9s might not align with that understanding for larger values biasing to count across a range of pairs inadequately handled through direct multiplicative approach. 

In conclusion, the program does not successfully handle and calculate the maximum pairs as described in every scenario.

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    max_9s = 0
    while (n + 1) % 10 == 0:
        max_9s += 1
        
        n //= 10
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is 0, `max_9s` is the count of how many times `n` originally ended in the digit 9
    pairs = (n + 1) * max_9s
    print(pairs)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer input `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and counts how many times `n` ends with the digit 9, by checking whether (n + 1) is divisible by 10. The function then calculates the product of (n + 1) and the count of trailing 9s and prints the result. If `n` initially ends in 0, the function will not count any trailing 9s and will produce an output based on the value of `(n + 1) * max_9s`, which will be `n + 1`. The output will vary depending on how many times `n` had the digit 9 at the end.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
