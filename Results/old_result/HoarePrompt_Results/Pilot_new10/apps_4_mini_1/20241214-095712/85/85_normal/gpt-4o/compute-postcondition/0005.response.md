According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `(n + 1) % 10 == 0`. This means `n + 1` must be a multiple of 10 for the loop to execute again. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `n` can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or greater depending on its previous value divided by 10. 

To satisfy the condition `(n + 1) % 10 == 0`, `n + 1` must equal 10, 20, 30, etc. So, for `n` to be one less than these values, it must be 9, 19, 29, etc. Given that `max_9s` is 1 and does not affect the loop condition, we only need to adjust `n` so that `n` can be 9.

State: **`n` must be equal to 9, `max_9s` is 1**
