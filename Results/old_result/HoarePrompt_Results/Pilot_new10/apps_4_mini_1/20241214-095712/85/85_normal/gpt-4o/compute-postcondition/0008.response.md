According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the expression `(n + 1) % 10`. The loop will execute if `n + 1` is a multiple of 10. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is 0. Therefore, `n + 1` is 1, which is not a multiple of 10. 

To ensure that `(n + 1) % 10 == 0` for one more iteration, `n` needs to be adjusted to be equal to 9, since `n + 1` (which would be 10) would then be a multiple of 10. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted.

State: **`n` must be 9, `max_9s` is 2**
