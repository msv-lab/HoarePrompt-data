The code modifies the value of `n` through integer division by 10. The initial value of `n` is 9. Consequently, the result of `n //= 10` assigns `n` the value of 0 (since 9 divided by 10 is 0 when using integer division). The variable `max_9s` remains unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is now 0; `max_9s` is now 2. 

Output State: **`n` is now 0; `max_9s` is 2**
