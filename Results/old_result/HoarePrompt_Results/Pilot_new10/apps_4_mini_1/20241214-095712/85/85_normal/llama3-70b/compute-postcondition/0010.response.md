The variable `ans` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `ans` is unknown, so we cannot ascertain its exact value. The states of the other variables `n` and `i` remain unaffected. Given that `n` must be at least 4 and `i` is at least 3, the output state will reflect this.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 4; `i` is at least 3; `ans` is incremented by 1.**
