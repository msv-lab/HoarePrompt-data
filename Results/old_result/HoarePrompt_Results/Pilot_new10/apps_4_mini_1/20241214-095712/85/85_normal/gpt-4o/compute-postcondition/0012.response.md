The variable `pairs` is assigned the value of `(n + 1) * max_9s`. Given that `n` is 0, this means that `n + 1` is 1. Therefore, `pairs` becomes `1 * max_9s`, which is equal to `max_9s`. The states of `n` and `max_9s` do not change. 

Output State: **`n` is 0, `max_9s` is the count of how many times `n` originally ended in the digit 9, `pairs` is equal to `max_9s`.**
