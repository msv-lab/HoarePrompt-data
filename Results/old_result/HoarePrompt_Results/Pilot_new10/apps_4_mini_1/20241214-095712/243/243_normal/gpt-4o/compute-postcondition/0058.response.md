Postcondition: ***`low` is less than or equal to `high`. If `zeroes` is less than `m`, then `low` is updated to `(low + high) // 2 + 1` while `high` remains unchanged, maintaining the relationship. Otherwise, if `zeroes` is greater than `m`, `high` is updated to `(low + high) // 2 - 1`. If neither condition is met, `mid` is recalculated, `zeroes` is updated based on `func_1(mid)`, and `result` contains elements from `left + 1` to `right - 1` with `right` being defined such that `func_1(right) != m`.*
