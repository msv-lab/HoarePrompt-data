The variable `low` is assigned the value of `mid + 1`. The value of `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, and since `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is valid. The variable `zeroes` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`low` is equal to `mid + 1`, `high` is unchanged, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`**.
