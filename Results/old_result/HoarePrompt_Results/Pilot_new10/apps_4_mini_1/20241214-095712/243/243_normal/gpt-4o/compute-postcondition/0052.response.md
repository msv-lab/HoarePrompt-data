In this case, the loop condition checks if `func_1(right)` is equal to `m`. To determine if the loop can execute again, we need to assess the state of `right`:

1. **Current State:** After the last iteration, we have that `right` has been incremented by 1 (i.e., `right is now right + 1`, meaning the new value of `right` is one greater than its value at the end of the last iteration).
   
2. **Loop Condition:** The loop can execute again only if `func_1(right)` returns `m`. Since we also have the condition that `func_1(right + 1) must equal m`, this tells us the value of `right + 1` is valid in the context of the function. Thus, for the current state of `right`, we need `func_1(right) != m` because if it were equal, the previous iteration wouldn't have changed its value (it would have stayed at `right + 1`).

To allow the loop to execute one additional time, we need to ensure that the value of `right` can be set to `right - 1` (the previous value before the increment), such that `func_1(right)` could equal `m` again. Therefore, we adjust our state that ensures the condition holds true.

State: **`left` is such that `func_1(left) != m`, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is equal to `func_1(mid)`, `result` is an empty list, `right` is now `right - 1`, and `func_1(right) must equal m**.
