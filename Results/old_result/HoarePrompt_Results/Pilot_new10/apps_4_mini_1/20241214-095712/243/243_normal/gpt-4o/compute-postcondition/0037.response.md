The value of `high` is assigned the result of `mid - 1`. The value of `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, thus impacting the value of `high` directly based on the previous value of `mid`. The other variables, `low`, `zeroes`, and `mid`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `zeroes` is equal to `func_1(mid)`; `high` is now equal to `(low + high) // 2 - 1`.

Output State: **`low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `zeroes` is equal to `func_1(mid)`; `high` is equal to `(low + high) // 2 - 1`.**
