Postcondition: ***`low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, and `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`. If `zeroes` is greater than `m`, then `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. Otherwise, `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`, `result` is a list containing integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, where `left` is `(low + high) // 2 - k`, and it is ensured that `func_1(left)`, `func_1(right)`, and `func_1(right + 1)` all equal `m`, while `right` is updated to its original value plus the number of times the loop executed, breaking out of the most internal loop.***
