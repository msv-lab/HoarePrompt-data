The code assigns a list to the variable `result` which contains a range of integers starting from `left + 1` up to but not including `right`. The previous values have set `left` to be equal to `(low + high) // 2 - k` and `right` has been defined as the original value plus the number of times the loop has executed. Therefore, `result` will now hold all integers between these two calculated values.

The other variables maintain their previous states and none of them are affected by this assignment other than `result`.

Output State: **`low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` remains equal to `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`, `result` is a list containing integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, `left` is equal to `(low + high) // 2 - k`, `func_1(left)` is equal to `m`, `func_1(right)` equals `m`, `func_1(right + 1)` equals `m`, and `right` is equal to the original value of `right` plus the number of times the loop executed.**
