To determine whether the loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition specified in the `while` loop: `func_1(left) == m`.

We know the following from the provided state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `func_1(left)` must equal `m` for the loop to execute one more time.
- `left` has been decremented by 1 since `left` is mentioned to be decreased by 1.

For the loop to be able to execute again, `left` must have a value that allows `func_1(left)` to return `m`. Since `left` is now one less than its previous value (which means it could potentially lead to `func_1(left) != m` if `func_1` is strictly decreasing), we need to ensure that `left` is set to a value where `func_1(left)` will still return `m`.

Thus, we can conclude that:
- We need to adjust `left` to a value where `func_1(left)` continues to return `m`, which may require `left` to be greater than or equal to its current value.

Therefore, the condition needs to reflect that `left` must be set to at least its previous value so that `func_1(left)` will satisfy `func_1(left) == m`.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` is 0; `high` is 5 * (`m` + 1); `result` is an empty list; `mid` is (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2; `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`; `func_1(left)` must equal `m`; `left` must be incremented back to its previous value.**
