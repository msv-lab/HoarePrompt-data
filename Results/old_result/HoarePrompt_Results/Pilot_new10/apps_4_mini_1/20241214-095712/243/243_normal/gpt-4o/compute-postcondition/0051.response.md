The value of `right` is incremented by 1. The preconditions indicate that `right` was some value, and now it is `right + 1`. The other variables (`left`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `zeroes`, and `result`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is such that `func_1(left) != m`, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is equal to `func_1(mid)`, `result` is an empty list, `right` is now incremented by 1 (so `right + 1`), and `func_1(right + 1) must equal m.

Output State: **`left` is such that `func_1(left) != m`, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is equal to `func_1(mid)`, `result` is an empty list, `right` is now `right + 1`, and `func_1(right + 1) must equal m.**
