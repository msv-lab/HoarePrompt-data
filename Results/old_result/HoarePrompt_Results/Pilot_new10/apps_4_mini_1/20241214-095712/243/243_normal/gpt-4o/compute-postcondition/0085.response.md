Output State: **`low` is greater than `high`, if `zeroes` is less than `m`, then `low` is greater than 5 * (`m` + 1); if `zeroes` is greater than `m`, then `high` is less than 5 * (`m` + 1). If `zeroes` equals `m`, then `result` contains a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, where `left` is the last index where `func_1(left) == m` and `right` is the first index where `func_1(right) != m`.`**
