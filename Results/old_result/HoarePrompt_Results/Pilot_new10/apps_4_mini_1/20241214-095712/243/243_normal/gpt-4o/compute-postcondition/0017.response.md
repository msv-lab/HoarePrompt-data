The value of `left` is decremented by 1. Since `left` is not provided in the initial state, we cannot determine its previous value. The other variables remain unaffected, so we will only note the change to `left`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` is 0; `high` is 5 * (`m` + 1); `result` is an empty list; `mid` is (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2; `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`; `func_1(left)` must equal `m`; `left` is decreased by 1.**
