The value of `left` is assigned the value of `mid`, which is previously calculated as (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2. Therefore, the value of `left` becomes (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2. No other variables are affected by this assignment. 

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` is 0; `high` is 5 * (`m` + 1); `result` is an empty list; `mid` is (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2; `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`; `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`; `left` is (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2**
