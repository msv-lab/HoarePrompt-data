`count` is assigned the value 0. The value of `m` remains unchanged and still falls within the range of 1 to 100,000. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is an integer derived from an input value, such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `count` is 0.

Output State: **`m` is an integer derived from an input value, such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `count` is 0**.
