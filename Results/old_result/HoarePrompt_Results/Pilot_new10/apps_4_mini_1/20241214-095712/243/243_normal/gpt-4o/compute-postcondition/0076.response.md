To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions under which the loop runs. The loop continues as long as `func_1(right)` equals `m`. At the end of the last iteration, the state indicates:

1. `func_1(left)` is equal to `m`.
2. `func_1(right)` must equal `m`.
3. `right` has been incremented by 1.

Since `right` has been incremented, we need to ensure that after this increment, `func_1(right)` still equals `m` for the loop to run one more time. Therefore, we can conclude that for the loop to execute again, the function output for the new `right` (which we denote as `right + 1`) must return `m`.

Thus, we need to modify the state so that `func_1(right + 1)` equals `m` to enable another iteration.

State: **`low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` remains equal to `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`, `result` is an empty list, `left` is equal to `(low + high) // 2 - k`, `func_1(left)` is equal to `m`, `func_1(right)` must equal m, and `func_1(right + 1)` must equal m**
