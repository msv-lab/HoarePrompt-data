Postcondition: ***`low` is less than or equal to `high`. If `zeroes` is less than `m`, then `low` is updated to `mid + 1` and `high` remains unchanged, with `mid` recalculated as `(low + high) // 2` and `zeroes` becoming the return value of `func_1(mid)`. If `zeroes` is greater than `m`, `high` is updated to `mid - 1`; otherwise, the function returns `zeroes`, and `result` is a list containing integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, ensuring that `func_1(left)`, `func_1(right)`, and `func_1(right + 1)` all equal `m`, while `right` is adjusted based on the loop's execution.***
