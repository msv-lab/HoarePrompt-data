`zeroes` is assigned the value of `func_1(mid)`. The value of `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`, and since `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `mid` will be a defined integer based on this calculation. The other variables are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `zeroes` is equal to `func_1(mid)`.**
