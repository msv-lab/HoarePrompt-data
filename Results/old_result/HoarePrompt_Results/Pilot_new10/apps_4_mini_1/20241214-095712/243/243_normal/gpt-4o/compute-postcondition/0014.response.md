According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the return value of `func_1(left)`. For the loop to execute, `func_1(left)` must be equal to `m`. Currently, `left` is calculated as (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2. Since `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)` and `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`, we do not have direct information about `func_1(left)`.

Since `left` is determined based on the formula and `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000, we need to ensure that `func_1(left)` produces the value `m`. The current states do not ensure that condition, therefore:

1. We cannot assume `func_1(left)` will equal `m` unless we adjust the implementation of `func_1` or the value of `left`.
2. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, an adjustment should be made: an appropriate value for `left` must exist that results in `func_1(left)` returning `m`.

Since we do not have specific details about how `func_1` operates, we may consider adjusting the assumption made about the function's result. We should check whether a specific state for `left` allows `func_1(left)` to return exactly equal to `m`, or adjust based on its definition if necessary.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` is 0; `high` is 5 * (`m` + 1); `result` is an empty list; `mid` is (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2; `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`; `left` must yield func_1(left) equal to `m`**
