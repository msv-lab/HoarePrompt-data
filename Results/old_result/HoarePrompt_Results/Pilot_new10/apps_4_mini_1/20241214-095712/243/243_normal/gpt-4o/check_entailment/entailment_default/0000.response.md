The provided Python code appears to be intended to find the count of positive integers \( n \) such that the factorial of \( n \) ends with exactly \( m \) trailing zeroes.

Let's analyze the code against the problem description and the provided outputs.

### Function Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function correctly counts the number of trailing zeroes in \( n! \) by summing the integer divisions of \( n \) by powers of 5.
   - This approach works because trailing zeroes in factorials are created by pairs of factors of 2 and 5, with 5 being the limiting factor since there are generally more factors of 2 than 5.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function performs a binary search for values of \( n \) such that \( n! \) has exactly \( m \) trailing zeroes.
   - It identifies the range of potential \( n \) values by calculating trailing zeroes using `func_1`.
   - The logic that explores the range where the number of trailing zeroes is equal to \( m \) starts from the midpoint and expands outwards. 
   - The results are collected in a list and returned.

### Output Hints Comparison
- The hints state that if no such integers exist, an empty list is returned, which is consistent with the behavior of the binary search implementation in `func_2`.

### Testing Against Examples
- For example input `1`:
    - `5!`, `6!`, `7!`, `8!`, and `9!` all have exactly one trailing zero.
    - The output correctly lists these numbers (5, 6, 7, 8, 9), therefore this behaves as expected.

- For example input `5`:
    - Although the output indicates there are no \( n \) values where \( n! \) has exactly five trailing zeroes, this reflects that \( 5! \) (which has 1 trailing zero) and subsequent values do not yield the desired count of trailing zeroes until \( n=25 \) which has 6 zeros.
    - Hence, returning 0 for input 5 is also correct.

### Conclusion
Every functional and edge case examined shows that the code operates correctly according to the problem specification and returns the expected results for the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**.
