The variable `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. The value of `mid` was calculated as `(low + high) // 2`, and since `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is a valid integer. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the new value of `high`.

Output State: **`low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`, `high` is equal to `mid - 1`.**
