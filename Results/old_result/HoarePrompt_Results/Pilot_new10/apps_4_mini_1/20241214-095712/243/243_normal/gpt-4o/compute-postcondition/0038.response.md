The code initializes `result` as an empty list. This does not depend on any specific values that `low`, `high`, `mid`, or `zeroes` might take; it simply sets up a new variable `result` that will now hold an empty list. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `zeroes` is equal to `func_1(mid)`; `result` is an empty list.**
