The variable `right` is incremented by 1. Given that `func_1(right + 1)` must equal `m`, this indicates that the value of `right` is relevant in the context of finding `m`. The other variables remain unchanged, but the value of `right` now increases by 1.

Output State: **`left` is decreased to a value such that `func_1(left)` is no longer equal to `m`, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000, `low` is 0, `high` is 5 * (`m` + 1), `result` is an empty list, `mid` is (5 * (`m` + 1)) // 2, `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`, `right` is incremented by 1, and `func_1(right + 1)` must equal `m`.**
