Postcondition: ***`low` must be less than or equal to `high`. If `zeroes` is greater than `m`, then `high` is updated to `(low + high) // 2 - 1`. Otherwise, `left` is such that `func_1(left) != m`, `mid` is determined as `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is updated to `func_1(mid)`, and `result` is a list containing elements from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, where `right` is such that `func_1(right) != m`, leading to a break from the most internal loop or if statement.***
