According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `func_1(left) == m`. For the loop to execute at least once, the current value of `left` needs to be such that `func_1(left)` is equal to `m`. 

Right before the loop, we have:

- `low` must be less than or equal to `high` (this condition is already satisfied),
- `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2` (this is set up correctly),
- `zeroes` is equal to `func_1(mid)` (this state might not be relevant here since the loop checks `func_1(left)`),
- `result` is an empty list (this does not influence the loop's execution),
- `left` is equal to `mid` (this means it takes the value of `mid`).

To ensure the loop executes, we need the condition `func_1(left) == m` to be true. Since we don't have information about the relationship between `func_1(left)` and `m`, we can ascertain that `left` needs to be adjusted so that `func_1(left)` is equal to `m`. Therefore, we need to state that `left` must be set such that `func_1(left) == m` for the loop to potentially execute.

State: **`low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `zeroes` is equal to `func_1(mid)`; `result` is an empty list; `left` must be such that `func_1(left) == m`**
