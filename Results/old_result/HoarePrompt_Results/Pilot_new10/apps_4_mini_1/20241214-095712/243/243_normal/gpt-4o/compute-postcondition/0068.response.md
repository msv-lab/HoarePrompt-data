In this case, the execution of the `while` loop depends on the variables involved, specifically `func_1(left)` and `m`. The loop will continue to execute as long as the condition `func_1(left) == m` is true.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state of the relevant variables is as follows:
- `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
- `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`.
- `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`.
- `result` is an empty list.
- `left` is equal to `(low + high) // 2 - 1`.
- It is established that `func_1(left)` must equal `m`.

For the loop to execute one more time, it is necessary for `func_1(left)` to equal `m` at the beginning of the next iteration as well. Since we need to ensure that this condition continues to hold, there are no adjustments needed if `func_1(left)` currently equals `m`.

Therefore, to guarantee the loop can proceed one more time, the state doesn't need to be adjusted because it has already been established that the condition for the loop's continuation is met.

State: **`low` is less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`; `result` is an empty list; `left` is equal to `(low + high) // 2 - 1`; `func_1(left)` must equal m**
