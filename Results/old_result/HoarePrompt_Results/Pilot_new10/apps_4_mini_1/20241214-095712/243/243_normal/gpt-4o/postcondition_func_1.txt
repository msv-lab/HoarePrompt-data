The function accepts a positive integer `m` and returns a list of integers `n` such that `n!` (n factorial) ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes. The range of `n` is determined by performing a binary search based on the output of the function `func_1`, which counts the trailing zeroes in `n!`. If no such integers exist, an empty list is returned.
