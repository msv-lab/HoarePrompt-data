Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle certain edge cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to account for the scenario where the available time `M` is significantly less than the time needed to complete even one subtask. 

For example, consider the input:
```
1 1 0
1
```
In this case, Polycarp has `0` minutes to solve `1` task with `1` subtask that requires `1` minute. According to the problem description, since he cannot solve any subtasks, he should earn `0` points. However, the current implementation of the program goes through the loop checking for complete tasks and does not verify whether subtasks can even be attempted, potentially leading to an incorrect calculation of the maximum points. 

Thus, it is possible for this program to yield a result greater than `0` for cases where `M` is `0`. Hence, it does not conform correctly to the problem requirements. 

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
