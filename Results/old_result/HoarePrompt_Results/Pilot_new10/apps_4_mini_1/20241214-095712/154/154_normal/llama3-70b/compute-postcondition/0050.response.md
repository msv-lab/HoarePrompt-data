Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45), `M` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9), `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers from input; the value of `sum(dp[i][M] for i in range(k + 1))` plus the count of `i` in the range `0` to `k` where `dp[i][M]` equals `i` has been printed.**
