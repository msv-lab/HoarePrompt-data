According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the list `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must contain at least one integer. Additionally, the loop variable `subtask_time` will take on the values of the integers present in the list `t` sequentially. 

Given that `k` is updated to be in the range of 1 to 45, it is implied that the list `t` must also contain at least `k` elements. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are as follows:

1. The list `t` must contain at least 1 element for the loop to execute.
2. The variable `subtask_time` will initially be set to the first element of the list `t` when the loop begins its first iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer with 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45, `k` is an integer with 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45, `M` is unchanged, `t` is a list of `k` integers that must have at least 1 element, `subtask_time` is the first element in `t`**
