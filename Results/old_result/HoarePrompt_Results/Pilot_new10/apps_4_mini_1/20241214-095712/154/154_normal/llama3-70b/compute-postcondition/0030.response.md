The statement `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]` assigns the value of `dp[i][j - 1]` to `dp[i][j]`. The variables `n`, `k`, `M`, `t`, and `j` remain unchanged, but `dp[i][j]` gets updated based on the value of `dp[i][j - 1]`. Here, it's important to note that the specific values of `dp[i][j]` and `dp[i][j - 1]` depend on their previous states.

Since `j` is initially 3, the operation is performed on the index corresponding to `j - 1`, which is 2. Therefore, the value stored in `dp[i][2]` gets copied into `dp[i][3]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `M` is at least 3, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers from input, `j` is 3, `dp[i][j]` is now equal to `dp[i][2]`**.
