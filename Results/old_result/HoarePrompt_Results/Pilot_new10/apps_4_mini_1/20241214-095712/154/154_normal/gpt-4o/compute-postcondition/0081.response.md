Output State: **`n` is an integer with 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45; `k` is an integer with 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45; `M` is unchanged; `t` is a list of `k` integers; `remaining_time` is updated to reflect the maximum time remaining after completing all possible tasks; `subtasks_solved` is the minimum of its final accumulated value and `(n - complete_tasks) * k`; `max_points` is updated to the maximum points achievable based on completed tasks and subtasks solved; `complete_tasks` is `n`, `time_used` is equal to `n * total_time_per_task`, and `points` is equal to `n * (k + 1)`.**
