The variable `remaining_time` is assigned the value `M - time_used`. The value of `M` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 2·10^9, and the value of `time_used` is currently 0. Thus, `remaining_time` will equal `M - 0`, which is simply `M`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, `M` are integers with 1 ≤ n ≤ 45, 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, `M` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9, `t` is a list of `k` integers, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of elements in `t`, `max_points` is 0, `complete_tasks` is 0, `time_used` is 0, `points` is 0, `remaining_time` is equal to `M`.**
