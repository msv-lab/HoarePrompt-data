Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `M` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers from input, `dp` is a list of lists with dimensions (k + 1) x (M + 1) initialized with zeros, `i` is 1, and `j` is 1. `dp[i][j]` is 0, and the current value of `j` is greater than or equal to the element `t[i - 1]` in the list `t`.***
