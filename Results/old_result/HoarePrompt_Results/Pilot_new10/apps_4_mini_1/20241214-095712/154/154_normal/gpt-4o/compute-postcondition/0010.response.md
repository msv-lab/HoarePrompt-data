According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the list `t`. For the loop to execute at least once, the list `t` must contain at least one integer. Since `k` is the length of the list `t`, it must be at least 1 for the loop to run.

Given that `k` is within the defined limits of 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, and provided that `t` must have elements for the loop to execute, we can assert that `subtask_time` will take its value from the first element of `t` on the first iteration. 

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `t` must be a list of integers with at least one element.
- On the first iteration of the loop, `subtask_time` will be equal to `t[0]`.

State: **`n`, `k` is at least 1, `M`, `t` is a list of `k` integers with at least 1 element, `subtask_time` is equal to the first element of `t` (i.e., `t[0]`)**
