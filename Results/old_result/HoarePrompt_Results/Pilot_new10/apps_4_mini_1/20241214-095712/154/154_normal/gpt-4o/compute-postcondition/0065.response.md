The variable `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is computed as `remaining_time // subtask_time`, which represents how many full subtasks can be completed within the available time. The value of `subtasks_solved` is increased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

The resulting state provides values for `n`, `k`, `M`, `remaining_time`, `max_points`, `complete_tasks`, `time_used`, `points`, `subtask_time`, and `max_subtasks_for_this_task`, while updating `subtasks_solved`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer with 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45; `k` is an integer with 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45; `M` is unchanged; `t` is a list of `k` integers; `remaining_time` is now `M - (n + 1) * total_time_per_task`; `max_points` is unchanged; `complete_tasks` is `n + 1`; `time_used` is `(n + 1) * total_time_per_task`; `points` is `(n + 1) * (k + 1)`; `subtask_time` is the first element of list `t`; `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `remaining_time // subtask_time`; `subtasks_solved` is increased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`.**
