#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), k is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45), M is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9), and t is a list of k integers (1 ≤ t[j] ≤ 1000000), where t[j] represents the time required to solve the j-th subtask.
def func():
    n, k, M = map(int, input().split())
    t = list(map(int, input().split()))
    t.sort()
    dp = [([0] * (M + 1)) for _ in range(k + 1)]
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        for j in range(1, M + 1):
            dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]
            if j >= t[i - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45), `M` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9), `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers from input; `dp[i][j]` contains the maximum value of items that can be selected with the given integers within the weight limit `M`, considering all combinations of the integers in `t`. If `M` is 0, all values in `dp` remain 0 since no items can be selected.
    print(sum(dp[i][M] for i in range(k + 1)) + sum(1 for i in range(k + 1) if 
    dp[i][M] == i))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: integers `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ 45), and `M` (0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9), and a list `t` of `k` integers (1 ≤ t[j] ≤ 1,000,000). It calculates the maximum number of subtasks that can be accomplished within the time limit `M` using dynamic programming. The final result displayed is the total number of those maximum subtasks plus 1 for each task if the task count at `M` matches the index. This includes edge cases where M is 0 or the list t might contain values which make it impossible to complete any subtasks.
