Output State: **`n` is an integer with 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45; `k` is an integer with 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45; `M` is unchanged; `t` is a list of `k` integers; `remaining_time` is updated to `M - ((n + 1) * total_time_per_task)`; `subtasks_solved` is now 0; `max_points` is updated to `max(max_points, (n + 1) * (k + 1))`; `complete_tasks` is `n + 1`; `time_used` is `(n + 1) * total_time_per_task`; `points` is `(n + 1) * (k + 1)`**
