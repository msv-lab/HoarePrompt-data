Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `M` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers from input; `dp[i][j]` contains the maximum value based on the conditions provided in the loop, considering all possible `j` from 1 to `M` and sequences of integers in `t`. If `j` is less than `t[i - 1]`, then `dp[i][j]` remains unchanged from its previous state; otherwise, `dp[i][j]` reflects the best selection of integers to maximize the count from 0 to `M`. If `M` is less than 1, `dp` will remain as originally initialized, and if `k` is 0, `dp[i][j]` will not be updated, remaining as zeros.**
