The given code assigns the value of `dp[i][j]` to `dp[i][j - 1]`, meaning that it sets `dp[i][j]` to the value of the cell to its left in the same row, indicating some sort of propagation of values in a dynamic programming context. The states of the other variables are not directly affected by this operation.

Important points to note:
- The variable `j` remains equal to `3` after the operation.
- The variable `i` remains equal to `k + 1`, which remains unchanged.
- Other variables like `n`, `k`, `M`, and `t` remain unchanged as well.

Thus, after executing the code snippet, the relevant output state is that `dp[i][j]` is now equal to `dp[i][2]`, which is the value directly to its left.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `M` is at least 3, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers, `j` is 3, `i` is `k + 1`, and `dp[i][j]` is now equal to `dp[i][2]`.**
