Output State: **`n` and `k` are at least 2; `M` is unchanged; `t` is a list of `k` integers with at least 2 elements; `subtask_time` is the second integer in the list; `remaining_time` is unchanged minus `max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time`; `subtasks_solved` is at least 1 increased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`; `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is equal to `remaining_time // subtask_time`.**
