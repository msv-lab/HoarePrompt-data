n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 45; M is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9; and t is a list of k positive integers where each element t[j] (1 ≤ j ≤ k) represents the time required to solve the j-th subtask of any task, and each t[j] is in the range 1 ≤ t[j] ≤ 1000000.
