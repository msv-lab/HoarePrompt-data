You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Polycarp takes part in a math show. He is given n tasks, each consists of k subtasks, numbered 1 through k. It takes him t_{j} minutes to solve the j-th subtask of any task. Thus, time required to solve a subtask depends only on its index, but not on the task itself. Polycarp can solve subtasks in any order.

By solving subtask of arbitrary problem he earns one point. Thus, the number of points for task is equal to the number of solved subtasks in it. Moreover, if Polycarp completely solves the task (solves all k of its subtasks), he recieves one extra point. Thus, total number of points he recieves for the complete solution of the task is k + 1.

Polycarp has M minutes of time. What is the maximum number of points he can earn?


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integer numbers n, k and M (1 ≤ n ≤ 45, 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9).

The second line contains k integer numbers, values t_{j} (1 ≤ t_{j} ≤ 1000000), where t_{j} is the time in minutes required to solve j-th subtask of any task.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum amount of points Polycarp can earn in M minutes.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4 11
1 2 3 4

Output
6

Input
5 5 10
1 2 4 8 16

Output
7



-----Note-----

In the first example Polycarp can complete the first task and spend 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 minutes. He also has the time to solve one subtask of the second task in one minute.

In the second example Polycarp can solve the first subtask of all five tasks and spend 5·1 = 5 minutes. Also he can solve the second subtasks of two tasks and spend 2·2 = 4 minutes. Thus, he earns 5 + 2 = 7 points in total.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
k = int(data[1])
M = int(data[2])
t = list(map(int, data[3:3 + k]))
result = func_1(n, k, M, t)
print(result)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 45 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, M is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9, and t is a list of k integers where each t[j] (1 ≤ t[j] ≤ 1000000) represents the time in minutes required to solve the j-th subtask.
def func_1(n, k, M, t):
    total_time_per_task = sum(t)
    max_points = 0
    for complete_tasks in range(n + 1):
        time_used = complete_tasks * total_time_per_task
        
        if time_used > M:
            break
        
        points = complete_tasks * (k + 1)
        
        remaining_time = M - time_used
        
        subtasks_solved = 0
        
        for subtask_time in t:
            if remaining_time >= subtask_time:
                max_subtasks_for_this_task = remaining_time // subtask_time
                subtasks_solved += max_subtasks_for_this_task
                remaining_time -= max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time
        
        subtasks_solved = min(subtasks_solved, (n - complete_tasks) * k)
        
        max_points = max(max_points, points + subtasks_solved)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer with 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45; `k` is an integer with 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45; `M` is unchanged; `t` is a list of `k` integers; `remaining_time` is updated to reflect the maximum time remaining after completing all possible tasks; `subtasks_solved` is the minimum of its final accumulated value and `(n - complete_tasks) * k`; `max_points` is updated to the maximum points achievable based on completed tasks and subtasks solved; `complete_tasks` is `n`, `time_used` is equal to `n * total_time_per_task`, and `points` is equal to `n * (k + 1)`.
    return max_points
    #The program returns max_points, which is updated to the maximum points achievable based on completed tasks (n) and subtasks solved, with points being equal to n multiplied by (k + 1) where complete_tasks is n, and time_used is equal to n multiplied by total_time_per_task.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts integers `n` (the maximum number of complete tasks), `k` (the number of subtasks per task), a non-negative integer `M` (the total time available), and a list `t` of integers where each represents the time required to solve a subtask. It calculates the maximum points achievable by completing full tasks and solving as many subtasks as possible within the available time. The points are calculated based on the number of completed tasks and the subtasks solved, considering the time constraints. It correctly handles cases where the available time may not allow all subtasks to be completed or where all tasks cannot be finished due to time limits. Additionally, there is no explicit safeguard against cases where `t` might contain invalid values or be empty, so it assumes `t` has at least one valid subtask time.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
