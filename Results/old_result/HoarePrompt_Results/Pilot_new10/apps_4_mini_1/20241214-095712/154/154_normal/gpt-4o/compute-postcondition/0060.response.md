The variable `remaining_time` is calculated as `M - time_used`. Given that `time_used` is already defined as `(n + 1) * total_time_per_task`, the new value of `remaining_time` will be `M - (n + 1) * total_time_per_task`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer with 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45, `k` is an integer with 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45, `M` is unchanged, `t` is a list of `k` integers, `remaining_time` is now `M - (n + 1) * total_time_per_task`, `subtasks_solved` is unchanged, `max_points` is unchanged, `complete_tasks` is `n + 1`, `time_used` is `(n + 1) * total_time_per_task`, and `points` is `(n + 1) * (k + 1)`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer with 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45; `k` is an integer with 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45; `M` is unchanged; `t` is a list of `k` integers; `remaining_time` is now `M - (n + 1) * total_time_per_task`; `subtasks_solved` is unchanged; `max_points` is unchanged; `complete_tasks` is `n + 1`; `time_used` is `(n + 1) * total_time_per_task`; `points` is `(n + 1) * (k + 1)`**.
