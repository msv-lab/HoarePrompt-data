According to the code, the for loop will execute as long as `complete_tasks` is within the range defined by `n + 1`, which means it will iterate from 0 to `n` inclusive. Given the last iteration where `complete_tasks` can be at most `n`, for the loop to execute one more time, `complete_tasks` needs to be increased by 1.

At the end of the last iteration, if `complete_tasks` was equal to `n`, then for the next iteration:
- `complete_tasks` should become `n + 1`, which is the exit condition for the loop.

Thus, the states `n`, `k`, `M`, `t`, `remaining_time`, `subtasks_solved`, `max_points`, `time_used`, and `points` remain unchanged, but we note that now `complete_tasks` equals `n + 1`, which is out of the loop's range.

State: **`n` is an integer with 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45, `k` is an integer with 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45, `M` is unchanged, `t` is a list of `k` integers, `remaining_time` is unchanged, `subtasks_solved` is unchanged, `max_points` is unchanged, `complete_tasks` is `n + 1`, `time_used` is unchanged, `points` is unchanged**
