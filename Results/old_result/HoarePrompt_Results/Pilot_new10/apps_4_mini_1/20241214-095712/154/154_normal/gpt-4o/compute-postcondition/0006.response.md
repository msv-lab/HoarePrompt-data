Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `M` are integers with 1 ≤ n ≤ 45, 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, `M` being a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9, `t` is a list of `k` integers, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of elements in `t`, `max_points` is 0, `complete_tasks` is 0, and `time_used` is 0. If `time_used` exceeds `M`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
