The code assigns the value of `total_time_per_task` to the sum of all elements in the list `t`. Since `t` consists of `k` integers where each `t[j]` represents the time required to solve the j-th subtask, `total_time_per_task` is calculated as the total time needed for all subtasks. The values of `n`, `k`, and `M` remain unchanged because they are not impacted by this operation.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 45 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 45; `M` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9; `t` is a list of k integers representing the time in minutes required to solve each subtask; `total_time_per_task` is equal to the sum of all elements in `t`.**
