Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are at least 1, `M`, and `t` is a list of `k` integers with at least 1 element. If `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`, then `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is equal to `remaining_time // subtask_time`, `remaining_time` is updated by subtracting `max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time`, and `subtasks_solved` is increased by at least 1.***
