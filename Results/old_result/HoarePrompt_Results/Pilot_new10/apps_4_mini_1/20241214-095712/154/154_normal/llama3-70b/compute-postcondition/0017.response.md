Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `M` is greater than or equal to 2, and `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers. If `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`, `dp[i][j]` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1.***
