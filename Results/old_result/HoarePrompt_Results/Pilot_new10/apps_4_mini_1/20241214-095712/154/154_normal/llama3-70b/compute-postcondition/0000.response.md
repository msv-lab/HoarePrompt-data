The values of `n`, `k`, and `M` are assigned new values from the `input` function converted to integers, while the variable `t` remains unchanged. The new values of `n`, `k`, and `M` will depend on the input provided. The ranges for these variables constrain their possible values, but without specific input data, I can only indicate that they will be integers within their defined limits.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45), `M` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9), `t` is a list of k integers (1 ≤ t[j] ≤ 1000000), where `n`, `k`, and `M` have been updated to new integers from input.**
