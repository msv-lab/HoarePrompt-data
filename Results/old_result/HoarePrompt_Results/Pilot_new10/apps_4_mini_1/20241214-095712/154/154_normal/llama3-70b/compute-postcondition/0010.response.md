According to the code, the for loop will execute for `j` starting from 1 up to `M`. In the last iteration of the loop, `j` was at its maximum value of `M`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1. Since the loop specified `range(1, M + 1)`, if `j` reaches `M + 1`, the loop condition will not be satisfied.

In terms of the state: 
- `n` remains unchanged as it does not affect the iteration of `j`.
- `k` also remains unchanged as it is not relevant for `j`.
- `M` remains unchanged as it doesn't influence the current increment of `j`.
- `t` remains unchanged since it is a fixed input list.
- The state of `dp` would also stay the same since it is not directly modified by the change in `j`.

Thus, for `j` to execute one more time, `M` would need to allow a new iteration, hence the conditions for `M` must show that if `j` is now `M` then `j` must be set to `M + 1` which falls outside the range.

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `M` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers from input, `dp` is a list of lists with dimensions (k + 1) x (M + 1), and `j` must be greater than M.**
