Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `M` is at least 1, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers, `j` is 1, and `i` is k + 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`, then `dp[k + 1][1]` is updated to be the maximum of `dp[k + 1][1]` and `dp[k][j - t[k]] + 1`. If `j` is less than `t[i - 1]`, then no changes are made.***
