Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `M` is at least 1, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers from input, `dp[i][j]` contains the maximum value that can be achieved with the conditions provided in the loop across all possible `j` from 1 to `M`, and all potential subsets of `t`. If no updates have occurred to `dp[i][j]`, it retains the value of `dp[i][j-1]`, and thus, `dp[i][j]` is the accumulated maximum based on previous iterations and conditions.**
