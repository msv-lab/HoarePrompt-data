Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are even integers within the range of 2 to 10^9. If `k` is less than `n - 1`, the function outputs `k + 1` and `1`. Otherwise, `k` is in the range from 0 to less than `nÂ·m`, `full_rows` is computed as `k // (m - 1)`, `remaining_steps` as `k % (m - 1)`, leading to the calculation of `row` as `n - full_rows`, and `col` is `2 + remaining_steps` if `full_rows` is even, or `m - remaining_steps` if `full_rows` is odd, and the values of `row` and `col` are printed.***
