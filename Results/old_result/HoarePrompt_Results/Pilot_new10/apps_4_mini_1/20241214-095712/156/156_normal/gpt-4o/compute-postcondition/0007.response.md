The code computes `row` as `n - full_rows`. The values of `n` and `full_rows` are known to be even integers, and given that `full_rows` is assigned a value based on `k`, its specific numeric value is also relevant here. 

Since `full_rows` is even, `row` is calculated by subtracting an even value from another even value, which results in an even value. Hence, the output state can be expressed in terms of the relationships defined:

- `n` is an even integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`.
- `full_rows` is an even integer derived from the previous calculations.
- `row` is thus also an even integer calculated as `n - full_rows`.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k < n·m; `full_rows` is assigned the value `k // (m - 1)` and is even; `remaining_steps` is equal to `k % (m - 1); `row` is equal to `n - full_rows`.**
