Functionality: ** The function accepts two even integers `n` and `m` (where 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9) and a non-negative integer `k` (where 0 ≤ k < n·m). It calculates and prints the position in the grid defined by these parameters. If `k` is less than `n - 1`, it prints `k + 1` and `1`. Otherwise, it computes how many full rows are completed and the remaining steps to determine the specific row and column in which the position falls, with row calculated as `n - full_rows` and column depending on whether `full_rows` is even or odd. This results in different column values based on the parity of `full_rows`. The function does not return a value; it directly prints the calculated position. **
