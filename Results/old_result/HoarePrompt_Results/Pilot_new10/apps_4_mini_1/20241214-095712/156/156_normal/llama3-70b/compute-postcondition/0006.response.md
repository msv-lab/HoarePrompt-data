To execute the given code snippet, we need to analyze it based on the initial state.

### Initial State
- `n` is an even integer in the range [2, 10^9]
- `m` is an integer in the range [2, 10^9]
- `k` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq k < n \times 2 - 2\), \(k \geq n - 1\), and \(k < n \times 2 - 2\)

### Code Analysis
The code provided is:
```python
print(n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1, (k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1)
```

1. **Calculating the First Printed Value:**
   - \((k - n + 1) \% (n - 1)\): The result of this calculation will determine how much to subtract from `n`.
   - We need to understand that \(k\) falls within a specific range. Given its relationship to \(n\) (especially the conditions \(k \geq n - 1\)), the value of \((k - n + 1)\) is effectively non-negative. 

2. **Calculating the Second Printed Value:**
   - \((k - n + 1) // (n - 1)\): This determines how many complete cycles of \(n - 1\) fit into \(k - n + 1\).
   - Adding 1 to this quotient adjusts for the fact that we want the cycle count to start at 1 rather than 0.

### Output Values
Without loss of generality, we keep the values of `n`, `m`, and the original range for `k`. However, we will derive expressions based on the conditions and the calculations.

After processing, the output values are as follows:
- The first printed value results from \(n - (k - n + 1) \% (n - 1) - 1\).
- The second printed value results from \((k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1\).

### Conclusion
The computed values, once derived through filling in the expressions defined for `n`, `k`, and their conditions, can be condensed as follows, retaining the relation bounded by that which `k` has represented before its update.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer in the range [2, 10^9]; `m` is an integer in the range [2, 10^9]; `k` is updated to \(k \% (n \times 2 - 2)\) but still satisfies \(k \geq n - 1\) and \(0 \leq k < n \times 2 - 2\); first printed value is \(n - (k - n + 1) \% (n - 1) - 1\); second printed value is \((k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1\)**.
