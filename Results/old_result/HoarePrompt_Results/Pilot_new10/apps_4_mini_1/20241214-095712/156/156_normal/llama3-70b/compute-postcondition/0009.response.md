Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer in the range [2, 10^9]; `m` is an integer in the range [2, 10^9]; `k` is a non-negative integer that after being updated to \(k \% (n \times 2 - 2)\) satisfies \(k \geq n - 1\) and \(0 \leq k < n \times 2 - 2\). If \(k < n \times 2 - 2\), the first printed value is calculated as \(n - (k - n + 1) \% (n - 1) - 1\) and the second printed value is \((k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1\). Otherwise, if \(k \geq n \times 2 - 2\), the values (1, 2) are printed.***
