Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case when `k` is equal to `n * 2 - 2`, which is the last move in the snake pattern traversal of the dungeon. According to the problem description, that would mean Lara should reach position `(1, 2)`. However, the current implementation always ends up returning `(1, 2)` when `k` is equal to or greater than `n * 2 - 2`, which can output erroneous results for any `k` value equal to that threshold before reaching `(1, 2)`.

For example, if we input `n = 4`, `m = 3`, and `k = 6`, the expected output should be `(3, 1)` because that's the 7th move downward, but the code will produce `(1, 2)` instead since it doesn't properly handle the exact value of `k`. This shows that the code does not cover all potential cases and fails to give accurate output based on the complete movement logic described in the problem statement.
