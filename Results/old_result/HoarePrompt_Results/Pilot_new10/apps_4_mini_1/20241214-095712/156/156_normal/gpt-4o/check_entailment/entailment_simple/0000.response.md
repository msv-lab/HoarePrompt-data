To determine the correctness of the program according to the problem description, letâ€™s analyze the two major components: the problem requirements and the implementation.

### Problem Requirements
The problem specifies the following conditions:
- Lara starts at (1, 1) in a matrix of size n rows by m columns.
- She moves down to (n, 1) and then continues in a snake-like pattern (moving right until the end of the row, moving up one cell, then to the left in the next row, and so forth).
- Given `k`, the number of moves she has made, we need to determine her current position in the matrix.

### Program Logic
1. **Initial Move Down:**
   - The first `n - 1` moves are simply moving down column 1 from (1,1) to (n,1). If `k < n - 1`, it directly outputs the position `k + 1, 1`. This part is correct (Lara's position after `k` moves if in the vertical descent).

2. **Calculating Position After the Down Moves:**
   - When `k >= n - 1`, it subtracts the `n - 1` down moves from `k`, leaving the moves that will occur in the snake pattern.
   - The calculation of `full_rows` (`k // (m - 1)`) determines how many full rows of the snake pattern Lara has completed, giving an indication of her vertical position in the matrix.

3. **Determine Remaining Steps and Position:**
   - `remaining_steps = k % (m - 1)` calculates how many steps Lara has taken in the current row after completing full rows.
   - The subsequent logic to determine the current row and column based on whether `full_rows` is even or odd accounts for the snake pattern.

### Review of Edge Cases
- When `k = 0`, she is at (1, 1), which is handled correctly.
- When `k = n - 1`, she reaches (n, 1) at the bottom of the first column.
- As `k` increases, the program correctly calculates subsequent positions according to the specified snake-like movement.

### Conclusion
After analyzing both the problem description and the logic in the code, the program correctly implements the movement rules laid out in the problem description:
- Moves are accounted for appropriately based on the total number of steps made.
- The calculation of the current position after `k` moves reflects the described behavior of Lara's navigation in the dungeon.

Therefore, the program meets all the requirements provided in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
