The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `k`. The parameters `n` and `m` are even integers that satisfy the constraints 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9. The parameter `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k < n·m. The function is designed to return a value based on these input parameters, although the specific output for different cases is not provided in this instance.

Functionality: **The function accepts two even integers n and m (where 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9), and a non-negative integer k (where 0 ≤ k < n·m), and returns a value based on these parameters.**
