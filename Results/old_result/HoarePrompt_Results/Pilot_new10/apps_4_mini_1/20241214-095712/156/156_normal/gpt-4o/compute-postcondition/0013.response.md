To provide the output state, we need to consider the conditions regarding `full_rows`, `remaining_steps`, `row`, and `col` bearing in mind whether `full_rows` is even or odd. Given the initial conditions, the code `print(row, col)` will output the calculated values for `row` and `col`, but we must determine what those values are based on the conditions stated and update accordingly.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are even integers such that 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9; `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k < n·m; `full_rows` is either equal to `k // (m - 1)`; `remaining_steps` is equal to `k % (m - 1)`; `row` is equal to `n - full_rows`; `col` is equal to `2 + remaining_steps` if `full_rows` is even, or `m - remaining_steps` if `full_rows` is odd, and the values of `row` and `col` are printed.**
