Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer representing the number of operations, `operations` is a non-empty string, `ops` has a length of at least `len(ops)`, and `op` is the subsequent character in `ops`. If `op` is 'R' and `dx` is greater than 0, `dx` is decreased by 1. If `op` is 'L' and `dx` is negative, then `dx` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `res` is increased by 1.***
