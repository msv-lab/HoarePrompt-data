According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `operations`, which is a non-empty string containing the characters U, D, L, and R. The loop iterates over each character in the `operations` string. At the end of the last iteration, since `operations` is non-empty and `n` is at least 1, we can successfully check the loop's index. Given that `operations` is of length `n`, for the loop to execute one more time, the index (or position being processed) must be at most `n - 1`. If `op` is the last character processed at index `n - 1`, we need to increment the index to `n`, which means `operations` has to have `n + 1` characters to still be within bounds, but since `operations` is a non-empty string it will not change.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration needs to reflect that `op` would be referring to the next character (if it existed), meaning it will be outside of the valid range for `operations`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 200000, `operations` is a non-empty string of length `n`, `op` will be beyond the last character in the string (thus invalid)**
