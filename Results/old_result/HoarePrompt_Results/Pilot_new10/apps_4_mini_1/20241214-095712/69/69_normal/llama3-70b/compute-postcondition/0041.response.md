The code contains a print statement that outputs `-1`, but it does not alter the values of any variables in the initial state. The variables remain unchanged, and the function simply outputs a value without affecting other program state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of operations, `operations` is a non-empty string, `ux` is the net effect of 'R' and 'L' operations, `uy` is the net effect of 'U' and 'D' operations, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, `dx` is equal to `x - ux`, `dy` is equal to `y - uy`, and either `dx` is less than 0 or `dy` is less than 0; value `-1` has been returned.**
