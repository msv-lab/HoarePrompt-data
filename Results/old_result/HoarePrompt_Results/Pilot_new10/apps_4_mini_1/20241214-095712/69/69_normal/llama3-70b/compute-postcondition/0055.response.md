`dx` is incremented by 1. Since the initial state indicates that the current value of `dx` is less than 0, after this operation, `dx` will still be less than or equal to 0 (it will now be equal to -1, assuming its initial value was -1). The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of operations, `operations` is a non-empty string, `ops` is derived from `operations`, `op` is equal to 'L', `dx` is now an integer greater than -1, and either `op` is not 'R' or `dx` is less than or equal to 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of operations, `operations` is a non-empty string, `ops` is derived from `operations`, `op` is equal to 'L', `dx` is an integer greater than -1, and either `op` is not 'R' or `dx` is less than or equal to 0.**
