The value of `final_y` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `final_y` is unknown. The values of `n` and `operations` remain unchanged, while the new value of `final_y` will be one more than its previous value. The states of `n` and `operations` are valid before and after the execution. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 200000; `operations` is a non-empty string of length `n`; `final_y` is increased by 1.**
