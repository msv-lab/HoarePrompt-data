The code `current_x -= 1` decrements the value of `current_x` by 1. The other variables are not affected, so we will retain their relationships and previous states. 

Since `current_x` is decreased by 1, we can express its new value as `current_x - 1`. The Output State will reflect this change while maintaining the other variable states intact.

Output State: **`final_x` is equal to `count_R - count_L`, `final_y` is equal to `count_U - count_D`, `dx` is equal to `x - final_x`, `dy` is equal to `y + count_D - count_U`, `position_map` is {(0, 0): -1, (current_x - 1, current_y): i}, `i` is `i_current + 2`, and `n` is greater than `i_current + 2.**
