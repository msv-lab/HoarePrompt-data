`uy` is incremented by 1. The value of `n` remains a positive integer, and `operations` is still a non-empty string. The values of `op`, `ux`, `lx`, and `ly` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a non-empty string, `op` is the next character in `operations`, `ux` is unchanged, `uy` is updated to `uy + 1`, `lx` is unchanged, `ly` is unchanged.**
