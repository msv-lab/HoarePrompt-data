Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 200000; `operations` is a non-empty string of length `n`; if `op` is 'U', `final_y` is incremented by 1 while `final_x` remains unchanged. If `op` is 'D', then `final_y` is reduced by 1 while `final_x` remains unchanged. If `op` is 'L', then `final_x` is decreased by 1 and `final_y` remains unchanged. If `op` is 'R', then `final_x` is increased by 1 and `final_y` remains unchanged; otherwise, both `final_x` and `final_y` remain unchanged.***
