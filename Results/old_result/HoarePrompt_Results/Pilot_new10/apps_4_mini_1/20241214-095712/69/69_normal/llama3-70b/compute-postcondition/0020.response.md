In the given loop, the loop is dependent on the variable `ops` which is a non-empty string. We start with the current state of the values at the end of the previous iteration, which involves the variables `n`, `operations`, `op`, `ux`, `uy`, `lx`, and `ly`. 

Since `ops` is a non-empty string, it indicates that there are still operations left to iterate over. The loop will continue executing as long as there are more characters to process in the `ops` string.

1. **Adjust `op`:** The current `op` should be advanced to the next character of the string `ops` at the start of the next iteration, so it needs to be updated accordingly. Assuming that during the previous iteration the current `op` was the last character of the string, the loop would exit. Otherwise, `op` will point to the next character in the next iteration.

2. **Adjust `ux`, `uy`, `lx`, `ly`:** The variables `ux`, `uy`, `lx`, and `ly` need to be calculated based on the new `op` value. Each type of operation ('U', 'D', 'R', 'L') updates these values in a specific way.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust:

- `op` to the next character in `ops`, which updates the actions for `ux`, `uy`, `lx`, and `ly`.
- The other states remain unchanged unless it's defined by the new `op`.

Since the task mentions the conditions for different operations, one can assume the next `op` corresponds to some valid index in `ops`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a non-empty string, `op` is set to the next character in `operations`, `ux`, `uy`, `lx`, and `ly` are updated according to the new `op`**.
