The code assigns `target_pos` the values of `current_x + dx` and `current_y + dy`. 

Let's break this down:

- `dx` is defined as `x - final_x`
- `dy` is defined as `y + count_D - count_U`

Thus, it means that:
- `target_pos` will be assigned the values of `current_x + (x - final_x)` and `current_y + (y + count_D - count_U)`.

No other variables are affected, but we maintain all valid preconditions. Therefore:

Output State: **`final_x` is equal to `count_R - count_L`, `final_y` is equal to `count_U - count_D`, `dx` is equal to `x - final_x`, `dy` is equal to `y + count_D - count_U`, `position_map` remains {(0, 0): -1}, `i` is `i_current + 1`, and `n` must be greater than `i_current + 1; target_pos is (current_x + (x - final_x), current_y + (y + count_D - count_U))**.
