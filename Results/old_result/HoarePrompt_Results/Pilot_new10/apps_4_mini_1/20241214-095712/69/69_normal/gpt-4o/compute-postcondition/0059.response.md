Postcondition: ***`final_x` is equal to `count_R - count_L`, `final_y` is equal to `count_U - count_D`, `dx` is equal to `x - final_x`, `dy` is equal to `y + count_D - count_U`, `min_length` is equal to float('inf'), `position_map` is {(0, 0): -1}, `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0. If the operation at index `i` is 'L', then `current_x` is -1 and `current_y` is 0. Otherwise, if the operation at index `i` is 'R', then `current_x` is 1 and `current_y` is 0, with no changes occurring for other operations at index `i`.***
