The variable `ux` is decremented by 1. The initial state does not provide the specific value of `ux`, but it is known that `n` is a positive integer, and `operations` is a non-empty string, with `op` being updated from it. The states of the other variables (`n`, `operations`, `op`, `uy`, `lx`, and `ly`) are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a non-empty string, `op` is the next character in `operations`, `ux` is decremented by 1.**
