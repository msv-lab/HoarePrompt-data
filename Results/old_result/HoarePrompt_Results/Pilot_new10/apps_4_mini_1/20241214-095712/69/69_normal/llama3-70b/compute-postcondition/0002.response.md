The code assigns the values from the user input to the variables `x` and `y`. The input consists of two integers separated by a space. The values of `x` and `y` are directly impacted based on this input. The initial values of `n`, `operations`, and `ops` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects only the updated values of `x` and `y`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer based on input (1 <= n <= 200000), `operations` is a string of length equal to the user input, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `ops` is the user input string**
