Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (the number of operations), a string `ops` consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R' representing movement directions, and two integers `x` and `y` as starting coordinates. It calculates the net effect of the operations on coordinates based on the movements. If the remaining distance in either the x or y direction is negative after applying the movements, it returns -1. Otherwise, it counts and returns the number of operations that did not change the position (i.e., ignored operations) needed to reach the final targeted coordinates (x, y). **
