The operation `print(res)` outputs the value of `res`, but does not modify any variables or their values. The values of `n`, `dx`, `dy`, and `ops` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged preconditions.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of operations; `res` is the count of ignored operations; `dx` is equal to `max(0, x - ux - R_count); `dy` is equal to `max(0, y - uy - U_count); `ops` represents the executed operations resulting in changes**.
