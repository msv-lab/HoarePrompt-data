The variable `final_y` is assigned the value `0`. The initial state indicates that `final_x` was already `0`, so the only change in the output state is the assignment of `final_y`. Other variables (`n`, `operations`, `x`, and `y`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 200000, `operations` is a string of length n consisting of characters U, D, L, and R, `x` and `y` are integers such that -10^9 <= x, y <= 10^9, `final_x` is 0, `final_y` is 0**
