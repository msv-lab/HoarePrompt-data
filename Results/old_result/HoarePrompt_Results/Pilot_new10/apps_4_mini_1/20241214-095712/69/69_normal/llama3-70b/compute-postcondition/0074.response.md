The value of `dy` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `dy` is not specified, but the operation implies that it now has a value that is one unit greater than its previous value. The states of the other variables (`n`, `operations`, `ops`, and `op`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State includes the updated information about `dy` while retaining the rest of the information.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of operations, `operations` is a non-empty string, `ops` has a length of at least `len(ops)`, and `dy` is incremented by 1.**
