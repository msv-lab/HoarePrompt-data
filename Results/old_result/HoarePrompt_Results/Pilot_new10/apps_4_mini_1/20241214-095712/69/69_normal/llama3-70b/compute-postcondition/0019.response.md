Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer and `operations` is a non-empty string. If `op` is equal to 'U', then `ux` is 0, `uy` is 1, `lx` is 0, and `ly` is 0. If `op` is equal to 'D', then `ux` is 0, `uy` is -1, `lx` is 0, and `ly` is 0. If `op` is equal to 'R', then `ux` is set to 1, `uy` is 0, `lx` is 0, and `ly` is 0. If `op` is equal to 'L', then `ux` is set to -1, `uy` is 0, `lx` is 0, and `ly` is 0, while `op` is not equal to 'R'.***
