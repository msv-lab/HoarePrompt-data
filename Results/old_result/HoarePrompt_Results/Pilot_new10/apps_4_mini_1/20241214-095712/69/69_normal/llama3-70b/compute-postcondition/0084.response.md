Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer representing the number of operations. If either `dx` or `dy` is less than 0, the function returns `-1`. Otherwise, `dx` is updated to be the maximum of `0` or `x - ux - R_count`, `dy` is updated to be the maximum of `0` or `y - uy - U_count`, and `res` represents the count of ignored operations with `ops` reflecting the executed operations resulting in changes.***
