`uy` is decremented by 1. The values of `n`, `operations`, `op`, `ux`, `lx`, and `ly` remain unchanged. The specific value of `uy` is now one less than its previous value. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a non-empty string, `op` is set to the next character in `operations`, `ux`, `uy` is now one less than its previous value, `lx`, and `ly` are unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a non-empty string, `op` is set to the next character in `operations`, `ux`, `uy` is now decremented by 1, `lx`, and `ly` remain unchanged.**
