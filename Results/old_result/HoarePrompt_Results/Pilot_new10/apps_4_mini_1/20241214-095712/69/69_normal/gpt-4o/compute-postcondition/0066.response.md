Output State: **`final_x` is equal to `count_R - count_L`, `final_y` is equal to `count_U - count_D`, `dx` is equal to `x - final_x`, `dy` is equal to `y + count_D - count_U`, and `position_map` is updated with the value `i` at the key `(current_x, current_y)`, where `position_map` remains {(0, 0): -1}**
