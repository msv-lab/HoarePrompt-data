The variable `dy` is decremented by 1. The initial state does not provide a specific value for `dy`, but it remains unaffected by other variables. The conditions about `n`, `operations`, `ops`, and `op` do not change.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of operations, `operations` is a non-empty string, `ops` must have a length of at least `len(ops) + 1`, `op` must be the next character in `ops`, and `dy` is decreased by 1.**
