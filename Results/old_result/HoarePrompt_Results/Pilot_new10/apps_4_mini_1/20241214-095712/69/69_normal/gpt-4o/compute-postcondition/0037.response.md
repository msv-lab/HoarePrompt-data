Given the initial state, we will analyze the impact of the code provided.

Initial State:
- `final_x` is the net change in the x-coordinate based on the operations in the string `operations`
- `final_y` is the net change in the y-coordinate
- `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters U, D, L, and R
- `count_U`, `count_D`, `count_L`, and `count_R` are the counts of 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R' in `operations`
- `final_x` is equal to `count_R - count_L`
- `final_y` is equal to `count_U - count_D`
- `x` is unspecified in the initial state

The code statement `dx = x - final_x` assigns to `dx` the value of `x` minus `final_x`. The variable `dx` is introduced here.

The preconditions remain unchanged except for the addition of `dx`. The value of `dx` is now dependent on the current value of `x` and the previously calculated `final_x`.

Output State: **`final_x` is `count_R - count_L`, `final_y` is `count_U - count_D`, `dx` is equal to `x - final_x`**
