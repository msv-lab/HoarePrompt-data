According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `d`. If `i` is less than `d`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `d` is a positive integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, which makes `i` equal to 2. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `d` must be greater than 2.

State: **`d` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the coordinates of `sofas[2]`**
