You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Yet another round on DecoForces is coming! Grandpa Maks wanted to participate in it but someone has stolen his precious sofa! And how can one perform well with such a major loss?

Fortunately, the thief had left a note for Grandpa Maks. This note got Maks to the sofa storehouse. Still he had no idea which sofa belongs to him as they all looked the same!

The storehouse is represented as matrix n × m. Every sofa takes two neighbouring by some side cells. No cell is covered by more than one sofa. There can be empty cells.

Sofa A is standing to the left of sofa B if there exist two such cells a and b that x_{a} < x_{b}, a is covered by A and b is covered by B. Sofa A is standing to the top of sofa B if there exist two such cells a and b that y_{a} < y_{b}, a is covered by A and b is covered by B. Right and bottom conditions are declared the same way. 

Note that in all conditions A ≠ B. Also some sofa A can be both to the top of another sofa B and to the bottom of it. The same is for left and right conditions.

The note also stated that there are cnt_{l} sofas to the left of Grandpa Maks's sofa, cnt_{r} — to the right, cnt_{t} — to the top and cnt_{b} — to the bottom.

Grandpa Maks asks you to help him to identify his sofa. It is guaranteed that there is no more than one sofa of given conditions.

Output the number of Grandpa Maks's sofa. If there is no such sofa that all the conditions are met for it then output -1.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer number d (1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5) — the number of sofas in the storehouse.

The second line contains two integer numbers n, m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5) — the size of the storehouse.

Next d lines contains four integer numbers x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 (1 ≤ x_1, x_2 ≤ n, 1 ≤ y_1, y_2 ≤ m) — coordinates of the i-th sofa. It is guaranteed that cells (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) have common side, (x_1, y_1)  ≠  (x_2, y_2) and no cell is covered by more than one sofa.

The last line contains four integer numbers cnt_{l}, cnt_{r}, cnt_{t}, cnt_{b} (0 ≤ cnt_{l}, cnt_{r}, cnt_{t}, cnt_{b} ≤ d - 1).


-----Output-----

Print the number of the sofa for which all the conditions are met. Sofas are numbered 1 through d as given in input. If there is no such sofa then print -1.

-----Note-----

Let's consider the second example.   The first sofa has 0 to its left, 2 sofas to its right ((1, 1) is to the left of both (5, 5) and (5, 4)), 0 to its top and 2 to its bottom (both 2nd and 3rd sofas are below).  The second sofa has cnt_{l} = 2, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 2 and cnt_{b} = 0.  The third sofa has cnt_{l} = 2, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 1 and cnt_{b} = 1. 

So the second one corresponds to the given conditions.

In the third example   The first sofa has cnt_{l} = 1, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 0 and cnt_{b} = 1.  The second sofa has cnt_{l} = 1, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 1 and cnt_{b} = 0. 

And there is no sofa with the set (1, 0, 0, 0) so the answer is -1.
Program:
```
d = int(input())
(n, m) = map(int, input().split())
sofas = []
for _ in range(d):
    (x1, y1, x2, y2) = map(int, input().split())
    sofas.append(((x1, y1), (x2, y2)))
(cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b) = map(int, input().split())
for (i, sofa) in enumerate(sofas):
    (left, right, top, bottom) = func_1(sofa, sofas)
    if (left, right, top, bottom) == (cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b):
        print(i + 1)
        break
else:
    print(-1)

def func_1(sofa, sofas):
    (left, right, top, bottom) = (0, 0, 0, 0)
    for s in sofas:
        if s != sofa:
            if sofa[0][0] < s[0][0] and sofa[0][1] == s[0][1]:
                left += 1
            if sofa[0][0] > s[0][0] and sofa[0][1] == s[0][1]:
                right += 1
            if sofa[0][1] < s[0][1] and sofa[0][0] == s[0][0]:
                top += 1
            if sofa[0][1] > s[0][1] and sofa[0][0] == s[0][0]:
                bottom += 1
    return (left, right, top, bottom)


```
Original Assessment: To validate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic and identify if the program correctly determines which sofa matches the specified conditions. 

The program has several components:

1. It reads the number of sofas and their dimensions.
2. It stores the coordinates of each sofa in a list.
3. It reads the expected counts (cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b).
4. It checks for each sofa by calling `func_1` which counts how many sofas are to the left, right, top, and bottom of the given sofa.

The main issue to look for is whether all conditions of the problem are correctly represented and checked. The logic for counting the positions of other sofas relative to a target sofa within `func_1` directly reflects the problem requirements.

However, when we inspect the method of comparison in `func_1`, we see that it uses the first cell (the leftmost cell of the sofa) for comparisons, which could lead to inaccurate counts in certain configurations. 

### Potential issue:
Consider the following example:

```
Input:
3
3 3
1 1 1 2
2 1 2 2
2 3 2 2
1 1 1 1
```

### Expected results:
- Sofa 1 has 0 to the left, 2 to the right (sofas 2 and 3), 0 to the top, and 0 below.
- Sofa 2 has 1 to the left (sofa 1), 0 to the right, 0 to the top, and 1 below (sofa 3).
- Sofa 3 has 1 to the left (sofa 2), but counting this with the method used in the program could be incorrect due to how it determines positions.

The program calculates `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom` based on checks that can miss those positions depending on how the coordinates are handled (if both cells of a sofa are not considered, leading to a miscount).

Thus, a scenario exists where the expected counts do not match the implemented logic used in `func_1`. Therefore, it is likely that the program fails to cover all edge cases in determining conditions correctly.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**. 
The program does not guarantee accurate results for every potential configuration of sofas due to its counting logic, particularly in cases where multiple sofas can share coordinates or when the coordinate comparisons do not reflect all occupied cells accurately.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
d = int(input())
(n, m) = map(int, input().split())
sofas = []
for _ in range(d):
    (x1, y1, x2, y2) = map(int, input().split())
    sofas.append(((x1, y1), (x2, y2)))
(cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b) = map(int, input().split())
for (i, sofa) in enumerate(sofas):
    (left, right, top, bottom) = func_1(sofa, sofas)
    if (left, right, top, bottom) == (cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b):
        print(i + 1)
        break
else:
    print(-1)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: sofa is an integer representing the number of sofas, sofas is a list of tuples where each tuple contains four integers representing the coordinates of each sofa. The last input represents four integers indicating the counts of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom. All integers are within the given constraints.
def func_1(sofa, sofas):
    left, right, top, bottom = 0, 0, 0, 0
    for s in sofas:
        if s != sofa:
            if sofa[0][0] < s[0][0] and sofa[0][1] == s[0][1]:
                left += 1
            if sofa[0][0] > s[0][0] and sofa[0][1] == s[0][1]:
                right += 1
            if sofa[0][1] < s[0][1] and sofa[0][0] == s[0][0]:
                top += 1
            if sofa[0][1] > s[0][1] and sofa[0][0] == s[0][0]:
                bottom += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sofa` is at least 1, `sofas` is a list of tuples with size equal to its original size, `left` represents the number of sofas to the left of `sofa` based on their coordinates, `right` represents the number of sofas to the right of `sofa`, `top` represents the number of sofas above `sofa`, and `bottom` represents the number of sofas below `sofa`. If `sofa` coincides with any tuple in `sofas`, it is not counted in left, right, top, or bottom calculations.
    return left, right, top, bottom
    #The program returns the values of left, right, top, and bottom which represent the number of sofas to the left, right, above, and below the specified sofa respectively, based on their coordinates, excluding the sofa itself from these counts.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `sofa` representing the index of a sofa and a list of tuples `sofas` containing coordinates of each sofa. It returns four integers indicating the counts of sofas that are positioned to the left, right, top, and bottom of the specified sofa based on their coordinates. The function counts only those sofas that are not the same as the specified sofa. However, the input type for `sofa` should be clearer; it is expected to be used as an index but not enforced in the implementation, potentially leading to incorrect results if the provided index does not align with the tuple structure. Hence, validation for `sofa` being a valid index should be considered an edge case.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
