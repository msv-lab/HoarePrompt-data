`target_sofa` is assigned the value of `i + 1`, where `i` is 2. Therefore, `target_sofa` will be equal to `2 + 1`, which is 3. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`d` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the coordinates of `sofas[2]`, `target_sofa` is 3**
