Postcondition: ***`right_count[1]`, `left_count[i]`, `bottom_count[2]`, and `top_count[1]` are updated counts based on comparisons. If `x1` is greater than `x2_j` and `x2` is greater than `x2_j`, then `right_count[1]` and `left_count[i]` are increased by 1; `bottom_count[2]` and `top_count[1]` are also updated based on comparisons, while `d`, `i`, and `j` remain greater than 2, 2, and 1 respectively, with `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` equal to the values from `sofas[1]`.***
