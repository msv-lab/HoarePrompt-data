Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because the logic for determining the number of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom is flawed. Here is the breakdown of the problems:

1. **Incorrect Sofa Comparison for Coordinates**: The `func_1` function is designed to determine how many sofas are positioned in relation to a given sofa based on their coordinates. However, it only checks the coordinates of the top-left corner of the sofas. Given that sofas are represented by two adjacent cells, this approach is insufficient as it does not account for all possible ways sofas can be positioned relative to each other.

2. **Logic Issues in the Count Calculation**: The comparison conditions in `func_1` involve solely checking relative positions based on the first coordinate of `sofa` with the first coordinate of other sofas, neglecting the scenario where the second coordinates (y-coordinates) must also be considered. This may lead to incorrect counts since it does not accurately check for adjacency and positional relationships as specified in the problem description.

3. **Boundary Conditions Not Handled**: The function does not correctly handle cases where sofas could be positioned in a different orientation (i.e., vertical vs. horizontal alignment). For instance, a sofa positioned at (x1, y1) to (x2, y2) in a vertical orientation should be compared against other sofas in both vertical and horizontal axes based on their occupied cells. The current implementation is not robust against such conditions.

In summary, because the program does not implement the required checks to accurately determine the relationships (left, right, top, bottom) based on the described conditions, it will fail to produce correct results for many test cases. Thus, it does not fulfill the requirements of the problem as described.
