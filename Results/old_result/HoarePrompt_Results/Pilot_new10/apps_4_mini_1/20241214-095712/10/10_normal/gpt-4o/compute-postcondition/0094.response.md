The values of the variables do not change because the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the remaining code in the current loop iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the loop. This means that no variables have been modified. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is greater than 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and we skip to the next loop iteration.

Output State: **`d` is greater than 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and we skip to the next loop iteration.**
