Final: **False**

The original assessment correctly identifies potential logic flaws within the program, notably that the counting logic in `func_1` only checks the first cell of the sofa, neglecting the second cell. This oversight could lead to inaccurate counting of sofas in relation to Grandpa Maks' sofa, violating the problem's requirements. The annotations reinforce that the counting is limited to one cell, which does not fully encompass the positioning rules defined in the problem description, ultimately leading to cases where the program could provide incorrect results. Thus, the original assessment is accurate in its conclusion regarding the program's correctness.
