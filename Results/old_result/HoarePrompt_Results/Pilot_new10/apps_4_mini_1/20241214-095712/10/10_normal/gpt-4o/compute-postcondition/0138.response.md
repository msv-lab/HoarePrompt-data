The `continue` statement does not change any variable values or states directly; it simply skips the rest of the current iteration of a loop and moves to the next iteration. The states of the variables in their precondition are unaffected apart from this behavioral implication.

Output State: **`right_count[1]`, `left_count[i]`, `bottom_count[2]`, and `top_count[1]` are updated counts based on comparisons; `d` is greater than 2; `i` is greater than 2; `j` is 2; `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are equal to the values from `sofas[1]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
