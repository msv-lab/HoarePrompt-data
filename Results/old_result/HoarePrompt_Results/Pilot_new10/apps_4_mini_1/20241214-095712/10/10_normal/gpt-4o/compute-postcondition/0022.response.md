The `continue` statement is used to skip the remainder of the current loop iteration and proceed to the next iteration. The values of `i`, `j`, and `d` as well as sofa variables `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` remain unchanged since no operation modifies them directly at this point. However, the loop context is affected as we will skip to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`d` must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are assigned values from `sofas[0]`, and we will continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
