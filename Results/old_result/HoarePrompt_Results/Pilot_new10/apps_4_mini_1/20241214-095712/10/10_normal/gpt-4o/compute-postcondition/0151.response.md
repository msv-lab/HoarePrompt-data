The variable `target_sofa` is assigned the value `-1`. This assignment replaces any previous value of `target_sofa` with `-1`, but other variables and counts remain unaffected. Hence, the output state will reflect this change.

Output State: **`d` is a positive integer, `right_count` contains the counts of how many sofas are to the right of each respective sofa, `left_count` contains the counts of how many sofas are to the left of each respective sofa, `bottom_count` contains the counts of how many sofas are below each respective sofa, `top_count` contains the counts of how many sofas are above each respective sofa, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples containing the coordinates of each sofa, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` represent the coordinates of the currently processed sofa in each iteration, and `target_sofa` is -1.**
