The variable `sofas` is assigned an empty list. The variables `d`, `n`, and `m` are unchanged, but `sofas` now holds no elements. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is an integer representing the number of sofas (1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5), `n` is a positive integer which is the user-defined value, `m` is a positive integer which is the user-defined value, and `sofas` is an empty list.

Output State: **`d` is an integer representing the number of sofas (1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5), `n` is a positive integer which is the user-defined value, `m` is a positive integer which is the user-defined value, and `sofas` is an empty list.**
