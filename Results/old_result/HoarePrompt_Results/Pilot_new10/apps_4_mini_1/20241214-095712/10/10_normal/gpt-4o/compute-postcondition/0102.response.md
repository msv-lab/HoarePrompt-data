Postcondition: ***`d` is greater than 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, with `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` assigned values from `sofas[2]`. If `y1` is less than `y1_j` and `y2` is less than `y1_j`, then `bottom_count[1]` is increased by 1. If the condition is not satisfied, the state remains unchanged.***
