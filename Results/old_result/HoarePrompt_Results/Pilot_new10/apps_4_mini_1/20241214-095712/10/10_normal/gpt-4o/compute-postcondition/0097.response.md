The value of `right_count[i]` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is 1, so `right_count[1]` will be updated from its previous value (unknown) to one more than that. The states of the other variables (`d`, `j`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j`) are not affected. 

Output State: **`d` is greater than 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are assigned values from `sofas[2]`, and `right_count[i]` is increased by 1.**
