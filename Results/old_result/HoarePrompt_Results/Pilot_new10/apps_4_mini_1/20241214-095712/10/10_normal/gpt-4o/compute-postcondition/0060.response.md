Postcondition: ***`d` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `x1_j, y1_j, x2_j, y2_j` are assigned values from `sofas[2]`. If `y1` is greater than `y2_j` and `y2` is greater than `y2_j`, then `top_count[i]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `bottom_count[i]` is increased by 1 if `y1` is less than `y1_j` and `y2` is also less than `y1_j`; otherwise, `bottom_count[i]` remains unchanged.***
