The code assigns the values from the tuple `sofas[j]` to the variables `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j`. The other variables are not affected by this assignment. Since `i` is equal to `j`, the execution skips to the next iteration, thus no assignments actually occur and the values of `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`d` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` remain unchanged, and we skip to the next iteration**.
