Postcondition: ***`d` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` remain unchanged. If both `x1` and `x2` are less than `x1_j`, then `right_count[1]` is incremented by 1; `left_count[0]`, `bottom_count[0]`, and `top_count[0]` reflect the number of sofas in relation to `sofas[0]`. The current value of `x1` is greater than `x2_j`, and the current value of `x2` is greater than `x2_j.***
