The code assigns the values obtained from user input to the variables `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`. The `map(int, input().strip().split())` function takes a single input line, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns them to the respective variables. The values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are now determined by the provided input, while the values of `d`, `n`, `m`, and `sofas` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `sofas` contains the original tuple plus the new tuple `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`, with `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` being input integers.**
