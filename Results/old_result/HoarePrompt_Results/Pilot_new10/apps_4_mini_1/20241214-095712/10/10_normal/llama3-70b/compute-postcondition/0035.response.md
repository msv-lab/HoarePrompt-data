Postcondition: ***`sofa` is at least 1, `sofas` is a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, and `s` is the third tuple in the list `sofas`. If `s` is not equal to `sofa`, and if the first element of the first tuple in `sofa` is greater than the first element of the first tuple in `s` while the second elements are equal, then `bottom` is increased by 1; otherwise, `bottom` remains unchanged.***
