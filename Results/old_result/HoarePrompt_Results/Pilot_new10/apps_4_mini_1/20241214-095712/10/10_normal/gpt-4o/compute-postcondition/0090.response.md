Postcondition: ***Given that `d` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `j` is 1, if `y1` is less than `y1_j` and `y2` is less than `y1_j`, then `bottom_count[1]` is increased by 1. If the condition is not met, the state of all other variables remains unchanged (including `left_count[1]`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`).***
