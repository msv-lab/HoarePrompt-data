Postcondition: ***`d` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the coordinates of `sofas[1]`. If `left_count[i]` equals `cnt_l`, `right_count[i]` equals `cnt_r`, `top_count[i]` equals `cnt_t`, and `bottom_count[i]` equals `cnt_b`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, indicating that the conditions for breaking have been met.***
