Postcondition: ***`right_count[1]`, `left_count[1]`, `bottom_count[1]`, and `top_count[1]` are updated counts based on comparisons with all sofas except `sofas[1]`, `d` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, and variables `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned values from `sofas[0]`, and `j` is 0. The current value of `y1` is less than `y1_j`, and the current value of `y2` is less than `y1_j`. If `x1` is greater than `x2_j` and `x2` is greater than `x2_j`, then `left_count[2]` is increased by 1 while the other counts remain the same.***
