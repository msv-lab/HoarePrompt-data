Output State: **`right_count[1]`, `left_count[i]`, `bottom_count[2]`, and `top_count[1]` are updated counts based on comparisons; `bottom_count[i]` is either increased by 1 or remains the same depending on the comparison conditions; `d`, `i`, and `j` remain greater than 2, 2, and 1 respectively; `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are equal to the values from `sofas[1]`; `top_count[i]` is increased by 1.**
