The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the current loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the coordinates of `sofas[i]`, and `left_count[i]`, `right_count[i]`, `top_count[i]`, and `bottom_count[i]` are equal to `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` respectively; `target_sofa` is equal to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
