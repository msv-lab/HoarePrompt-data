Final: **False**

The original assessment correctly identifies a potential issue with how the program determines the counts of sofas relative to a specified sofa, particularly in cases where multiple coordinates could lead to miscalculations. The logic within `func_1` is based on comparing only the first coordinate of the sofas instead of considering both cells that the sofas occupy. This oversight can lead to inaccurate counts, causing the program to fail in correctly identifying the sofa that matches the specified conditions. 

The annotations further confirm that the program maintains its structure and intended constraints but do not address the crucial flaw in coordinate comparison. 

Thus, the assessment stands validated; the program does not guarantee accurate results for all configurations of sofas as specified in the problem description.
