The code `continue` is used to skip the rest of the current loop iteration and immediately begins the next iteration. In this case, no variables are modified directly by this statement. The values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned the values from `sofas[2]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
