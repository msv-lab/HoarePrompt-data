The `print` statement outputs the value of `total_fruits`, which is calculated as `max_lemons * 7`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged, and we still know that `max_lemons` is equal to `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`, which defines its value based on the inputs. The output of `print` does not affect any variable values, it only displays `total_fruits`. 

Output State: **`a` is an input positive integer, `b` is an input positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, `c` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `c` ≤ 1000, `max_lemons` is equal to min(a, b // 2, c // 4), `total_fruits` is equal to `max_lemons * 7`, and `total_fruits` value has been printed.**
