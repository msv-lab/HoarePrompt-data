The variable `a` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means it will take an integer input from the user. The limits for `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged, so `b` and `c` will still be positive integers in the range of 1 to 1000. The specific value of `a` will depend on the user input, but it will be a positive integer as per the constraints.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer (inputted value), `b` is a positive integer (1 ≤ b ≤ 1000), `c` is a positive integer (1 ≤ c ≤ 1000)**.
