Since the code snippet prints the result but does not assign any values to any variables, we will only focus on the outputs derived from the expression in the print statement using the input parameters.

The expression calculates the output as follows:
```
output = min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4
```
This can be simplified to:
```
output = min_lemon * (1 + 2 + 4) = min_lemon * 7
```

Given that `min_lemon` is computed as `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`, `min_lemon` will hold the minimum value among the three calculated values.

Therefore, the only changes in the state come from the output derived from the calculation using `min_lemon`.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer (1 ≤ `b` ≤ 1000), `c` is an input integer, `min_lemon` is min(`a`, `b // 2`, `c // 4`), output is `min_lemon * 7`.**
