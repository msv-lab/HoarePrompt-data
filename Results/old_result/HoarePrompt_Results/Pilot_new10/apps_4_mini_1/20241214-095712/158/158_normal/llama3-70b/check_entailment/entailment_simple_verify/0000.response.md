Final: **True** 

The original assessment accurately reflects the correctness of the program based on the problem description and the annotations provided. The annotated code clearly demonstrates that the program reads valid inputs for the number of lemons (a), apples (b), and pears (c), and correctly applies the logic to determine the maximum sets of fruit ratios defined in the problem (1:2:4). Each test case considered during the assessment confirmed that the program functions as intended, yielding correct outputs consistent with the specified requirements. The annotations support this by confirming the constraints of the inputs, thus reinforcing the original assessment that the program is indeed correct.
