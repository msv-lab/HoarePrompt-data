The value of `b` is assigned the value from `int(input())`, which is an input integer that can range from 1 to 1000. The states of the other variables `a` and `c` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State reflects the potential range of the variable `b`.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer (inputted value), `b` is an input integer (1 ≤ `b` ≤ 1000), `c` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `c` ≤ 1000)**
