To determine the correctness of the provided program in relation to the problem description, let's analyze the annotated program step by step.

### Problem Analysis
According to the problem:
- Nikolay has a certain number of lemons (a), apples (b), and pears (c).
- The required ratio for making the compote is 1 lemon to 2 apples to 4 pears.
- We need to determine the maximum total number of fruits (lemons, apples, and pears) that can be used to make the compote based on the available quantities and the required ratio.

### Proposed Solution in the Program
1. The program reads three integers from input, which represent the number of lemons (a), apples (b), and pears (c).
2. It calculates `min_lemon`, which represents how many complete sets of 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears can be created. This is calculated using:
   - The number of lemons directly available `a`
   - The number of complete pairs of apples (i.e., `b // 2`, because it takes 2 apples for each lemon)
   - The number of complete groups of pears (i.e., `c // 4`, because it takes 4 pears for each lemon)
   Thus, `min_lemon` is determined by the minimum of these three values: `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`.
3. Finally, the total number of fruits used in the compote is calculated and printed, as:
   - `min_lemon + (min_lemon * 2) + (min_lemon * 4)` which simplifies to `min_lemon * 7` since:
     - 1 lemon contributes 1 to the sum
     - 2 apples contribute 2 to the sum
     - 4 pears contribute 4 to the sum

### Correctness Evaluation
- The program accurately follows the described logic of determining how many sets of fruits can be created based on the constraints provided.
- It correctly checks each type of fruit against its required ratio and ensures no fractional counts affect the computation.
- Finally, the output correctly represents the total number of fruits combined based on the number of complete sets that can be made.

### Conclusion
Given that the program adheres to the problem requirements and correctly implements the logic to compute the maximum number of fruits that can be used in the compote, we can conclude:

Correctness: **True**
