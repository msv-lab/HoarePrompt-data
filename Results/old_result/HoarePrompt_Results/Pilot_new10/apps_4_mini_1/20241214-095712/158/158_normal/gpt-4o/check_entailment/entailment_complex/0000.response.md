The provided program reads three integers representing the quantities of lemons, apples, and pears and calculates the maximum total number of fruits that can be used in a compote according to the required ratio of 1:2:4 (lemons:apples:pears). 

Let's analyze the program step by step:

1. **Input**: The function reads three positive integers from user input: `a` for lemons, `b` for apples, and `c` for pears. The program assumes that the input values follow the constraints of being positive integers between 1 and 1000, which is specified in the comments.

2. **Calculation of Maximum Lemons**: The program uses the line `max_lemons = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)` to determine the maximum number of lemons that can be used in the compote:
   - It takes `a` as the maximum number of lemons available.
   - It calculates how many lemons can be matched with apples using `b // 2`, since each lemon requires two apples.
   - It calculates how many lemons can be matched with pears using `c // 4`, since each lemon requires four pears.
   - By taking the minimum of these three values, we ensure that we do not exceed the available fruits.

3. **Total Fruits Calculation**: The line `total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4` correctly calculates the total number of fruits used based on the maximum number of lemons that can be made. The expression evaluates to `max_lemons * (1 + 2 + 4)`, which thus results in the correct total.

4. **Output**: The program prints the total number of fruits used.

**Conclusion**: 
- The program adheres to the problem description. It calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used based on the available fruits and computes the total number of fruits accordingly. 
- The logic in the program matches the requirement of using 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears for each lemon based on the given ratios.

Since the program accurately reflects the requirements outlined in the problem description for all potential input cases:

Correctness: **True**
