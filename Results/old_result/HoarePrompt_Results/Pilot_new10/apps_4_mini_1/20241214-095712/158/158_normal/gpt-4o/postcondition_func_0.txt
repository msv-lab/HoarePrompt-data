The function accepts three positive integers `a`, `b`, and `c` through user input, representing quantities of fruits. It calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be made using these fruitsâ€”where 1 lemon requires 1 unit of `a`, 2 units of `b`, and 4 units of `c`. It then computes the total number of fruits used based on the maximum number of lemons that can be made and prints this total. The function does not return any value.
