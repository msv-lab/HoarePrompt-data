Correctness: **True**. 

Explanation: The code correctly implements the logic needed to determine the maximum total number of fruits that can be used in the compote based on the 1:2:4 ratio of lemons, apples, and pears. It calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used (`max_lemons`) by taking the minimum of the available lemons, half of the available apples (since it takes 2 apples per lemon), and a quarter of the available pears (since it takes 4 pears per lemon). Then, it computes the total number of fruits used based on that maximum number of lemons and correctly outputs the total. The output hints match the code's functionality, confirming that it will work for any valid input within the specified constraints. 

All given examples in the problem description are handled correctly by the code. The program returns 0 when there are not enough fruits to make even one complete set of compote based on the required ratio. Thus, the implementation meets the requirements as described.
