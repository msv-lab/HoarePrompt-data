Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly check if two sliding puzzles can reach the same configuration. The primary flaw lies in the function `func_1`, particularly in how it swaps tiles when an empty space is found.

When the function locates the empty tile ('X') in both puzzles, it incorrectly attempts to swap the characters at the found indices (`x1` and `x2`). However, this operation does not simulate the actual sliding moves required to reach a specific configuration, nor does it account for the necessary sequence of moves that would be needed from any given configuration. Sliding tiles is a restricted motion dictated by the adjacent positions, and simply sorting the grid afterward (using `sorted`) is not an adequate way to determine if both puzzles can arrive at the same configuration at all.

Consider the example:
```
Input:
AB
XC
AC
BX
```
In this case, Bessie's valid moves from `AB/XC` would be limited to the following:

1. Slide 'A' down: `XA/BC`
2. Slide 'C' up: `AC/XB`

Neither of these moves will lead Bessie to the configuration of Elsie's puzzle, thereby making it impossible for both puzzles to meet at the same configuration. 

A concrete case where the program fails to determine the relationship correctly is the above example, where it would incorrectly yield "YES" when the expected output is "NO". 

Thus, since the program fails to account for the sliding motion properly and yields incorrect results for certain inputs, it is deemed incorrect.
