The variable `new_state_str` is assigned the value created by joining the characters of the list `new_state`. The `new_state` contains the values at indices defined by `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped. Thus, the specific characters in `new_state` are affected by this swapping, but the length and unique characters ('A', 'B', 'C', 'X') in `start` remain unchanged, as do the values of `visited`, `queue`, and `directions`. The value of `new_state_str` will reflect the current state of `new_state` after the swap operation.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and one character 'X'; `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`; `visited` remains unchanged; `queue` contains at least 3 unique states including `new_state_str`; `directions` has at least one more pair to process; `new_pos` is equal to `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`; `new_state_str` is created by joining the characters of `new_state`.**
