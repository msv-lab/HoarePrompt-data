The variable `queue` is assigned the value of a `deque` initialized with a list that contains the string `start`. The precondition states that `start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C' and one character 'X'. Therefore, the `deque` will contain this specific string as its only element. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C' and one character 'X'; `queue` is deque(['start']).**
