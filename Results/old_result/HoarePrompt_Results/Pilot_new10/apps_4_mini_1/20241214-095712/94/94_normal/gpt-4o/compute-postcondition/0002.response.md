The variable `directions` is assigned a list of tuples representing movement in a 2D grid: up (-1, 0), down (1, 0), left (0, -1), and right (0, 1). The other variables, `start`, `queue`, and `visited`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C' and one character 'X'; `queue` is deque(['start']); `visited` is a set containing the element `start`; `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]**
