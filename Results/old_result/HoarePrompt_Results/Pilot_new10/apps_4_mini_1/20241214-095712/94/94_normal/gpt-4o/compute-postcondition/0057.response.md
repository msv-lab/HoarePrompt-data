In the given code snippet, `new_row` and `new_col` are being assigned values based on the current position of the empty tile. The calculations rely on `empty_row` and `empty_col`, as well as the deltas `dr` and `dc`, which represent the changes in row and column respectively.

Since the values of `empty_row` and `empty_col` are not specified in the initial state, we cannot define the exact values for `new_row` and `new_col`. However, we know that the assignment is straightforward. The output state will indicate that `new_row` and `new_col` are determined by the calculations that involve `empty_row`, `dr`, `empty_col`, and `dc`.

The states of the other variables (`start`, `visited`, `queue`, and `directions`) remain unchanged. 

Thus, the Output State reflects the transformation that occurred with the variables `new_row` and `new_col` based on the defined operations.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and one character 'X'; `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`; `visited` remains unchanged; `queue` contains at least 3 unique states including `new_state_str`; `directions` has at least one more pair to process.**
