The code snippet assigns new values to `new_row` and `new_col` based on the `empty_row` and `empty_col` values, and changes these two variables according to the values of `dr` and `dc`. The values of `dr` and `dc` are not given, but since `empty_row` is calculated from `empty_pos // 2` and `empty_col` from `empty_pos % 2`, this means that the calculations depend on the current position of 'X'.

As `new_row` and `new_col` are calculated as `empty_row + dr` and `empty_col + dc`, the output must reflect how `new_row` and `new_col` are derived from the existing values. Since the `current`, `visited`, `start`, and `empty_pos` remain unchanged, they will still retain their original values. 

Though we do not know `dr` and `dc`, we can express `new_row` and `new_col` in terms of the initial values:

- `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`
- `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`

Thus, the Output State will reflect that `empty_row` and `empty_col` derive from `empty_pos`, and will show how `new_row` and `new_col` are determined:

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and one character 'X'; `visited` is a set containing all unique states created during the swapping process, including `start`; `queue` contains at least 2 unique states; `current` is the first element in `queue`; `empty_pos` is a valid index of 'X' in `current`; `empty_row` is equal to `empty_pos // 2`; `empty_col` is equal to `empty_pos % 2`; `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`.**
