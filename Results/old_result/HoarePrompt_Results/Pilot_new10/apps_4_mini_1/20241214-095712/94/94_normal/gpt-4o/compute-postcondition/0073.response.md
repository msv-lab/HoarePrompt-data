The code `queue.append(new_state_str)` appends the value of `new_state_str` to the list `queue`. The other variables in the state remain unchanged since they are not modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and one character 'X'; `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is equal to `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`; `new_state` is updated with swapped elements; `new_state_str` is the string representation of `new_state`; `visited` now includes `new_state_str`; `queue` includes `new_state_str` (added to it).**
