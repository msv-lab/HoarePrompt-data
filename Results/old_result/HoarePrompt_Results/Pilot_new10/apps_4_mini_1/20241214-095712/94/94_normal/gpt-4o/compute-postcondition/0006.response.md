In the code snippet provided, `empty_row` and `empty_col` are assigned values based on the division of `empty_pos` by 2 (using `divmod`). The specific value of `empty_pos` is necessary to determine the values for `empty_row` and `empty_col`, as `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in the string `start`. 

Given the initial state, we know that:
- `start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C' and one character 'X'.
- The index `empty_pos` of 'X' in `current` (which is equal to `start`) would be one of {0, 1, 2, 3}. 

The `divmod` operation will return:
- `empty_row` as the integer division of `empty_pos` by 2, which gives the row index based on the assumption that we're treating the string as a 2-row, 2-column grid.
- `empty_col` as the remainder when `empty_pos` is divided by 2, which gives the column index in the same 2x2 perspective.

Therefore, we consider the possible values of `empty_pos`:
- If `empty_pos` is 0, then `empty_row` is 0, `empty_col` is 0.
- If `empty_pos` is 1, then `empty_row` is 0, `empty_col` is 1.
- If `empty_pos` is 2, then `empty_row` is 1, `empty_col` is 0.
- If `empty_pos` is 3, then `empty_row` is 1, `empty_col` is 1.

The `empty_pos` value is determined by the position of 'X', but since it is not specified in the initial state, we should incorporate all conditions based on the valid positions of 'X'.

Thus, summarizing, since `empty_row` and `empty_col` are dependent on `empty_pos`, we state the relationships while acknowledging the potential values.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C' and one character 'X'; `queue` is deque([]); `visited` is a set containing `start`; `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]; `current` is 'start'; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`; `empty_row` is either 0 or 1, and `empty_col` is either 0 or 1 depending on the value of `empty_pos`.**
