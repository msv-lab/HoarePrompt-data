The code snippet swaps the elements in the list `new_state` at the indices `empty_pos` and `new_pos`. The specific values of `empty_pos`, `new_pos`, `dr`, and `dc` are derived from the previous states of the corresponding variables.

In the current state, `new_state` is a list derived from `current`, so we assume it holds the previous state of the elements.

Given that `new_row = empty_row + dr` and `new_col = empty_col + dc`, we can compute `new_pos` as `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`. The previous value of `new_state` is a list of characters including 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'.

After executing the swapping of the elements:
- `new_state[empty_pos]` now holds the value that was originally at `new_pos`.
- `new_state[new_pos]` now holds the value that was originally at `empty_pos`.

Thus, we have two affected values in `new_state`, and all variables outside of the swap are unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and one character 'X'; `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is equal to `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`; `new_state` has swapped the elements at indices `empty_pos` and `new_pos`.**
