The values of `new_row` and `new_col` are updated based on the previous values of `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `dr`, and `dc`. The variables `empty_row` and `empty_col` are the positions of an empty space, and `dr` and `dc` represent the changes in row and column from the `directions`. Since `new_row` and `new_col` are calculated by adding `dr` and `dc` to `empty_row` and `empty_col`, their specific values will depend on the current values of `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `dr`, and `dc`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State will be:
Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`; `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `queue` must have at least one unique state; `current` remains the leftmost state from `queue`; `dr` is the next value from `directions`; `dc` is the next value from `directions`.**
