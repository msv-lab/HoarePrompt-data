To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the variables and conditions involved in the for loop:

1. The loop definition is `for (dr, dc) in directions:`, which means that the loop will iterate over each tuple in the `directions` list.
2. The variable `directions` is defined as `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`, which means there are four tuples to iterate over.
3. No further specific conditions are needed for the loop to execute, since `directions` is a list with elements, so the loop will execute four times.

Given that the state of `start`, `queue`, `visited`, and other variables do not directly affect the loop execution itself but are part of the overall program state, the critical elements we need to modify for the loop to execute are solely about ensuring `directions` is populated, which it is.

After considering these points, I can formulate the adjusted state:

State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C' and one character 'X'; `queue` is deque([]); `visited` is a set containing `start`; `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]; `current` is 'start'; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current'; `empty_row` is either 0 or 1; `empty_col` is either 0 or 1; `dr` and `dc` will take values from directions as the loop iterates.**
