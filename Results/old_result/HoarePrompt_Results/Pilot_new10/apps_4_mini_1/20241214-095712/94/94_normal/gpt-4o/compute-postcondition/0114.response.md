Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and one character 'X'; `visited` is a set containing all unique states generated through the swapping process; `queue` is empty indicating no further states are left to process; `current` is the last unique state processed by the loop; `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, and `empty_col` represent the position of 'X' in the last processed state. If no valid moves were possible at any point, `visited` would only include `start`, and `queue` would remain empty throughout execution.**
