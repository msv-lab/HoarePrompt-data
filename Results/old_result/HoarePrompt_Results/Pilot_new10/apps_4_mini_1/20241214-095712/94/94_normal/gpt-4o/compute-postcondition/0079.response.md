The code assigns the value of `empty_pos` to the index of the character 'X' in the string `current`. Since `current` is derived from `queue`, which has one less unique state than before, its value is unchanged in this context. The only updated variable is `empty_pos`, which now holds the specific index position of 'X' in `current`. 

As `current` holds a string of length 4 consisting of three unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and one character 'X', the exact value of `empty_pos` will depend on where 'X' is located in that string.

Therefore, the variables that remain unaffected are `start`, `visited`, and `queue`, while `empty_pos` has now been determined to be the index of 'X' in `current`.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and one character 'X'; `visited` includes all unique states created during the swapping process; `queue` has one less unique state; `current` is assigned the leftmost state from `queue`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`.**
