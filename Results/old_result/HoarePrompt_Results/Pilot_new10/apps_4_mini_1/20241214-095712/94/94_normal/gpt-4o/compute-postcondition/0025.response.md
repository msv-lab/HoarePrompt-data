The code `visited.add(new_state_str)` adds the `new_state_str` to the `visited` set. The states of all other variables remain unchanged. Specifically, `visited` now contains `new_state_str`, which is a string formed by joining elements of `new_state` and represents a specific configuration of the state.

Since no information is given on the initial state of `visited`, we acknowledge that it is being updated with the addition of `new_state_str`.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and one character 'X'; `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is equal to `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc); `new_state` is a list with swapped values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos`; `new_state_str` is a string formed by joining elements of `new_state`; `visited` now contains `new_state_str`.**
