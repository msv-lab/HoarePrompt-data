You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Bessie the cow and her best friend Elsie each received a sliding puzzle on Pi Day. Their puzzles consist of a 2 × 2 grid and three tiles labeled 'A', 'B', and 'C'. The three tiles sit on top of the grid, leaving one grid cell empty. To make a move, Bessie or Elsie can slide a tile adjacent to the empty cell into the empty cell as shown below: $\rightarrow$ 

In order to determine if they are truly Best Friends For Life (BFFLs), Bessie and Elsie would like to know if there exists a sequence of moves that takes their puzzles to the same configuration (moves can be performed in both puzzles). Two puzzles are considered to be in the same configuration if each tile is on top of the same grid cell in both puzzles. Since the tiles are labeled with letters, rotations and reflections are not allowed.


-----Input-----

The first two lines of the input consist of a 2 × 2 grid describing the initial configuration of Bessie's puzzle. The next two lines contain a 2 × 2 grid describing the initial configuration of Elsie's puzzle. The positions of the tiles are labeled 'A', 'B', and 'C', while the empty cell is labeled 'X'. It's guaranteed that both puzzles contain exactly one tile with each letter and exactly one empty position.


-----Output-----

Output "YES"(without quotes) if the puzzles can reach the same configuration (and Bessie and Elsie are truly BFFLs). Otherwise, print "NO" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
AB
XC
XB
AC

Output
YES

Input
AB
XC
AC
BX

Output
NO



-----Note-----

The solution to the first sample is described by the image. All Bessie needs to do is slide her 'A' tile down.

In the second sample, the two puzzles can never be in the same configuration. Perhaps Bessie and Elsie are not meant to be friends after all...
Program:
```
from collections import deque

bessie_puzzle = [input().strip() for _ in range(2)]
elsie_puzzle = [input().strip() for _ in range(2)]
bessie_start = func_1(bessie_puzzle)
elsie_start = func_1(elsie_puzzle)
bessie_reachable = func_2(bessie_start)
elsie_reachable = func_2(elsie_start)
if bessie_reachable & elsie_reachable:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')

def func_1(puzzle):
    return puzzle[0] + puzzle[1]

def func_2(start):
    queue = deque([start])
    visited = set([start])
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while queue:
        current = queue.popleft()
        empty_pos = current.index('X')
        (empty_row, empty_col) = divmod(empty_pos, 2)
        for (dr, dc) in directions:
            (new_row, new_col) = (empty_row + dr, empty_col + dc)
            if 0 <= new_row < 2 and 0 <= new_col < 2:
                new_pos = new_row * 2 + new_col
                new_state = list(current)
                (new_state[empty_pos], new_state[new_pos]) = (new_state[new_pos], new_state[empty_pos])
                new_state_str = ''.join(new_state)
                if new_state_str not in visited:
                    visited.add(new_state_str)
                    queue.append(new_state_str)
    return visited


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program against the given problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the implementation:

1. **Input Reading**: The puzzles are read into `bessie_puzzle` and `elsie_puzzle`, and transformed into string representations by `func_1`, which concatenates both rows into a single string.
  
2. **Generate Reachable States**: The `func_2` creates all possible configurations that can be reached from the starting configuration of each puzzle using a breadth-first search (BFS) approach. It considers moving an adjacent tile into the empty cell.

3. **Comparison of Reachable States**: The program checks if there is any overlapping configuration between the reachable states of Bessie and Elsie's puzzles.

### Potential Issues:
- The program assumes that the only way to represent the state of the puzzle is through the strings generated by `func_1`, which combines both rows of the grid. 
- The BFS implementation assumes that every possible state can be reached efficiently. However, it does not utilize any mechanisms to detect symmetrical positions or states that may be indistinct from one another yet represent unique configurations (due to rotations or reflections).
- It relies on the true identity of the states generated by tiles and checks their overlaps without considering the nature of sliding tiles or ensuring that if one shuffle does not yield certain configurations for both grids, it could end up returning wrong results.

### Test Case That Fails:
- Consider the following input:
```
AB
XC
AC
BX
```
- Expected output is `NO`. However, let's see if both configurations lead to the same reachable states according to the program:
  - For Bessie's puzzle: By sliding 'A' or 'B', she can achieve all configurations including the one represented by `ACBX` but the recheck may mislead because `func_2` states might not clearly signify backtracking in legal tile movements.
  - While they start with unique states, their allowed moves do not permit reaching identical configurations as specified.

Hence, a potential flaw in the program is that it does not fully account for the mechanics of tile movement correctly and might return `YES` on certain configurations where it is not applicable.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**. The program does not guarantee correctly identifying whether both puzzles can reach the same configuration for all possible states.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a list `puzzle` containing exactly two strings, each of which consists of exactly two characters ('A', 'B', 'C', or 'X'). It returns the concatenation of these two strings. It assumes that the input is always a list of two valid strings, and does not handle cases where the input may not meet these specifications. 

Output hint for function_2: The function accepts a string `start` of length 4, consisting of three unique characters `'A'`, `'B'`, `'C'` and one character `'X'` representing an empty cell. It generates and returns a set of all unique states that can be reached by swapping the empty cell `'X'` with its adjacent positions. The returned set will always include the initial `start` state, and depending on the validity of moves made, it may include additional unique configurations as well. Every possible unique configuration results from using breadth-first search to explore new states until no valid moves remain. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
