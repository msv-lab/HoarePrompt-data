The code snippet swaps the elements at the indices `empty_pos` and `new_pos` in the `new_state` list. The value of `new_state` changes as a result of this swapping operation. The other variables in the initial state are not affected. 

Specifically, `new_state[empty_pos]` gets the value from `new_state[new_pos]`, and `new_state[new_pos]` gets the value from `new_state[empty_pos]`, making two elements of `new_state` swap their positions.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and one character 'X'; `visited` is a set containing all unique states created during the swapping process, including `start`; `queue` contains at least 2 unique states; `current` is the first element in `queue`; `empty_pos` is a valid index of 'X' in `current`; `empty_row` is equal to `empty_pos // 2`; `empty_col` is equal to `empty_pos % 2`; `new_row` is valid; `new_col` is valid; `new_pos` is equal to `new_row * 2 + new_col`; `new_state` is the list containing the swapped elements of `current`.**
