The variable `empty_row` is assigned the value of the integer division of `empty_pos` by 2, and `empty_col` is assigned the value of the modulus of `empty_pos` by 2. The precondition states that `empty_pos` is known. Since `start` is a string of length 4 consisting of a specific arrangement of characters, `visited` is a set that contains all unique states including `start`, and `current` is the first element removed from `queue`, the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and one character 'X'; `visited` is a set containing all unique states created during the swapping process, including `start`; `queue` has one less unique state; `current` is the first element removed from `queue`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`; `empty_row` is equal to `empty_pos // 2`; `empty_col` is equal to `empty_pos % 2`.**
