Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `start` of length 4, consisting of three unique characters `'A'`, `'B'`, `'C'` and one character `'X'` representing an empty cell. It generates and returns a set of all unique states that can be reached by swapping the empty cell `'X'` with its adjacent positions. The returned set will always include the initial `start` state, and depending on the validity of moves made, it may include additional unique configurations as well. Every possible unique configuration results from using breadth-first search to explore new states until no valid moves remain.**
