The variable `visited` is a set that will have `new_state_str` added to it. The value of `new_state_str` is a string formed by joining the elements of `new_state`, and since it's stated that `new_state_str` is not already in `visited`, this means that after the operation is executed, `visited` will include this new string.

The other variables (`start`, `queue`, `current`, `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `new_row`, `new_col`, `new_pos`, and `new_state`) are unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and one character 'X'; `visited` contains the previous states plus `new_state_str`; `queue` contains at least 2 unique states; `current` is the first element in `queue`; `empty_pos` is a valid index of 'X' in `current'; `empty_row` is equal to `empty_pos // 2`; `empty_col` is equal to `empty_pos % 2`; `new_row` is valid; `new_col` is valid; `new_pos` is equal to `new_row * 2 + new_col`; `new_state` is the list containing the swapped elements of `current`; `new_state_str` is the string formed by joining the elements of `new_state`, and `new_state_str` has been added to `visited`.**
