The variables `new_row` and `new_col` are both assigned values based on the expressions `empty_row + dr` and `empty_col + dc`, respectively. The predefined "current" (dr, dc) values have been processed. Thus, the new positions (new_row, new_col) will be calculated by using the values of `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `dr`, and `dc`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and one character 'X'; `directions` must contain at least one more element; `(dr, dc)` has been processed; `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`.**
