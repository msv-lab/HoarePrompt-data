The `queue` variable is being appended with the value of `new_state_str`. Since `new_state_str` is formed by joining elements of `new_state`, the state of the `queue` variable is essentially updated to include this new string representation of the state.

As a result, the output will capture the original states of the variables and include the updated state of `queue` now containing `new_state_str`.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and one character 'X'; `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is equal to `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc); `new_state` is a list with swapped values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos`; `new_state_str` is a string formed by joining elements of `new_state`; `visited` now contains `new_state_str`; `queue` now contains `new_state_str`.**
