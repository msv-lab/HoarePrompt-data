The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `puzzle1` and `puzzle2`. Both `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` are strings consisting of two lines, each containing two characters where each character is either 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'X', with exactly one 'X' in each puzzle indicating the empty cell. After executing the function body, it compares the sorted characters of `puzzle1` and `puzzle2`. If the sorted characters of 'AABX' are not equal to the sorted characters of 'CCBB', the function returns `False`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `puzzle1` and `puzzle2`, which are strings containing specified characters, and it returns `False` if the sorted characters of `puzzle1` are not equal to the sorted characters of `puzzle2`.**
