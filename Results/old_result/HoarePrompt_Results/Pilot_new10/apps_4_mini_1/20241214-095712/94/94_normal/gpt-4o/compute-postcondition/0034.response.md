`new_state_str` is assigned the value of `''.join(new_state)`, which combines all elements of the list `new_state` into a single string. The composition of `new_state` involves manipulating characters based on previously stated conditions using the unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three unique characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and one character 'X'; `directions` must contain at least one more element; `(dr, dc)` has been processed; `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`; `new_state` is the list created from `current`, with elements at positions `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped; `new_state_str` is the string formed by joining the elements of `new_state`.**
