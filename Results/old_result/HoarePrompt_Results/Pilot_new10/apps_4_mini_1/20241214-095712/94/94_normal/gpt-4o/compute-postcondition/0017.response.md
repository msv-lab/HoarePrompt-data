Postcondition: ***`start` is the updated string after swapping characters at `empty_pos` and `new_pos`. If `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, then `queue` becomes deque(['new_state_str']), and `visited` includes both `start` and `new_state_str`. The `directions` remain [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` remains 'start', with `empty_pos` as the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` being either 0 or 1, `empty_col` being either 0 or 1, and `new_row` and `new_col` being updated according to the direction applied.***
