The value of `min_length` is incremented by `min_speed`. Therefore, `min_length` is updated to `min_length + min_speed`. As such, the updated value for `min_length` is the previous value of `min_length` plus `min_speed`. None of the other variables change, and their states remain the same.

Output State: **`v_1` is an integer between 1 and 100, `v_2` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is greater than 3, `d` is an integer between 0 and 10, `min_speed` is updated to `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`, `max_length` is updated to `max_length + max_speed`, `min_length` is updated to `min_length + min_speed`, `i` is `t - 3`, `max_speed` is still `max_speed`.**
