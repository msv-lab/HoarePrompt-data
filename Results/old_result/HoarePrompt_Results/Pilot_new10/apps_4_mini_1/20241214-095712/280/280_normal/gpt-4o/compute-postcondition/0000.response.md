The variables `v1` and `v2` are assigned values from the input, which takes two integers and maps them to `v1` and `v2`. The values of `v1` and `v2` are now defined by the user's input, but the specific values are not known. The constraints of `v1`, `v2`, `t`, and `d` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `v1` and `v2` are now integers based on user input while keeping the other preconditions intact.

Output State: **`v_1` and `v_2` are integers defined by user input; `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100; `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10.**
