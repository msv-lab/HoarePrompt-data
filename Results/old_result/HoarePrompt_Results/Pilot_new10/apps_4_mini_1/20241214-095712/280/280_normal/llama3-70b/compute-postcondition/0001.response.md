In the given code, the variables `t` and `d` are updated with new integer values obtained from input. The function `map(int, input().split())` converts the input into two integers, which are then assigned to `t` and `d`.

Prior to this operation, `t` is defined to be an integer value between 2 and 100, and `d` is defined to be an integer value between 0 and 10. This means after the execution of the code, both `t` and `d` will take on new integer values based on user input, but their previous constraints remain valid.

Since `v_1` and `v_2` are not affected by this operation, they remain unchanged.

Output State: **`v_1` is an integer input value between 1 and 100, `v_2` is an integer input value between 1 and 100, `t` is an integer input value between 2 and 100, `d` is an integer input value between 0 and 10.**
