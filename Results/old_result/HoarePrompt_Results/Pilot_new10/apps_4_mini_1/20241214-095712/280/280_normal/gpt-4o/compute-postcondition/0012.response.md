To determine the output state based on the provided code snippet and initial state, let's break down the code's impact step by step.

1. **Initialization**:
   - If `t >= 2`: 
     - `v_1` is a user-defined integer.
     - `v_2` is a user-defined integer.
     - `t` is an integer between 2 and 100.
     - `d` is an integer between 0 and 10.
     - The calculation of `speeds` array elements:
       - `speeds[0]` is `v_1`.
       - `speeds[1]` is calculated as `min(v_1 + d, v_2 + (t - 2) * d)`.
       - For each subsequent speed, we would continue calculating until `speeds[t-1]`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The line `total_distance = sum(speeds)` sums up all elements of the `speeds` array that were defined based on the input integers, considering the conditions set by the problem.

3. **Values of Variables**:
   - `total_distance` takes the value of the sum of all speed values defined within `speeds`.

Therefore, the output state reflects the calculated `total_distance` and retains the values of `v_1`, `v_2`, `t`, `d`, and `speeds` which were not altered in their definitions but are derived values contributing to `total_distance`.

Output State: **`v_1` is a user-defined integer, `v_2` is a user-defined integer, `t` is an integer between 2 and 100, `d` is an integer between 0 and 10, `speeds` is an array based on the formulae provided, and `total_distance = sum(speeds)`**.
