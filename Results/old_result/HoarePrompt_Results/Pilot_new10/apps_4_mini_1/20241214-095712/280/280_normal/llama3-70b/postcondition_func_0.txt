The function accepts no parameters and reads two speed values (`v1` and `v2`), a time value (`t`), and a decrease value (`d`) from user input. It calculates the maximum and minimum speeds over time, considering possible adjustments due to `d`, and computes the total potential distances covered at these speeds. Finally, it prints the total maximum distance covered. The function does not handle negative values for `d`, and it does not return any value.
