The variable `min_length` is assigned the value of `min_speed * t`. The value of `min_speed` is equal to the minimum of `v_1` and `v_2`, both of which are integer input values between 1 and 100. The value of `t` is also an integer input value between 2 and 100. Therefore, `min_length` will be calculated based on these values.

Since `max_speed`, `min_speed`, and `max_length` remain unchanged, we can represent the state of the variables accurately. Thus, `min_length` is equal to the product of `min_speed` and `t`.

Output State: **`v_1` is an integer input value between 1 and 100, `v_2` is an integer input value between 1 and 100, `t` is an integer input value between 2 and 100, `d` is an integer input value between 0 and 10; `max_speed` is the maximum value between `v_1` and `v_2`, `min_speed` is the minimum value between `v_1` and `v_2`, `max_length` is `max_speed * t`, `min_length` is `min_speed * t`.**
