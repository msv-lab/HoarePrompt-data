Output State: **`v_1` is an integer between 1 and 100, `v_2` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is 2 or greater, `d` is an integer between 0 and 10, `min_speed` is updated to `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`, `max_length` is `max_speed * (t + 1)`, `min_length` is `min_speed * (t + 1)`, `i` is `t - 2`, `max_speed` is `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`**
