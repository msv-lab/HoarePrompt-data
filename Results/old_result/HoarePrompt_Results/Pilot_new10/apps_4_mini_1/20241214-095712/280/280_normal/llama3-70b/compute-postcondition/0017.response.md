The code `max_speed = max(max_speed - d, min_speed)` updates the value of `max_speed`. The previous value of `max_speed` is adjusted downward by `d`, but it cannot go below `min_speed`. 

Since `min_speed` is updated to `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`, the relationship between `min_speed` and `max_speed` can also impact this calculation, but the specific values of `min_speed`, `max_speed`, and `d` are not provided as specific integers.

Given that `d` is between 0 and 10, the maximum value of `max_speed` could reduce by at most 10. However, the function will ensure that `max_speed` does not drop below `min_speed`.

Assuming the relationships defined by their constraints still hold, the output can be expressed as follows:

Output State: **`v_1` is an integer between 1 and 100, `v_2` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is greater than 3, `d` is an integer between 0 and 10, `min_speed` is updated to `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`, `max_length` is `max_length + max_speed`, `min_length` is `min_speed * (t + 2)`, `i` is `t - 3`, `max_speed` is updated to `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`**
