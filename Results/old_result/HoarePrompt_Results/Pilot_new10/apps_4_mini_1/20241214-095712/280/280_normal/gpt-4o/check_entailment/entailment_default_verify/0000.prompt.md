You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The on-board computer on Polycarp's car measured that the car speed at the beginning of some section of the path equals v_1 meters per second, and in the end it is v_2 meters per second. We know that this section of the route took exactly t seconds to pass.

Assuming that at each of the seconds the speed is constant, and between seconds the speed can change at most by d meters per second in absolute value (i.e., the difference in the speed of any two adjacent seconds does not exceed d in absolute value), find the maximum possible length of the path section in meters.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers v_1 and v_2 (1 ≤ v_1, v_2 ≤ 100) — the speeds in meters per second at the beginning of the segment and at the end of the segment, respectively.

The second line contains two integers t (2 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the time when the car moves along the segment in seconds, d (0 ≤ d ≤ 10) — the maximum value of the speed change between adjacent seconds.

It is guaranteed that there is a way to complete the segment so that:  the speed in the first second equals v_1,  the speed in the last second equals v_2,  the absolute value of difference of speeds between any two adjacent seconds doesn't exceed d. 


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible length of the path segment in meters. 


-----Examples-----
Input
5 6
4 2

Output
26
Input
10 10
10 0

Output
100


-----Note-----

In the first sample the sequence of speeds of Polycarpus' car can look as follows: 5, 7, 8, 6. Thus, the total path is 5 + 7 + 8 + 6 = 26 meters.

In the second sample, as d = 0, the car covers the whole segment at constant speed v = 10. In t = 10 seconds it covers the distance of 100 meters.
Program:
```
def func():
    (v1, v2) = map(int, input().split())
    (t, d) = map(int, input().split())
    speeds = [0] * t
    speeds[0] = v1
    speeds[-1] = v2
    for i in range(1, t):
        speeds[i] = min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)
    total_distance = sum(speeds)
    print(total_distance)


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the given code against the problem description and requirements.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Inputs:** 
   - Two integers, `v1` (initial speed) and `v2` (final speed).
   - Two integers, `t` (time in seconds) and `d` (maximum speed change per second).

2. **Outputs:**
   - Maximum possible distance covered in `t` seconds with the constraints on speed.

3. **Constraints:**
   - The speed must be constant during each second, but may change by at most `d` meters per second between adjacent seconds.
   - The speed at the start is `v1` and at the end is `v2`.

### Analysis of the Provided Code
- The code initializes an array `speeds` to hold the speed at each of the `t` seconds.
- It sets the first speed to `v1` and the last speed to `v2`.
- It attempts to fill in the speeds for the seconds in between, ensuring that the speed change does not exceed `d`.

### Potential Edge Cases
1. **When `t` is small, `d` is small:** This may prevent reaching the final speed `v2`. 
   - For the case: `v1 = 5`, `v2 = 6`, `t = 2`, `d = 1`, the program will set `speeds[1] = 6`, resulting in speeds `[5, 6]` with a total distance of `11`. However, if we take a legitimate speed profile, it would just be two seconds at varying speeds, and the distance would still hold true. 
   
2. **Handling the maximum speed jumps:** 
   - If `v1` and `v2` have a difference greater than `d * (t - 1)`, it would be impossible to reach `v2` from `v1` in `t` seconds as per the program logic. Yet, the problem guarantees that a solution exists.
   
3. **An extreme test case:** 
   - Testing with `v1 = 1`, `v2 = 100`, `t = 10`, `d = 10` leads to speeds becoming `[1, 11, 21, 31, 41, 51, 61, 71, 81, 100]`, which sums to `475`, much higher than if it were consistently incremented optimally.

### Conclusion
The current logic does not consider the situation comprehensively. By the constraints:
- It will only fill the speeds forward instead of also checking where it can backtrack to allow for `v2` at second `t` potentially leading to excessive speed as seen in the extreme case mentioned.

In short, considering the maximum allowed speed change and the guaranteed solution described, the program doesn't efficiently fill out the speed array to ensure it adheres to all conditions.

Therefore, the answer is:
Correctness: **False**. 

The program can lead to incorrect calculations in certain edge cases, particularly when the actual relationship between the speeds and total time leads to speeds that do not align with the description's constraints.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts no parameters but reads input integers v1, v2, t, and d, calculating a speed list based on these values. It initializes the first speed as v1 and the last as v2, filling in intermediate speeds constrained by the values of v2 and d. Finally, it computes and prints the sum of the speeds. The function's behavior is entirely reliant on user input and does not handle erroneous or out-of-bound inputs, thus, if invalid data is provided, it may lead to unexpected results or errors. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
