To analyze the impact of the provided code:

- We know `speeds[i]` is affected.
- The existing conditions provide:
  - `speeds[i] = min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)`

From the initial state:
- `i` is 3
- Therefore, `speeds[i - 1]` corresponds to `speeds[2]`, which has the value `min(min(v_1 + d, v_2 + (t - 2) * d) + d, v_2 + (t - 2) * d)`.
- We can calculate `speeds[3]` as: 
  - `speeds[3] = min(speeds[2] + d, v_2 + (t - 4) * d)`.

The rest of the variables remain unchanged. Thus, the output state is constructed with all relevant pieces of information.

Output State: **`v_1` is user-defined integer; `v_2` is user-defined integer; `t` is 2 or more; `d` is an integer between 0 and 10; `speeds[0]` is `v_1`; `speeds[1]` is `min(v_1 + d, v_2 + (t - 2) * d)`; `speeds[2]` is `min(min(v_1 + d, v_2 + (t - 2) * d) + d, v_2 + (t - 2) * d)`; `speeds[3]` is `min(speeds[2] + d, v_2 + (t - 4) * d)`; `speeds[-1]` is `v_2`; remaining elements of `speeds` are zeroes; `i` is 3.**
