The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates based on the provided input integers, which are `v_1`, `v_2`, `t`, and `d`. The constraints are: `v_1` and `v_2` are integers (1 ≤ v_1, v_2 ≤ 100), `t` is an integer (2 ≤ t ≤ 100), and `d` is an integer (0 ≤ d ≤ 10). The function returns a result based on the values of these integers. However, without specific output cases or return conditions being provided, I cannot detail the functionality explicitly. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is currently undetermined due to lack of output information. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters but operates based on input integers v_1, v_2, t, and d, returning a result based on these values. Specific return values are not provided.**
