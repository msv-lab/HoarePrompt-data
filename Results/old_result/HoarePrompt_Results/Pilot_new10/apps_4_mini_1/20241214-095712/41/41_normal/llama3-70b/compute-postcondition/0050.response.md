Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 4, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, and `unrated` is False. If `ratings_before[i]` is less than `ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i]` is greater than `ratings_after[j]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without breaking.***
