According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop iterates over the range from `i + 1` to `n`. Since `i` is currently 0, the range will start from 1 (i + 1 = 0 + 1). The loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 1. 

There are no adjustments needed for the initial state as `n` is already defined to be between 2 and 1000, meaning it is guaranteed to be greater than 1. Furthermore, `j` will be initialized to 1 at the start of the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
