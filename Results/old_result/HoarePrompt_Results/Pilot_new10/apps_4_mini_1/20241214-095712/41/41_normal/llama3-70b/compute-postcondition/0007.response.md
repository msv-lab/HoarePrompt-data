According to the code, the loop will execute as long as it hasn't completed `n` iterations. The loop uses an underscore `_` as a variable name, which is a conventional way to indicate that the variable is not going to be used in the loop body. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is still an integer between 2 and 1000, indicating that the loop can execute again as long as the number of executed iterations is still less than `n`.

If `n` is at least 2 and has been executed once, this means that one iteration has already been completed, making the total executed iterations 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, it will require that there are still iterations left (i.e., 1 completed and at least 1 more remaining). For that, `n` must be greater than 1, and it must decrement the count of remaining iterations.

Let's assume the loop has executed once, and thus we keep `n` the same and the iteration count increases. The next iteration would be the second.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `ratings_before` contains `a`, `ratings_after` contains `b`**
