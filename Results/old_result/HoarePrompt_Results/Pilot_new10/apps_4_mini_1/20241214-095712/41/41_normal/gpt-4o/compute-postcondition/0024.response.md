The code snippet sets the variable `is_unrated` to `True`. Previously, `is_unrated` was `False`. The other variables remain unchanged as the code only affects `is_unrated`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 1000, `ratings` contains `n` tuples of `(a[i], b[i])` for each participant, `is_rated` is False, `is_unrated` is True, `i` is 1. The current value of `ratings[i - 1][0]` is less than `ratings[i][0]**
