`is_rated` is assigned the value `True`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, and `ratings`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `ratings` now includes ((a, b)); `is_rated` is True. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `ratings` now includes ((a, b)); `is_rated` is True.**
