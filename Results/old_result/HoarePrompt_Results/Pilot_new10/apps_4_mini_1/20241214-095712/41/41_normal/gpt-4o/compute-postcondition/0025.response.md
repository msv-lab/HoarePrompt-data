The code snippet `break` indicates that the execution will exit from the most immediate loop or conditional structure in which it resides. There are no changes to the values of any variables, but the flow of control in the program will change.

- `n` remains an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 1000.
- `ratings` still contains `n` tuples of `(a[i], b[i])` for each participant.
- `is_rated` remains False.
- `is_unrated` remains True.
- `i` remains 1.

The state of the program is effectively the same, but it is noted that the loop or condition the program was in has been exited.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 1000, `ratings` contains `n` tuples of `(a[i], b[i])` for each participant, `is_rated` is False, `is_unrated` is True, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
