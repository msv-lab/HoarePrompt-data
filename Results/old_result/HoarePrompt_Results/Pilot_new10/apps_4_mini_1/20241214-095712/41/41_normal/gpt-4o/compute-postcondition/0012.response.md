The variable `ratings` is updated to include a new tuple consisting of the current values of `a` and `b`. The state of `a` and `b` remains unchanged, and since the original condition regarding `is_rated` and its assignment isn't directly affected by this operation in the provided code snippet, that part of the state remains valid. Therefore, the output state reflects that `ratings` has been updated with the new rating tuple.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `ratings` is now (a, b), and now `ratings` has been updated to include ((a, b)).**
