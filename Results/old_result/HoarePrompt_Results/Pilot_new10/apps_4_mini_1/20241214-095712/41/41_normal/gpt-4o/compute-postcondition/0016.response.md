Given the initial state where `n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 999`, and `a` and `b` are input integers, here is the impact of the code:

The line `a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads a pair of integers from input and assigns them to `a` and `b`. The specific values for `a` and `b` are provided through user input.

Next, we consider the conditional logic that follows:

1. If `a != b`, then `ratings` is updated to include the tuple `(a, b)` and `is_rated` is set to `True`.
2. If `a == b`, then `ratings` remains unchanged and `is_rated` does not change.

Since the values of `a` and `b` are not known from the initial state, we cannot definitively determine if `ratings` was updated or if `is_rated` was changed.

Thus, the output state will summarize the conditions that are potentially changed depending on the comparison between `a` and `b`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 999; `a` and `b` are input integers; if `a` is not equal to `b`, then `ratings` includes `(a, b)` and `is_rated` is set to True; if `a` equals `b`, then `ratings` remain unchanged and `is_rated` is not updated.**
