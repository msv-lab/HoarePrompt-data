The variables `a` and `b` are assigned values from the `input()`, which is split and converted into integers. Given that `ratings_before` contains two instances of `a`, and `ratings_after` contains `b` followed by the previous elements, the values of `a` and `b` directly replace the previous entries.

The initial state is:

- `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000
- `ratings_before` contains two instances of `a`
- `ratings_after` contains `b` and the previous elements
- `_` is 1

After executing the code, the values of `a` and `b` will change based on the input, but we do not know the specific values since `input()` is taking that information. Since these are assigned from user input, we can refer to their input values as `input_a` and `input_b`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000; `ratings_before` contains two instances of `input_a`; `ratings_after` contains `input_b` and the previous elements; `_` is 1.**
