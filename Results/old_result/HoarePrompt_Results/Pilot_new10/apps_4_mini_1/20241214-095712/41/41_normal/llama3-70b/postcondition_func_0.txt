The function accepts an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000) followed by `n` pairs of integers representing participant ratings before and after a round. It checks if the ratings have changed for any participant; if any rating has changed, it prints "rated." If the ratings haven't changed for any participant, it checks if there is a ranking inconsistency (i.e., if a participant with a lower initial rating has a higher final rating) and prints "maybe" if such inconsistency exists; otherwise, it prints "unrated." If both the rating changes and ranking inconsistencies are missing, it will still print either "unrated" or "maybe" based on comparisons between the ratings, but will not account for cases where ratings are unchanged due to being equal initially and finally across the board. Therefore, the logic concerning ranking is solely evaluated when no rated status is found.
