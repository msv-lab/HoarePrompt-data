The variable `is_unrated` is assigned the value `True`. The previous values for `is_rated` and `is_unrated` were `False`. The values of `n`, `ratings`, and `i` remain unchanged after executing the code. The output state reflects the updated value of `is_unrated`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 1000, `ratings` contains `n` tuples of `(a[i], b[i])` for each participant, `is_rated` is False, `is_unrated` is True, and `i` is 2**
