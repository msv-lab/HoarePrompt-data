The code sets the variable `is_rated` to `True`. The initial conditions remain unchanged, except for the value of `is_rated`. The other variables — `n`, `a`, `b`, and the tuple `ratings` — retain their prior states, and since `a` and `b` were not equal, that condition remains valid.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is an integer from input; `b` is an integer from input; `ratings` now contains one tuple `(a, b)`; `is_rated` is True.**
