Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 1000, `ratings` contains `n` tuples of `(a[i], b[i])` for each participant, `is_rated` is False, if `ratings[i - 1][0]` is less than `ratings[i][0]`, then `is_unrated` is set to True, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, `is_unrated` remains False.***
