Initially, `ratings` is an undefined list that will hold tuples of `(a, b)`. The provided code appends a tuple containing the values of `a` and `b` to the list `ratings`. The previous values of `a` and `b` are obtained from input, and thus will hold specific integer values. The variable `ratings` will now contain one tuple with these integer values. The states of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is an integer from input; `b` is an integer from input; `ratings` now contains one tuple `(a, b)`.**
