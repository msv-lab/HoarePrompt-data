Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `unrated` is False. If the condition that `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]` holds true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes.***
