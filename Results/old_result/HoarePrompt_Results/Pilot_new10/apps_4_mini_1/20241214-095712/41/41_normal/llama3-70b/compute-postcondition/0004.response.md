The code reads two integers from input and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`, effectively changing the state. The variable `n` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by this operation. The lists `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` also remain empty. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `ratings_before` is an empty list, `ratings_after` is an empty list, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**.
