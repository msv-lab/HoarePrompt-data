Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `unrated` is False. If `ratings_before[i]` is less than `ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i]` is greater than `ratings_after[j]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the execution does not enter the if condition, and no changes are made to the variables.***
