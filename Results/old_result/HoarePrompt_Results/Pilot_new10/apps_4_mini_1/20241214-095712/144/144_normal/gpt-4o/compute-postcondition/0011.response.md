According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the state of the list `a` and the variables involved. The loop iterates over each element in the sorted list `a`. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is the second element of `a`, `mex` has been adjusted based on whether `num` is greater than or equal to `mex` or less than `mex`. Since we are looking for the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to determine what the next value of `num` will be.

If `num` is currently the second element in the sorted list `a`, then for the loop to execute one more time, `num` should refer to the third element in the list. The total number of elements `n` in the list remains unchanged.

Thus, if `num` is the second element of `a`, it implies that there is at least one more element in the list; therefore `n` must be at least 3 to allow the loop to continue.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 100000`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers with at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element of `a`, `mex` remains unchanged or is the current modified value**.
