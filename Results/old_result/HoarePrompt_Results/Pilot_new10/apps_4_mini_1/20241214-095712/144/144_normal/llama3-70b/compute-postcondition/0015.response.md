Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers; `mex` is 2; `arr` is a sorted list of positive integers of length `n` with at least 2 elements; `num` is the second element of `arr`. If `num` is greater than `mex`, we break out of the most internal loop.***
