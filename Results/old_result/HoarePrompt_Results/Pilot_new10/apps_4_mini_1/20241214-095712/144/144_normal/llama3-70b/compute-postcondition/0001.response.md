`arr` is assigned the list of integers obtained from the input, which is mapped to integers. The input consists of `n` integers, where `n` remains the same positive integer as in the initial state, but `a` is updated to reflect the values entered from the input. The states of `n` and `a` remain valid, but `a` now corresponds to the values in `arr`.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, now updated to match the input values from `arr`.**
