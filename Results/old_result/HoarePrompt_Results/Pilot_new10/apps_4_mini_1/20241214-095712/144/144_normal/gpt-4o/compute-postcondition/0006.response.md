The value of `mex` is incremented by 1. The value of `n` remains a positive integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 100000`, `a` continues to be a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `num` retains the first element of `a`, and `num` is still greater than or equal to `mex` after the increment.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 100000`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `num` is the first element of `a`, `num` is greater than or equal to `mex`, and now `mex` is incremented by 1.**
