Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 100000`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers with at least 1 element, and `num` is the first element of `a`. If `num` is greater than or equal to `mex`, `mex` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `num` is less than `mex`, there is no else part in the code.***
