The variable `mex` is assigned the value `1`. The initial state indicates that `n` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000) and `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers (1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10^9). The values of `n` and `a` are not modified by the code provided, but `mex` now specifically equals 1.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 100000`; `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers obtained from input, where each integer `a[i]` satisfies `1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10^9`; `mex` is 1**.
