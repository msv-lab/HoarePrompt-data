The code `arr.sort()` sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is simply the length of the list `arr`, which is positive and between 1 and 100,000. The variable `a` is now updated to match the sorted values of `arr`. Therefore, the output states that `a` is now the sorted list.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers.**
