The value of `mex` is incremented by 1, changing it from 3 to 4. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers; `mex` is 4; `arr` is a sorted list of positive integers of length `n` with at least 3 elements; `num` is the third element in the list `arr`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers; `mex` is 4; `arr` is a sorted list of positive integers of length `n` with at least 3 elements; `num` is the third element in the list `arr`.**
