The function reads a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers, then computes the smallest positive integer that is not present in the list (referred to as the "minimum excluded value", or mex). It handles cases where the list is empty or all numbers in the list are greater than 1. The function outputs this smallest missing positive integer but does not return any value.
