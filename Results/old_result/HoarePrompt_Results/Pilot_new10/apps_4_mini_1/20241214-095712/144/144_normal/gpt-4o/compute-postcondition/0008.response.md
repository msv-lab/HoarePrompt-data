According to the code, the loop continues to execute as long as there are elements in the list `a`. The state at the end of the last iteration indicates that `num` is the first element of the list `a`, and `a` contains `n` positive integers. 

Since `a` is a sorted list and `num` represents the current value being iterated over, the loop will proceed to the next element of the list for its next iteration. The next `num` value will be the second element of the list `a`.

To summarize, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the state to reflect the next `num` as the second element in the list and maintain `n` as the total number of elements in `a`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 100000`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers with at least 1 element, `num` is the second element of `a`.**
