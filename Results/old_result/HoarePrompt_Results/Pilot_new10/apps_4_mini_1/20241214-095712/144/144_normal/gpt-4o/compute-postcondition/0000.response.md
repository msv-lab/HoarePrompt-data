The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input as a string and `int` converts that string to an integer. The precondition states that `n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, and since the new value of `n` will be obtained from input, it will still satisfy this condition after execution. The variable `a` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000; `a` is a list of n positive integers where each integer a[i] satisfies 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10^9.**
