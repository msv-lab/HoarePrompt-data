Postcondition: ***`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers; `mex` is 1; `arr` is a sorted list of positive integers of length `n`; `num` is the first element of `arr`, which is not equal to `mex`. The current value of `num` is greater than `mex`.***
