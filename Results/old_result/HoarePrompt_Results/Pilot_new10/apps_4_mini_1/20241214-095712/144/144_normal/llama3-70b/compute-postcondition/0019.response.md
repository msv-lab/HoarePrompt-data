The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers; `mex` is 3; `arr` is a sorted list of positive integers of length `n` with at least 3 elements; `num` is the third element in the list `arr` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
