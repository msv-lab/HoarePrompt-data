According to the code, the next iteration of the loop will execute if there are more elements in the `arr` list. Since `arr` is a sorted list of positive integers and has at least 2 elements, we need to check the current index of the loop iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, the `num` is the second element of the `arr` list. For the loop to execute one more time, `num` needs to refer to the next element in the list (the third element), assuming that there are sufficient elements in the list. Thus, for the loop to execute again, the `arr` must have at least 3 elements.

If the second element is equal to `mex` (which is 3), then `mex` remains 3. If the next `num` (the third element) of `arr` is encountered, its value determines the next state. If the next `num` is greater than 2, it will continue without breaking out of the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers; `mex` is 3; `arr` is a sorted list of positive integers of length `n` with at least 3 elements; `num` is the third element in the list `arr`.**
