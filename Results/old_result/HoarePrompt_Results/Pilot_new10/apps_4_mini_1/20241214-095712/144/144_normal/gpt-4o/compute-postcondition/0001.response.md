The variable `a` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the integer conversion of each split input value. The previous state of `a` is not valid anymore, as it will now be populated with `n` integers that are positive and within the specified bounds. 

Since `n` is an input positive integer that satisfies `1 ≤ n ≤ 100000`, and each integer in `a` is guaranteed to satisfy `1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10^9`, 

The output state is: 
`n` is an input positive integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 100000`; `a` is a list of `n` positive integers obtained from input, where each integer `a[i]` satisfies `1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10^9`.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 100000`; `a` is a list of `n` positive integers obtained from input, where each integer `a[i]` satisfies `1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10^9`.**
