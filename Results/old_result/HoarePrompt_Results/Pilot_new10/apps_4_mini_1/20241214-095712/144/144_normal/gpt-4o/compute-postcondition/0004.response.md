To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we analyze the provided context:

1. The loop iterates over the list `a`, which contains `n` sorted positive integers.
2. The variable `num` will take on each value from the list `a` in each iteration.

Since `n` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 100000`, it guarantees that the list `a` will have at least one integer. Therefore, we do not need to adjust `n`, as it already confirms the list has elements.

The state of `mex` (which is initialized to 1) does not affect the execution of the loop but may be relevant for operations within the loop if they were included. However, for the purpose of executing the loop, we focus on the state of the iterator variable `num`.

1. At the start of the loop, `num` will be assigned the first element of the list `a` during the first iteration. Thus, it will be the first element of `a` when the loop executes.

Following this reasoning, to ensure that the loop executes, we acknowledge:

- `n` is confirmed to be at least 1 (from the given conditions).
- `a` contains sorted positive integers (as stated).
- `num` will be set to the first element of `a` during the first iteration.

Thus, the required adjustments to the state would include confirming the conditions of the list `a` and its first element.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 100000`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers with at least 1 element, `num` is the first element of `a`**
