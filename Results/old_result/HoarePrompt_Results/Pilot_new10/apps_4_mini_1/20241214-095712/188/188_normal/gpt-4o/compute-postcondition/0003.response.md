The `unique_numbers` variable is assigned a sorted list of the keys from the `count` Counter object, sorted based on the frequency of each integer in `cards`. The initial state indicates that `count` represents the occurrence of integers from `cards`, which is a list of `n` integers. Therefore, `unique_numbers` will now hold the unique integers from `cards`, sorted by their occurrences in ascending order.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100; `cards` is a list of `n` integers obtained from input; `count` is a Counter object representing the occurrences of each integer in `cards`; `unique_numbers` is a list of unique integers from `cards` sorted by their occurrences in ascending order.**
