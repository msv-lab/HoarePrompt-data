The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, as it appears to rely on external input (which is not specified here). The constraints state that `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, and the subsequent `n` integers are the values written on `n` cards, each in the range of 1 to 100. 

Since there are no specific return conditions or cases mentioned in the output description, I cannot define clear return behavior. However, I can summarize the input parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts an even integer `n` between 2 and 100, followed by `n` integers representing card values between 1 and 100.**
