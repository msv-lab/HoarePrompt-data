Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, it only checks for two distinct integers that appear exactly `n // 2` times, which is not sufficient to ensure that all `n` cards can be taken by Petya and Vasya. 

For example, consider the input:
```
6
1
1
2
2
3
3
```
In this case, the function would output 'NO', but the more accurate interpretation is 'YES' for `1` and `2` or `1` and `3`, as each would allow both players to collect three cards each.

Additionally, the logic to find distinct integers that appear only `n // 2` times is flawed because there are potential distributions of values where both players can still achieve equality without strictly adhering to that frequency. 

Thus, the program fails to account for all possible distributions of cards that could lead to a fair game, making it incomplete.
