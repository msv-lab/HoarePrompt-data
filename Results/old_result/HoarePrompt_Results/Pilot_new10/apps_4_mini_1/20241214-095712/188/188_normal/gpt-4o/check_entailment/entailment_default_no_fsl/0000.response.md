Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases described in the problem. Specifically, there are situations where the program would print "NO" even when it is possible to have a fair game.

For instance, consider the input:
```
6
1
1
2
2
3
3
```
This should return "NO" according to the program because the top two unique numbers (1 and 2) do not appear exactly half of the time. However, both 1 and 2 occur twice, with 3 also occurring twice. This would mean Petya can choose 1 and Vasya can choose 2, both obtaining 2 cards each, making the game fair after all.

Moreover, the program only checks the last two unique numbers, which might not cover all cases of fairness, as demonstrated in the example above where both 1 and 2 would work, but they are not the last two unique numbers.

Therefore, the program fails to satisfy the conditions for every potential case, which is why the correctness is determined to be false.
