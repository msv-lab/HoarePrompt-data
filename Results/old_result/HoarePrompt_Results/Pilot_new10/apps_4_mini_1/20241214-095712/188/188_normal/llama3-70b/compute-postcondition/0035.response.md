Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer in the range 2 to 100, `d` contains at least 1 key, if `c` is equal to 0, then `c` is set to 1, `a1` is equal to `i`, `a2` is -1, `i` is the first key in `d`, and the value of `d[i]` is equal to `n // 2`. If `c` is not equal to 0, then `a1` is -1, `a2` is equal to `i`, `i` is the first key in `d`, and the value of `d[i]` is equal to `n // 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
