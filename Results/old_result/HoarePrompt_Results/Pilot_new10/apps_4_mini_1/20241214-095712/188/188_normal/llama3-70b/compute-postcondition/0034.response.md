The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an even integer in the range 2 to 100, `d` must contain at least 1 key, `c` is not equal to 0, `a1` is -1, `a2` is equal to `i`, and `i` is the first key in `d`, and the value of `d[i]` is equal to `n // 2`.
