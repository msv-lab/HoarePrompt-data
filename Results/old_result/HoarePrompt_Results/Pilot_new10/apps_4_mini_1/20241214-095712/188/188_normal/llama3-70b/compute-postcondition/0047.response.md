The code assigns the value of `i` to `a2`. Since `i` is the next key in the dictionary `d`, this means that `a2` is now equal to the value of the next key in `d`. The variable `n` (even integer), `d` (contains additional keys), and `c` (0) remain unchanged. The variable `a1` is also unchanged, while `a2` is now updated to this new value from `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer in the range 2 to 100, `d` contains at least 1 more key, `c` is 0, `a1` remains as it is, `a2` is the next value in `d`, `i` is the next key in `d`.**
