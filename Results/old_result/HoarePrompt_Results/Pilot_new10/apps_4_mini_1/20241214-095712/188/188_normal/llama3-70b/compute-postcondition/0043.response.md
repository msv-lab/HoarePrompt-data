Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer in the range 2 to 100, `d` contains at least 1 more key, `c` is 0, `a1` remains as it is, `a2` remains as it is, and `i` is the next key in `d`. If `d[i]` is equal to `n // 2`, then `c` is updated to 1 and `a1` takes the value of `i`, while `a2` remains unchanged, and `i` moves to the next key in `d`. If `c` was not initially 0, then `c` remains 0, `a1` remains unchanged, `a2` is updated to the next value in `d`, and `i` moves to the next key in `d`.***
