The value of `d[i]` is incremented by 1. The variable `i` is the third integer in the list `a`, which contains `n` integers. The variable `n` is an even integer in the range from 2 to 100; therefore, `i` is defined as the integer at index 2 (the third integer) of the list `a`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an even integer in the range 2 to 100, `i` is the third integer in the list `a`, `d[i]` is incremented by 1**.
