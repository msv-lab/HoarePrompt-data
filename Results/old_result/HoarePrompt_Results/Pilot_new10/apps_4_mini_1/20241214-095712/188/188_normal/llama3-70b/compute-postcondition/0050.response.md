Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer in the range 2 to 100. If `d[i]` equals `n // 2`, then if `c` is 0, `c` is set to 1, `a1` is updated to the next key in `d`, `a2` is updated to the next value in `d`, and `i` is updated to the next key in `d`. If `c` is not 0, `c` remains 0, `a1` stays the same, `a2` is updated to the next value in `d`, and `i` is updated to the next key in `d`, exiting the most internal loop or if statement.***
