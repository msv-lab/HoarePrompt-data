According to the code provided, the loop iterates over the keys in the dictionary `d`. For the loop to execute, `d` must contain at least one key (which means the dictionary cannot be empty). 

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an even integer in the range 2 to 100. This does not directly affect the loop execution but indicates that `a` has a valid length.
- `d` needs to have at least one key to allow the loop to execute. 
- `c`, `a1`, and `a2` state the current count and values but do not impact the execution of the loop itself.

For the loop to be executed, the states need to be adjusted so that `d` has at least one key. Since the value of `i` will take on each key in `d`, we will denote `i` as an existing key after the loop starts. 

State: **`n` is an even integer in the range 2 to 100, `d` must contain at least 1 key, `c` is 0, `a1` is -1, `a2` is -1, `i` is the first key in `d`**
