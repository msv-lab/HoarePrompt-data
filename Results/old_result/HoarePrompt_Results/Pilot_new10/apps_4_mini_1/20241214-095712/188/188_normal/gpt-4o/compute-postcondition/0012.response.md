Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100; `cards` is a list of `n` integers obtained from input; `count` is a Counter object representing the occurrences of each integer in `cards`; `unique_numbers` is a list of unique integers from `cards` sorted by their occurrences in ascending order, with a length of 2 or more. If both the counts of the last and second to last unique numbers in `unique_numbers` are equal to `n // 2`, then 'YES' is printed, followed by the last unique number and the second to last unique number from `unique_numbers`. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
