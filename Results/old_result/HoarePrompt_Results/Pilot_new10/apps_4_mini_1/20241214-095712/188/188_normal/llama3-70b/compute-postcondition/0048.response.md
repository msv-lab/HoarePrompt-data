The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an even integer in the range 2 to 100, `d` contains at least 1 more key, `c` is 0, `a1` remains as it is, `a2` is the next value in `d`, `i` is the next key in `d`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
