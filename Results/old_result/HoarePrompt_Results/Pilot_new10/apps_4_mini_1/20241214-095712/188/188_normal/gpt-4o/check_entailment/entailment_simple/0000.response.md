Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description for all potential cases. 

### Explanation of Why It Is Incorrect:

1. **Card Count Check**: The program only checks if the last two unique numbers in `unique_numbers` have exactly `n // 2` occurrences. This does not account for the scenario where the counts of two unique numbers may not be equal but can still allow both players to take all `n` cards fairly. For example, if one number appears `3` times and another appears `3` times, the program would deny fairness just based on the equality condition without recognizing the overall card distribution.

2. **Distinct Integer Requirement**: Although the program correctly identifies the need for two distinct integers, it assumes a structure of card counts that might not exist. It fails to return 'YES' in cases where there are exactly two distinct numbers, each appearing an equal number of times that sums to `n`.

3. **Example Failure Case**:
   - For input:
     ```
     6
     1
     2
     1
     2
     1
     2
     ```
     - Petya could choose `1` and Vasya could choose `2`. Both players would have three cards, which satisfies the gameâ€™s fairness condition. The program will print 'NO' as it fails the criteria established (needing both counts to be `n//2`).

Therefore, the program does not cover all scenarios as required by the problem statement, leading to incorrect outputs in specific cases. This is why the correctness is marked as **False**.
