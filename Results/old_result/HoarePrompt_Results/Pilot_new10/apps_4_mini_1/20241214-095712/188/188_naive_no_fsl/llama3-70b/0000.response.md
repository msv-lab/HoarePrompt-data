Correctness: **False**

The provided program attempts to determine if Petya and Vasya can play a fair game based on the integers on the cards. However, the program fails to correctly handle all potential cases as described. 

For example, consider the input:

```
4
1
1
2
2
```

In this scenario, the numbers on the cards are not distinct, but the program outputs "YES" and returns the integers 1 and 2. This is incorrect because although each player could choose a number, Petya would take two cards with the number 1 and Vasya would take two cards with the number 2, resulting in a fair division of cards. However, it does not account for the fact that the numbers chosen should be distinct and should allow for a total of `n` cards to be taken.

Another problematic case is:

```
4
3
3
3
3
```

Here, there are only one unique number on the cards, and the code will also incorrectly return "NO" when it should, in fact, be collected in a definitive check whether two distinct numbers exist. 

Instead of only checking for pairs of cards with exactly `n/2` occurrences, the program needs to ensure there are exactly two distinct numbers on the cards in order to print "YES" along with those numbers. 

Thus, since the program does not handle cases correctly and produces incorrect outputs for valid inputs, it fails to meet the problem's requirements.
