Postcondition: ***`dp[2]` remains the maximum value previously calculated, `dp[n]` is equal to `cakes[n][0]`, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 0. If `cakes[i][1]` is less than `cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2]` is less than `cakes[j][2]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its current value or `dp[j] + cakes[i][0]`.***
