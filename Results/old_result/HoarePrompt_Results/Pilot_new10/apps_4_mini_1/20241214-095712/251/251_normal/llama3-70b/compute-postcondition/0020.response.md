Postcondition: ***`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 1, `cakes` is a list of `n` tuples sorted in descending order by volume, `dp[0]` is `cakes[0][0]`, `dp[1]` is `cakes[1][0]`, `dp[i]` is now equal to `max(0.0, cakes[0][0] + cakes[i][0])` for `i=1`, `j` is 0, if `cakes[i][1]` is less than `cakes[j][1]`, and `cakes[i][2]` is less than `cakes[j][2]`, then `dp[i]` is updated accordingly. Otherwise, `dp[i]` remains 0.0 as it was before.***
