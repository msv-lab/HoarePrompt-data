According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the variable `j`. The variable `i` determines the number of iterations, and since `i` is currently 2, the loop will execute twice (with `j` taking values 0 and 1).

Before the first execution of the loop:
- `j` will start at 0 for the first iteration and then increment by 1.
- After the loop runs completely, `j` will be 2 after the second iteration.

To summarize, the states can be adjusted as follows to ensure the loop can execute correctly.

State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `cakes` is a list of `n` tuples sorted in descending order by volume, `dp[2]` is equal to `cakes[2][0]`**
