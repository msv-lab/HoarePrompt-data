Output State: **`dp` is updated such that `dp[i]` is the maximum value calculated based on previous `dp[j]` values that satisfy the condition of `cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]`, and `dp[n]` is equal to `cakes[n][0]`. The maximum value of `dp[k]` for `k < i` is retained, ensuring `dp[i]` reflects the best possible value for each cake when compared to the previous cakes. If no valid cakes were found, `dp[i]` retains its initial value as `cakes[i][0]`.**
