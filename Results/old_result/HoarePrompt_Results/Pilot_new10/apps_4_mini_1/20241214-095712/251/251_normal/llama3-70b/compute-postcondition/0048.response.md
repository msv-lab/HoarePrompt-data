The line of code `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + cakes[i][0])` checks the current value of `dp[i]` and compares it to the sum of `dp[j]` and `cakes[i][0]`. It updates `dp[i]` to the greater of those two values. In the initial state, `dp[2]` is the maximum value previously calculated. `dp[n]` is equal to `cakes[n][0]`. The values of `i` is greater than 1, and `j` is 1.

After this line of code executes:
- `dp[i]` will either retain its previous value or be updated to `dp[j] + cakes[i][0]`.

Since the maximum value of `dp[i]` could change depending on the values of `dp[j]` and `cakes[i][0]`, we need to specify that `dp[i]` now holds either its previous value or a new value.

Output State: **`dp[2]` remains the maximum value previously calculated; `dp[n]` is equal to `cakes[n][0]`; `i` is greater than 1; `j` is 1; `dp[i]` is updated to either `previous dp[i]` or `dp[j] + cakes[i][0]`.**
