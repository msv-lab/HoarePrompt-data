Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, `i` is at least 0, `dp[i]` is equal to the maximum sum obtained from sequences of volumes up to index `i`, and `dp[0]` remains equal to `volumes[0]`. If no values of `volumes[j]` were less than `volumes[i]`, then `dp[i]` remains unchanged from its initial value.**
