Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `i` is `n`; `j` is in the range [0, n-1]. After all iterations of the loop, `dp[n]` contains the maximum value possible based on the conditions set by `volumes[j] < volumes[n]` for all `j` in that range, starting from the initial value of `dp[n]` which was equal to `volumes[n]`. Therefore, `dp[n]` is the maximum of its original value and the sums of `dp[j] + volumes[n]` for all `j` where `volumes[j] < volumes[n]`.**
