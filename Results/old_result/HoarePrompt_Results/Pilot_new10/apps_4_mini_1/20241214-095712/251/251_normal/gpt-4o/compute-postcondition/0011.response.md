According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i`. The loop executes for values of `j` starting from `0` up to `i - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least `2`, which means that the loop has executed for `j` equal to `0` and `1`. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by `1`. Therefore, `j` must now be equal to `2`. Since `j` must be less than `i` for the loop to execute, `i` must be at least `3` for the loop to allow `j` to take the value `2` and continue executing.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, `i` is at least 3, `j` is 2**
