According to the code, the execution of the loop depends primarily on the value of `n`. Since `n` is positive and valued between 1 and 100000, the loop will iterate from 1 to `n-1`. 

Before the loop starts, it is important to recognize that we want `i` to begin at 1 for the first iteration. The conditions in the state indicate that `dp[0]` is already set to the volume of the first cake, while `dp[i]` for all `i > 0` is initialized to 0. This means that the loop can successfully execute provided `n` is at least 2, allowing `i` to take the value of 1 (the first value in the loop).

Thus, for the loop to be executed properly, we need `n` to be at least 2, and `i` starts at 1 at the beginning of the loop.

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 1, `cakes` is a list of n tuples sorted in descending order by volume, `dp[0]` is cakes[0][0], `dp[i]` is still 0.0 for all i > 0.**
