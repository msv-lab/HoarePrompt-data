Postcondition: ***`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `cakes` is a list of `n` tuples sorted in descending order by volume, `dp[0]` is `cakes[0][0]`, `dp[1]` is `cakes[1][0]`. If `cakes[i][1]` is less than `cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2]` is less than `cakes[j][2]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the sum of `dp[0]` and `cakes[i][0]`. Otherwise, `dp[i]` retains its current value, which is `max(0.0, cakes[0][0] + cakes[i][0])` originally set.***
