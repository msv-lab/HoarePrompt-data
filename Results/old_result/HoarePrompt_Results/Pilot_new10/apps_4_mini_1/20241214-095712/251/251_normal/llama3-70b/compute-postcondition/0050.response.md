According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop iterates over `j`, which ranges from `0` to `i-1`. Currently, `i` is greater than 1, and `j` is 1 at the end of the last iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must increment to 2, and it can continue until it reaches `i-1`.

For the loop to execute again:
- `i` must remain greater than 2 to allow more iterations, and `j` will increment to 2.
- The condition for the loop keeps executing as long as `j` remains less than `i`.

Thus, to ensure the loop runs for the next iteration:
State: **`dp[2]` remains the maximum value previously calculated; `dp[n]` is equal to `cakes[n][0]`; `i` is greater than 2; `j` is 2.**
