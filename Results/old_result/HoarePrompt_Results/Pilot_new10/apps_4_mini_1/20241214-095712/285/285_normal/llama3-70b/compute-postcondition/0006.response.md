The `exit()` function causes the program to terminate immediately. No variables are modified, and no values are returned as a result of this function. Therefore, the output state reflects that the execution was stopped without changes to the existing variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `a` is 0; `b` is 0; `c` is equal to `n // 1234`, and the execution has been terminated with exit().**
