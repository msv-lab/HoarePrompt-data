Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. 

Here is an explanation of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program accepts an integer input `n`, which represents Kolya's initial game-coin score, and adheres to the specified range (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9).

2. **Iteration Logic**: It uses a nested loop structure:
   - The outer loop iterates through possible values of `a`, where `a` represents the number of houses (each costing 1,234,567 game-coins). The range for `a` is computed as `n // 1234567 + 1`, ensuring it only considers valid non-negative integers that could potentially fit within `n`.
   - The inner loop computes the potential values for `b`, which represents the number of cars (each costing 123,456 game-coins), after deducting the value used by `a`. The calculation of the upper limit for `b` is `(n - a * 1234567) // 123456 + 1`.

3. **Calculation of `c`**: For each combination of `a` and `b`, it calculates `c` which denotes the number of computers (each costing 1,234 game-coins). The value of `c` is computed such that it calculates how many computers can be bought with the remaining coins: `c = (n - a * 1234567 - b * 123456) // 1234`.

4. **Conditional Check**: The program checks if the sum of the individual contributions from houses, cars, and computers exactly equals `n`. If it finds such a combination, it prints `'YES'` and exits.

5. **Final Output**: If all combinations of `a` and `b` are exhausted without a valid allocation of coins, it outputs `'NO'`, indicating that it’s not possible to spend all game-coins as described.

The program effectively explores all non-negative integer combinations of `a`, `b`, and `c`, satisfying the conditions set forth in the problem description, hence it is correct.
