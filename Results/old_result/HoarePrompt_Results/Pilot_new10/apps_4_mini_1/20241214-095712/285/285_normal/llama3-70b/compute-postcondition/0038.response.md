To determine the necessary states for the for loop to execute, we analyze the loop's range:

1. The range of the loop is defined by the expression `range((n - a * 1234567) // 123456 + 1)`.
2. For the loop to execute, the value of `(n - a * 1234567) // 123456 + 1` must be greater than 0.
3. This implies that `(n - a * 1234567) // 123456` must be at least 0, which means that `n - a * 1234567` should be non-negative. Hence, `n` must be greater than or equal to `a * 1234567`.
4. Since `n` is provided as a positive integer greater than or equal to 1234567, and because `a` has just been incremented by 1, `a` will be at least 1 (if its previous value was non-negative).

Therefore, we need to ensure that the state reflects:
- The value of `a` after the increment (let's denote the previous value of `a` as `prev_a`, thus now `a` is `prev_a + 1`).
- We need `n` to be equal to or greater than `(prev_a + 1) * 1234567`.

Now, let's express this in terms of the states:

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1234567, `a` is at least 1 (as it is incremented by 1), `b` is derived from (n - (prev_a + 1) * 1234567) // 123456, `b` must be non-negative for the loop to execute**.
