Postcondition: ***`n` must be at least `1234567`, and the initial costs of `house_cost`, `car_cost`, and `computer_cost` are `1234567`, `123456`, and `1234` respectively. If the `remaining_after_cars` is divisible by `computer_cost`, the function returns 'YES', indicating that the conditions set by the initial state are satisfied. If not, there is no else part in the code.***
