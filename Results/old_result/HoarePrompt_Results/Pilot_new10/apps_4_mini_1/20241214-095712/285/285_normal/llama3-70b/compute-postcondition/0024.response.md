The `exit()` command terminates the program execution. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the `exit()` command. The preceding context shows that 'YES' was printed before the exit command, which no longer affects the state. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer that is greater than or equal to 1234567; `a` is 1; `b` is 0; `c` is updated to `(n - 1234567) // 1234; program exited after printing 'YES'.**
