Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is the maximum number of times it can contribute to the sum without exceeding `n`, `b` is the maximum number of times it can contribute after considering the contributions of `a`, and `c` is the maximum number of times it can contribute after considering the contributions of both `a` and `b`, with  `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234` either equal to or less than `n`. If there is no combination of `a`, `b`, and `c` that satisfies the equation, then no output will be printed and the loop will finish without executing the print statement.**
