The `exit()` statement terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables do not change due to the execution of `exit()`, but the program is exited before any further processing can occur. Therefore, the output state will indicate that the program has exited, and all preconditions remain valid but are no longer relevant after termination.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1234567, `a` is at least 1, `b` is derived from (n - (prev_a + 1) * 1234567) // 123456, and `c` is calculated as (n - a * 1234567 - b * 123456) // 1234; 'YES' has been printed; program has exited.**
