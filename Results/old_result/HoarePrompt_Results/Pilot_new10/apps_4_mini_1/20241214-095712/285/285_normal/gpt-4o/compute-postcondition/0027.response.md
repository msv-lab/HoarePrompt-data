The variable `remaining_after_cars` is assigned the value of `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`. The value of `remaining_after_houses` is at least `123456`, and `b` is `1`, so this will simplify to `remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - car_cost`. The relationship with `computer_cost` still holds as `remaining_after_cars` is not divisible by `computer_cost`. 

Since the specific value of `car_cost` is not provided, we denote the updated value of `remaining_after_cars` in relation to `remaining_after_houses` and `car_cost`.

Output State: **`n` is at least `1358023`, `remaining_after_houses` is greater than or equal to `123456`, `b` is 1, `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `remaining_after_houses - car_cost`, and `remaining_after_cars` is not divisible by `computer_cost`.**
