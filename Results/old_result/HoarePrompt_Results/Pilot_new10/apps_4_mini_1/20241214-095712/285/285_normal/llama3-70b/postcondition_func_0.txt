The function accepts no parameters and prompts the user to input a positive integer `n` (where 1 <= n <= 10^9). It attempts to find non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c` such that the equation `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234 = n` holds true. If such integers exist, it prints 'YES' and exits the function. If no valid combination is found after exhausting all possibilities, it prints 'NO'.
