The code only consists of a print statement. This means that while the output 'YES' will be printed, there are no changes made to any variables in the initial state. Therefore, the previous values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `a` is 0; `b` is 1; `c` is `(n - 123456) // 1234` and 'YES' has been printed.**
