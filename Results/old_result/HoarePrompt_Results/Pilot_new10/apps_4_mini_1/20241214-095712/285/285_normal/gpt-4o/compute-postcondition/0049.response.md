Postcondition: ***`n` is at least `1234567`, `remaining_after_houses` is at least equal to `car_cost`, `car_cost` is greater than 0, `b` is 2, and `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `remaining_after_houses - 2 * car_cost`. If `remaining_after_cars` is divisible by `computer_cost`, the program returns 'YES', indicating that all conditions allow for this outcome.***
