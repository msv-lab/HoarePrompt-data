Output State: **`n` is at least `1234567`, `house_cost` is `1234567`, `car_cost` is `123456`, `computer_cost` is `1234`, `remaining_after_houses` is nonnegative and less than or equal to `remaining_after_houses`, `a` is `0`, `b` is at most `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`, and if the loop executed, `remaining_after_cars` is less than or equal to the starting value of `remaining_after_houses` after the last iteration; if the loop did not execute, `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `remaining_after_houses`. The function will have returned 'YES' if any value of `remaining_after_cars` during execution was divisible by `computer_cost`, otherwise it does not return 'YES'.**
