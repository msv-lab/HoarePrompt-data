To determine the correctness of the provided Python program in relation to the problem description, we need to analyze the logic presented in the code and check it against possible edge cases and constraints mentioned.

**Analysis of the Code:**
1. The program reads two integers `n` and `k`.
2. It first checks if `n < k`, which would imply that it's impossible to express `n` as a sum of `k` powers of two since the minimum power (considering non-negative powers) would be `1` (2^0) multiplied by `k`, leading to values of at least `k`.
3. Then, it initializes an empty list `a` and attempts to find powers of two that can sum to `n` using a `while` loop. The method to determine the largest power of two is derived from using `n.bit_length() - 1`, which finds the bit position of the highest bit set in `n`.
4. If `len(a) < k`, it prints "No", indicating that it could not find enough components to meet the requirement of having length `k`.
5. Otherwise, it sorts and prints the result as required.

**Edge Cases:**
- The program seems to handle cases where `n < k` correctly.
- However, there are potential issues when `n` can yield valid possibilities with powers of two but in counts less than `k`, particularly with negative powers or distributing powers unevenly.

**Potential Issues:**
1. Consider the case when `n = 1` and `k = 2`. The answer is supposed to be "Yes" with `-1 -1`, which the code will output as "No", as it doesn't account for negative powers specifically. Instead, `2^{-1} + 2^{-1} = 1`, which is valid, but the logic in the code restricts to non-negative integers in the array `a`.
   
2. Similarly, for `n = 3` and `k = 2`, the sequence `(1, 1)` or `(-1, 3)` should be a valid output but would fail for the current implementation because it only progressively adds positive powers of two.

In conclusion, the code logic fails to cover scenarios where `n` can indeed be represented by less-than-conventional methods, especially when valid combinations involve negative powers or selections that sum up to `n` in more complex distributions.

**Correctness: False**

The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly based on the problem description, particularly for cases where negative powers would be necessary. An example input like `1 2` where the program should find the valid sequence `-1 -1` results in "No".
