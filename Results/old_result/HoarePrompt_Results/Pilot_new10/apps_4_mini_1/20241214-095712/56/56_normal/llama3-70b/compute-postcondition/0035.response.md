The statement `print(' '.join(map(str, a)))` outputs the values contained in the list `a`, converting each element to a string and joining them with a space in between. The variable `a` remains unchanged after this operation, and it is still a list of integers representing the highest set bits encountered during each iteration.

Therefore, since the state of `a` remains valid and unchanged, reflecting the current values, the final output just indicates that the values of `a` are now presented in a space-separated format.

Output State: **`n` is non-negative, `i` is the total number of iterations executed, `a` remains sorted in descending order and printed as space-separated values, `k` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5, and the length of `a` is equal to `k`.**
