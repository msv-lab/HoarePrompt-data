You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Jamie is preparing a Codeforces round. He has got an idea for a problem, but does not know how to solve it. Help him write a solution to the following problem:

Find k integers such that the sum of two to the power of each number equals to the number n and the largest integer in the answer is as small as possible. As there may be multiple answers, you are asked to output the lexicographically largest one. 

To be more clear, consider all integer sequence with length k (a_1, a_2, ..., a_{k}) with $\sum_{i = 1}^{k} 2^{a_{i}} = n$. Give a value $y = \operatorname{max}_{1 \leq i \leq k} a_{i}$ to each sequence. Among all sequence(s) that have the minimum y value, output the one that is the lexicographically largest.

For definitions of powers and lexicographical order see notes.


-----Input-----

The first line consists of two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5) — the required sum and the length of the sequence.


-----Output-----

Output "No" (without quotes) in a single line if there does not exist such sequence. Otherwise, output "Yes" (without quotes) in the first line, and k numbers separated by space in the second line — the required sequence.

It is guaranteed that the integers in the answer sequence fit the range [ - 10^18, 10^18].


-----Examples-----
Input
23 5

Output
Yes
3 3 2 1 0 

Input
13 2

Output
No

Input
1 2

Output
Yes
-1 -1 



-----Note-----

Sample 1:

2^3 + 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0 = 8 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 23

Answers like (3, 3, 2, 0, 1) or (0, 1, 2, 3, 3) are not lexicographically largest.

Answers like (4, 1, 1, 1, 0) do not have the minimum y value.

Sample 2:

It can be shown there does not exist a sequence with length 2.

Sample 3:

$2^{-1} + 2^{-1} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1$

Powers of 2:

If x > 0, then 2^{x} = 2·2·2·...·2 (x times).

If x = 0, then 2^{x} = 1.

If x < 0, then $2^{x} = \frac{1}{2^{-x}}$.

Lexicographical order:

Given two different sequences of the same length, (a_1, a_2, ... , a_{k}) and (b_1, b_2, ... , b_{k}), the first one is smaller than the second one for the lexicographical order, if and only if a_{i} < b_{i}, for the first i where a_{i} and b_{i} differ.
Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().strip().split()
n = int(data[0])
k = int(data[1])
print(func_1(n, k))

def func_1(n, k):
    if k > n:
        return 'No'
    bits = []
    for i in range(60, -1, -1):
        if n >> i & 1:
            bits.append(i)
    if len(bits) > k:
        return 'No'
    while len(bits) < k:
        smallest = bits.pop()
        bits.append(smallest - 1)
        bits.append(smallest - 1)
    bits.sort(reverse=True)
    return 'Yes\n' + ' '.join(map(str, bits))


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the constraints and implementation of the function `func_1`.

**Problem Breakdown:**

The program is supposed to generate a sequence of `k` integers such that the sum of \( 2^{a_i} \) equals `n`, while also ensuring that the maximum integer in the result sequence is minimized, and that the sequence is lexicographically largest among all valid sequences.

**Validation of the Code Logic:**

1. It first checks if `k > n`, returning "No" if true because it is impossible to create a valid sequence in such a case since the minimum sum with `k` non-negative terms (when they are all zeros) is `k * 2^0 = k`.

2. It collects the powers of two corresponding to bits set in `n` into the list `bits`.

3. If the length of `bits` is greater than `k`, it returns "No" since we cannot build a sequence with `k` elements out of fewer than `k` unique bits.

4. The subsequent `while` loop expands the number of elements in `bits` until it reaches `k` by taking the smallest bit and creating two instances of `smallest - 1`, thus preserving the lexicographical order.

5. Finally, the sequence is sorted in descending order and printed.

**Potential Edge Cases:**

- If `k` is 1 and `n` is 0, it should return "Yes" and the output should be [0]. The check for bits will yield an empty list but through the bit expansion process, `[-1]` would be created incorrectly, which is contrary to the expected behavior.
  
- When `n` is a power of 2 and `k > 1`, there is a question if it's possible to sum to `n` with more than one bit.

**Conclusion:**

Upon evaluating the code, it appears that it does not properly handle the case where the bit representation may require negative integers. More importantly, it completely misses the case where when `k` is greater than the number of bits representing `n`, and if any additional required numbers create a sum that cannot be achieved with purely non-negative integers.

For example, for the input:

- `n = 1`, `k = 2`, it would incorrectly produce "Yes" with output `[-1, -1]`, while conceptually, it should state "No" since with k = 2 we can't use just 2^(-1).

Thus, the program does not work correctly in all cases. 

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().strip().split()
n = int(data[0])
k = int(data[1])
print(func_1(n, k))

import sys

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, and k is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5.
def func_1(n, k):
    if (k > n) :
        return 'No'
        #The program returns 'No' because the current value of k is greater than n.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5, and `k` is less than or equal to `n`.
    bits = []
    for i in range(60, -1, -1):
        if n >> i & 1:
            bits.append(i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5, `k` is less than or equal to `n`, and `bits` is a list of indices of the set bits in the binary representation of `n`, ranging from 0 to 60.
    if (len(bits) > k) :
        return 'No'
        #The program returns 'No'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5, `k` is less than or equal to `n`, and `bits` is a list of indices of the set bits in the binary representation of `n`, ranging from 0 to 60. The length of `bits` is less than or equal to `k`.
    while len(bits) < k:
        smallest = bits.pop()
        
        bits.append(smallest - 1)
        
        bits.append(smallest - 1)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5; `k` is less than or equal to `n`; `len(bits)` is equal to `k`; `smallest` is the value of the last element removed from `bits` during the final execution; `bits` now contains the indices of set bits in `n` with additional elements that are decremented values of the smallest elements that have been processed, ensuring that `len(bits)` has reached `k`.
    bits.sort(reverse=True)
    return 'Yes\n' + ' '.join(map(str, bits))
    #The program returns 'Yes' followed by the indices of set bits in n, which are contained in the sorted list 'bits', formatted as a space-separated string.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
