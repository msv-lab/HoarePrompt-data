The value of `x` is assigned the result of `n.bit_length() - 1`. The method `bit_length()` returns the number of bits necessary to represent `n` in binary, which will indicate the position of the highest bit (with position starting from 0). Given that `n` must be greater than 2, the output of `n.bit_length()` will always be at least 3, making `x` at least 2. The values of `k` and `i` are unchanged by this operation. 

Thus, the output state is: `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5, `n` must be greater than 2; `i` is increased by 1; and `x` is equal to `n.bit_length() - 1`, which is at least 2.
