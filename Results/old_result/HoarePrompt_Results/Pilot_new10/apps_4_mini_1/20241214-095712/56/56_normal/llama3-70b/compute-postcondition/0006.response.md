According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the variable `n` is greater than 0. Right before the loop, `n` is an input integer that satisfies the conditions 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18 and `n` is guaranteed to be greater than or equal to `k`, which is an integer between 1 and 10^5. Since the minimum value of `n` is 1, it is already positive.

Thus, all states are already set in a way that ensures the loop can execute at least one time. 

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `a` is an empty list, `i` is 0**.
