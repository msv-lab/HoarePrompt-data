Functionality: ** The function accepts two parameters, `n` (a positive integer between 1 and 10^18) and `k` (a positive integer between 1 and 10^5). It first checks if `k` is greater than `n`, in which case it returns 'No'. It then counts the number of set bits in the binary representation of `n` and if the count exceeds `k`, it again returns 'No'. If the count is less than or equal to `k`, it ensures that the total number of bits matches `k` by adding decremented indices of the smallest set bit until the count reaches `k`. Finally, it returns 'Yes' followed by the sorted indices of the set bits in `n` as a space-separated string. This function assumes `k` will not exceed the maximum possible number of bits (which is 60 in this context).**
