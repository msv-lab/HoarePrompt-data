Correctness: **False**

The program provided does not meet the requirements for all potential cases as dictated by the problem description. 

Let's consider the third example provided in the problem description:

**Input:**
```
1 2
```

According to the output hints, since 1 can be expressed as `0.5 + 0.5` (which corresponds to `2^{-1} + 2^{-1}`), the output should be:

```
Yes
-1 -1
```

However, in the implementation, the program does not account for the possibility of negative powers of 2 adequately when `k` is greater than 1. Specifically, the code:

1. Checks if `k > n`, then outputs "No". This is not a correct assessment for all cases; for instance, `k` can be greater than `n` and still produce valid sequences as shown in the third example when considering negative powers.
  
2. When adjusting the bits to match `k`, the code only accounts for non-negative integers and does not handle the scenario of needing to decrement into negative indices.

Thus, for the case `1 2`, the expected output should be "Yes" with two -1 values, but the code would likely return "No" if it doesn't fall through the checks correctly, leading to an incorrect output. 

In summary, since the program does not guarantee correct outputs for all possible inputs, especially when `n` is less than `k`, it can result in situations where the output does not match the expectations from the problem description. Therefore, the program is not correct for every potential case.
