To verify the correctness of the annotated Python program against the problem description, we'll evaluate whether the program fully implements the requirements as detailed in the problem statement.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. **Input Format**: Two integers `n` and `k`, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18` and `1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5`.
2. **Output Requirements**:
   - If it's impossible to form a sequence of length `k` whose terms, when applied to `2^a_i`, sum to `n`, output "No".
   - If a valid sequence can be formed, output "Yes" followed by a sequence of `k` integers that satisfies:
     - The sum of `2^a_i` equals `n`.
     - It's lexicographically largest.
     - The maximum value in the sequence is minimized.

### Code Review:
1. **Initial Check**:
   - The program first checks if `n < k`. If this condition holds, it immediately returns "No". This part is correct since if `n` cannot be split into `k` contributions, it's impossible to satisfy the constraints.
   
2. **Finding Highest Set Bits**:
   - It uses a loop to extract the highest power of 2 from `n`, which it does correctly using `n.bit_length() - 1`.
   - The loop continues while `n` is greater than 0, extracting the highest set bit until no more set bits are found. 

3. **List Length Check**:
   - After attempting to form the list `a` of powers, it checks if the size of `a` is less than `k`. If so, it returns "No". This is correctly capturing the scenarios where it's not possible to create a sequence of sufficient length.

4. **Generating the Output**:
   - If the length of `a` is at least `k`, it slices `a` to the size `k`, sorts it in descending order, and prints "Yes" followed by the necessary integers.

### Analysis of Correctness:
- The program correctly identifies the impossibility of creating a valid sequence when `n < k`.
- The method used to gather the highest powers of two ensures that the list contains viable candidates for constructing the required sum `n`.
- By sorting `a` in descending order and then limiting it to the first `k` elements, the program ensures that the output is lexicographically largest while maintaining the minimum highest power.

### Potential Faults:
- The program does not account for situations where `n` may still allow for k components but summing them from higher powers creates a different component scheme compared to just collecting individual powers. For example, if `n` was less than the smallest power that can be produced from the required length, it might not gather the right configuration.
- The treatment of the sorted array should prioritize the sum condition, which isn't explicitly enforced in generating elements beyond the loop terminating on `n > 0`.

### Conclusion:
The program has a logical flaw in how it prepares the values to sum to `n` and thereby may fail to provide a correct sequence under certain configurations of `n` and `k`. The inherent assumption of how the bits are collected and then limiting through a simple slice and sort does not guarantee the required lexicographical output might not hold for all sequences.

Correctness: **False**
