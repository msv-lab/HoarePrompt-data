Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18 and `k` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5. If `n` is less than `k`, the output is 'No'. If `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `n` is non-negative and `i` is the total number of iterations executed. If the length of `a` is less than `k`, values corresponding to the highest set bits encountered during each iteration are added to `a`. If the length of `a` is equal to `k`, then `a` remains sorted in descending order and is printed as space-separated values.***
