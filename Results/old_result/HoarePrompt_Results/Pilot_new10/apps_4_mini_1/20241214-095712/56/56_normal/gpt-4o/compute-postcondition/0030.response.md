Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5; `k` is less than or equal to `n`; `len(bits)` is equal to `k`; `smallest` is the value of the last element removed from `bits` during the final execution; `bits` now contains the indices of set bits in `n` with additional elements that are decremented values of the smallest elements that have been processed, ensuring that `len(bits)` has reached `k`.**
