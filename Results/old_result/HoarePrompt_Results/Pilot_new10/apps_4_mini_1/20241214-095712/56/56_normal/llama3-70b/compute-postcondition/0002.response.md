The code simply executes a print statement which outputs a string 'No', but it does not change any variable values or states. The variables `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and thus the values remain the same as the initial state. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5, `n` is less than `k`, and the output is 'No'.**
