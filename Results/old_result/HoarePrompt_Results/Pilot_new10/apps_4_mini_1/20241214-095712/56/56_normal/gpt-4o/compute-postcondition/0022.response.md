According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition that `len(bits)` must be less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `len(bits)` is less than or equal to `k` since it is stated that the current state has `len(bits)` increased by 1. This indicates that `len(bits)` has just become equal to `k`. Therefore, in order for the loop to execute one more time, `len(bits)` must be less than `k`. As such, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `len(bits)` is less than `k` again.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5; `k` is less than or equal to `n`; `len(bits)` must be less than `k`**
