The value of `x` is assigned the result of `n.bit_length() - 1`. The `bit_length()` method returns the number of bits required to represent the number `n` in binary. Since `n` is greater than 0, `n.bit_length()` will yield at least 1, making `x` a non-negative integer. The states of other variables are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is increased by 1; `x` is equal to `n.bit_length() - 1`.**
