Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5, with `k` being less than or equal to `n`; `bits` includes the values 60, 59, 59; and `i` is 59. If the bit at position `i` in `n` is set (i.e., `n` >> `i` & 1 evaluates to true), the conditions regarding `n`, `k`, `bits`, and `i` hold true.***
