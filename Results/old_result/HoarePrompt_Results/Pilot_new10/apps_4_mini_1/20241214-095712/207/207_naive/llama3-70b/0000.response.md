Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not correctly implement the logic needed to calculate \( f(i) \). The key problems with the code are:

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach Flaw**: The code seems to try to use dynamic programming to accumulate counts of reachable positions, but it incorrectly updates the `dp` array in both the forward and backward directions within the loop. The logic for jumping backward is fundamentally flawed. Specifically, the line `dp[i] += dp[i - b]` leads to incorrect counts because it does not account for the fact that jumping backward does not progress in the way intended. It also leads to incorrect updates on positions that are not valid jumps.

2. **Incorrect Population of Results**: The function counts states within the `dp` list based on invalid index additions. The result of `sum(dp)` will not reflect the distinct counts reachable by the frog as intended, especially without regard to boundaries correctly to compute reachable states accurately.

3. **Missing Edge Cases**: The function does not properly handle scenarios where jumping backward or forward exceeds the bounds of the interval [0, m] or when no moves can yet be made. Therefore, edge cases can arise, particularly when \( m \) is small relative to the values of \( a \) and \( b \).

An example that highlights this flaw is:

- Input: `1 2 1`
  
  According to the problem, \( f(i) \) would yield \( f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1 \). Thus, \( f(0) + f(1) = 2 \). However, the program incorrectly accumulates values leading to an incorrect final output.

Hence the solution does not satisfy the problem requirements, confirming its incorrectness.
