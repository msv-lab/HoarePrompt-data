To determine the correctness of the given Python program against the problem description, we need to evaluate if the provided function accurately computes the required output based on every potential input case.

The problem requires us to find the sum of all distinct integers that a frog can reach on the number line from position 0 using two types of jumps: jumping forward by `a` and jumping backward by `b`. We denote this reachable count as `f(x)` for positions from `0` to `m`. The challenge lies in ensuring that the program handles the bounds of the jumping operations effectively and efficiently for large values of `m`.

### Function Analysis

1. **Function 1 (Calculating GCD)**: 
   - `func_1(x, y)` computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers `x` and `y`. This part seems correct and is a complementary function to what is needed in the main logic.

2. **Function 2 (Core Logic)**:
   - `func_2(m, a, b)` is the primary function intended to calculate the desired sum.
   - The first thing it does is find the GCD of `a` and `b`. If the GCD `g` is greater than `1`, it scales down the inputs for the next calculations which is mathematically sound to simplify the problem.
   - It checks if `m` is less than `k` (where `k = a + b - 1`). If this is the case, it returns the sum of the first `(m + 1)` integers, which is correct as those points should all be reachable within the constraints set by `a` and `b`.
   - If `m` is greater than or equal to `k`, it then calculates two sums related to `k` and `m`. This part seems like it visually represents two ranges, which is standard in arithmetic problems.

### Edge Cases and Concerns
- The primary concern is whether all positions reachable from `0` are accounted for in the computation of `f(i)` for every `i` from `0` to `m`. The comments suggest that for `m >= k`, it merely calculates the sums without explicitly considering unreachable points or overlapping reachable ranges. 

- Importantly, the code seems to assume that all integers from `0` to `k-1` are reachable when `m` is less than `k`. However, when `m` is greater than `k`, the splits could overlook some integers that are not reachable if `b` exceeds certain gaps between incremental `a` jumps.

#### Case of Failure
For instance, consider the test case where:
```
m = 7, a = 5, b = 3
```
Here `k = 5 + 3 - 1 = 7`. Here, at `i = 7`, the code needs to calculate reachable integers but might miss nuanced jumps because of specific bounds `(m, a, b)` interactions. 

There are intervals where distinct integers that the frog can actually reach would not be counted accurately, especially with diverse jump lengths `a` and `b`. 

### Conclusion
Due to the potential to overlook distinct integers between gaps created by jumping `b` backward and not updating reachable intervals accurately, we observe a fault.

Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle all potential edge cases, especially in the region where `m` intersects with distinct integer reachability given the properties of jumps `a` and `b`.
