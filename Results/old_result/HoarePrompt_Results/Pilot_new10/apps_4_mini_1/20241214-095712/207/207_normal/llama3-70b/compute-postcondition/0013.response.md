The statement `dp[i] += dp[i - b]` indicates that the value of `dp[i]` is being updated by adding `dp[i - b]` to it. Since `m`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers, we can determine that `dp[i]` will change based on the value of `dp[i - b]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

However, we need to check whether the condition related to the variables `m`, `a`, and `b` affects the computation. The state of `dp` at index `i - b` must be valid before we perform the update. There is no information on the previous values of `dp[i]` and `dp[i - b]`, so we cannot specify exact numerical values.

Given that the state allows the manipulation based on the condition stated, we summarize it in the output state.

Output State: **`m`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers; `dp[i]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i] + dp[i - b]`**.
