The function accepts three parameters: positive integers `m`, `a`, and `b`. It first calls another function `func_1(a, b)` to obtain `g`. If `g` is not equal to 1, it recursively calls itself with modified parameters `(m // g, a // g, b // g)`, multiplying the result by `g`. If `m` is less than `k` (where `k` is `a + b - 1`), it returns the sum of the first `m + 1` integers. If neither of these conditions hold, it calculates and returns the sum of two series: one up to `k` and another from `k` to `m`. The function can therefore handle different scenarios based on the values of `g`, `m`, `a`, and `b` while involving multiple recursive calls if `g` is greater than 1.
