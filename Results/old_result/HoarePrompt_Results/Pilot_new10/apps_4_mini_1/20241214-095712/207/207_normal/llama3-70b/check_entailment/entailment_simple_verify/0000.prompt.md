You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A frog is initially at position $0$ on the number line. The frog has two positive integers $a$ and $b$. From a position $k$, it can either jump to position $k+a$ or $k-b$.

Let $f(x)$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $[0, x]$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $0$.

Given an integer $m$, find $\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$. That is, find the sum of all $f(i)$ for $i$ from $0$ to $m$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers $m, a, b$ ($1 \leq m \leq 10^9, 1 \leq a,b \leq 10^5$).


-----Output-----

Print a single integer, the desired sum.


-----Examples-----
Input
7 5 3

Output
19

Input
1000000000 1 2019

Output
500000001500000001

Input
100 100000 1

Output
101

Input
6 4 5

Output
10



-----Note-----

In the first example, we must find $f(0)+f(1)+\ldots+f(7)$. We have $f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$. The sum of these values is $19$.

In the second example, we have $f(i) = i+1$, so we want to find $\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$.

In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.
Program:
```
def func():
    (m, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    dp = [0] * (m + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    for i in range(m + 1):
        if i + a <= m:
            dp[i + a] += dp[i]
        if i - b >= 0:
            dp[i] += dp[i - b]
    print(sum(dp))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not correctly implement the logic needed to calculate \( f(i) \). The key problems with the code are:

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach Flaw**: The code seems to try to use dynamic programming to accumulate counts of reachable positions, but it incorrectly updates the `dp` array in both the forward and backward directions within the loop. The logic for jumping backward is fundamentally flawed. Specifically, the line `dp[i] += dp[i - b]` leads to incorrect counts because it does not account for the fact that jumping backward does not progress in the way intended. It also leads to incorrect updates on positions that are not valid jumps.

2. **Incorrect Population of Results**: The function counts states within the `dp` list based on invalid index additions. The result of `sum(dp)` will not reflect the distinct counts reachable by the frog as intended, especially without regard to boundaries correctly to compute reachable states accurately.

3. **Missing Edge Cases**: The function does not properly handle scenarios where jumping backward or forward exceeds the bounds of the interval [0, m] or when no moves can yet be made. Therefore, edge cases can arise, particularly when \( m \) is small relative to the values of \( a \) and \( b \).

An example that highlights this flaw is:

- Input: `1 2 1`
  
  According to the problem, \( f(i) \) would yield \( f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1 \). Thus, \( f(0) + f(1) = 2 \). However, the program incorrectly accumulates values leading to an incorrect final output.

Hence the solution does not satisfy the problem requirements, confirming its incorrectness.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: m is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9, and a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^5.
def func():
    m, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    dp = [0] * (m + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    for i in range(m + 1):
        if i + a <= m:
            dp[i + a] += dp[i]
        
        if i - b >= 0:
            dp[i] += dp[i - b]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `m`, `a`, `b` are positive integers. `dp` is an array where `dp[i]` contains the number of ways to reach the index `i` using steps of size `a` and `b`, such that `dp[0]` is 1 and all other values depend on the accumulated values from previous iterations. If `i + a` is less than or equal to `m`, `dp[i + a]` is incremented by `dp[i]`, and if `i - b` is greater than or equal to 0, `dp[i]` is incremented by `dp[i - b]`. Therefore, after all iterations, `dp` reflects all possible combinations of moves to reach each index up to `m`.
    print(sum(dp))


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
