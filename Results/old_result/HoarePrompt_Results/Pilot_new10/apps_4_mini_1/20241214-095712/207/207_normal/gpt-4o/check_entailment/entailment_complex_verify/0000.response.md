Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately identifies that the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem of calculating the sum of reachable integers by the frog on the number line. The annotated version of the code reinforces that each function operates correctly according to its design:

1. **GCD Calculation**: The `func_1` correctly determines the GCD of `a` and `b`, which is essential for simplifying the problem when `a` and `b` have a common factor greater than 1. This behavior is appropriately captured in the annotations.

2. **Summation Logic**: The `func_2` assesses the range effectively and handles different cases based on the relationship between `m`, `a`, and `b`. The conditions for calculating the sums of reachable indices (i.e., returning the appropriate sums based on values of `m` relative to `k = a + b - 1`) are sound and represent the combinatorial nature of integer jumps from position 0.

The program's correctness hinges on its ability to handle edge cases, such as scenarios where `m` is less than both `a` and `b`. Given the logical flow of the program as evidenced by both the original assessment and the annotations, it supports reaching the stated results correctly. Thus, the assessment remains as proposed, reaffirming that the program operates as intended and satisfies the problem requirements.
