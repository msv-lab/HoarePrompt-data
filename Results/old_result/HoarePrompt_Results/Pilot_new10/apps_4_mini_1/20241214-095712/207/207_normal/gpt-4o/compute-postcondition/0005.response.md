Postcondition: ***`m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9; `a` is a positive integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^5; `b` is a positive integer such that 1 <= b <= 10^5; `g` is equal to 1, which is the result of `func_1(a, b)`; `k` is equal to `a + b - 1`; the current value of `m` is less than `k`.***
