Correctness: **False**

The provided program uses a dynamic programming approach to determine the number of distinct integers the frog can reach but has a flawed logic. Specifically, the process of updating `dp` with backward jumps is incorrect. 

When the program calculates the possible positions the frog can reach using backward jumps (`i - b`), it adds the existing count of ways to reach `i - b` to `dp[i]`, which does not correctly account for the fact that you can only jump backward into the range `[0, m]`. This leads to erroneous results when `i` is less than `b`, as it can result in negative indices or incorrectly counting jumps that should not be tracked.

An example to illustrate this flaw is when:
- Input: `m = 6`, `a = 4`, `b = 5`
1. The frog starts at position `0` and can make the following jumps:
   - Jump forward to `4` and be stuck (only can jump to positions `0` or `4`)
   - Jump backward cannot happen in this case
2. Therefore, it cannot reach positions `1`, `2`, `3`, which means `f(i)` would yield incorrect results.

Therefore, the computations for `f(i)` will not accurately reflect the distinct reachable integers for certain values of `a` and `b`, leading to incorrect total sums, affirming that the code does not handle all potential cases faithfully as specified in the problem description.
