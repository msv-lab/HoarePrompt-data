The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `m`, `a`, and `b`. Here, `m` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 10^9, while `a` and `b` are also positive integers within the range of 1 to 100,000. 

The function can return different values based on the following cases:
- **Case 1**: If a certain condition is met (involving the result of `func_1(a, b)` which is greater than 1), the function returns the result of `func_2` with modified parameters `(m // g, a // g, b // g)` multiplied by `g`, where `g` is the result from `func_1(a, b)`.
- **Case 2**: If `m` is a positive integer less than `k` (where `k` is equal to `a + b - 1`), the function returns the result of the formula `(m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2`.
- **Case 3**: If neither of the previous conditions is met, the function returns the sum of `sum_k` (calculated as `(a + b - 1) * (a + b) // 2`) and `sum_m` (calculated as `m * (m + 1) // 2 - k * (k - 1) // 2`).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept three positive integer parameters `m`, `a`, and `b`, and return results based on specific conditions involving these parameters and calculations based on their values. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters m, a, and b. It returns a modified result based on func_1 if a certain condition is satisfied, or a calculated value based on m if it is less than k, or a sum of two calculated values otherwise.**
