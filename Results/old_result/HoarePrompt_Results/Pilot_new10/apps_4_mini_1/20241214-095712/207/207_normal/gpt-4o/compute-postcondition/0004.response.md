The value of `k` is assigned the result of the expression `a + b - 1`. The variables `a` and `b` are both positive integers within their respective ranges, hence their sum will also be within a valid integer range. The rest of the variables `m` and `g` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `k`, while `m`, `a`, `b`, and `g` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9; `a` is a positive integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^5; `b` is a positive integer such that 1 <= b <= 10^5; `g` is equal to 1, which is the result of `func_1(a, b)`, `k` is equal to `a + b - 1`.**
