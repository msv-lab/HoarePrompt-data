Postcondition: ***`m` is a positive integer (1 <= `m` <= 10^9), `a` is a positive integer (1 <= `a` <= 10^5), `b` is a positive integer (1 <= `b` <= 10^5), `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[1]` to `dp[m]` are all initialized to 0, `i` is 0 at the start of the loop, and the current value of `i` plus `a` is less than or equal to `m`.***
