To determine the correctness of the provided program according to the problem description, we need to analyze how well the program addresses all potential cases described.

1. **Understanding the Area Condition**: The area condition requires that a triangle formed by three points \((x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), (x_3, y_3)\) has an area equal to \(\frac{nm}{k}\). The program first checks if this area is an integer and if it's not zero. 

2. **Points Selection Logic**: The program attempts to generate three points based on calculated conditions:
   - If twice the area is less than or equal to \(n\), it picks the corresponding points with the x-coordinates managing \((2 \cdot \text{area}, 1)\).
   - If the previous condition isn't met but twice the area is less than or equal to \(m\), it does similarly with y-coordinates managing \((1, 2 \cdot \text{area})\).
   - If neither condition applies, it uses the maximum values of \(n\) and \(m\) to form points on the edges.

3. **Potential Failures**: 
   - The generated points might not actually lie within the limits defined (\(0 \leq x_i \leq n\) and \(0 \leq y_i \leq m\)).
   - Notably, if \(n\) or \(m\) is specifically not large enough to accommodate any valid triangle forming points dictated by the area condition, or if the calculation of points provides out-of-bound coordinates, the program does not catch these edge cases.

Let's investigate some edge cases, for instance:
- **Input**: \(1, 1, 2\)
  - In this case, the area \(\frac{1 \cdot 1}{2} = 0.5\), which the program will correctly identify as non-integer and subsequently print "NO". However, it's also important to note that with \(k\) set to 2, the area doesn't represent even a trivial triangle.
  
- **Input**: \(2, 2, 3\)
  - The area \(\frac{2 \cdot 2}{3} = \frac{4}{3}\) which isn't an integer; thus, it will print "NO". 

Checking a condition that passes criteria:
- **Input**: \(4, 4, 2\)
  - The area becomes \(8\). The points would print as:
    ```
    YES
    0 0
    8 1
    0 1
    ```
  However, \((8, 1)\) is out of bounds for \(x\) being greater than \(n\) which should invalidate the triangle points.

Given that this program can produce edge cases where coordinates exceed permissible limits, we conclude there can be cases where valid points indeed cannot be produced despite the area condition seeming fulfilled.

Therefore, based on the analysis of potential edge cases and the logic being flawed in generating valid point outputs while considering bounds:

**Correctness: False**. 

The program fails in providing accurate results for all edge cases, specifically failing to guarantee the points remain within specified limits.
