To assess the correctness of the provided code according to the problem description and examples given, we need to analyze the program and its logic thoroughly.

### Key Concepts:
1. **Area of Triangle**: The area of a triangle formed by three points \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\) is given by the formula:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \right|
   \]
   The task requires this area to equal \(\frac{nm}{k}\).

2. **Input Constraints**: The values for \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\) are bounded within certain limits.

3. **Output Conditions**: If there are no suitable points, the output should be "NO", otherwise "YES" followed by the coordinates of the points.

### Code Walkthrough:
1. **Initial Check**:
   ```python
   if n * m % k:
       print('NO')
       exit()
   ```
   This checks if the area \(\frac{nm}{k}\) is an integer (i.e., whether \(nm\) is divisible by \(k\)). If not, it prints "NO", which is correct because you cannot have a non-integer area for the triangle.

2. **Function Call**:
   ```python
   (n1, m1, g) = func_3(n, m)
   ```
   This calls `func_3` which eventually uses `func_2`, likely for finding integer coefficients and a linear combination related to \(n\) and \(m\).

3. **Validating Point Generation**:
   ```python
   if abs(n1 * m) >= g:
       print('YES')
       print(0, 0)
       print(0, n1 * m // g)
       print(m1 * m // g, 0)
   else:
       print('NO')
   ```
   This checks if \(n1 \times m\) is enough to create a triangle of required area. If conditions allow, it generates three points. The points are always selected based on the proportions due to the division by \(g\).

### Finding Issues:
- The code observes that if \(n \cdot m\) is divisible by \(k\), it assumes the generated points will always satisfy the area condition. However, there might be cases where the resulting coordinates do not yield the necessary area despite being divisible.

- Specifically, in the problem description and examples given:
   - For \(n = 4\), \(m = 4\), \(k = 7\) â†’ Expected area = \(\frac{16}{7}\) is not possible as a triangular area given integer coordinates.
   - Yet, the code outputs "NO" correctly for this case, indicating it works for some cases.

### Counter-Example:
Consider values where \(n\) and \(m\) might both be small, yet \(k\) is very high causing the area condition to yield a non-integer, or configurations that might lead to degenerate triangles. 

For instance:
- `n = 2`, `m = 2`, `k = 5` results in area `\frac{4}{5}` which cannot be produced by any configuration of integer coordinates.

### Conclusion:
The program indeed misses handling some conditions effectively due to not exploring all boundaries and logic ramifications for triangle area formation. Additionally, it assumes that generating points by proportions will always form the triangle correctly, which may not be true for all inputs.

Thus, there exists at least a scenario where the function does not produce the expected output per the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
