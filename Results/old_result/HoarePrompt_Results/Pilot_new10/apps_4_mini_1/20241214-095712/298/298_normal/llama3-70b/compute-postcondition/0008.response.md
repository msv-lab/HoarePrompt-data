The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are positive integers. The function returns the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the original values of `a` and `b` if `b` is not zero. If `b` is zero, the function indicates that `a` remains unchanged as the loop was not executed. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `a` and `b` and return their greatest common divisor, with special handling if `b` is zero, returning `a`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both positive integers, and returns the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b`. If `b` is zero, it returns `a`.**
