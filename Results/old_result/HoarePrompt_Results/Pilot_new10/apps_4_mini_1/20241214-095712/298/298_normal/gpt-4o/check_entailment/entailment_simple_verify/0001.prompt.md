You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has got three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$. He'd like to find three integer points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, $(x_3, y_3)$, such that $0 \le x_1, x_2, x_3 \le n$, $0 \le y_1, y_2, y_3 \le m$ and the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$.

Help Vasya! Find such points (if it's possible). If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The single line contains three integers $n$, $m$, $k$ ($1\le n, m \le 10^9$, $2 \le k \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

If there are no such points, print "NO".

Otherwise print "YES" in the first line. The next three lines should contain integers $x_i, y_i$ â€” coordinates of the points, one point per line. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 3

Output
YES
1 0
2 3
4 1

Input
4 4 7

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example area of the triangle should be equal to $\frac{nm}{k} = 4$. The triangle mentioned in the output is pictured below:  [Image] 

In the second example there is no triangle with area $\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{16}{7}$.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    area = n * m / k
    if area != int(area):
        print('NO')
    else:
        area = int(area)
        if area == 0:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            print('0 0')
            if 2 * area <= n:
                print(f'{2 * area} 1')
                print(f'0 1')
            elif 2 * area <= m:
                print(f'1 {2 * area}')
                print(f'1 0')
            else:
                print(f'{n} {m // 2}')
                print(f'0 {m // 2}')


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program according to the problem description, we need to analyze how well the program addresses all potential cases described.

1. **Understanding the Area Condition**: The area condition requires that a triangle formed by three points \((x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), (x_3, y_3)\) has an area equal to \(\frac{nm}{k}\). The program first checks if this area is an integer and if it's not zero. 

2. **Points Selection Logic**: The program attempts to generate three points based on calculated conditions:
   - If twice the area is less than or equal to \(n\), it picks the corresponding points with the x-coordinates managing \((2 \cdot \text{area}, 1)\).
   - If the previous condition isn't met but twice the area is less than or equal to \(m\), it does similarly with y-coordinates managing \((1, 2 \cdot \text{area})\).
   - If neither condition applies, it uses the maximum values of \(n\) and \(m\) to form points on the edges.

3. **Potential Failures**: 
   - The generated points might not actually lie within the limits defined (\(0 \leq x_i \leq n\) and \(0 \leq y_i \leq m\)).
   - Notably, if \(n\) or \(m\) is specifically not large enough to accommodate any valid triangle forming points dictated by the area condition, or if the calculation of points provides out-of-bound coordinates, the program does not catch these edge cases.

Let's investigate some edge cases, for instance:
- **Input**: \(1, 1, 2\)
  - In this case, the area \(\frac{1 \cdot 1}{2} = 0.5\), which the program will correctly identify as non-integer and subsequently print "NO". However, it's also important to note that with \(k\) set to 2, the area doesn't represent even a trivial triangle.
  
- **Input**: \(2, 2, 3\)
  - The area \(\frac{2 \cdot 2}{3} = \frac{4}{3}\) which isn't an integer; thus, it will print "NO". 

Checking a condition that passes criteria:
- **Input**: \(4, 4, 2\)
  - The area becomes \(8\). The points would print as:
    ```
    YES
    0 0
    8 1
    0 1
    ```
  However, \((8, 1)\) is out of bounds for \(x\) being greater than \(n\) which should invalidate the triangle points.

Given that this program can produce edge cases where coordinates exceed permissible limits, we conclude there can be cases where valid points indeed cannot be produced despite the area condition seeming fulfilled.

Therefore, based on the analysis of potential edge cases and the logic being flawed in generating valid point outputs while considering bounds:

**Correctness: False**. 

The program fails in providing accurate results for all edge cases, specifically failing to guarantee the points remain within specified limits.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and k are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^9 and 2 <= k <= 10^9.
def func():
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    area = n * m / k
    if (area != int(area)) :
        print('NO')
    else :
        area = int(area)
        if (area == 0) :
            print('NO')
        else :
            print('YES')
            print('0 0')
            if (2 * area <= n) :
                print(f'{2 * area} 1')
                print(f'0 1')
            else :
                if (2 * area <= m) :
                    print(f'1 {2 * area}')
                    print(f'1 0')
                else :

                #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer (1 <= `n` <= 10^9), `m` is an integer (1 <= `m` <= 10^9), `k` is an integer (2 <= `k` <= 10^9), and `area` is calculated as `n * m / k` which is greater than 0. If `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m`, the printed output is '1 0'. Otherwise, the printed output is `0 m // 2`.
            #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers with the specified ranges. If `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`, the output is '0 1'. Otherwise, if `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m`, the output is '1 0'. If `2 * area` is greater than both `n` and `m`, the output is '0 m // 2'.
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `m`, `k` are integers within specified ranges. If `area` equals 0, "NO" is printed. Otherwise, if `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`, the output is '0 1'. If `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m`, the output is '1 0'. If `2 * area` is greater than both `n` and `m`, the output is '0 m // 2'.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `m`, `k` are integers within specified ranges. If `area` is not an integer, indicating a fractional component, 'NO' is printed. If `area` is equal to 0, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, if `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`, the output is '0 1'. If `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m`, the output is '1 0'. If `2 * area` is greater than both `n` and `m`, the output is '0 m // 2'.
