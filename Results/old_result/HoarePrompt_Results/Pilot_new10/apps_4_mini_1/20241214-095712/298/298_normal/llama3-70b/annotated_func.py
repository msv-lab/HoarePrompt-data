#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `b` is 0, `a` is the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the original values of `a` and `b`, and the loop executed as long as `b` was greater than 0.
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the original values of a and b, where b is 0, indicating that a remains unchanged as the loop was not executed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers, `a` and `b`, and returns the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b`. If `b` is initially zero, the function will return `a` as the gcd immediately. The function utilizes the Euclidean algorithm to compute the gcd, ensuring that the result reflects the correct mathematical definition of gcd for the provided inputs.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers where b is not equal to zero.
def func_2(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        return 1, 0
        #The program returns the tuple (1, 0)
    else :
        x, y = func_2(b, a % b)
        return y, x - a // b * y
        #The program returns a tuple consisting of y (the second value returned by func_2(b, a % b)) and x - (a // b * y) which represents the calculation based on the provided integer values of a and b.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers `a` and `b` (with the constraint that `b` cannot be zero) and returns the tuple (1, 0) when `b` is zero, facilitating the base case for recursion. Otherwise, it computes the Extended Euclidean Algorithm by recursively calling itself with new values of `b` and `a % b`, ultimately returning a tuple consisting of the second value from this recursive call and the calculation `x - (a // b * y)`, which represents the coefficients for `a` and `b` that satisfy BÃ©zout's identity. The provided function has the potential edge case of being called with `b` equal to zero; however, this case is not applicable due to the precondition stated in the comment.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers greater than or equal to 1.
def func_3(a, b):
    x, y = func_2(a, b)
    return x, y, x * a + y * b
    #The program returns x and y, which are the outputs of the function `func_2(a, b)`, along with the result of the expression x * a + y * b
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b` (both greater than or equal to 1), and returns a tuple containing the outputs from `func_2(a, b)` and the result of the expression `x * a + y * b`, where `x` and `y` are the outputs of `func_2(a, b)`. It assumes that `func_2` is defined and returns two values. The functionality does not include any handling for possible exceptions that `func_2` might raise, which could occur if `func_2` does not behave as expected.
