The code assigns new integer values to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` using the `map(int, input().split())` function, which collects input and splits it into separate values to be converted to integers. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are overwritten by this input. Since no specific values are provided for `n`, `m`, and `k`, we can only describe that they will now hold new integer values. The initial constraints still apply considering new input.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= `n`, `m` <= 10^9 and 2 <= `k` <= 10^9, with new integer values assigned from input.**
