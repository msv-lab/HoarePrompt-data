The function accepts two integers `a` and `b` (with the constraint that `b` cannot be zero) and returns the tuple (1, 0) when `b` is zero, facilitating the base case for recursion. Otherwise, it computes the Extended Euclidean Algorithm by recursively calling itself with new values of `b` and `a % b`, ultimately returning a tuple consisting of the second value from this recursive call and the calculation `x - (a // b * y)`, which represents the coefficients for `a` and `b` that satisfy BÃ©zout's identity. The provided function has the potential edge case of being called with `b` equal to zero; however, this case is not applicable due to the precondition stated in the comment.
