Functionality: ** The function accepts three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` provided through input. It computes the area based on the formula `area = n * m / k`. If the area is not an integer or if it is zero, the function prints 'NO'. If the area is a positive integer, it prints 'YES' and two coordinates based on the value of `2 * area`: if `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`, it outputs '0 1'; if it's less than or equal to `m`, it outputs '1 0'; otherwise, it outputs '0 m // 2' along with the maximum values of `n` and `m` that fit the criteria. **
