In the given code snippet, we are calculating a value to be printed based on the current state of the variable `area`. The variable `area` is derived from the formula `n * m / k`, and we know that this value is an integer and greater than 0. We also know that `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`.

The `print` function outputs a formatted string containing two values: `2 * area` and `1`. No variables are being modified, but the output is generated based on the current state of `area`.

Since `area` is calculated based on `n`, `m`, and `k`, and `2 * area` must be less than or equal to `n`, we can infer the bounds for our output.

Thus, we find that:
- `output value 1` = `2 * area` (which is less than or equal to `n`)
- `output value 2` = `1`

The output state will include all previous conditions regarding `n`, `m`, `k`, and `area`, while also specifying the values being output.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 <= `n` <= 10^9), `m` is an integer (1 <= `m` <= 10^9), `k` is an integer (2 <= `k` <= 10^9), `area` is an integer greater than 0, `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`; printed output is '2 * area' and 1**.
