You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has got three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$. He'd like to find three integer points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, $(x_3, y_3)$, such that $0 \le x_1, x_2, x_3 \le n$, $0 \le y_1, y_2, y_3 \le m$ and the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$.

Help Vasya! Find such points (if it's possible). If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The single line contains three integers $n$, $m$, $k$ ($1\le n, m \le 10^9$, $2 \le k \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

If there are no such points, print "NO".

Otherwise print "YES" in the first line. The next three lines should contain integers $x_i, y_i$ — coordinates of the points, one point per line. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 3

Output
YES
1 0
2 3
4 1

Input
4 4 7

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example area of the triangle should be equal to $\frac{nm}{k} = 4$. The triangle mentioned in the output is pictured below:  [Image] 

In the second example there is no triangle with area $\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{16}{7}$.
Functions with output description for each function:
import math

(n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
if n * m % k:
    print('NO')
    exit()
(n1, m1, g) = func_3(n, m)
if abs(n1 * m) >= g:
    print('YES')
    print(0, 0)
    print(0, n1 * m // g)
    print(m1 * m // g, 0)
else:
    print('NO')

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function accepts two positive integers, `a` and `b`, and returns the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b`. If `b` is initially zero, the function will return `a` as the gcd immediately. The function utilizes the Euclidean algorithm to compute the gcd, ensuring that the result reflects the correct mathematical definition of gcd for the provided inputs.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return (1, 0)
    else:
        (x, y) = func_2(b, a % b)
        return (y, x - a // b * y)
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function accepts two integers `a` and `b` (with the constraint that `b` cannot be zero) and returns the tuple (1, 0) when `b` is zero, facilitating the base case for recursion. Otherwise, it computes the Extended Euclidean Algorithm by recursively calling itself with new values of `b` and `a % b`, ultimately returning a tuple consisting of the second value from this recursive call and the calculation `x - (a // b * y)`, which represents the coefficients for `a` and `b` that satisfy Bézout's identity. The provided function has the potential edge case of being called with `b` equal to zero; however, this case is not applicable due to the precondition stated in the comment.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3(a, b):
    (x, y) = func_2(a, b)
    return (x, y, x * a + y * b)
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b` (both greater than or equal to 1), and returns a tuple containing the outputs from `func_2(a, b)` and the result of the expression `x * a + y * b`, where `x` and `y` are the outputs of `func_2(a, b)`. It assumes that `func_2` is defined and returns two values. The functionality does not include any handling for possible exceptions that `func_2` might raise, which could occur if `func_2` does not behave as expected.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
