You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has got three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$. He'd like to find three integer points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, $(x_3, y_3)$, such that $0 \le x_1, x_2, x_3 \le n$, $0 \le y_1, y_2, y_3 \le m$ and the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$.

Help Vasya! Find such points (if it's possible). If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The single line contains three integers $n$, $m$, $k$ ($1\le n, m \le 10^9$, $2 \le k \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

If there are no such points, print "NO".

Otherwise print "YES" in the first line. The next three lines should contain integers $x_i, y_i$ â€” coordinates of the points, one point per line. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 3

Output
YES
1 0
2 3
4 1

Input
4 4 7

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example area of the triangle should be equal to $\frac{nm}{k} = 4$. The triangle mentioned in the output is pictured below:  [Image] 

In the second example there is no triangle with area $\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{16}{7}$.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    area = n * m / k
    if area != int(area):
        print('NO')
    else:
        area = int(area)
        if area == 0:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            print('0 0')
            if 2 * area <= n:
                print(f'{2 * area} 1')
                print(f'0 1')
            elif 2 * area <= m:
                print(f'1 {2 * area}')
                print(f'1 0')
            else:
                print(f'{n} {m // 2}')
                print(f'0 {m // 2}')


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program according to the problem description, we need to analyze how well the program addresses all potential cases described.

1. **Understanding the Area Condition**: The area condition requires that a triangle formed by three points \((x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), (x_3, y_3)\) has an area equal to \(\frac{nm}{k}\). The program first checks if this area is an integer and if it's not zero. 

2. **Points Selection Logic**: The program attempts to generate three points based on calculated conditions:
   - If twice the area is less than or equal to \(n\), it picks the corresponding points with the x-coordinates managing \((2 \cdot \text{area}, 1)\).
   - If the previous condition isn't met but twice the area is less than or equal to \(m\), it does similarly with y-coordinates managing \((1, 2 \cdot \text{area})\).
   - If neither condition applies, it uses the maximum values of \(n\) and \(m\) to form points on the edges.

3. **Potential Failures**: 
   - The generated points might not actually lie within the limits defined (\(0 \leq x_i \leq n\) and \(0 \leq y_i \leq m\)).
   - Notably, if \(n\) or \(m\) is specifically not large enough to accommodate any valid triangle forming points dictated by the area condition, or if the calculation of points provides out-of-bound coordinates, the program does not catch these edge cases.

Let's investigate some edge cases, for instance:
- **Input**: \(1, 1, 2\)
  - In this case, the area \(\frac{1 \cdot 1}{2} = 0.5\), which the program will correctly identify as non-integer and subsequently print "NO". However, it's also important to note that with \(k\) set to 2, the area doesn't represent even a trivial triangle.
  
- **Input**: \(2, 2, 3\)
  - The area \(\frac{2 \cdot 2}{3} = \frac{4}{3}\) which isn't an integer; thus, it will print "NO". 

Checking a condition that passes criteria:
- **Input**: \(4, 4, 2\)
  - The area becomes \(8\). The points would print as:
    ```
    YES
    0 0
    8 1
    0 1
    ```
  However, \((8, 1)\) is out of bounds for \(x\) being greater than \(n\) which should invalidate the triangle points.

Given that this program can produce edge cases where coordinates exceed permissible limits, we conclude there can be cases where valid points indeed cannot be produced despite the area condition seeming fulfilled.

Therefore, based on the analysis of potential edge cases and the logic being flawed in generating valid point outputs while considering bounds:

**Correctness: False**. 

The program fails in providing accurate results for all edge cases, specifically failing to guarantee the points remain within specified limits.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` provided through input. It computes the area based on the formula `area = n * m / k`. If the area is not an integer or if it is zero, the function prints 'NO'. If the area is a positive integer, it prints 'YES' and two coordinates based on the value of `2 * area`: if `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`, it outputs '0 1'; if it's less than or equal to `m`, it outputs '1 0'; otherwise, it outputs '0 m // 2' along with the maximum values of `n` and `m` that fit the criteria. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
