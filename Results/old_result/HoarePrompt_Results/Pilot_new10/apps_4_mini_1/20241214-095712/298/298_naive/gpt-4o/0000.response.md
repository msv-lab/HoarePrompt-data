To determine the correctness of the provided program in relation to the problem description, let's analyze its logic step by step.

### Summary of Task:
The program should find three integer points such that the area of the triangle formed by these points equals \(\frac{nm}{k}\), subject to certain constraints. 

### Breakdown of the Program:
1. It reads the inputs \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\).
2. It calculates the area needed as \(n \times m / k\) and checks if this area is an integer. If it's not an integer, it prints "NO".
3. If the calculated area is zero, it also prints "NO".
4. It attempts to find integer coordinates that yield the desired area. The three conditions present in the logic involve checking if \(2 \times \text{area}\) is less than or equal to \(n\) or \(m\), leading into respective points being printed.

### Key Edge Cases:
- **When \( n \) or \( m \) is too small relative to \( k \)**: If \(k\) is such that \( \frac{nm}{k} \) is not achievable or leads to insufficient dimensions for any triangle. For instance:
  - If \(n = 1\), \(m = 1\), and \(k = 2\), the area calculated would be \( \frac{1 \times 1}{2} = 0.5 \), which is not an integer and should return "NO". This case is caught correctly.
  
- **Valid integer area check**: If \(k = 2\) with larger \(n\) and \(m\), it should be noted: For larger valid inputs, the checks for positions rely on the expected conditions but may fail if there's a mistake dealing with integer ranges. 

### Failure Case:
The point that can potentially lead to complications is in coordinate calculation:
- The conditions checking \(2 \times \text{area}\) against \(n\) or \(m\) could fail to check all edge cases adequately. For example, if you set \( (n,m,k) = (10,10,3) \):
  - The area becomes \( \frac{10 \times 10}{3} = \frac{100}{3} \), which is not an integer. However, the code structure may not explicitly manage all integer results effectively.
  
- Additionally, there are multiple edge cases existing in how the coordinates \( (x_2, y_2) \) and \( (x_3, y_3) \) are calculated. If the triangle sides assume certain positions that yield negative or out of bound coordinates, that should also yield a "NO".

### Conclusion:
The program risks incorrectly handling cases where the criteria do not yield proper integer coordinates for the points. There might be configurations of inputs that lead to invalid configurations not considered in the logic.

Thus, after identifying potential failing edge cases and assessing logical gaps:

Correctness: **False**. 

The provided program does not cover all scenarios as per the problem statement's requirements.
