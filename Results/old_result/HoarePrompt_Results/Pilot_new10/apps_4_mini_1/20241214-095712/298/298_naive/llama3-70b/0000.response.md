Correctness: **False**.

The program attempts to check if there are three integer points forming a triangle with a specific area. However, it contains logical errors that prevent it from achieving the desired behavior correctly.

### Analysis of the program:

1. **Area Calculation**: The area of the triangle is expected to be \( \frac{nm}{k} \). The first condition checks if \( nm \) is divisible by \( k \) to ensure that the area can be expressed as an integer. However, this alone doesn't guarantee that valid points can be found.

2. **Triangle Points Generation**: The implementation of points seems unclear. The function `func_3` is designed to return values used to potentially create triangle points, but the logic in the main part of the program may lead to incorrect points or no valid points at all. 

3. **Checking Conditions**: The condition `if abs(n1 * m) >= g:` does not guarantee valid points within the bounds defined by \( n \) and \( m \). Specifically, it can lead to negative coordinates or coordinates outside the range specified by the problem.

### Potential Fail Case:
Consider the input:
```
n = 1
m = 1
k = 2
```
In this case, \( \frac{nm}{k} = \frac{1 \times 1}{2} = 0.5 \), which is not an integer. The program should print "NO", however based on the constraint `if n * m % k:` it's more likely to lead to a situation where it may not evaluate points correctly.

Another case that illuminates the failure is larger values:
```
n = 10
m = 10
k = 3
```
Here \( \frac{nm}{k} \) results in \( \frac{100}{3} \), which is not integer. However, it may proceed erroneously without proper checks concluding with incorrectly generated points.

### Conclusion:
The logic in the program is flawed because it does not account for generating valid points correctly, given the area conditions and bounds. Therefore, it does not fulfill the requirements laid out in the problem description.
